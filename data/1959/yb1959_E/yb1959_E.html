<p><span class="font11">of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">D</span><span class="font8">OING the divine will and sticking to this course is the only worth-while work. In the time of Jesus Christ it was recognizable that this teacher was doing a worth-while work. He was awake to his privileges of service. He was preaching the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. He knew that that was the divine will. He stuck to his work from the time of his baptism in the river Jordan by John until his death. He preached incessantly. He taught diligently. He healed the sick both in mind and in body. He found many faithful Jews who would be his disciples. He kept his twelve apostles close to him and trained them daily, and he showed them how to stick to their divinely given work of preaching the Kingdom good news. These faithful Jews were looking for the Messiah, and now they had found him in Christ Jesus and they stayed with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were many other persons that recognized Jesus’ devotion to Jehovah. One in particular was a rich man who said: “Teacher, what good must I do in order to get everlasting life?” (Matt. 19:16) How many millions of people have asked that same question since then. Living is such a natural desire. One does not want to die. Jesus had often demonstrated that he had the power to give people a more abundant life. He healed the sick, he opened the blind eyes, he even raised the dead from the tombs. He spoke of everlasting life as being within their reach and said that it could easily be had if people would only follow him and live</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">according to his teachings. This particular rich man had observed the Ten Commandments from his youth up, but just how could he get the eternal life he desired? Jesus told him: “If, though, you want to enter into life, observe the commandments continually.” (Matt. 19:17) To the query, “Which ones?” Jesus continued: “‘Why, You must not murder, You must not commit adultery, You must not steal, You must not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother, and, You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ The young man said to him: ‘I have kept all these; what yet am I lacking?’ Jesus said to him: ‘If you want to be complete, go sell your belongings and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven, and come be my follower.’ When the young man heard this saying, he went away grieved, for he was holding many possessions.”—Matt. 19:18-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This grieved rich man was told: “Sell your belongings and give to the poor.” What a price to pay for life! But is one’s life not worth it? However, there was more to it than just that. Did he hear what the Great Teacher of the divine will said in addition: “Be my follower”? That was the real secret in getting everlasting life. First of all, do not be burdened down with the cares of this world, so that you can walk unburdened in the footsteps of Jesus Christ, preaching the good news of the kingdom of the heavens. Certainly if one were occupied with preaching the good news he would not have time for the care of so many possessions as this rich man had. Neither then, nor now, could a true follower of Christ Jesus be burdened down with so many cares of this old world. If it was necessary for the rich man to dispose of his possessions and follow Christ nineteen hundred years ago to be a Christian, how much more is it true now that an individual who wants to follow Christ Jesus and do Kingdom work must free himself of the anxieties of this present way of living? Christ is no longer with us on earth to give us personal counsel, but Jehovah God has seen to it that his words and those of his faithful followers were written down for the admonition and the learning of us upon whom the end of this system of things would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures show us that Christ has come the second time, invisibly, and when Jesus gave the Revelation to John he pointed out that he, Christ Jesus, was to come also as a thief just before the battle of God Almighty, known as Armageddon. Jesus expects that at that time those who have declared themselves to be Christians will be on duty and be awake and on guard, watching their Kingdom duties. He has the right to expect them to be walking in his footsteps, doing the same thing he advised the rich man to do, “be my follower.” Being a Christian is a full-time occupation, no vacation periods, no change of religion, no stopping for a while. When one really walks in the footsteps of Christ Jesus he will not give all his time to the commercial business of life. The Christian wants to please the one who called him to be his disciple, and that means giving Christ and his work first attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul put the matter very plainly and forcefully, saying that Christians are employed in Christ’s service as soldiers. All Christians must be singleminded. They must look to and obey the one who called them to be soldiers. Being in Christ’s employ and following him, there is only one thing they can do: “As a right kind of soldier of Christ Jesus take your part in suffering evil. No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life, in order that he may meet the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier.” (2 Tim. 2:3, 4) A soldier of Christ Jesus does not and can not divide his interests. He does not try to run a selfish commercial business and at the same time be a soldier. When one is hired as a soldier, that is his work, and when one is assigned to guard the interests of the king he does not go to sleep. The Christian stays in his assignment. He is awake to his responsibilities. Paul, the former Saul of Tarsus, knew what it meant to be a soldier. When Saul was sent out to persecute the Christians he had an assignment and did it. He followed out orders. When he was converted to be a follower of Christ Jesus and was named Paul he also determined to be a right kind of soldier in the Christian army, putting on the full suit of armor provided by God, suffering any trials or difficulties that would arise because of being a soldier. If to be a Christian in the days of Paul it was necessary to be a faithful and alert soldier, certainly today nothing less is required. Jesus stated it so clearly to the rich man, “Sell your belongings ... be my follower”; and Paul made it just as plain when he said: “No man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life.” So how should one who calls himself a Christian today look at the matter? Not differently. He should stay by the things he has learned, be an honest follower, not a hypocrite.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>NO CHANGE IN REQUIREMENTS TODAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Today a Christian must be just as faithful and devoted to his call to service as Christ was to his, the apostles were to theirs and the early Christians to theirs. There is no difference in the requirements for Christians today. They must still stay awake and be alert on duty and carry out their responsibilities. True, this generation is far removed from the days of Christ, nineteen hundred years in fact. The ways of living have changed. The ideas and philosophies of men and the customs of the people have proved to be quite different. Christendom has moved along with the times and does not want to be old-fashioned. Too many clergymen of today have become modernists and have rejected the Bible, saying that the story of Noah and the creation of Adam and Eve are just myths, and that Christ’s dying on the torture stake was not necessary for salvation. The simple faith of Christ Jesus and of the disciples of Christ is a thing wanting throughout all Christendom. But the Bible has not changed since the days of the apostles. The divine will has not changed for the Christian. Jehovah is not one to change. His truth remains forever! So today to be a Christian, one must “be my follower.” Paul was one, but the rich man went away grieved at how to be one. Paul spoke of a falling away that would take place. He said that “the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith.” (1 Tim. 4:1) Today that great falling away from walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus is at its height. It was so important for Paul to say to the Christians of his time: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.” This is even more applicable today. No individual professing to be a Christian can brush aside the teachings of Christ. The Holy Bible is God’s Word. Jesus believed it and lived it. Every professed follower of his must pay constant attention to himself and to Christ’s teachings so that he may stay awake to his privileges of service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nineteen hundred years after Jesus introduced the wonderful message of the kingdom of the heavens it must still be preached. It is still the only hope for mankind. Jesus taught his followers to pray: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matt. 6:10) While Christendom repeats these words in chant and song and sometimes in read prayers, her religionists do not believe it. If they did they would preach it. True followers of Christ Jesus—and Jehovah’s witnesses prove to be such —are still preaching the good news of God’s kingdom as the only hope for mankind and they believe it with all their heart, mind, soul and strength, and they are on the watch as to the time when God’s established kingdom with all its powerful heavenly force will strike at Armageddon. As Christians Jehovah’s witnesses feel their responsibility to look after their Kingdom preaching, not just to the end of the times of the Gentiles, but to the end of all the nations of the Devil’s organization. Whether the world of mankind will take time to find out the importance of the day in which they are living or not makes no difference. Christ Jesus has come into his kingdom. By him Jehovah reigns. God’s kingdom rules! And the reason the religionists of Christendom have not been declaring this good news is that they are asleep. The warning of the world’s end as being near has been given around the world, and especially in Christendom. We are living in the last days of this system of things and Jehovah’s witnesses, being true to their assignment, have let the world know in all principal languages that God’s kingdom rules and the world’s end is near. Christendom is not left ignorant of the times in which we are living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The apostles of Christ Jesus were very much concerned about the times and the condition of world affairs when Christ would make his second appearance. But Christendom and its religious leaders do not show interest in this matter. “While [Jesus] was sitting upon the mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: ‘Tell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the consummation of the system of things?’ ” (Matt. 24:3) Jesus described clearly the conditions that would exist in the world when the whole system of things would be ending together in a “consummation.” It would not be going down in little bits of pieces, or sections, but this combined ending would “come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of all the earth.” In the very days of the ‘ending together of the system of things,’ Jesus said, “this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus gave a composite sign, showing many things that would occur, nation rising against nation, kingdom against kingdom, food shortage, earthquakes in one place after another, all of these things together being the “beginning of pangs of distress.” As far as real Christians are concerned, he stated: “Then people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.” (Matt. 24:9) How true this has been! But despite the hatred, Jehovah’s witnesses have been alert, awake, on guard and have seen to it that God’s kingdom was preached and that the warning was given to Christendom and to all the world of mankind concerning these last days. They have not slowed down in this announcement either, nor will they do so until the accomplished end comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses do not want to find themselves asleep just before the complete end when, all together, this system of things will go down. They appreciate what Christ Jesus said, at Revelation 16:15: “I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his parts of shame.” Being awake, taking care of one’s responsibilities and preaching the good news right up to the complete end at the battle of Armageddon is an essential thing for a Christian. The December 15, 1958, issue of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> gives the reader a clear and detailed explanation of this text and shows without question that it is just prior to the battle of Armageddon when this scripture has its fulfillment. As the context shows, the three unclean inspired expressions that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, the mouth of the wild beast and the mouth of the false prophet are in fact “expressions inspired by demons” and have a lot to say. With all this talk they “go forth to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, . . . And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.” It is when this great gathering work reaches its peak for this final battle that Christ Jesus comes “as a thief,” showing great interest in those who are on guard duty in his temple organization. It is at the same time when this system of things in all its wickedness has been gathered together for the purpose of being brought to a complete end at the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” that this scripture finds application. While this gathering of the nations is going on, Jehovah’s gathered people, the remnant and the other sheep, hear Christ Jesus say, “Look!” Yes, he gains their attention and they hear him say: “I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his parts of shame.”—Rev. 16:15.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>CHRISTENDOM ASLEEP</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is a terrible thing for a person to be indifferent toward his privilege of service, his assignment as a guard within the spiritual temple of Jehovah, and to be found asleep. He deserves to be beaten, stripped of his garments and have people look upon his shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The newspaper </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate,</span><span class="font8"> which is the official publication of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark and of the Diocese of Paterson in New Jersey, had something to say under the heading “Arise, Ye Who Sleep,” and in this article we can see just how sleepy Christendom is and how religionists are not alert to the signs of the times, nor to the presence of Christ Jesus, nor to the preaching of the good news. But this paper also recognizes that there is a group that is wide awake and filled with fiery zeal and that there is no complacency or indifference among them. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we went to school and studied our catechism, we learned that there are three divisions to the Catholic Church: (1) The Church Triumphant; (2) The Church Suffering; and (3) The Church Militant. With a great deal of justification we might add a fourth division and call it the Church Dormant or the Church Complacent. The people who make up this group are men and women who should in fact be members of the Church Militant, but who seemingly have forgotten the meaning of the word. They are apparently asleep at the switch and nothing seems to bother them. . . . The fantastic story of the Jehovah’s Witnesses attracted worldwide attention during their recent convention in New York. Here was a group of religious-minded people who numbered about 800,000 throughout the entire world. Their doctrine is weird and strange. But they managed to get 250,000 members to their convention. Most people cannot understand what it is that attracts these people, but the fact remains that there is something which brings out this phenomenal attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What they do have is a fiery zeal; there is no complacency or indifference among them, and sacrifice does not deter them. Every one of these people pledges himself to work 12 hours a week at the conversion of his fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If we had such zeal and perseverance among the rank and file of our Catholic people, we could transform the face of the earth. A famous Catholic preacher once said: “Judged by human, business standards, the Catholic Church is a colossal failure. After 20 centuries two-thirds of the human race is still pagan.”—</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Advocate,</span><span class="font7"> September 19, 1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Catholic organization admits they are found asleep. Their unchristian nakedness is exposed. They are not zealous for God’s kingdom, nor are they putting forth any effort at all to preach it. And how about the Protestants? The Litchville </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font8"> of North Dakota had this listing in the Want Ads column of its newspaper: “Lost—Over 100 members of the Lutheran Parish. Not seen since Easter. Please return to the North LaMoure, Litchville, or Hastings Lutheran Churches on Sunday morning. No questions will be asked. Pastor Bob Harrison.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What would Christ Jesus do if he came to visit these Catholic and Protestant organizations, representatives of Christendom? He would take off their outer garments and he would expose them and let the people walk naked so that others could see their parts of shame. But this has already been done before the eyes of true Christians. Christendom’s nakedness has been exposed to them. She has neglected the work and failed the people. She has denied the Bible. She does not teach its principal message, that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand, nor does she magnify the great name of the God of the universe, Jehovah. But so much for Christendom. What about the true Christians themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is no time for Christians to be lax and indifferent. We definitely are living in the last days of this system of things, and in the twenty-first chapter of Luke, where Jesus is describing in detail the composite sign, he gives this very strong admonition to his followers. If the reader claims to be his follower, then listen to his words: “Pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of all the earth. Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and to hold your position before the Son of man.” (Luke 21:34-36) Here again, we have the expression “pay attention to yourselves.” Why? What could happen? One could easily be weighed down with the cares of this world, the eating and the drinking and the anxieties of life. Or, as the footnote of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font8"> says: “anxieties over livelihood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the time of Jesus he admonished his faithful followers not to be so much concerned about the things of one’s livelihood, “as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear.” (Matt. 6:25) They should be “seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.” (Matt. 6:33) Is not that what he was telling the rich young man? Get rid of all these things that have made you rich. Give them to the poor, these things whereby you were making your livelihood, and follow me. The important thing is ‘seeking first the kingdom and God’s righteousness.’ In the prayer that Jesus taught his apostles to pray he said: “Give us today our bread for this day.” He did not ask for any more. With food, clothing and shelter we should be content, along with our godly devotion. So never be weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life. And why not? If these become the important things in one’s life, the principal reason for living, as they were in the life of the rich man, then we are not going to have time for walking in the footsteps of Christ Jesus, following him. We cannot be a soldier of Christ Jesus if it is the eating and drinking and the anxieties of life that we are interested in and if we are going to be weighed down with commercial businesses of life in order to get these things in abundance. The two do not go together.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>STAYING AWAKE DURING THE CONSUMMATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Describing living in these last days, in the twenty-first chapter of Luke, Jesus says the complete end will happen so suddenly that that day will be instantly upon us as a snare. Then what is going to happen? Jesus said that it will come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of the earth. He is not making any exceptions. So his very strong advice to the apostles and, of course, to Christians today was: “Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and to hold your position before the Son of man.” Truly there is a way of escape from going down executed in the battle of the great day of God the Almighty. The way of escape is in staying awake, living as a Christian, making supplication before God. Then you may succeed in escaping all these troubles and distresses that will come upon the Devil’s system of things at one time, completely wiping it out, the political system, the religious system, the commercial system, and abyssing the demons who control this world and even the Devil himself. Being on guard as a Christian at God’s spiritual temple and staying awake there will mean, too, that you will hold your approved position before the Son of man. He will preserve you alive through the battle of Armageddon, which destroys this present evil world, into God’s new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This will not be the first time that a world is destroyed. It happened before in the days of Noah, “when the patience of God was waiting in Noah’s days, while the ark was being constructed, in which a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” (1 Pet. 3:20) Jehovah had good cause for destroying the people that lived in Noah’s day. They paid no attention to God, nor to the message that God had Noah preach to them concerning the end of that world. But they were given to eating and drinking and having a good time, feasting, thinking of just themselves and their own anxieties of life. They were truly weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking. Jesus tells us that it would be very similar in our day just before the battle of Armageddon to what it was in Noah’s day: “For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be. For as people were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.” (Matt. 24:37-39) This flood came upon all those dwelling upon the face of the earth during Noah’s day: Identical to what is going to happen at the battle of Armageddon. Christians cannot be asleep. Jesus said, ‘Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments.’ Noah was not asleep as to his building of the ark. He kept busy at construction. In addition he kept preaching. With him were his three sons and their wives and Noah’s own wife; all of them kept busy with Noah, and when the flood came they were ready, they were awake, they were in the ark with all the animals and they were preserved alive out of the world that was, into a cleansed earth. Noah and his family stayed on the watch, worked and were ready when the rains came. It pays to stay awake! You do not lose your outer garments of God’s ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If Noah had not stayed by the things that were committed into his care, he would not have saved himself, and others also, his loved ones. The only sensible thing to do now is stay awake and take care of the responsibilities that fall upon one, just as the early Christians did when destruction was about to befall Jerusalem. Many years before the destruction of Jerusalem in the year 70 (A.D.), the Christians had received warning through the prophecy that Jesus gave them. “Furthermore, when you see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then understand that the desolating of her has drawn near. Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains, and let those in the midst of her withdraw, and let those in the nearby regions not enter into her, because these are days for meting out justice that all the things written may be fulfilled.” (Luke 21:20-22) Shortly after the days of Pentecost many persons gained a knowledge of the truth, dedicated themselves to Jehovah’s service and were baptized. In fact, in one day 3,000 persons were baptized. There must have been many assembly places within Jerusalem where God’s people met and studied the Word of God together and prepared themselves for their preaching activity. But all this time while they were studying the Bible they were on the watch, they were awake to the critical situations that were prophesied by Christ Jesus, when Jerusalem would be in for destruction. So in the year 66, when the armies of Rome surrounded the city, it certainly must have brought to their attention that destruction was imminent. When these armies moved away for a short season, all the Christians in Jerusalem fled to the mountains, out of the city gates, over the hills of Galilee, down into the Jordan valley and across the river to Gilead, to the mountains where there was safety. When one is warned, why stay at the place where destruction is going to happen? Why be asleep at this crucial time, when one should be awake and on duty? Those early Christians were awake to their responsibilities. They wanted to preserve their lives so they could continue to preach the good news of the Kingdom after the destruction of Jerusalem. They did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While Christendom is exposed to true Christians today because of not having on its outer garments, and this is due to falling asleep to Christian privileges of service, Jehovah’s witnesses world-wide continue to preach God’s kingdom and pay attention to the divine will. They see to it that those coming within Jehovah’s sanctuary for worship are clean, just as the guard protected the temple of Jehovah when on night watch to see that nothing unclean got in to pollute the temple or to steal from it. In these last days the Kingdom interests have been committed into the care of the “faithful and discreet slave” class, and now joining with them is a “great crowd” of “other sheep” coming from all nations, kindreds and tongues, and these, too, have been given the privilege of guarding these Kingdom interests by preaching even to the ends of the earth. This great crowd now numbering well over 770,000 ministers of the Kingdom are not being weighed down by overeating and heavy drinking and the anxieties of this life. They are alerted to the fact that Christ Jesus will come at Armageddon as a thief, suddenly, instantly, and that when this destruction comes to the earth it will affect all those dwelling upon the face of the earth. So they keep awake, and hold their position before the Son of man, guarding the Kingdom interests, keeping on their ministerial garments, showing that they appreciate their responsibilities. By having on these garments they prove that they have been favored by Jehovah God and have been retained in Jehovah’s holy service in his sanctuary.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>WHO REALLY CAN BE SAVED ?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The person that does right and seeks truth will come into the light. John the Baptist introduced the Jews to the one who became the “light of the world.” John the Baptist “came for the purpose of a witness, in order to bear witness about the light, that people of all kinds might believe through him.” (John 1:7) John knew that the light of the world was Christ Jesus. (John 8:12) Jesus, having instructed his disciples concerning truth, said to them: “You are the light of the world.” (Matt. 5:14) So true Christians today are the only light there is. People of all walks of life should examine themselves and ask themselves the questions, “Am I afraid of the light? Am I afraid of truth?” Jesus puts it squarely to everyone: “Now this is the basis for judgment, that the light has come into the world but men have loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were wicked. For he that practices vile things hates the light and does not come to the light, in order that his works may not be reproved. But he that does what is true comes to the light, in order that his works may be made manifest as having been worked in harmony with God.”—John 3:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rich man who came to Jesus seeking life was not seeking truth. He turned away from the opportunity of following Jesus and went to look after his riches. One must really love truth and light in order to work in harmony with God. This is what the disciples of Christ were seeking to do, and Jesus said to his disciples: “Truly I say to you that it will be a difficult thing for a rich man to get into the kingdom of the heavens.” “When the disciples heard that, they expressed very great surprise, saying: ‘Who really can be saved?’ Looking them in the face, Jesus said to them: ‘With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.’ ” (Matt. 19:23, 25, 26) One who does the divine will of the heavenly Father will find that it is possible for men to be saved. God makes it possible. He made it possible by sending his only-begotten Son into the world that whosoever believed on him and exercised faith in him might get everlasting life. (John 3:16) If one believes in the Son then he is going to follow his teaching. He is going to walk in his footsteps. He is going to be a minister. It means service, hard work, and keeping at it. Keeping at it means being on the watch continually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After Jesus left his disciples and ascended to the heavens, the eleven faithful apostles along with other disciples stuck together and stayed on the watch. When Pentecost arrived the holy spirit descended upon them and energized them to further activity. From then on nothing could stop them. They preached. The same holy spirit that energized the disciples then is working on true Christians today. The same active force or holy spirit from God is now stimulating his people to go ahead with the work of preaching the good news. Immediately after Pentecost for three and one half years the disciples traveled throughout Palestine preaching and gathering the remnant of the Jews who were seeking the Messiah. After that the divine will indicated that the message of salvation should go to all nations, kindreds and tongues; and so the disciples went to Asia Minor, Greece, Babylon, Italy and other parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The command given to Christians was: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) Today nothing stops a real Christian from carrying out that responsibility, not even death itself. Even in these last days, when Christians see the gathering together of the great armies of the earth to the battle of Armageddon, they are not fearful, but they stay on the watch, looking after the things that Jehovah God has put in their care. Their big interest is the Kingdom interest, preaching the good news in all the world for a witness to all nations and gathering the other sheep. The “faithful and discreet slave” class is standing upon the mountain of God crying out to all who have an ear to hear to come and to take of the “water of life” freely. Today hundreds of thousands of persons are coming to the “mountain of Jehovah,” there to learn of his laws and his ways. They do appreciate his undeserved kindness, the gift of his beloved Son, for through him salvation is gained. They love the truth, and because of this they come to the light, Christ Jesus, and, having come, they want to do the works in harmony with God.—Isa. 2:2-4; Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not going to be easy for a true Christian to stand out publicly declaring the good news, no more than it was for the early disciples, who stood in the synagogues and in the public forums declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus. For this, the Bible tells us, the disciples were flogged and frequently they were warned to quit preaching. Did the early Christians quit? No; for concerning the apostles it is reported: “Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” (Acts 5:42) Those apostles, though imperfect, stayed at their divinely assigned work. They did not pity themselves or make excuses for quitting because the going was hard. They were convinced that what they were doing was the right thing to do. Jesus did it. They had heard their teacher tell them what to do and what to say. They had the holy spirit backing them up now. This was no time for hesitancy, no time for fear. It was a time to keep awake and on the watch. It was then time to preach the good news of God’s kingdom, and it still is the time to preach, yes, now more than ever, because right now we are at the time when Christ Jesus comes as inspector of the guards. Happy is the one who stays awake and keeps his outer garments, so that he may not walk naked and have people look upon his parts of shame. Regardless of what Christendom does —and the evidence shows that Christendom has been asleep as far as looking after Kingdom interests is concerned, and has been stripped naked to Christian eyes—Jehovah’s witnesses must and will stay awake in these last days of the end of this system of things and preach. This is the time to do the divine will of gathering the “other sheep” from all nations, kindreds, tongues, religions and from all walks of life, rich or poor.—John 10:16.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>STAYING BY THESE THINGS FOR SALVATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is so necessary for a Christian to stay by these things he was taught in his early Christian life. Paul said to Timothy: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.” (2 Tim. 4:2) Nothing may be allowed to separate a Christian from the love of God no matter how hard the opposition may be. It is no time to be sleepy or to relax or to be eating and drinking and be looking after the anxieties of this life. The persistence on the part of Christ Jesus in preaching God’s kingdom irritated the religious clergy of his day so much that they finally put him to death on the torture stake. They murdered him! The early Christians were just as persistent in their preaching, and by threats and imprisonments the Devil’s crowd of that day tried to get them to stop declaring the good news of Christ Jesus that he had taught them. This failed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same religious crowd has been trying to silence Christians in these last days, influencing the political crowd to take action against Jehovah’s witnesses. The totalitarian rulers have tried brainwashing, concentration camps and Communist prisons. The rulers have tried to break down the faithfulness of some of Jehovah’s witnesses so that they would not continue in their service to God. However, when a Christian is determined to keep faithful and on the watch, all the brainwashing that is done will have no effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A book published in the British Isles in 1957, called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Battle for the Mind, a Physiology of Conversion and Brainwashing,</span><span class="font8"> said: “Those reported as among the best able to preserve their standards and beliefs in the German concentration camps during World War two were members of the sect of Jehovah’s witnesses. This pacifist religious group has many strange beliefs, but these were implanted with such strength and certainty by their religious leaders as to remain operative when continued debilitation and psychological degraduation had reduced most other people of the highest ideals, but no specific loyalties, to accept the very lowest conception of individual and group morality. A safeguard against conversion is indeed a burning and obsessive belief in some other creed or way of life. History shows that well indoctrinated and trained soldiers can be just as brave and stubborn as Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So must all of Jehovah’s witnesses be today, all Christians, all true followers of Christ Jesus. Through this singleness of devotion to Jehovah through Christ Jesus they can be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Where do Jehovah’s witnesses gain this strength ? Not by anything within themselves. It is by acquiring power from God. Paul told Timothy: “You, therefore, my child, keep on acquiring power in the undeserved kindness that is in connection with Christ Jesus, and the things you heard from me with the support of many witnesses, these things commit to faithful men who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others. As a right kind of soldier of Christ Jesus take your part in suffering evil.”—2 Tim. 2:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses must stay alert daily by studying God’s Word, meeting with Jehovah’s people in the congregations, going from house to house preaching the good news. Today the German concentration camps have long been gone, but Jehovah’s witnesses remain, triumphant. The Communist concentration camps are still in operation, but Jehovah’s witnesses are growing rapidly behind the Iron Curtain, as the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> report of Jehovah’s witnesses shows. The greatest single group of Jehovah’s witnesses outside the United States in any one country has been assembled behind the Iron Curtain despite all the brainwashing, propaganda and threats to annihilate and destroy God’s faithful servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No matter where anyone lives throughout the world, if he is going to remain a Christian and stay on the watch and be found faithful when Christ Jesus comes at Armageddon as a thief, then he must be paying constant attention to himself and to what he is teaching. The only way that he can do this is to stay close to Jehovah’s organization, study the divine will and live according to it, for if he stays by these things and does them he will save himself and those who listen to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is the strength of Jehovah’s organization: faith in Jehovah God, in his beloved Son, Christ Jesus, and in his faithful promises. Christian minds must be filled with truth. And those who do the same thing that Timothy, an early Christian, did, ‘paying constant attention to himself and to his teaching, staying by these things, thus saving both himself and those who listened to him,’ will have the same reward as he did. It can be you, if you seek the Light, Christ Jesus, and do the divine will! Endurance brings happiness. Endurance brings reward. Accomplishment through faithful labor brings great joy and boundless happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christians today work, are awake, really busy preaching. Even though while they are doing this work it means persecution for all, and death to some, still a Christian must always remember that Jesus said: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.” (John 4:34) So right up until the very end, to the finish of the battle of Armageddon, Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to be on the watch, staying awake, keeping their ministerial outer garments. They will stay at their assignment declaring the good news of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES AND THEIR SOCIETIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are a group of Christian people from all walks of life and of all colors and from all nations, speaking hundreds of tongues. But every one of them is wholly devoted to Jehovah God; they have dedicated their lives to his service and have been baptized in water. They are determined by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to do the divine will as set forth in their textbook, the Holy Bible. They are of one mind, having the mind of Christ. They look to Jehovah God as their teacher. “It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by Jehovah.’ Everyone that has heard the Father’s teaching and has learned comes to me.” (John 6:45) Jehovah’s witnesses appreciate that Jehovah is the Supreme One of the universe and has all knowledge and wisdom. “For ‘who has come to know the mind of Jehovah, that he may instruct him?’ But we do have the mind of Christ.” (1 Cor. 2:16) So with this oneness of mind Jehovah’s witnesses around the world work harmoniously together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is a corporation that Jehovah’s witnesses use to direct their work world-wide. Its headquarters is at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, New York, United States of America. There are many other corporations that are used and that work in conjunction with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, such as the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, and of Germany, the International Bible Students Association of Canada, England and Australia, and numerous other local corporations. But all of them have the same function, that is, to keep Jehovah’s witnesses organized in congregations and active in the preaching of the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The outstanding event of Jehovah’s witnesses during the year was the Divine Will International Assembly held in New York city, July 27 to August 3, 1958. This assembly of Christian people was the climax of the year and the most outstanding Christian assembly in the history of the world. The Societies afore-mentioned arranged to bring delegates from all parts of the earth to the Divine Will assembly in New York, and the unity, joy and happiness of these people are without compare. It was Jehovah who directed this assembly. His spirit was manifest. The warm love shown by all from many nations toward one another showed that this organization is truly bearing the fruits of the spirit. The divine will was made clear to all in attendance, and the effects of this marvelous convention have been felt by the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses around the earth. The truths concerning God’s kingdom that were expressed will penetrate into every nation. A comprehensive report of the assembly is made a part of this </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark189"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark190"></a>DIVINE WILL. INTERNATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">God’s kingdom rules—throughout the universe! As never before in history it made its presence felt in the earth in the summer of the year 1958, not with any violence, but with a remarkable peaceful demonstration. Never before did it have so many of its ambassadors and envoys assembled together for training and consultation and for a united public testimony and proclamation as then. The world-known Yankee Stadium and the neighboring Polo Grounds, the largest baseball parks in metropolitan New York city, literally overflowed with myriads, yet without disorder of any kind, just as befitted representatives of the great Government of universal order. Daily for eight days in succession more than 145,000 of them came together and deliberated concerning the interests of God’s kingdom; and peace, orderliness and brotherhood reigned among them. The tension, the fierce charges and countercharges, the rivalry and the clash that marked the official gatherings at the United Nations capital a few miles to the south did not disturb or mar a single session of the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses from Sunday, July 27, to Sunday, August 3. Coming from at least 123 countries and island groups, yet they met together in loyal unity around the now-ruling kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The hostility of the nations of the East and of the West because of endangerment to their divided selfish interests had brought all mankind near to the brink of war—of World War III. The Middle East, a zone of continual ferment and recurring trouble in Bible history, was like a powder keg that a wild spark could blow up. Violent rebellion had overthrown the royal government in the ancient Bible land of Mesopotamia, and Russia and the United Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria had promptly recognized the rebel regime. At the request of the then constitutional president of Lebanon, the United States of America had landed thousands of troops in that coastal land of famous cedar trees; and at the request of the king of Jordan Great Britain had landed troops at its capital Amman. Selfishly concerned nations called these moves “acts of aggression.&quot; The United Nations and its border observation force proved to be unequal to the emergency. The earthly situation was shaping up dangerously. For an international nonpolitical assembly of any size to be held the time seemed to be most inopportune. Especially so when delegates would come from the four quarters of the earth, even areas in the trouble zone, and would be dependent upon the world transportation system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, the long-announced international assembly had not been misnamed. It was the “Divine Will” for it to be held, and world conditions had to yield to it. The Most High God of heaven, who rules by means of his enthroned Son Jesus Christ, displayed his power to rule in the midst of his demonic and human enemies. He restrained the forces behind the Eastern and Western blocs of nations in order that the ambassadors and envoys of his heavenly kingdom might assemble in peace according to divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It takes time and organization to gather together any great number of ambassadors, diplomats and official representatives from worldly nations. Expect, then, the coming together at New York city of more than 150,000 ambassadors and envoys of God’s kingdom from more than sixscore lands, and one can at least faintly imagine the amount of time and organization it had to take to arrange to bring together all the dedicated Christian witnesses of Jehovah to the Divine Will International Assembly for eight days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All those attending had been given nineteen months of advance notice by the announcement that appeared in the issue of December 15,1956, of the official Kingdom magazine, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom, </span><span class="font7">page 763. By that time the contract had been secured for the use of the Yankee Stadium during the announced eight days. However, in view of the growth of the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses since the 1953 international assembly in Yankee Stadium, supplemented by a Trailer City many miles away in the neighboring state of New Jersey, it was evident from the start of the negotiations that more than the one stadium was needed for the vastly greater number of assembly delegates expected. So with Intense interest the spiritual governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses watched the developments with regard to the baseball park of the New York Giants, the Polo Grounds, just northwest across the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium. A shift of the National League baseball team, the New York Giants, from New York city to San Francisco, California, was under consideration; and providentially this transfer was approved on August 19, 1957, by the Board of Directors of the corporation operating the team. This shift left the Polo Grounds without regular occupancy and hence available for assembly use. Without delay the president of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society closed a contract with the owners to use the Polo Grounds simultaneously with Yankee Stadium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Efforts, begun long in advance, to procure an ample and convenient site for erecting a Trailer City to accommodate tens of thousands of theocratic assemblers failed repeatedly. Finally, near the time for the opening of the international assembly, the monthly service folder, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font7"> as of July, 1958, advised definitely that there would be “no trailer city.” It was plainly the divine will that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7"> the theocratic assemblers meet together at one site, in direct contact with one another and in full view of one another, under one administration, for one combined demonstration of Christian love, fellowship and solidarity. Whatever tents were to be pitched were to be those right alongside the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium for cafeteria and for great overflow crowds to sit under cover and listen to the Assembly program by sound equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Moreover, there were other vital meetings to be held with key members of Jehovah’s visible organization that could not conveniently be held inside the Polo Grounds and Yankee Stadium. For such special meetings, as well as for additional overflow accommodations, the New Rockland Palace was rented, just one city block south of the Polo Grounds. Thus the all-provident King of eternity, Jehovah God, not only called his royal ambassadors and envoys to the great Kingdom assembly but also saw to it that they had ample accommodations for meetings and for transacting their affairs.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>LODGINGS AND DEPARTMENTAL SERVICES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Although situated in a so-called Christian land, New York city is in fact a great pagan city, a large percentage of it not professing Christianity or even Judaism and those who do merely “having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.” (2 Tim. 3:5) This great metropolis and its environs, with over eight millions of inhabitants, have many hotels, tourist camps and motels, but not enough rooms were available at convenient rates for the critical time, the international assembly dates. Since all the assembly delegates from all quarters of the earth were to flock together to New York city and needed to be roomed there and roundabout, with no trailer city available, this posed a big problem, not for the great God of heaven, but for his witnesses in and about New York city who were to play hosts to the overwhelming number of guests from outside this metropolitan area. But the hand of Almighty God, the divine Host, worked in their behalf, however, not without strenuous effort and extreme hospitality on the part of the members of the seventy-three congregations inside New York city and many other congregations roundabout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Generously the Yankee Stadium management provided the use of its facilities for the two-hour “kick-off” meeting on Saturday afternoon, April 26, 1958, for starting off the campaign to get rooming accommodations in the private homes of people in this great pagan or semireligious area, where neighborliness is not much practiced with one’s heart in it. Fully 9,000 attended this kick-off meeting in Yankee Stadium to receive encouragement and instructions on how to proceed with this mammoth rooming-accommodations task and succeed in it. At the very start they were told that they would have to accommodate more than 150,000 guests, who would come by various means of transport from more than a hundred lands and largely with limited means for lodging and other assembly expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The very next morning that largest number ever to launch a rooming-accommodations campaign was out in the field, going to the private homes in the metropolitan area seeking and completing arrangements for lodgings for the coming theocratic assemblers. Exemplarily the homes of members of the metropolitan congregations threw open their own doors first in an expression of hospitality to Christian ministers, to Kingdom ambassadors and envoys, before asking the homes of Catholics, Protestants, Jews and outright pagans to do so. The Brooklyn Bethel home, where the central headquarters personnel of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania have their home, arranged to take in more than three hundred assembly delegates from more than eighty lands, one or two or more extra cots being installed in each dwelling room. Happy were the hospitable, for they were shown hospitality when sorely needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following due announcement, the requests for rooms in hotels and private homes poured in by the thousands each week at the rooming-accommodations department on the eleventh floor of the Watchtower Building, 77 Sands Street, Brooklyn, N.Y. For many weeks the number of requests received exceeded the number of rooming accommodations definitely engaged, and the margin between the requests and the rooms secured widened. The first weekend of the Assembly month saw more than 30,000 requests still not accommodated, and more requests were sure to come in by mail, not counting in the many requests that would be made directly at the Rooming Departments when set up at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds. With just three more weeks to go till Assembly, faith and perseverance needed to be exercised to the limit in the hunt for rooms. What a joy and relief it was, when, at the dinner table just a few days before the Assembly start, the president of the Watch Tower Society read off a triumphant roomingaccommodations report to the Brooklyn Bethel family, revealing that several hundred rooming accommodations had at last been secured in excess of all the requests received to that date! The great King and heavenly Supervisor of the approaching international assembly had rewarded the hospitality, the strenuous labors and the faith of the congregations of his dedicated witnesses in and around the Assembly city. Still the engaging of further rooms continued, in order to provide for any emergencies as to lodgings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By television, radio, printed matter and direct, personal visitation at homes and hotels the colossal need for rooms was advertised to the millions of inhabitants of New York city. Many were the cases of exceptional generosity that turned up in exhibition of good will and confidence toward Jehovah’s witnesses, thousands of absolutely free accommodations being tendered. Thus the entire metropolitan district was keenly alive to the fact that New York city was to play host to the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. From the beginning of July onward, advertising</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">cards in New York city subway trains, billboards, magazines, handbills, newspaper announcements, radio and television, besides bumper signs on thousands of private autos from all parts of America and Canada, were overwhelming the people with notice of the Assembly and especially of its public meeting on August 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Long before the first official announcement of the Assembly was made in the Kingdom magazine, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> behind-the-scenes preparations were already under way for it, Jehovah God, the King of eternity, has gifted his earthly organization with the needed farsightedness like that of the high-perched eagle. This 1958 Assembly was included within the purpose of the Most High God, and nothing could be left to take care of itself without preparation. The Assembly was to be a world-impressive demonstration of the power, organizability, theocraticalness and presence of God’s kingdom. Hence the Assembly needed the utmost of preparation, with due attention to the thousands of details. There is nothing slipshod about God’s kingdom. For an assembly of the size estimated, an organized personnel of ten thousand voluntary workers had to be assembled and assigned to departments and duties, from workers serving on the platform program down through the twenty-two listed departments, yes, down to the vital cleaning and sanitation department. Everything deserved to be done for the comfort, convenience and help of the Assembly delegates that they might better enjoy the program of platform events and of united field activities in advertising God’s kingdom, for eight days straight. One can well imagine the extensive and intensive planning, arranging and organization work that had to go forward. Not only was there an organizational structure to be worked out, but many physical structures had to be prefabricated for the platforms and their decorations, for the booths, for the soundequipment facilities, and for many other things. A tremendous amount of printing in many languages needed to be done on short order. This kept the Society’s factories in Brooklyn working night and day, for weeks.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>THE KINGDOM A DOMINANT FEATURE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The divine Creator of heaven and earth does everything with a purpose in expression of his will. (Rev. 4:11) The Divine Will International Assembly of his witnesses had to serve his purpose, because it was held in his name. His purpose was that this Assembly should serve the interests of his established kingdom now ruling. In any international gathering of ambassadors, foreign ministers or heads of governments it is very</span></p><img src="yb1959_E_files/yb1959_E-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:212pt;height:298pt;">

<p><span class="font7">necessary for first an agenda to be worked out, a program of events, a listing of subjects that it is agreed upon to discuss freely, in the hope of coming to some agreement and understanding and thus making progress and getting something done. Since the Divine Will International Assembly concerned itself with the greatest and only enduring government in the wide universe, it was highly proper that a far-reaching, many-featured, progressive and purposeful program be scheduled. The program had to be in full harmony with the divine will as revealed in the Holy Scriptures, in the light of fulfilled Bible prophecy. It had to serve the interests of God’s kingdom as such interests were dictated by the needs of God’s ambassadors and envoys in doing the work that they are ordained to do in all the earth, in the midst of enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thirty-two-page printed program, in an attractive cover, was distributed at the two Assembly stadiums on the day before the Assembly opened. It amazed the theocratic assemblers with the great variety of its features and the richness and interestingness of the matters that were to be handled from the platform. In fact, since two Assembly stadiums were to be served, it really required the putting on of a double program, each feature of which, with a few exceptions, was presented first at one stadium and then shortly afterward at the other stadium by the same speaker or symposium of speakers or group of demonstrators. The nearness of the two stadiums to each other, requiring just a few minutes’ ride on the subway train under the Harlem River from the one stadium station to the very next stadium station, made this conveniently possible. So each audience in each stadium got things directly, first hand, from its own platform. Each stadium had its own assistant chairman and assistant convention servant and orchestra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The printed program gave the menu of the spiritual feast that the divine King of the universe was to spread for his assembled ambassadors and envoys. (2 Cor. 5: 20) Here, in an exceptional and large-scale way, through the publications of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Jehovah God the King was calling out in the words of Isaiah 55:1-3: “Hey there, all you thirsty ones! Come to the water. And the ones that have no money! Come, buy and eat. Yes, come, buy wine and milk even without money and without price. Why do you people keep paying out money for what is not bread, and why is your toil for what results in no satisfaction? Listen intently to me, and eat what is good, and let your soul find its exquisite delight in fatness itself. Incline your ear and come to me. Listen, and your soul will keep alive.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ah yes, all those dedicated witnesses of Jehovah God who came to the Assembly had turned away from toiling and paying out money for materialism at a high price in dissatisfaction. They had hungered and thirsted for a divine government to rule all the parts of the earth where they lived. So in dedication to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ they turned to God’s kingdom as the only means for the everlasting blessing of all the families and nations of the earth. Without paying financially for ministerial training in any of Christendom’s theological seminaries they had begun to eat freely of the milk of the fatness of God’s service, being enriched with pure Bible knowledge and enjoying many privileges in the ministry of Kingdom truth for which this precious knowledge equipped them. They drank deeply of the wine of Kingdom joys that their ministry as ambassadors and envoys of God’s kingdom brought to them. Now, by attending this international assembly, they wanted to learn and to be trained how to partake more fully of the wine and milk of ministerial joys and privileges, which a minister enjoys by proclaiming God’s kingdom and by gathering all the other hungry, thirsty sheeplike people into God's fold under Christ. At this 1958 international assembly the teeming multitudes of delegates enjoyed the richest, most wholesome spiritual feast yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The rule of God’s kingdom is global, despite the enemies in the midst of which it must rule. In support of this fact is the observable presence of Jehovah’s witnesses in more than 170 countries and islands around the globe. In all those territories Matthew 24:14 is being proved to be a true prophecy by the preaching of the good news of God’s established kingdom to the many nations by his witnesses. All these witnesses are under the supervision of the now eighty-five Branch offices of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania, including the American Branch in Brooklyn, N.Y., each Branch having its own assigned territory to supervise and to report on directly to the President of the Society at Brooklyn, N.Y. Taking advantage of the Assembly, the Society’s president called in each supervisory Branch servant to report in person directly to him at Brooklyn and to the international assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite the troubled world conditions, only two of the Branch servants were prevented by men in worldly authority from answering the call to the visible headquarters of Jehovah’s witnesses in Brooklyn. The Society’s president, who has visited almost all of these Branch offices and factories around the globe, appreciated the need for all the Branches to carry on the functions of their various departments uniformly, according to proved efficient methods. So, after he himself had made a personal inspection of the Society’s biggest and most complicated Branch in Brooklyn over several weeks, he composed an all-embracing book of guidance and instruction for all Branch organizations and had it specially printed. This large-size 158-page loose-leaf book is entitled “Branch Office Procedure of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania”; and its instructions were to be put into effect from September 1, 1958, forward. This new book required study and discussion. On July 16, or about two weeks before the Assembly began, the Society’s president called together all the more than eighty Branch servants present, together with their respective assistants, totaling all together 160 overseers, to the Kingdom Hall located in the Brooklyn Bethel building, at 136 Columbia Heights. There, day after day, he went over this Branch Office Procedure book with them, discussing it, enlarging on it, answering their questions upon it, until two days before the Assembly opened. The gift of a copy of this special book to each one of the Branch servants was, in effect, the first release of the international assembly, or at least a preliminary release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Inasmuch as each Branch is equipped with this instruction book and must follow it, Jehovah’s witnesses in any territory around the globe may have the fullest confidence in the particular Branch that supervises their witness activities and congregational affairs. They know that such Branch, no matter how distant from headquarters and no matter how small or recently established, is operating according to the most advanced, up-to-date procedure, in full harmony with all other Branches, even the oldest and largest. Thus no one should despise or ignore any one Branch, but every active witness of Jehovah should appreciate that the entire organization of many parts is working in complete unity. Each witness should therefore co-operate and be submissive.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>DAYS OF SIGNIFICANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">According to the skillfully planned program, each of the Assembly days was given a name that emphasized some theocratic principle or activity. Beginning with Sunday, July 27, the days were named in the following order: Faithfulness Day, Exclusive Devotion Day, Expanding Our Ministry Day, Tasting Divine Goodness Day, Fullness of Service Day, Fearless Ministry Day, “Your Will Come to Pass” Day and God’s Kingdom Day. Thus on the eighth and last day the names culminated in a theme that called attention to the outstanding teaching of the Holy Bible, God’s kingdom. This harmonized perfectly with the subject of the public lecture that climaxed the closing day, “God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?” This theocratic kingdom is inseparable from the divine will, for it is by God’s kingdom that the model prayer to the heavenly Father is carried out, “Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matt. 6:9, 10) All the discussions and talks of the preceding seven days led the assemblers into a grander, soul-filling appreciation of God’s glorious kingdom that has been ruling in the heavens since 1914 by his enthroned Son, Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Divine Will International Assembly was no assembly for true, dedicated Christians just to have a relaxing good time together, listening to some entertainment program or to eulogistic speeches in praise of themselves and enjoying pleasant sociabilities together. The Assembly was arranged to be and it proved to be a most instructive training school, with the latest, most advanced Scriptural and organizational information to be given out. To this end, not only were the Society’s Branch servants called in, but all the district and circuit servants and as many foreign congregation servants understanding English as possible were brought to the Assembly. These were key men in the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses around the globe. They especially needed and deserved the counsel, the training and the mighty tonic spiritual effect that were to be imparted at the Assembly. Besides these, practically all the graduates of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead, who were still active in full service as missionaries and special pioneers, were brought in. Congregations all around the globe had made voluntary contributions to the Watch Tower Society toward meeting the travel expenses of all such worthy ones; and this aided greatly in bringing them to the Assembly from Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe and the Americas and the many islands of the seas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society’s president made provision for meeting in special morning sessions with these outstanding representatives and appointed servants of the Society. It was particularly for such special sessions that the New Rockland Palace was engaged. On Tuesday morning, July 29, 1,211 missionaries who make use of fifty-eight languages in their territories met with the Society’s president and the teaching faculty of the School of Gilead to hear encouraging talks and to enjoy a special tray-dinner together. All thirty-one graduated classes of Gilead were represented, thirty-one missionaries being from the first class of 1943. Wednesday morning marked a meeting with another group of full-time workers whom the Society sustains, namely, the special pioneers, who are doing vitally needed witness work in many lands in specially assigned locations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many circuit and district servants had had schooling in Gilead, but at 9:30 a.m., both Thursday and Friday, at the Palace, the Society’s president met with all the circuit and district servants from all lands and nationalities. This was with a view to improving their ministry as special overseers of the many congregations in their circuits and districts. These two mornings of discussion and of taking counsel together at the Palace were supplemented by the talks “Keeping Strict Watch on How We Walk” and “Shepherding the Sheep with Skillfulness” by the Society’s vice-president and president respectively on Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium, these talks being particularly directed to district, circuit and congregational servants, all of whom sat together in a reserved section of the stadium to hear these special talks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A further talk Saturday morning by one of the Society’s directors from the headquarters’ Service Department, on the subject, &quot;Overseers, Keep Your Congregation Alive,” emphasized the importance and responsibleness of spiritual overseers, on whatever level of service privileges they find themselves. Overseers with a still larger supervision received due attention during the Assembly itself when the Society’s president met again with the Branch servants, together with their assistants, at the Palace on Saturday morning at 9 a.m. Branch servants as well as district and circuit servants also attended when the president addressed himself to all brothers who held the appointment as public relations servants, at the Palace on Monday, July 28, at 9:30 a.m. What those public relations servants there absorbed they were soon able to apply when they returned home and publicized in their local areas the grand features and the exploits of the Assembly which they had personally observed. Public relations servants hold a responsible relationship to the public continually in being obligated to advertise God's kingdom and his New World society impressively and favorably by means of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and other valid means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the foregoing special meetings added greatly to the onerous duties of the Society’s president as a principal overseer of God’s flock on earth; but those meetings had a spurring and educational effect on all those privileged to take part in the meetings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>REALIZATION SURPASSES ANTICIPATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The Assembly’s very opening day, Faithfulness Day, held forth the promise of surpassingly grand things to be realized here at this international assembly down to its thrilling climax. From the start the Assembly was marked by internationality. Each day the temporary chairman in each stadium was of a different nationality, as follows: American, Japanese, Brazilian, Filipino, Mexican, Northern Rhodesian, Ghanan, Egyptian, Moroccan, Argentinian, Austrian, British, Ceylonese, Grecian and French. Morever, on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday morning, two-hour sessions were held in various sections of the two stadiums in twenty foreign languages to give Assembly resumes to those not well acquainted with English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The first Sunday morning, July 27, in a feature entitled “We Are Glad It Is the Divine Will that We Are Here,” Branch servants from fifteen foreign lands, including Alaska, Australia, Korea and South Africa, occupied the platform for forty-five minutes. The servant of the American Branch, in his capacity as Assembly Chairman, delivered a cordial Address of Welcome to an audience of 122,061 from 123 or more lands. The entire globe has been divided into large zones, each one taking in a number of the Society’s eighty-five Branches, each zone under a traveling zone servant. Seven such servants, who themselves hailed from Denmark, Japan, the Philippines, Ceylon, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Northern Rhodesia, spoke for a period of fifteen minutes on the platform as “Zone Servants Representing the Nations.” That same Sunday afternoon the internationalism of the Assembly, as forecast in the famous, oft-quoted prophecy of Isaiah 2:2-4, was shoved into bold relief in the graduation exercises of the thirty-first class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On that occasion, in the running track around Yankee Stadium, in their respective class groups, sat the stillactive missionaries and full-time workers of the preceding thirty graduated classes of Gilead, many in national dress. At the home plate of the Yankee team’s baseball diamond sat the 103 students of class No. 31, whose graduating exercises were now to proceed. Called to Gilead from sixty-four lands, only four being Americans, they formed a colorful group as they sat clad in native costume. Rainfall, which began at 3:35 p.m., halfway through the School president’s hour-long talk on “Stay by These Things,” did not budge them from their seats. It was still raining when the time came for them to file to the platform for the Society’s president to present to them their diplomas so well merited. After this presentation of diplomas a student read a Resolution as the united expression of the multination thirty-first class of Gilead. Then, after failing to halt the graduation exercises, the rainfall itself halted, and the astoundingly great audience of 180,291 witnesses in and around both stadiums rejoiced greatly that 103 more specially trained Kingdom educators were now ready to be sent forth on their mission to fifty-two lands of the inhabited earth. That night, under the light of a shining moon, 111,795 conventioners hugely enjoyed the two-and-a-half-hour-long feature, “The Students of the 31st Class of Gilead from 64 Lands Express Themselves,” in native costume, at both stadiums. The students expressed themselves in seventeen highly varied, tuneful, colorful, stirring solo and group presentations that held the attention of the vast audience from start to finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Continuing to keep the international make-up and activity of the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses to the fore, the Branch servants or representatives from the remainder of the Watch Tower Society’s Branches continued to present territorial reports to the Assembly from day to day. Each servant played up some different feature that marked the increase of the territorial organization. All these servants swept their great audiences along with them through the lengths and the breadths of the earth, into 164 lands where Jehovah’s witnesses are courageously preaching the good news of His kingdom in more than 120 languages, underground as well as above ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To supply a report on eight countries under Communist rule, where Jehovah’s witnesses are banned and must operate underground, a Swiss delegate occupied forty-five minutes in presenting the feature “Behind the Iron Curtain.” It was quite sensational to learn that there were 80,000 witnesses whose service reports proved that they refused to obey the Communist ban and quit preaching Jehovah’s kingdom; and that 90,000 persons had secretly attended the annual celebration of the Lord’s Evening Meal last April 3, 1958. Of that large number, however, merely 126 partook of the bread and wine in symbol of their being of the spirit-begotten remnant of Christ’s joint heirs for the heavenly kingdom. To add some heart-stirring realism to this report from behind the penetrable Iron Curtain, the Swiss delegate played a tape recording that had been smuggled across a number of frontiers. By means of this the audience of 127,802 on Saturday morning actually heard a group of underground witnesses sing in four-part harmony two sacred songs from our 1928 Songbook and heard a message of greeting and prayerful good wishes from an underground overseer. What loyalty God’s kingdom calls forth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Branch servants and circuit and district servants fulfilled other parts on the greatly diversified educational program. Representative brothers from the Society’s central establishment in Brooklyn also served on the platform in certain vital features. The counsel and instruction given from the Scriptures not only had in mind the representative responsible servants of the earth-wide organization but also dealt with the Christian obligations of parents and children, husbands and wives, and the hundreds of thousands of congregation members who take part in Kingdom preaching. In fact, all features of Christian living were touched upon in the platform talks, and much practical advice from God’s Word was given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A number of true-life accounts were given by stillactive, long-time faithful missionaries under the title “We Pursued Our Purpose in Life.” Various ways and means of penetrating into many untouched lands and islands where the witness work is barred to missionaries and there organizing congregations were described under the theme “Serving Where the Need Is Great Overseas.” The opportunities in one’s own home country were forcibly brought to mind in the companion talk “Filling the Need in Our Own Country.” Those talks showed the way out to the many witnesses who may feel cramped in their preaching opportunities in congregation territories that are so congested with local Kingdom publishers that the territories get worked very frequently because of the continual activities. But the talk “Staying Where the Need Is Great” reminded Kingdom publishers to endure and persevere and be stable in their assigned territories and not yield to wanderlust, disgust or despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thirty-minute discussion of “Theocratic School for Fearless Ministers” stirred up a sustained applause when the speaker, the Society’s president, sprang a surprise on his combined audience of 173,079 Friday night. What was it? That, from the beginning of 1959, sisters in the congregations were to be privileged to enroll in the weekly Theocratic Ministry School. They would then take part in the platform presentations to the extent of demonstrating how to give six-minute sermons to people at their homes, these sermons being based on an assigned number of pages in the new publication entitled “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.” This was for the sisters a really serious assignment in the Theocratic Ministry School, for they were to be counseled afterward by the school servant on their presentation. This talk on how the program of the school will thus be expanded was followed by an hourlong platform demonstration of a school session that combined the new feature. There were the usual instruction talk and two student talks first by three brothers, but then at the close there came two six-minute sermons, each given by a sister from the Brooklyn Bethel headquarters family to another sister playing a counterpart. Each of the two sisters giving the sermons was then counseled by the school servant, the same as the two brothers giving student talks had been counseled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wednesday morning, or Tasting Divine Goodness Day, afforded a sight that had no equal since the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem A.D. 33, or nineteen centuries ago. The preceding night (Tuesday) the Branch servant from Korea had given the half-hour talk on “What Prevents Me from Getting Baptized?” Now this morning that question was to be answered. How many there in attendance at the Assembly had tasted of the divine goodness and had responsively dedicated themselves to the divine Good One? How many were now asking themselves the Ethiopian’s question, “What prevents me from getting baptized?” (Acts 8:36) All such dedicated ones sat in a specially reserved section down front in the grandstand of Yankee Stadium. Tens of thousands of waiting, watching observers surrounded them. The Swedish Branch servant addressed them in accord with the subject “Baptism According to the Divine Will.” He had two basic, searching questions to ask them in order to learn whether anything prevented them from getting baptized. At his request the baptismal applicants rose to answer audibly in unison these two determining questions. At that moment the great crowd of observers sent wave upon wave of heavy applause surging through the vast stadium. Why? Because so many stood to show that nothing prevented them from symbolizing their dedication to God through Christ by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Orchard Beach swimming area miles away, where they were transported by seventy-five-passenger buses, they trooped into the sea in thirty lines to be baptized. At the end of two and a half hours the count of those actually baptized ran up to 2,937 men and 4,199 women, to total 7,136. This was 4,136 more than were baptized that day of Pentecost long ago, and they represented far more than the sixteen nations that were represented on that Pentecost. The Pentecostal baptism of 3,000 in water was in response to the revealed fact that Jesus was seated as Lord and Christ at the right hand of his Father in heaven. The baptism of 7,136 at the 1958 Divine Will International Assembly was a record-breaking response to the fact that God’s kingdom rules since the world-disturbing year of 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a couple of days prior to Friday an urgent appeal was made for all delegates to be present Friday afternoon when the issue was to be submitted to the Assembly, “Why This Convention Should Resolve?” To the boundless joy of the whole Assembly, the amazing number of 194,418 responded to the invitation. For three quarters of an hour the Society’s vice-president laid before this applause-happy multitude Scriptural reasons why the Assembly should seize this unequaled occasion to unite in an unequivocal resolve, thus going on record before God, angels and men. Eagerly, for the next fifteen minutes, they listened to the Society’s president as he read declaration after declaration of the proposed Resolution. This outrightly exposed Christendom’s clergy as the most reprehensible class on earth today. It reaffirmed the witnesses’ own theocratic principles. It unashamedly proclaimed God’s kingdom by Christ to be the sole means of salvation for all men who long for peace and security. It strongly asserted their determination to serve and preach God’s kingdom in love, peace and unity and without letup, like our faithful brothers behind the Iron Curtain, until Jehovah himself brings the witness work to a world-smashing finale by his own act of testimony at Armageddon. Applause greeted the president’s motion that the Resolution as read be adopted. His motion being seconded, he put the question, and 194,418 voices roared out a unanimous Aye! The consequences of this forthright Resolution all those who heartily adopted it stand ready to meet with Almighty God’s help.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>PRINTED GIFTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Unknown to the tens of thousands attending the Assembly the New World Bible Translation Committee had finished its work on Volume IV of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font7"> on April 13, 1958. So it released it for the Watchtower Society’s factory to print. Volume IV contains the translation of the prophetic books of Isaiah, Jeremiah and Lamentations. Jehovah having provided his witnesses with this latest translation of these three Bible books, it was apparent that his special messages for the Divine Will International Assembly should be drawn from those prophecies. They were. The reprehensibility of Christendom’s clergy as set forth in the Resolution that the Assembly adopted was foreshadowed by Jehovah’s denunciation of Judah’s religious leaders, in Jeremiah, chapter 23. Other principal speeches were likewise based upon the prophecies contained in this latest volume of the New World Translation. The president’s keynote speech on Monday afternoon, “Signs and Wonders in the Time of the End,” rested chiefly upon Isaiah’s prophecy; similarly the vice-president’s speech on Tuesday afternoon, “Divine Loving-Kindness and the Kingdom,” and his speech on Saturday night, “When Jehovah Rises Up to His Unusual Work.” The president’s speech of Wednesday afternoon, “Down with the Old—Up with the New!” was a present-day application of dynamic prophecies of Jeremiah, who, together with men of good will, survived the shocking destruction of the holy city of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 607 B.C. At the dramatic close of this Jeremian speech the Society’s president evoked great applause from his audience of 150,282 by releasing Volume IV of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures.</span><span class="font7"> Tens on tens of thousands of copies of it were eagerly taken by the vast throng at the close of the session.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thursday afternoon, July 31, was paradisaic in both its assembly and in what it produced. The surroundings of the speakers’ platforms of both stadiums were paradisaic in their physical beauty. The audience of 145,488 all roundabout were enjoying a feast of Christian association and Kingdom truths in a spiritual paradise. Their appreciation of this fact was sharpened by the speech of the Society’s president entitled “Maintaining Our Spiritual Paradise.” He crowned the occasion by his entirely unexpected display and release of the glowingly beautiful, handsomely illustrated book of 256 pages, bearing the title “From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.” This book wastes no time and space discussing false doctrines of worldly religions, but simply explains the God-honoring truths of the sacred Bible as these came to the surface in the outworking of God’s purpose to restore obedient humankind to an everlasting earthly paradise. But this restoration has to be preceded by the establishing of God’s heavenly kingdom and his restoring first a spiritual paradise for his faithful Christian witnesses. It was this spiritual paradise that had to be maintained now with faithfulness and fruitfulness by its blest, happy inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The book on Paradise had been published, not with children in mind, but for the purpose of satisfying the need and craving of adult persons in many lands who needed a primary or elementary manner of approach to the pure truths of God’s Word. After the session there was many an assembler that took copies of the book in large quantity. Delight went permeating the mighty hosts assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Why the international assembly was embellished with the title Divine Will dawned on the delegates, especially Saturday afternoon. The day’s name itself was drawn from the words of our Lord’s Prayer. This was true also of the president’s speech, “Let Your Will Come to Pass.” For twenty-three times his audience of 175,441 applauded his descriptions of how divine Jehovah had carried out his will in heaven and earth. This has been despite the opposition by Satan’s hosts of angels in heaven and by the mighty world powers on earth, from the days of the first world power Babylon, Jerusalem’s destroyer, down to the atomically armed seventh world power, Britain-America, of today, together with the eighth world power, the United Nations. By his heavenly kingdom, which Jehovah God gave to the once “lowliest of men,” Jesus Christ, in 1914, the God of heaven will have his will come to pass in the coming battle of Armageddon and also afterward in the endless new world. With a deepened appreciation of how God accomplishes his will the Assembly applauded the president’s announcement of the title of the beautiful new 384-page book, “Your Will Be Done on Earth.” The distribution of 228,000 copies into their hands by the next few days bespoke the yearning they felt for the unfolding of the prophecies of Daniel and of other holy inspired men that this book offered them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark203"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark204"></a>GOD’S KINGDOM DAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For both heaven and earth the final Sunday afternoon was a happy time. Certainly the great King of heaven, Jehovah God, and his reigning Son, Jesus Christ, rejoiced together with the holy angels to have God’s kingdom preached by one mouthpiece to the largest visible audience on one occasion. From heaven they looked down on an audience of more than a quarter of a million persons, 253,922 by count, occupying all seats in the two Assembly stadiums, thousands standing in close formation out on the baseball outfield behind the speakers’ platform in Yankee Stadium, all seats in the overflow tents being occupied, and thousands standing listening on the walks outside the stadiums and tents. The challenging subject of the public address, so widely advertised over the weeks, was “God’s Kingdom Rules —Is the World’s End Near?” Showing a fine grasp of his subject, the speaking witness of Jehovah, the Society’s president, proved by Scripture and by prophecy fulfilled since 1914 that God’s kingdom by Christ has ruled in the heavens since that date. This unavoidably denotes that the end of this political, commercial, religious world is near. No vacuum will follow its complete end at Armageddon, for God’s everlasting new world of righteousness will glorify heaven and earth after Armageddon, and forever His will shall be done on earth in a paradise state as it is done in the holy heavens above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This was indeed something for this overwhelmingly great audience to hail, and hail it they did, with a finale of applause that was really a tribute to the Kingdom message. During the intermission that followed they gladly accepted the proffered two free copies apiece of the booklet containing the full text of the speech, half a million copies of which had been printed and brought to the stadiums for this exalted occasion. Judging from the big audience of the preceding Friday afternoon, we believe that about 60,000 of the invited public had turned out and joined the Assembly in listening to this glad message of God’s now ruling kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of those 60,000 must have remained in response to the invitation to hear shortly the closing remarks of the president, the public speaker, for the final attendance was 210,778, the second-largest attendance of the entire Assembly. What they heard proved to be amply rewarding. It vividly revealed that over all the earth God’s kingdom was on the march toward victory and that his visible organization was planning, preparing and arranging for greater expansion by the enlarging of the physical facilities of the New World society and by the use of these facilities in a widening program for training the servants of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the start of these closing remarks came the final release of the assembly, the ninety-first. Yes, there had already been ninety releases of books and booklets in various languages, post cards and sixteen-page convention reports. But this final one, a post card giving the architect’s conception of the new twelve-story building to be erected in 1959 on Columbia Heights opposite the present Brooklyn Bethel home, conveyed a thrill of its own. A copy was handed free to each adult before the Society’s president commented on its significance. He branched out from this onto many other provisions that were to be made for feeding Jehovah’s sheep under Jesus Christ with the latest spiritual food and for producing better organizational servants and for making better ministers out of all of Jehovah’s dedicated witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More than fifty applauses punctuated these fascinating closing remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After such a review of all the grand things of the Assembly and after the setting forth in grand array of all our theocratic purposes for the future, the immense congregation could join in singing heartfelt the song, the first line of which reads, “Great God, we thank you for the part we have in making glad your heart.” With reverent and grateful hearts they could bow their heads as the Society’s president offered the closing prayer. With hearts filled with the joy of having something noble to live for in the service of God’s kingdom, in obedience to the divine will, they gradually disbanded, the spirit of Jehovah God accompanying them. A great ineffaceable sign and wonder to Jehovah’s lasting glory had been wrought by this Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark205"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark206"></a>“LET ALL YOUR AFFAIRS TAKE PLACE WITH LOVE”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">These are strenuous times, treacherous. Some people think they live in the peaceful part of the world, but the majority know that they live in a world where a war of destruction could break out at any moment. However, all of us live in a world of idolaters, fornicators, murderers, thieves, greedy persons, a truly delinquent world for young and old. So no matter where anyone lives he is going to be surrounded by difficulties. How will he conduct himself under these influences? For the Christian there is only one way. Paul stated it plainly when he said: “Let all your affairs take place with love.” (1 Cor. 16:14) Regardless of the other individual’s way of life, the Christian should deal with the other person unselfishly and kindly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Paul defined love in First Corinthians the thirteenth chapter he had to compose quite a lengthy expression in order to make it comprehensive, to bring in everything involved in connection with love. He was definite that love is “long-suffering and obliging. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up.” (1 Cor. 13:4) An individual having true love will not lose his selfcontrol. He will keep on an even keel. That does not mean a Christian could not be firm, strong in his decisions. No, for Paul said: “Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on as men, grow mighty. Let all your affairs take place with love.” —1 Cor. 16:13,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul also said: “Only behave in a manner worthy of the good news about the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear about the things which concern you, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul fighting side by side for the faith of the good news.” (Phil. 1:27) Can a true Christian do otherwise? No! He must behave in a manner worthy of the good news. So he shows real love and carries on all his affairs that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses have been declaring that “God’s kingdom rules.” This certainly is good news. At the great Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 253,922 persons heard what Jehovah’s witnesses believe concerning this kingdom of God, which is the only hope for mankind, and there Jehovah’s witnesses declared themselves as ministers of that kingdom. To see how determined they have been in their standing firm in one spirit and with one soul fighting side by side for the faith of the good news, all one needs to do is look at their year’s field service report. See pages 52-59. This report reveals that there were, on the average, 717,088 ministers preaching from house to house every month during the 1958 service year, conducting their affairs in love one toward the other. Not only toward Jehovah’s witnesses do they act respectably, but to all the world of mankind they feel the responsibility of showing love, and this they do by preaching. These ministers are to be found in 175 countries, islands of the seas, colonies, provinces, right around the world. Every month during the 1958 service year there were, on the average, 63,815 more of Jehovah’s witnesses preaching this good news than during the 1957 service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In fact, last year so many turned away from the sleepy condition in the world that a new peak in number of proclaimers of the good news was reached, totaling 798,326. This is 81,425 more ministers than the peak number of publishers of the previous year, 1957. Why this tremendous influx into Jehovah’s witnesses’ organization? It is because people are finding salvation. Many people want to live with individuals who are really Christians, those who are letting all their affairs take place with love. They have found an organization that is following the good advice of Paul: “Now we request you, brothers, to have regard for those who are working hard among you . . . give them more than extraordinary consideration in love because of their work. Be peaceable with one another. . . . speak comfortingly to the depressed souls, support the weak, be long-suffering toward all. See that no one renders injury for injury to anyone else, but always pursue what is good toward one another and to all others.” (1 Thess. 5:12-15) Because Jehovah’s witnesses follow such instruction, it furnishes one of the reasons why the New World society is growing so rapidly. It is this spirit expressed by true Christians toward one another and to others that attracts good-will sheeplike people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A goodly number of those who have come into the organization during the last few years have gone into the full-time service, devoting all their energies to the preaching of the good news. In fact, we find 23,772 persons engaging in pioneer service. Some of these are missionaries away off in foreign lands, working in high mountains, in low deserts, in fertile green valleys, in large and in small cities. Others are special pioneers, working out from the eighty-five Branch offices scattered throughout the world, organizing interested ones into congregations where they could serve God. There are now 17,878 congregations, an increase of 995 over the previous year. In these congregations Jehovah’s witnesses are studying weekly, several times a week in fact, in home Bible studies, congregation book studies, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> studies, all the information thus gained building up their minds so that they may be able to declare more clearly the good news. All this association and study aids them to stand shoulder to shoulder, fighting side by side and not compromising with this old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the Memorial season there was a total of 1,171,789 persons who came together in these congregations, of which 15,037 were of the anointed, that is, believers that they are of the body of Christ and will be joint-heirs with Christ Jesus in heavenly glory. The greater number believed that they are of the other sheep who will enjoy everlasting life here upon the earth. But, all together, they must stay awake, be on guard as to the Kingdom interests and show love for one another, letting all their affairs take place with love. These thousands of persons who are associating with Jehovah’s witnesses in such great numbers each year are not just curious religion hunters, looking for something new and different. They are sincere in wanting to know the truth and they find it in God’s Word and then they make a stand for it. They grow strong and carry on as men and are willing to defend their faith. They go so far as to dedicate their lives to the service of Jehovah God, giving him exclusive devotion, and 62,666 of those who associated themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses last year were baptized in water, completely immersed, showing their willingness to do the divine will. As readers of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> know, Jehovah’s witnesses are not the silent type. They are expressive in their belief, and in the twelvemonth period of their service year they devoted 110,390,944 hours to preaching the good news that God’s kingdom rules. This is 10,255,928 more hours spent in the ministry than the previous year. They are anxious for the people to know the good things they know, and that is why during the year these witnesses of Jehovah obtained 1,273,698 new subscriptions for the magazines </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font8">and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> and distributed individual copies in their many languages to the number of 86,498,251. In order for the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, in its many printing plants, to take care of the demand of its readers it was necessary for the printing plants to publish 86,141,119 copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> in fifty-one languages and 71,431,928 copies of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazine in nineteen languages, making a grand total of 157,583,041 magazines published and shipped out. In addition, 4,381,504 Bibles and bound books and 14,125,528 booklets, thirty-two and sixty-four pages in size, were printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But the love of Jehovah’s witnesses for the peoples of the world and their desire to bring them the message of salvation goes farther than just placing literature. Those 110,390,944 hours that they worked were spent, in part, in calling back on those who have shown interest, and so these 798,326 publishers of the Kingdom made 36,398,025 back-calls. In other words, Jehovah’s witnesses have gone back to persons’ homes where they have found interest and they have explained further the things they believe and have answered these peoples’ questions on Bible subjects. They have shown love to an even greater extent: they have gone back to these peoples’ homes week after week and have spent an hour at a time studying with the people from their Bibles of any translation, Catholic or Protestant, so that these people might learn the truth. How many clergymen do that with their parishioners? These studies Jehovah’s witnesses call home Bible studies. During every week of the year they conducted 508,320 such Bible studies. This is 95,271 more than they were conducting the year before. Think of the time that it takes to conduct that many Bible studies every week for a whole year. That alone would require more than 25,000,000 hours and, in addition to that, much traveling time to and from the study is involved, but not counted. Would you not say that it takes love to do such kind of work? That is why Jehovah’s witnesses believe the expression of Paul when he said: “Let all your affairs take place with love.” Be interested in people, regardless of race, color, creed, be it in good season or bad season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As you study the chart on pages 52 to 59 of the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font8">you will see that those of Jehovah’s witnesses behind the Iron Curtain are working just as hard, if not harder, and are having better results in gathering other sheep than Christians living in the Western bloc of nations or in neutral countries. Look at the report! It is most truly amazing! For eight countries behind the Iron Curtain there has been a 21-percent increase in the number of those taking their stand for the Kingdom. Whereas throughout the whole world the average is 9.8 percent. Who can say Christians are not men? Who can say that they are not willing to fight for truth and for righteousness? Who can say that they will not stay on guard and on duty and take up their ministerial responsibilities? Yes, true Christians of God, Jehovah’s witnesses, stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on as men and grow mighty. They preach with greater zeal and effort than ever before in their lives. What a glorious year they have had! What joy has been theirs! What happiness they possess because they are letting all their affairs take place with love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">servants and these make a visit yearly to all the branches and the missionary homes and they also serve some congregations. Then there are branch servants, district servants, circuit servants and other special representatives in the branch who visit the congregations and give them comfort and admonition and encourage them in their Kingdom service. All these are ordained ministers appointed to special service. (See below.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has eighty-five Branches scattered throughout the world, and these Branches look after the direction of each of the congregations in their territory and recommend certain individuals to take on these special privileges of service. All of these are overseers too. So in addition to those that are listed in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font8"> there are thousands of others who are overseers appointed to be the congregation servant, or the presiding minister of the congregation itself; and there are many others who are appointed as ministerial servants, assisting the congregation servant, who is the overseer of a particular congregation. All of this arrangement of sending special representatives throughout the earth under the direction of the Society has bound the organization together in unity and it has kept God’s people spiritually minded, wholesome and clean and devoted to one cause, the vindication of Jehovah’s name and Word.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark212"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark213"></a>EDUCATIONAL CENTERS TO INCREASE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead has been in operation now a little more than fifteen years, and it was thrilling to hear the Society’s president announce in his closing remarks at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses that a great expansion program and educational program was planned. A new twelve-story structure is to rise across the street from 124 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn during the year 1959, if this be Jehovah’s will; and at its completion a tenmonth training course will be put into effect for further education of ordained ministers from all parts of the world. In addition to this a new special training program was announced that will be effective in almost all the large countries, using the new branch homes at Toronto, Canada; London, England; Paris, France; Wiesbaden, Germany, and other countries for training congregation servants as well as district and circuit servants. Jehovah is our grand Instructor and it seems good now to be planning for the future, and it is hoped that within the next two years this whole arrangement will be going into effect for the blessing of the overseers and, in turn, for the blessing of all of God’s ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the past service year, the thirtieth and thirty-first classes of Gilead were graduated. Two hundred and fifteen students were originally called to attend these two classes and 212 of them graduated. This has brought the total number of students who have finished school to 3,265 in fifteen and one half years. The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead has proved to be an international school. The Society has brought students from eighty-two lands outside the United States. Of the total number who have graduated 1,413 were from all around the world, while 1,852 came from America. This means that 43 percent of the students who have graduated in the thirty-one classes came from outside the United States. The Society is indeed grateful that such splendid training can be given to missionaries and representatives of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The registrar at the school gives a brief report of the thirtieth and thirty-first classes that have graduated.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark214"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark215"></a>THE THIRTIETH TERM OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">September 4, 1957, school opened for the thirtieth class. A total of 112 students registered. Eighteen of these were from outside the United States. The class did very well with its studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thirtieth class had a historic graduation. It was held at Gilead School during the worst winter that this part of the country had had in fifty years. On Sunday morning, February 9, 1958, there were 1,687 in attendance at the graduation. Heavy snows began to fall on Saturday and continued during Sunday. By late Sunday afternoon Gilead was snow-blocked, with no cars able to get through on the main highway. Many who had stayed for the late afternoon session found it impossible to leave, and it meant that over seven hundred were snowbound Sunday night. Men, women and children slept as best they could on the floors and in the chairs and elsewhere in the various buildings at the Watchtower Bible School. Many used the library, classrooms and some the lounges. Everyone took it in very good spirits. The next day the snow plows of the county got through and opened the highways sufficiently for the guests to start on their way home. Of those students who registered, 109 graduated, 104 received diplomas. Appropriately, on graduation day the president of the Society spoke on the subject “Hospitality, a Responsibility.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark217"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>THE THIRTY-FIRST TERM OF GILEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">On February 19, 1958, 103 students from sixty-four lands started school. Ninety-nine of these students were from outside the United States. This class proved to be the most colorful group that ever gathered together at Gilead for a special training in missionary service. There was no foreign language taught, because most of the students would be returning to their homelands. So a special course was arranged in advanced English. In spite of language difficulties the students did very well in their academic studies. Only three of the 103 that graduated failed to receive diplomas. Never in the history of the school did a graduating class have such a large audience on its graduating day. The amazing total of 180,291 attended the graduation of the thirty-first class on Sunday, July 27, 1958, at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds in New York city. All the instructors spoke in the afternoon as well as the vice-president and the president of the Society, after which the diplomas were handed out at the Yankee Stadium. It rained, but this did not interfere one bit with the program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following this colorful afternoon graduation the students also appeared in native costume and presented a two-and-one-half-hour program in the evening giving their impressions of Gilead school days. People from around the world had come to the international assembly and they have taken back very pleasant memories of the thirty-first class graduation from Gilead School.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark220"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark221"></a>THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The year 1958 will be long remembered by Jehovah’s witnesses in the United States, and especially by members of the Bethel family in Brooklyn. This has been the most outstanding year in the lives of God’s people in this country. What happened in America in the latter part of July and the beginning of August made news that was heard around the world. The greatest Christian convention of all times, the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, was held simultaneously in Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds and surrounding properties. It seemed that the whole year was being used in preparation for this eight-day assembly of praise to Jehovah’s name. Now that the assembly is over, all who attended the assembly can look back and say that the months of preparation brought about the desired results. It was only because Jehovah’s spirit was directing, not only the activities in America, but the activities throughout all the Branch organizations, for at this convention there was full co-ordination among the ministers of God’s kingdom from every place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While the field service report for the United States was excellent, outstanding in publishers, with an 8-percent increase, and especially in the number of Bible studies held, still all of this seems to reflect itself in the convention that took a city as large as New York to hold it. Those who are in the New World society, Jehovah’s witnesses themselves, know why the convention operated so smoothly and peaceably, why so much love was shown and why the world sat up and took notice. This assembly was brought about because of the divine will, and those in attendance were doing the divine will. The world that looked on at this Christian assembly could not help but marvel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even the Congressional Record of 1958 in its appendix, page A6907, published this report on the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>CONVENTION OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES IN NEW YORK CITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. RICHARD L. NEUBERGER OF OREGON</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Friday, August 1, 1958</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Mr. NEUBERGER. Mr. President, in recent years much publicity has been given to so-called rowdy and boisterous conventions of various organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is a pleasure to see a totally different kind of attention accorded in this respect. On August 1, 1958, America’s leading daily newspaper, the New York Times, reported that the religious group known as Jehovah’s Witnesses had just held in America’s largest city, New York’s best behaved convention. That is the description which the Times applied to the recent meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the city of New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">And the Times has added:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whatever New Yorkers may think of the Witnesses’ theology, they are unanimous in agreeing that the Witnesses’ conduct has been exemplary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many prominent hotel operators in New York are quoted as describing their patrons among Jehovah’s Witnesses as orderly, considerate, and pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So that there may be a permanent recording and noting in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of the fact that a very large number of our citizens can meet in a great American metropolitan center in orderly, well behaved and thoroughly considerate fashion, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Appendix of the RECORD an article entitled “Witnesses Styled City’s Best Guests,” published in the New York Times of August 1,1958.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">WITNESSES STYLED CITY’S BEST GUESTS— 180,000 AT WORLD ASSEMBLY WIN PRAISE FOR COURTESY, QUIETUDE, AND NEATNESS (By George Dugan)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">New York has been host for the last 6 days to its biggest and in all likelihood its best-behaved convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since Sunday some 180,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses have been eating, sleeping and working in the metropolitan area. Their Divine Will International Assembly, in daily session at both the Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds, will end the day after tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Whatever New Yorkers may think of the Witnesses’ theology, they are unanimous in agreeing that the Witnesses’ conduct has been exemplary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A typical comment was voiced yesterday by Norbert P. Popper, reservation manager of the Dixie Hotel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">He reported that never in his career as a hotelman had he seen “a nicer bunch of people.” He said the Dixie was “jammed” with Witnesses— every one of them orderly, considerate, and pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PARSIMONIOUS BUT CLEANLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Equally glowing phrases were used by Mrs. Elizabeth Alonso. Mrs. Alonso is a cashier and waitress at Jiffy’s Food Shop on the northwest corner of Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">She observed that &quot;the Witnesses never have given us any trouble and are considerate as well as cooperative.” Asked about their tipping habits, she reluctantly said they “could do better.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But this is a common complaint wherever most religious folk gather. A standard cab-driver joke from coast to coast goes like this: “Ah, they came here with the Ten Commandments and a 10-buck bill and haven’t broken either.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Aside from their failure to tip in the New York manner, no serious gripes could be lodged against the Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Their cleanliness is now almost legendary. A week ago a corps of volunteer Witnesses washed down every seat in Yankee Stadium. When they leave on Sunday night the ball park will be spotless. Three years ago Yankee maintenance men testified that when the Witnesses departed the arena had never been cleaner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSIDERATE OF PASSERSBY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Times Square area where members of the movement have been passing out tracts, handbills and periodicals, courtesy has been their watchword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the East Side paeans were also sung. Royal Ryan, executive vice president of the New York Convention and Vistors’ Bureau, called the Witnesses “an asset to the community.” He described their behavior as “out of this world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Neil Lang, general manager of the Roosevelt Hotel, said about 750 Witnesses were staying in his hostelry. He characterized them as “very nice, not a bit demanding, and easy to do business with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To Witnesses, the words of the Bible are not to be tampered with. They regard them as exact, true and prophetic. Certain Biblical texts, they insist, predict in the not too distant future the end of the world, preceded by the battle of Armageddon, or the final conflict between good and evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Then 144,000 elect of the ages will reign with Jesus in heaven as the body of Christ. The wicked will be destroyed, and only Witnesses will remain on earth to live in eternal peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The figure 144,000 was arrived at through a combination of Biblical verses appearing in Revelation, Luke, and other books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The report furnished by the branch office in the United States also is filled with experiences about the convention because the Branch felt, too, that the convention was the outstanding event of the year and nothing else could be written to compare with it. Some of the excerpts of the Branch report are published herewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the United States not only New York city received a tremendous witness, but as a result of the excellent newspaper, radio and television publicity during the assembly and the favorable articles following the assembly in popular and prominent magazines the whole country knew Jehovah’s witnesses had held the greatest Christian assembly of all times. As a result, on returning home from the assembly publishers found many newly interested persons. A district servant writes: “Not a day passes in our witnessing but that several householders inquire about the New York assembly. Only today I made a call a few moments before noon. The bright-looking young woman pleaded that she was busy so I suggested a call later in the day. Midafternoon we called back. She followed the sermon with keen interest. Afterward she informed me that relatives of hers were witnesses and had visited on their way home from the assembly. In addition she had followed it in the newspapers and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font7"> magazine. She was now as enthusiastic about the assembly and the work as we were and thanked us several times for calling back.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">By staying in private homes publishers were privileged to help householders by example and by preaching to appreciate the truth. Writes a sister: “My husband and I decided to stay in a private home as suggested by the Society so we could have opportunity of witnessing to the householders. We were assigned to a home with husband, wife and two teen-age daughters. Being dissatisfied with their church, they no longer attended. The first evening my husband spent more than an hour discussing the Kingdom blessings with the man of the house. Then came the release of the latest edition of the New World Translation. I presented this to the wife as a gift and tears came to her eyes. When </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained</span><span class="font7"> was released a copy was presented to each of the teen-age daughters. The new book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Your Will Be Done on Earth’</span><span class="font7"> was presented to the husband. Every evening was spent discussing the Scriptures with the entire family. When it came time to leave, even the neighbors from adjacent apartments, who had become acquainted with us during our stay, came down to the street to say good-by, waving to us as long as we were in sight. If we had stayed in a hotel we would have missed this blessing of giving a witness in this Catholic section.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Publishers in New York city are, at the time of this report, very busy calling on all householders who opened their homes to house our brothers and also persons of good will whose names were turned in. Many wonderful experiences have resulted such as this typical one: On making a landlady call the publisher was cordially invited in, and told, “I had some very nice people staying with me who took me to the assembly.” After an enthusiastic and spirited discussion of how much she enjoyed the assembly and the people who stayed at her home, the publisher introduced the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Kingdom Rules—Is the World’s End Near?</span><span class="font7"> seeking to use it as a means of getting into a Bible discussion. She replied, “I have the booklet, as I was there the last day. Wait a minute, I would like to show you something.” She returned with three publications she had obtained from the book counter at the assembly. In showing her interesting points in each publication, the publisher noticed portions in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life” </span><span class="font7">underlined and with notations made in the margin. The householder explained that she had made notations and underlined portions she wanted to show her husband. Not only was a study started, in which her husband joined, but both have begun attending congregation meetings, and the lady has been in field service several times and is making excellent progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among things highlighted at the assembly was serving where the need is great. We are happy to report that many families have already left this country to serve where the need is great and many more are now arranging to leave. Others, unable to go abroad, have responded to serving where the need is great within the country and are enjoying wonderful blessings. One of the numerous cases is that of a well-educated colored brother with wife and child, living in California. On being advised by the Society that much help was needed in the South, he accepted an isolated assignment in Georgia. Being qualified, he was appointed a special pioneer. After being in the territory only a few months he was successful in organizing a congregation of eleven publishers. One year later the congregation had grown to forty-one publishers—a 272-percent increase in one year. With many more families of publishers and pioneers going into sections where much work is to be done we look forward to seeing good expansion in these heretofore unworked or little-covered sections.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark224"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>PRINTING AT THE BROOKLYN PLANT</span></h2>
<div><img src="yb1959_E_files/yb1959_E-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:137pt;height:178pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Never has the printing plant of the Society in Brooklyn been so busy as it has been during the 1958 service year. One cannot help but recall that about forty years ago the Society started its own printing in Brooklyn, then using a small three-floor building that no longer exists, but because of the need of spreading the good news of the Kingdom in printed form the factories of the Society have now grown to two large buildings, each covering a city block, one of them rising nine stories in height and the other thirteen stories, a beautiful sight between two of the principal bridges connecting Brooklyn with Manhattan. Outstanding in production during the year was the increased printing of magazines. It was necessary to print 18,452,000 more magazines than during the previous year. A number of the Society’s presses had to work nights in order to meet this increased demand in distribution, and at the close of the year two new presses were being delivered. The picture to the right shows a huge derrick bringing in a large part of the press and lifting it into the opening on the sixth floor. With these new high-speed web rotary presses the Society hopes to be able to keep up with the demand for magazines, books and booklets for the coming year. The Society now has thirteen large rotary presses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been a real joy to produce Bibles, books and booklets in greater numbers than ever</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7">before. Many of</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">these were needed for the Divine Will International</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Assembly of Jehovah's Witnesses. The brothers at Bethel are happy that they can work on Bibles, especially the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font7"> and they rejoiced particularly at the statement in the Resolution that Jehovah’s witnesses around the world have accepted, namely: ‘‘That we deplore the fact that the inspired written Word of the Universal Sovereign is ignored due to the delinquency of the religious leaders of Christendom.” The Bethel family is very happy that they can print a book that discloses the true name of their God and also print other literature that magnifies His name. So as to have some comparison of what has been done in the Brooklyn printing plant during the past three years, the following report is set out.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The publications listed above were produced in sixty-one different languages. To do the printing during the 1958 service year the Society consumed 7,709 tons of paper, also manufactured and used 188,099 pounds of ink. Many other supplies were brought into the plant to make the covers and to bind the books, and all of this work was done by ordained ministers who spend their weekends and evenings preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. The majority of the Bethel family are also used to go out Sundays serving congregations, speaking to the brothers in their Kingdom Halls and leading them out in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brother Knorr, the president of the Society, visits Branches throughout the world regularly, and this year it was our pleasure to have him visit the printing plant in Brooklyn and give it a very thorough check. During the months of December and January he was able to thoroughly look into the office routine, factory production, and help to better organize and co-ordinate the activities in the tremendous printing plant of the Society here in Brooklyn. I feel sure that I can speak for the 499 members of the Bethel family who have found their place in the New World society at Brooklyn in saying that we are happy to hold our place by always having plenty to do in connection with Jehovah and his service. We want to do our work faithfully as to Jehovah and supply our fellow workers, our brothers, world-wide with the things they need in printed form; and, additionally, we are happy that we can serve in the field. We look forward to the new year and we will go on in our victory march as integrity walkers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORTS ON TERRITORIES UNDER THE UNITED STATES BRANCH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are a number of isolated territories too small to establish a Branch and too far distant from other Branches to have them take supervision; so these are handled directly by the Brooklyn office. It is encouraging to see how the work has been progressing in all of these countries, and by consulting the chart one will be able to see the increase. What follows under the heading of the territory are experiences.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>ALASKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The past service year has been one of slow, steady growth. Of course, the outstanding feature of the year was the Divine Will International Assembly at New York. Over one hundred were able to go from Alaska and the benefits should be reflected in the coming service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The most immediately noticeable benefit was the way the publicity opened up the opportunity to witness to people who would otherwise not have taken time to listen. The TV, radio, and newspaper publicity really aroused the interest and curiosity of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One sign of progress was the new Kingdom Hall in Fairbanks. A government surplus building was purchased and moved to a lot the congregation owned. This entailed renting jackhammers and a compressor to free the building from the frozen ground. It was immediately used for the circuit assembly. This required much hard work on the part of the brothers.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark228"></a><span class="font7">That young people can take a firm stand for the truth was demonstrated during the year in the experience of a family of isolated publishers who make use of every opportunity to witness. A seventeen-year-old boy to whom they witnessed was not much interested until the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> convinced him that it was the truth. Immediately he grasped the truth and recognized the need of study. Within a few months he obtained permission to move to town to be with the congregation. Within one week in town he had a job and a place to stay and has since taken advantage of meetings and the training program and expects to be baptized at the next circuit assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>BERMUDA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">What refreshment we had at the Divine Will International Assembly! How keen our anticipation was for the good things there can be gauged by our large party of thirty-six delegates, more than our peak of publishers has ever been. For many it was their first journey out of the island and half of the brothers had never attended a congregational meeting with an attendance of more than about fifty. The six brothers there baptized formed the largest group from here ever to be immersed at one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We had two more “firsts” last year. As reported at the New York assembly, we held our first marriage talk at the Kingdom Hall, and it was also our first success in the field of marriage at helping someone straighten out a tangled moral condition. Then we got our first radio time as a result of the brothers’ being alive to seize an opportunity to supply a speaker for a local club’s weekly broadcast. This was reported in the following day’s press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young man had been in contact with brothers for more than a year but appeared to have just an idle curiosity as far as the Bible was concerned. His interest was in politics and he was associated with a small group of young radicals. As a result of a brother’s patient answering of his questions over a long period of time a Bible study was started. Shortly after this he told the witness that the political group had dissolved; that he saw in it the breeding ground for hate and violence; that, as it had ever been his ambition to help others, he now saw how he could be of assistance in a real and lasting way by telling them of the good news of God’s kingdom. Wanting now to progress as fast as possible in the knowledge of God’s purposes, he asked to have three studies a week. Two weeks later he was out preaching in Sunday morning house-to-house service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark230"></a>ERITREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This year we were pleased to have authorization from the Society to translate and mimeograph </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in Tigrinya, the language of our people in this country. What a wonderful aid it has proved to be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Until this service year almost all our efforts of service had been centered in Asmara, but there were hundreds of thousands of inhabitants living in small villages throughout the interior. This year special pioneers were sent out to reach some of these scattered sheep and it is largely due to their good work that we now have four congregations in the country rather than the single congregation that we had at the beginning of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As it is true in most of the Eastern world beggars are often seen on the streets of Asmara, and for the most part they are a selfish lot of social parasites who would prefer to beg than to do an honest day’s work. Therefore, we did not expect to find any of their number who would take the truth seriously. A little over a year ago, however, one of these ragged, blind beggars found his way into our Kingdom Hall and sat quietly through the meeting. As the weeks and months passed it became a familiar sound to hear his cane bumping on the street outside as he found his way to the door. Months have passed and at this writing this former ragged, dirty beggar is now a clean, well-shaven, well-dressed respectable citizen preaching the gospel in one of the interior villages where the need is great. His little boy, who used to lead him while begging, now leads his sightless father from house to house, on back-calls and on his Bible studies. This blind brother has brought us many joys but I believe one of the greatest was the time he was led to the front of the Kingdom Hall for his student talk. He gave one of the most spirited student talks I think I have ever heard, quoting scriptures word for word and giving book, chapter and verse to back up his arguments. If our blind brother can do this, certainly our sisters should not hesitate to take part in the new school arrangement that calls for them to participate by giving student sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We cannot close this report without saying how very grateful we are to Jehovah, to the Society, and to our wonderful brothers throughout the world who contributed and made it possible for two of us from this northern Ethiopian territory to attend the Divine Will assembly of Jehovah’s people in New York. We hope to show our gratitude by another year of increase during the new service year in our assignment of Eritrea.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark231"></a>GUAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">To show the pressure that can be put on people who want to learn the truth, we would like you to know what happened to one native family. The interest started with a young seventeen-year-old girl. Through her the whole family began to study. Interest was growing fast and the young daughter started in the service. At one of the last confessions she attended she told the priest she was studying the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. He forbade her to study. Later a nun took her Bible and books when she was not home. The daughter had the courage to go to the nun and demand her Bible and literature back. It was given back. Then her brother came home on a military furlough and demanded that the whole family stay Roman Catholic and quit disgracing the family by studying the Bible. He took the literature back to the publisher who was conducting the study. Everyone quit under all of his threats. Finally the daughter left home to live with someone else. She then came to the publisher’s home and asked for her literature back and for a Bible study to be held with her, because she knew enough of the truth and it bothered her conscience. Also, she asked to have someone visit her sister who is interested and has already taken her children out of parochial school. This shows we must be patient and demonstrate much love to Jehovah’s sheep as we help them battle for their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Four delegates from Guam attended the Divine Will assembly. We want to thank our brothers who made this trip possible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark232"></a>ICELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">What a wonderful year! It brought a series of high lights, culminating with the big international assembly in New York, where five delegates from Iceland had the grand privilege to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But the joys began long before that, already in the beginning of the service year, when we had the film “The Happiness of the New World Society” here. We showed it six times to a combined audience of 391; and though these numbers are relatively small compared with some other audiences from other places, it is really fine for Iceland. We were able to use a fine hall for showing the film and since then we have used it as our Kingdom Hall. The next great step was having, for the first time, a native Icelandic brother give a public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The magazine work is going on well, and the good examples set by the special pioneers and the other mature brothers are followed up well by the newer ones. The widow you have read of the other years is still going strong as a real champion of this work. Furthermore, her children are closely following in her footsteps. Three of them, aged respectively eleven, thirteen and sixteen, are now dedicated, baptized and regular publishers, and in April all of them made their quota for the magazines, and as a small family group these four, the sister and the children, averaged sixty-six magazines, while the congregation as a whole just made the quota, with thirty-one on the average. However, the special pioneers did not lag behind, but averaged 286 magazines for this particular month.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>SOMALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Last year the Society reported one of Jehovah’s witnesses working in Somalia for a period of time and meeting with good success, but the Catholic Church began warning its flock against the work of Jehovah’s witnesses and tried to discourage the people from listening to the missionary. He was able to work for two more months and made fine progress, placed much literature and conducted seven Bible studies. His permission to stay in the country expired and he moved on to another land. However, during the period of time that he was there seed was planted, people heard the truth, a considerable amount of literature was scattered in the territory, and if it be Jehovah’s will some of this seed will sprout and publishers will come forth to praise the name of Jehovah. One never knows what will happen, but we can feel sure of this, that before the battle of Armageddon those who love truth and righteousness will be gathered together into Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark234"></a>ARGENTINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in this country have real cause for rejoicing. They have seen Jehovah’s blessing on their work. They have shared in the great ingathering of the other sheep and they are able to cry out: “And in that day you will certainly say: ‘Laud Jehovah, you people! Call upon his name. Make known among the peoples his dealings. Make mention that his name is to be put on high. Make melody to Jehovah, for he has done surpassingly. This is to be made known in all the earth.’ ” (Isa. 12:4, 5) So regardless of opposition on the part of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy Jehovah’s witnesses go right ahead preaching the good news. Although applications have been made for recognition of true religion, as yet the government has not given permission for Jehovah’s witnesses to meet together freely. But nothing will stop the free course of the good news, as the report from the Branch servant shows. Here are some excerpts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Making melody to Jehovah has not been considered as such by those shepherds who have not shepherded the flock of God but have identified themselves as of this old world system of things. Much has been said in the smaller-town newspapers where special pioneers are working. Just two of Jehovah’s witnesses telling the good news causes the powerful Catholic Church to rise up in cold war against us. They have published article after article in their Catholic-run newspapers, saying that the people should not listen to the Protestants that go from door to door with a message against the doctrines of the mother church. They have told the people not to listen to us or receive our literature. They have learned that it is best not to identify these Protestants as Jehovah’s witnesses, because in many cases this has helped to place more literature, and the people want to listen to us. The same is true with the name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">La Atalaya.</span><span class="font7"> In one place where the Catholic newspaper published an article against the special pioneers and said that the people should not read </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font7"> the special pioneers, thanks to this article, placed four books and started two studies with two of these sincere Catholic people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vacation pioneering was enjoyed by 567 publishers during the year. In one month there were eighty-five, fourteen of them from one congregation. In reporting their experiences these publishers wish to encourage every publisher to be a vacation pioneer at least once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes we hear the complaint: “Why did I not learn about the truth years ago?” Yes, I am sure that you have heard this same thing. A woman eighty-four years old said this to the sister who had just placed the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> with her. The woman had been abandoned, living by herself without any hope of better conditions because she could see no relief from her woes and troubles. When she heard of the hope that God holds out for us, a change took place. Her eyes lit up and her indifference turned to a desire to know more. “I returned a few days later,” says the publisher, “and upon arriving at the house thought I had made a mistake. I found things changed; everything was clean and the woman was ready to study.” Learning the Bible truths brought her a hope and renewed enthusiasm as she learned that she was not alone in this world. Her progress in the truth is fast. What she had learned in the first visit she started telling her neighbor, and now she too is enjoying the study with the good-will lady. This woman now says: “Just to think that a short time ago I prayed to God to let me die because life meant nothing to me; I had no family, I could not work and am old. Now I pray to Jehovah my God to thank him that I have been able to live to this day and learn of him, and I want to continue living to learn more about him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On a visit of a publisher to a home a sermon was started, and the householder took the Bible out of a trunk where it had been for a long time and cleaned off the dust. The sermon was finished in this now-clean Bible, resulting in the placing of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth.”</span><span class="font7"> So great was the interest that a study was started at once in the just-placed book and proof was taken from the once dust-covered Bible. The lady said: &quot;How happy I am to be able to talk with someone about the Bible! I like the Bible so much, but I had to stop talking about it because the neighbors all laughed at me. It was then that I put the Bible in the trunk. Never again will I let it get covered with dust.” She now talks to her neighbors and is studying with one of them. Her husband became interested and in just two months husband and wife were publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A good-will slip from the Society was received bearing the address of a hospital. “I found the person,” says the publisher, “in a fairly healthy condition. I placed some literature. The following day, a Sunday, I returned to have a study with him. He had already talked to another person, so there were two at the study of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> The following Thursday we started a study with the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font7"> The next Sunday, in just a week’s time, this person accompanied me in the field service. Just as soon as possible he wants to be baptized. He has interested four more in the hospital in the truth. Every Sunday afternoon we now have the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study with five persons present, and on Thursdays the book study. The meeting place is the hospital.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There were ninety-four brothers from Argentina that were able to attend the Divine Will International Assembly. Not only these ninety-four but all the brothers from Argentina want to take this opportunity to express their thanks to Jehovah through the Society for the many helps received and to say that we are determined to put them all to good use as soon as possible.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>AUSTRALIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The work continues to move along wonderfully, with all dedicated publishers trying to do the divine will. Jehovah’s witnesses are grateful that “he gave . . . some as missionaries, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work.” (Eph. 4:11, 12) It is because of the brothers’ having proper appreciation of Jehovah’s theocratic arrangement that excellent advancement has been made in this land and the islands of the South Pacific. Truly in this great area where the witness is being given there has been a great need for missionaries, for shepherds and teachers, and many have had to be trained, as the report will show. The Branch servant residing in Australia has twelve territories to report on this year, and it makes our hearts glad to see work being done where the need is great. We feel sure that many reading these experiences will in time join their brothers in new territories, pushing ahead with the great expansion work that Jehovah would have his people do at this time. Excerpts from the numerous reports on the islands of the sea are included here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The major factor contributing to the increase has been the great upswing in number of Bible studies. At the time of preparing this report they exceed eight thousand a month and are climbing steadily. The brothers are becoming much more confident in their approach, as can be seen by the following: “A lady who showed interest when I presented my Kingdom theme accepted the book-and-booklet offer and arrangements were made to call back. This we did, but she told us that her husband did not want the study to continue. I arranged to call back one evening when the husband would be home. I arrived to find both the husband and wife and the four children at home with the large family Bible in the center of the table. Numerous questions were answered, with the husband showing good interest. The reason for his change was that he was so impressed by the fact that I arranged to come back and see him as well as his wife that he decided to listen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Like myriads of droplets of rain the individual copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> continue to drench the country with the truth. An experience from school illustrates both the power of the magazines and the work of our youthful publishers. A young sister gave a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> dealing with the St. Lawrence Seaway project to her teacher. The class had discussed the project earlier in the week. The teacher read the article to the class. She then gave it to a male teacher, who also read it. Then all the teachers from grades three to seven read it. That same week they discussed Ghana, and upon learning that </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> also published an article on this subject the teacher read it. After this she read it over the air to grades six and seven. At the end of the year at the annual school fete two cartons of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font7">and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> were placed like hot cakes with the students for the usual contribution of five pence each. The teacher took a dozen copies herself and accepted an invitation to the circuit assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">People are now seen flocking to the organization from all walks of life. Since the end of World War II over one million immigrants have come to Australia, and one of these, a German brother who spoke little English, found employment as a steward at an agricultural college. One of the students desiring to learn German asked if he would assist him, and to this the brother agreed. For his language textbook the brother chose the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“The Truth Shall Make You Free”</span><span class="font7"> in German. Soon this intelligent young man, who came from one of the most prominent families in the state, became extremely interested. He began to witness to many of his classmates and entered into lengthy debates. Finally he fully accepted the truth and was baptized. From this point on the opposition of his parents intensified until he was told he must make his choice between Jehovah’s witnesses and his inheritance, which he was to share with his sister. After attending university for another year he wrote the Society: &quot;I have used the last year to do private research as well as the university curriculum and even more importantly I have used the time to reconsider carefully my dedication in order to make sure of all things—to do as Paul said, ‘examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith.’ I had to appreciate what I was giving up. Having reaffirmed to myself that I fully believed what Jehovah’s witnesses taught and why, I then carefully planned my departure from my parents.” Immediately on leaving school he joined the pioneer ranks and is now on the way toward attending the school of Gilead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A woman who had a nervous breakdown and who almost took her life unknowingly accompanied her husband to see the doctor. After a thorough examination the doctor explained that all the medicine in the world would not do her any good. He then walked over to his bookcase and took down the Bible and explained that It was the only cure for her nerves. He said she should read a chapter every day and he then sat down and demonstrated by reading two chapters to her. He told her that no priest or clergyman could help her, but only Jehovah’s witnesses. What a surprise! Her sister-in-law was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. A study was started immediately using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Good News of the Kingdom,” </span><span class="font7">and in six weeks’ time she had made such remarkable progress physically that the neighborhood was amazed. She now looks forward to being one of the Lord’s &quot;other sheep” in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In keeping with the persistent and regular call to serve where the need is great not only have we kept before the brothers the need overseas but also the desirable results of a better distribution of publishers throughout Australia. As a result many have moved from Western Australia, where the publisher-per-popu-lation ratio is about one for every 350, to the more thickly populated sections of the country in the east. Last year we were happy to report that twenty-two publishers had moved to the islands, but this figure was doubled this year, with forty-three moving at great expense and sacrifice to Papua, New Caledonia, Fiji, New Guinea and Norfolk Island. The need is still very great in the many islands of the South Pacific. Expressions and letters from those who are serving there clearly indicate that they are having a wonderful time. The brothers in the islands are delighted with Brother Knorr’s arrangement to open a Branch office in Fiji, September 1, 1958, to care for this rapidly expanding field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are indebted to Jehovah and his organization for the arrangements that made it possible for so many from this country to attend the Divine Will assembly in New York. This convention has given us an enriched vision of our work and the continued need for training and greater efficiency in the ministry.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark236"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark237"></a>AMERICAN SAMOA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One sister, the wife of a chief, has been very active and has received much criticism from other high-ranking individuals. She decided to send formal invitations to all she could think of to attend the district assembly. These invitations she graciously worded and carefully prepared in neat envelopes and then had her husband, who is not a publisher, deliver them to the different persons. This was a shock to the chiefs, so they called a special meeting to discuss the matter. One of them got up in the meeting with this to say: “Here we have all been showing hate to Jehovah’s witnesses, and what do they do? No matter what our religion is they are the only ones who show real Christian love by inviting us all to come to their meeting. This is very difficult to understand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Naturally, a matter of greatest importance and that was attention-holding during the year was preparation for and attendance at the Divine Will world assembly. One brother, a congregation publisher, when he heard in December, 1956, of the convention, started immediately to make plans to attend. Although his wages were not very high compared with living cost, by careful planning and co-operation of the entire family he was able to save enough to pay all his expenses. Even some superiors and associates in his secular work, though not agreeing with his religion, aided all they could in encouraging him to attend and in getting his vacation and documents arranged so that he could do so. One man even gave him a good suit. Four others from this land were privileged to attend the assembly, including two missionaries who have served here since February, 1955.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On his way home from the New York convention it was possible for the Branch servant to spend three days with the brothers in American Samoa, visiting different parts of the island, working with the brothers in the field and relating information from the Divine Will assembly. During this visit four more were baptized, including a Samoan chief. This man clearly demonstrated his love for the truth a few weeks previously at the funeral of one of his sons killed in an accident. While the family wanted the local native pastor to conduct the service together with all the ceremony usually attached to such an event, the Samoan chief stood firm and said that he wanted his missionary, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, to take the service. The only part in the service the native pastor was permitted was to introduce the brother, who then gave a fine witness about the state of the dead and the hope of the resurrection.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark238"></a>FIJI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During December at the three-day district assembly the zone servant stressed that all the brothers learn the Fijian language. Two months later, in February, language classes were started in all congregations, with not only European but also Indian and Fijian brothers attending. Later in the year a new simplified ministry school was introduced in which provision is made for all students to speak and read Fijian. Regular public talks in Fijian are now being held as well as incorporating Fijian into the service meetings. Jehovah’s blessing on this move to reach the Fijian people in their own language has been seen in the fact that Fijian public talks are now better attended than those in English. During the circuit assembly held in Suva in August, nine of the thirteen baptized were Fijian-speaking brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Reaching the Fijians in the unassigned territory has its share of blessings. A brother returned to a large Fijian village where interest was found before. In keeping with the custom the brother approached the chief to get permission to call at houses in this village. The chief instead asked him to wait until eight that night when he would call all the men of the village to his home to listen. At the gathering were three ministers and three lay preachers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When he left the village, the chief asked him to return the next Sunday to preach in the church when three villages would be present. The next Sunday more than two hundred and fifty people crowded the church to overflowing. At the conclusion, before our own chairman could stand up and thank the audience for their attention, the chief rose and said to them all: “What you have just heard is the truth. This is what you should all follow.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark239"></a>NEW BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This territory was first opened up in 1956 when two Australian brothers arrived to serve where the need was great. Now there is a total of thirteen Australians, including two special pioneers, witnessing on the island. Another congregation was organized during the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much time was spent in aiding the native publishers to prepare their house-to-house and back-call sermons. At the close of the year we are happy to report that several publishers are capable of delivering the sermons alone, while others have made good progress in this direction. One of the congregation servants, explaining how the brothers are taught their sermons, writes: “Few have any conception of reading. We draw pictures on a blackboard of all the parts of a sermon, step by step, and weave the story around the pictures. It takes them about a month to know the sermon thoroughly. They must be able to give it in pidgin and also in their own language; then we go on to the next sermon. They love getting up In front of the others and giving their sermons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher relates the following experience: “The importance of thorough coverage of our territory was further brought home to us when we hesitated to return to a European house where the housewife had not been interested the previous time we called. However, we decided to try again, with the result that a different woman came to the door and invited us in. We answered her many questions for one hour and a half and finally placed the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True’</span><span class="font7"> with her. When we suggested we call again next week she readily agreed, remarking that she would try to interest her husband also. She has been studying regularly now for several weeks, making no effort to hide from her friends and neighbors the fact that she is studying with Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark108"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>NEW CALEDONIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Just prior to the circuit servant’s visit in May we received a letter from the government telling us to bring copies of all our books into the office to be checked by the censor. The official concerned gave permission to distribute all our publications in the territory. Taking advantage of his kindness, we asked for permission to give public talks. This, too, he granted. When the circuit servant arrived, the same official had to be approached for approval to show the New World Society in Action film publicly; permission being granted made it possible to show the film publicly for the first time in New Caledonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next thing was to find a place for screening. After much searching we were offered the use of a brick factory for one weekend, rent free. Upon further investigation we were able to hire for two nights one of the biggest theaters in town. All avenues of advertising were used and the film was shown to a total attendance of 690 on the two nights. Forty-four books, three hundred booklets and two subscriptions were placed at the showings. Many people expressed admiration for the wonderful things done by the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magazine work has become a very popular feature of theocratic activity. Thursday has been made a special day for children, as they have no school on Thursday but are at school on Saturday, the regular Magazine Day. One sister of sixty-eight, hardly able to read because of failing eyesight, goes out in the field service regularly every Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, placing up to twenty-two magazines each morning. The service year started with the placing of eighty magazines the first month, and ended in August with a distribution of 815 for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One big problem here has been how to contact the native population. According to law white men have no right to enter the native villages and call on the people. Many efforts have been made to establish contact with the natives outside their tribes, but without result. But recently a young native man has been contacted and a study started with him. He explained that his father, already over seventy years of age, was one of the first Protestant native missionaries to work here. He stayed always faithful through the years, but noticed the change in the church. He started being a little outspoken about this change, with the result that his white bosses dismissed him. He ceased to associate with the church and reared his children on his thoughts of what is the right religion. A visit to this man some six hours’ drive from the capital was well repaid by seeing his eyes shine with the knowledge that the truth had at last reached him. So it seems that in this young native man and his father we have at last found a way of opening the door to the native population.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark110"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark241"></a>NEW GUINEA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Many so-called Christian missions have been established here for years. But as a farmer divides off his field for planting various kinds of seed, so much of this territory has been divided among the various orthodox missions with what is called a “gentleman’s agreement” not to trespass on one another’s assigned section. The poor native is forced to accept the religion of whatever division of the field in which he happens to find himself, whether it be Catholic or one of the many varieties of Protestantism. But there are Jehovah’s “sheep” in all these territories and to all of them faithful witnesses must go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is good to see the changes that a knowledge of the truth produces as some of these natives begin taking ornamental bones from their noses, giving up their beetle-nut chewing, and dressing in clothing suitable to members of the New World society. Many of these newly interested natives have been brought down from distant mountain villages, where as yet the white man has scarcely set his foot. The publishers have particularly concentrated on these interested natives, for as soon as their work contracts run out they will go back to their mountain villages carrying to their heathen relatives and friends a knowledge of Jehovah’s established kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark242"></a>NEW HEBRIDES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Transport is a problem because the island is mainly jungle with copra plantations dotted all over it. We planned to witness to all the native workers at some of these plantations, so one Sunday back in April a taxi was hired for the day and one of the plantations called Sorrento was visited. We went to the chief and explained that we were missionaries and would like to call on all the huts in his village and talk to the people. The chief had a better idea. “Why not talk long all people one time,” he said, and then set about arranging the seating accommodation. Fifteen minutes later, with the whole village in attendance, a public talk was given, the theme being “Knowledge of the True God Jehovah Means Life.” How they liked to learn the truth! They exhausted our entire supply of literature. We promised to return a month later to help further, and thought that we might start some Bible studies, but what a shock we received. On our next visit exactly one month later we found a great crowd assembled with a speaker in front addressing them. Immediately we thought that the “birds” had gotten in. Afterward we found that these people were so interested that they had invited their friends from the next plantation to come and many were present that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The white population will not mix in with the natives and they treat them harshly, so when natives see white people come into their homes to teach them the truth of the Bible they are immediately impressed. Among some of the things that impress them are pictures such as the one on page 21 of the 1953 Assembly Report. It shows a colored brother baptizing a white brother. Things like that have never been known in the Hebrides before, and it presses home the point that there is no class distinction in the New World society.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark243"></a>NEW IRELAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The result of the confusion of the languages can be seen very easily here. Almost every village, even though it may be no more than two miles from its neighbor, has its own language. Fortunately this barrier is overcome by speaking pidgin to all natives and to many of the Chinese who do not understand English. The government and various missions have taught some of the natives to read and write, but for the most part they are illiterate. A number of the more prominent religions are represented in New Ireland, but it is evident that their commercial interest far exceeds their spiritual interest. As far as can be seen, they have made little attempt to change the natives from their superstitious ways. The policy of the administration was to allot one village to the Catholic mission, the next to the Methodist, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">House-to-house witnessing was not recommended by the Society at first, so the question was how to witness. This was solved by inviting persons to their home and then witnessing incidentally. If any interest was manifested, a back-call was arranged by inviting the person back again.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark123"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark244"></a>PAPUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It was a great joy to many of the brothers this year to receive </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> printed in their native tongue, Motu. Now the studies are really appreciated by the brothers reading that language. This is shown by the many more participating in answering questions, by better field service and more maturity generally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several of the local congregations have built their own native Kingdom Halls in the various villages. One congregation went a step farther and constructed a fine three-room native house for the European witnesses to occupy when they come out weekends to help them. Since the Divine Will assembly the native brothers appreciate that they must all learn to read and write as quickly as possible, so undoubtedly this new native home will be used more than ever by the European brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer who spoke a native language fluently was moved into a distant isolated area. He built a house on property whose owner assured him he would not have to leave. The prominent pastor of this district did not speak the native tongue. When he discovered that Jehovah’s witnesses were living and working in his territory he was quick to visit them and to warn them that the natives did not like nor want witnesses in the district. Pressure was soon brought to bear on the owner of the property on which the brother had built his house. The brother was given orders to leave almost immediately. But during the short time they had been there the pioneer and his wife had endeared themselves to the natives of many villages. What a help it had been knowing the native tongue! On learning of the movement to have the pioneers put out of the community the natives were most indignant. They loved the pioneer family; they needed much spiritual help and felt they must not let them go. These natives themselves then located property for the erecting of the house. From two of the villages came the natives; in short order they had taken the house down and moved the material to the new location; in another few days the house was again erected and the pioneer family was living happily in it. Studies continued with the natives, who are maturing quickly, and the prospects are that before long a congregation will be formed here.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark132"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark245"></a>ROTUMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are quite a few problems to overcome with the people, the main one being immorality and superstition. Immorality is allowed to continue by the government to such an extent that more than half the births are illegitimate and legal divorce is rarely resorted to. If a person, husband or wife, becomes tired of the legal mate, he merely chooses someone else without even seeking to divorce the other, even though he may have legal rights for doing so. Fear of the dead and of evil spirits, which frequently possess people, causes many to resort to the use of mediums in order to drive out such demons. Also, the practice of voodooism in cases of illness very often results in the death of the victim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ships to and from Rotuma run only about once every six weeks, so the circuit servant spends the time between ships with the brothers, who long for theocratic association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers have been very diligent in the back-call and Bible study features of the work and the publishers grew in number from four to nine during the year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark150"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark246"></a>SOLOMON ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Happily, both government and police officials are becoming tolerant toward the people of the New World society as they realize that our brothers are not troublemakers or Communists, but to the best of their ability are clean-living, diligent, enterprising men and women who, while endeavoring to give “Caesar” his due, are exclusively dedicated to the service of the Supreme Sovereign and his world-conquering King, Christ Jesus. —Ps. 2:7-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant was mildly surprised when, on his arrival, he was received openly and thereafter was not hounded by police as was his predecessor, but was well received by all with whom he had contact or business. On one occasion during the visit, after five days’ walking through rugged country in torrential downpours, the circuit servant, footsore and soaked, gave an address to sixty-seven adult persons, four of whom symbolized their dedication.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark247"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark248"></a>WESTERN SAMOA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Funerals always call for a lot of speech-making, singing and feasting. One of the old brothers was dying and even though his family and village pastor were pleading with him, he would not denounce the truth. His family did not respect his wish that one of Jehovah’s witnesses should bury him. However, one of the brothers was in the house when the service started, and he was allowed to speak for just a few minutes. Being prepared, he proceeded to develop his discourse on the subject of death, proving from the Bible that the dead are not in heaven as a previous speaker had asserted. The 400 or so people present listened attentively to his half-hour talk, at the conclusion of which the minister conducting the service agreed with our brother that this man had not gone to heaven. This testifies to the power of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At another funeral where permission to speak had been given the brother declined, as the service was held in a church. At the graveside the opportunity was taken and, standing on top of the pile of freshly dug earth, the brother clearly and forcefully expounded the Scriptures to give a powerful and fitting witness to the condition of the dead. An old retired minister, who had hated the Bible truth on this subject, later thanked our brother, shook his hand, and said how pleased he was at the excellent discourse given. So funerals can also serve as places for giving the Kingdom witness about the hope for the dead.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark249"></a>AUSTRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in this war-torn land have come to know God, “whose will is that all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) A splendid witness has been given concerning the divine will throughout Austria. Ninety of the brothers and sisters of that land were delighted that they could attend the international assembly in New York, and then relate their experiences to 7,019 gathered at the Divine Will district assembly in Austria. To the cities, to the valleys, to the mountains the publishers go to all kinds of men, preaching the good news and gathering in the other sheep. The Branch servant relates some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two special pioneers were very happy when soon in their mountainous territory ten Catholics with whom they studied took a firm stand for the truth and wanted to leave the Catholic Church. To do this the authorities require the Catholic certificate of baptism. One man of good will went to the parson to get these for all of them. He explained: “We have now become acquainted with the Bible and find that the Catholic Church has taken much away from it and added much to it. Therefore we do not want to have anything to do with this church any more.” The parson did not give him the certificates, but demanded that all ten should come. So they visited him accompanied by the special pioneers. “You have not been invited,” the parson said to the pioneers, and asked them to go at once. But they stayed, and a long discussion followed. Among other things the parson said: “There is something in the Bible about false prophets.” “Yes,” replied one pioneer brother, “and it gives also their characteristics.” Then the brother read from 1 Timothy 4, verses one and two. When the parson heard the words “some will fall away from the faith” he jumped from his chair with joy. “Where is this in the Bible?” he asked. “I will mark it in my Bible and read it from the pulpit on Sunday.” But the brother said: “The apostle Paul also describes the characteristics of the false prophets.” And he read verse three: “forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving.” The parson was flabbergasted and beaten. He said: “This is not in our Bible.” But after a little while he said: “Maybe it is also in our Bible,” and he went to bring his Bible, and it said exactly the same. Then he turned to our new sheep, who had listened attentively. “What do you say?” One after the other stood up: “You could not prove anything.” “I have enough.” &quot;Give us our certificates.” Such were the words the parson had to hear, and the foundation of our congregation was laid. There are now twenty publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now an experience of how some other kinds of men came to an accurate knowledge of truth by the help of a faithful publisher: A nice Protestant family had a Bible study with a brother. After some time he found out that the couple was not married, so he explained to them God’s principle on this point. The couple decided to do Jehovah’s will and to get married, but to leave the Protestant Church first. The woman knew the pastor very well, and when asked why they were leaving the church, she said: “Because you have never taken care of our salvation.” Surprised, the pastor asked how she could say that. So she replied that he had personally accepted their church tax all the time without ever saying a word to let them know that their life was not in harmony with God’s requirements and their concubinage was not recognized by God as a marriage. &quot;But Jehovah’s witnesses,” the woman said, “have explained all this, and they would not accept us unless we legalize our marriage.” The pastor wanted to talk to our brother, so he was invited. At the beginning of the discussion the pastor asked haughtily what worldly studies the brother had, so that he would know “on what level” he could converse with him. After a long discussion, in which the pastor was not at all able to confirm his assertions with the Bible, he admitted his ignorance openly in front of the family. This convinced them all the more that they were on the right way now.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark250"></a>BAHAMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It has been a busy year for the brothers in the Bahamas, with the zone servant’s visit, the building of a new Branch office, the preparation to come to the great assembly in New York and at the same time looking after all the Kingdom interests in the territory. But the brothers rejoiced and had in mind that they must “keep testing whether you are in the faith, keep proving what you yourselves are.” (2 Cor. 13:5) Working in the islands that make up the Bahamas group brings very outstanding experiences. It is hard going at times, but it brings its rewards. One very interesting experience is set out here from the report of the Branch servant. Incidentally, of the 160 publishers who are now working in the Bahamas eighty managed to get to the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our circuit servant reports on his visit to one of the Out Islands where two vacation pioneers were serving. They also came in to Nassau for the assembly. He says: “Right after Brother Adams’ visit we took a two-day voyage by the mailboat to Long Cay. It was night when we landed so we then walked across the island, thus avoiding the heat of the day, taking with us the movie projector, the screen, our baggage and a 125-pound generator. While we rested in a little broken-down warehouse by the dock on the other side, we let some green twigs and coconut hulls smolder inside to keep out the million mosquitoes that sought our company and our blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“At daylight we loaded our equipment into a dinghy and sculled out to a small sailboat, which we boarded, and set sail for Acklins. A mile or two offshore the wind dropped and we were becalmed. Taking advantage of this, we witnessed to the captain and the other two passengers while the tropic sun beat down. The boat had an auxiliary engine but it was out of order, so we offered to try to fix it. An hour or two later it spluttered to life, breaking the quiet of the becalmed sea, and we were moving again. The captain was so pleased that he refused to accept any payment for our passage. That night we sighted Acklins but could not land, as someone had forgotten to light the oil lamp on the beach marker. In the morning the weather had changed and the sea was heavy, making the landing of our equipment very difficult. By that night, with the welcome aid of a wheelbarrow on shore, we were all settled in the house we would be using. Next day half the island knew we were there and that a movie would be shown in the school. How they enjoyed ‘The Happiness of the New World Society’! For many this was the first electric light they had ever seen, let alone a movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Busy days were spent transporting things to other settlements, usually by boat, as roads are few and poor. One brother walked twenty-seven miles to arrange for a boat. Almost everyone would turn out to see the film, some even traveling with us to other settlements so that they could see it again. One teacher offered us the use of the schoolroom and instructed the children, as he gave them handbills advertising the show, to be there and take careful note of what they would see, for the next day he would get them to write an essay on what they saw. All were very impressed, including the parents and other persons in attendance, and many expressed the desire for us to be able to stay longer and teach them more. Several studies were started. The vacation pioneers plan to return to this island and continue their activity just as soon as they are able. The need for more pioneers in the Bahamas is great.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark251"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark252"></a>BELGIUM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">This small country in Europe is an important one and the nine million people who live there, speaking two different languages, Flemish and French, need attention and need to hear the good news just like everyone else throughout the world. It was a joy to have 121 delegates from Belgium at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York, and they took back with them the spirit of the Assembly, which has been felt throughout the whole nation. While the work has increased excellently during the past twelve months, we are looking to 1959 to be an outstanding year. The experiences that the Branch servant reports illustrate what Luke 8:15 says: “As for that on the right soil, these are the ones that, after hearing the word with a right and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.” The seed has been planted, the good-will persons are growing to maturity, and these experiences show that all must keep planting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the witnesses was hospitalized for a period of time. This did not prevent him from preaching the good news. One day several other witnesses who were preaching in the city where the hospital is located came to pay a visit to the sick brother. They brought him some presents. This manifestation of brotherly love was very much noticed by the other people. They came along and asked the brother many questions. One man got interested in the truth and a study was conducted regularly in the hospital. The interested man would come to his bed almost every evening to receive instruction from the brother. He made contact with the local congregation upon his returning home and is now a zealous publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In doing the divine will and preaching efficiently one has often the opportunity to present little tracts. These accomplish a tremendous work. They are written clearly and are supported with strong Scriptural proof. A sister explained to the office that while she was preaching in the territory of her congregation she met a man who refused everything she offered him—everything but two tracts. She went on a way farther and, having stopped in front of a house, she noticed a car draw up and stop at her side. Who was it? The same man who had received the two tracts. He took out the tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">What Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Believe?</span><span class="font7"> and showed her the last page, where it states that if one wishes further proof he should read the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font7"> The man asked for the book, and arrangements were made for a back-call a week later. At the first back-call, although his time was very limited, it was evident that he had read the book. He ordered the Bible. This man was so thirsty for the truth that he got two subscriptions right away and even wrote to the Branch office to get more literature. A Bible study is now being conducted regularly with him, and the man is progressing very well in the truth. Do you use tracts in your preaching work?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>BOLIVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Unusually good progress has been made by Jehovah’s witnesses in Bolivia and the Branch servant refers to the country as the land of theocratic increases. After many years of rather slow progress it does appear that during the 1958 service year things have really moved along rapidly in finding the other sheep, and they have taken their stand. The thing that all the publishers must have in mind now, especially those who are in overseers’ positions, is the scripture at Hebrews 6:1: “Let us press on to maturity.” There is certainly no need of bringing many persons into an organization and then letting them drop out. They must be preserved for life. The Branch servant gives us some interesting experiences, showing how interested the overseers are in helping the people get this life-giving knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The thoroughness of the circuit servants in working new isolated territory has been a factor in expansion through organizing study groups in the far reaches of our territory. This report by a circuit servant sent in from the tropical section of the Beni illustrates this point: “I spent fifteen days in San Ignacio Instead of a week, as the plane did not get in due to too much rain. However, the time was well spent. Jehovah’s witnesses were talked about from the priest on down to the school children, and, being there two weeks, I was able to defend the truth after false religion made its attack. Now all see that we firmly base our teachings on the Bible alone. Two public talks were given, six studies were started, and a group study was begun in one of the nicest homes in the town. Most of the home Bible studies were held daily so that a goodly number of subjects were covered with the various ones. At one house the man showed much curiosity, and when he found out what organization I represented he directed my attention to a beam in his house where he had chalked on the address of the Branch, and on the inside of the door he had chalked on the title of the book from the handbill he had received some time ago. It was a privilege to speak to this isolated person of good will. With the group study in operation, the group should be well advanced when the circuit servant returns.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Following through with the Society’s suggestion of calling back on placements within a week has proved to be very practical, as a happy publisher from a valley in central Bolivia relates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“My experience with a couple who now have a very deep interest in the Bible began by their taking the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font7"> when I met them at their door. The very next day I called back, and they took a Bible, as the wife had neither seen nor read one before. Within one week they had both read the book, and within four weeks the husband, who was free from secular work at the time, had read the entire Bible. Having been very religious and trained by the Catholic Church to kiss idols and pictures, they have appreciated learning Bible truths that free one from such snares as idol worship and other false teachings. The woman is already witnessing to everyone she meets, after just a few studies. It is a real joy for us to see people like this awaken to the truth and really believe it in their heart, giving them the desire to tell it to others in so short a time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also, it is often worth while to call back even though no literature has been placed if the householder shows interest. From central Bolivia we received this joyful experience: “While working from door to door I met a Catholic woman who, although she listened attentively, refused any literature. Even so, I felt that she had an interest in the truth, so I called back. After several back-calls a study in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom’</span><span class="font7"> was started with her and five of her seven children. They understood the truth well enough but were still bound by tradition to the Catholic religion. Then the circuit servant showed the film ‘The Happiness of the New World Society.’ The six of them went to see it. At the next study they each embraced me and with tears of joy said that they had decided to become Jehovah’s witnesses! That very month all six went out in the service. Soon their images were disposed of and within a month three of them were conducting their own Bible studies. Because of their zeal and regular attendance at meetings, the father began studying too, and soon he was out in the service with the rest of the family. Within seven months the six older members of the family were baptized. Shortly thereafter they moved to southern Bolivia, where they are now zealously working.” Reports from their new location indicate that this entire family is continuing to vindicate the name of Jehovah. The two oldest girls are now vacation pioneering and the father was instrumental in helping the isolated group continue operating efficiently in the absence of the missionaries during the international assembly. Their quickness in obeying Jehovah’s Word and organization has brought them many blessings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark254"></a>BRAZIL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The field in Brazil is white for harvesting and the New World society has enjoyed one of its most prosperous years. There were 145 new congregations formed, and a new peak of publishers totaling 14,458 was reached. No wonder the scripture comes to mind: “Look! I say to you: Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already the reaper is receiving a reward and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.” (John 4:35, 36) It takes real work at harvesttime, but Jehovah’s witnesses in Brazil are willing and ready to prepare themselves for the ingathering and some of the experiences in the annual report from the Branch servant prove this to be very true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much progress has been achieved, not only in covering new territory and in the number of publishers preaching the good news, but also in improving the quality and efficiency of these ministers. Much of the credit for this goes to the reading school that is being conducted by Jehovah’s witnesses in every congregation. There are 1,322 enrolled in the school, which is conducted for two hours every week by an appointed instructor, and it is reported that 532 persons have learned to read and write during the past year. A brother writes the following: “When I first enrolled in the school about one year ago I did not even know the alphabet. Now I can read fluently and write. I use the Bible in giving three- to eight-minute sermons at the doors and also conduct three Bible studies. I am very grateful to Jehovah for this wonderful provision.” Another person writes: “It is a great privilege to me to be able to pick up the Bible and the study aids provided by the Society and read, not only for myself, but also in aiding persons of good will from house to house and at back-calls to learn more about God’s kingdom and the way to life.” A dedicated sister, forty-five years of age, sends in her experience showing how her learning to read and write changed the attitude of her husband, who was opposed to the truth and to her attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall. One day after discovering that she really learned to read and write at the Kingdom Hall, he promised not to interfere with her attending the meetings and marveled at the fact that she learned to read and write at her age. Persons in their sixties and seventies have learned to read and write through the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A group of six missionaries who have worked in an isolated city for two years produced a congregation of fifty publishers. When the missionaries left for another assignment, this congregation did not weaken but progressed rapidly in maturity. In order that they might have a more active part in the special activity during April, thirteen publishers from this congregation, ranging in years from ten to sixty-one, sent in their applications for vacation pioneering. Four from this congregation are now working as special pioneers in isolated territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers that received financial help to attend the Divine Will International Assembly are very grateful for this expression of love on the part of the Society and their brothers in other countries whose contributions made this possible. They have been greatly strengthened and refreshed by the spiritual program of the assembly and are determined to carry on with the work, working harder than ever.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark255"></a>BRITISH GUIANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">During the year seventy-four more individuals freed themselves from this old world by symbolizing their dedication in water, and now they have gone forth preaching the good news of God’s kingdom along with other publishers of the Kingdom. It is grand to see how the oneness of Jehovah’s organization is being developed year by year and national barriers are broken down. Back in 1953 there was one local witness in British Guiana who was able to attend the international assembly held that year. Again in 1955 one was able to get to a large assembly in the United States. But in 1958 all rejoiced that thirty-one were able to make their way from British Guiana to the great gathering of God’s people in New York city. This is having a very stimulating effect on the publishers of the entire country and they expect to have many more experiences like those reported this year from the Branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One man had for years practiced his worship at a church eighty miles from his home, making the journey regularly by train. His family of wife and three daughters shared his beliefs and for many years they celebrated the “Lord’s day,” especially set apart by their religion for the worship of Jesus. One day the man was contacted by one of our Indian brothers. He accepted a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font7"> A few pages were read, a back-call was arranged and a home Bible study started. Bible proof of the supremacy of Jehovah was accepted into a meek heart. Convinced of the error of worshiping Jesus ahead of Jehovah, the man wrote his “pastor” to that effect. The “pastor” took the train posthaste to visit him but could produce no evidence that Jesus and Jehovah were the same person. Later the new witness severed all connection with his former religion by advising the “pastor” that he was going to be baptized in symbol of his dedication to do the will, not of Jesus, but of Jehovah. Yet again the “pastor” made the eighty-mile train trip, and yet again his trip was in vain. Not only is our newfound brother now baptized but also two of his daughters. His wife and other daughter are publishers too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A back-call in a church started another man on the road to freedom. Two brothers entered the church, which was the lower part of a house, and found the man attending to churchly duties prior to morning service. His attitude was that the brothers were doing fine but they ought to preach to the unconverted. Nevertheless, one of the brothers was very persistent and eventually arranged a back-call, although other publishers had also made back-calls on many previous occasions. It took the persistent publisher a number of back-calls before the light of the truth eventually illuminated the man’s formerly bedarkened mind. Rejoicing at finding and embracing the truth, this man wrote his “pastor” as follows: “I remember mentioning that I will not join another body of Christians, but I should have also said this: ‘unless I receive greater light’; and thank God I am now receiving same. Paul declared: ‘I gained and prospered more than my fellow companions in the Jews’ religion,’ yet in the end he had to follow the side of truth. ... It is indeed a shame to see what little regard and how much ridicule is passed upon a doctrine so filled with shining rays of Bible truths and revelations for these closing days of the present system of things.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark256"></a>BRITISH HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In this small country in Central America, with not too great a population, there is still territory that needs to be worked and so those who want to go where the need is great in their own country have found this privilege of service locally. No matter where one goes he finds difficult times, once in a while big problems and at other occasions small ones. But Paul said to Timothy: “Preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.” (2 Tim. 4:2) No minister of the good news can run away from obstacles, large or small, or from opposition. Calmly and persistently we must press on preaching the good news. The Branch servant gives us a few experiences that are of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Often we neglect starting Bible studies where the interest is only slight, feeling it is not worth it. Actual experience will show that an effective Bible study is just the thing to build up sufficient interest. A sister recently proved this when she called on a lady who said she was too busy to listen but did mention that she already had some of the publications. When the witness expressed her desire to call back and study them with her she hesitated, saying she would be working, but then agreed on a time when she would be home. On the return call very little interest was manifest at first, but in the course of the discussion some questions were raised that stirred her interest. The following week she was ready and waiting for a Bible study, and when invited to the Kingdom Hall she said, “I’ll think it over.” When the next study was held she said she had thought it over and made up her mind to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses. Since then she has been regular at the Kingdom Hall, but as she progressed and desired to dedicate her life she saw the need to straighten out her marital affairs so she would be acceptable as a clean servant of Jehovah. Diligently she began working on this, hoping all would be straightened out by the time of the Divine Will Assembly to be held in Belize at the end of August. As the time came and there was still a delay it made her very sad, for she said: “I wept on that Saturday morning to see others of my former church getting immersed as witnesses of Jehovah and I couldn’t be with them.” This Interest has grown in this sincere person because one of Jehovah’s witnesses saw the need to fan a small spark of interest that was manifest one Sunday morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Should eight children, all under the age of eight, stop you from having a home Bible study? No, not with kind and tactful help, as was well illustrated when the sincere father of these children began to study. ‘Well, that is easy enough for the father,’ you might say, ‘but the mother . . . ?' Yes, the mother, after being invited and given encouragement, joined in the study and began preparing her lesson beforehand. So the home was now organized for the first time in its history for regular Bible study, and then it was that the Devil saw to it that opposition came. First, a Roman Catholic priest blustered in to tell the mother she was immoral because she had not baptized her youngest baby; however, her studies had given her the answer: ‘‘Well, I am not so bad; the ‘Blessed Virgin Mary’ must have been immoral for thirty years until Jesus was baptized.” Next, came an Adventist minister who had been trying to win her over and then a Nazarene clergyman who told her she would have been better off to remain a Roman Catholic than to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. This mother is now planning to symbolize her dedication to Jehovah publicly and, instead of being weaker for the attacks, is now giving good encouragement to others in the congregation. So whatever the difficulties, with kind, persistent help by a mature minister they can be overcome.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>BRITAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The publishers of the Kingdom in Britain are really on the move. Many people of good will there are learning the wonderful truth that Christ Jesus taught: “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, . . . Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven.” (Matt. 6:19, 20) Those already doing the divine will have worked diligently to show the people the need of changing their way of life, and thousands have done just that during the past year. All of us rejoice to see how widespread the message of the Kingdom is in Britain. It is being declared throughout the territory, and also in Malta a little witness work is being carried on. Out of the Branch report these experiences that follow are taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Magazine work has proved to be ideal for parents to train their children in the ministry, and the children are getting results. On one occasion a publisher was working a street along with his young son and daughter. He overlapped one house, to find that the lady had already taken two magazines from the children and was reading one with great interest. A discussion followed and a Bible study was started. Both the lady and her husband took the truth so readily that six weeks later they were baptized. The children had planted the seed in good soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many a sheep is found by incidental witnessing. The foreman on a building site gave one of Jehovah’s witnesses a lift to work each day. This foreman had been an active Communist for twenty-five years and was keen to argue his view that communism would bring in a new world. The brother kept talking to him each day about Jehovah and the Kingdom. Finally, after a month, the last of the foreman’s Communist beliefs had been overturned and he could see that only Jehovah could give mankind a new world. Having been so stanch a Communist, he found it embarrassing to admit to his wife that he had been all wrong, but he began by speaking of the new world of the Bible. To his surprise she replied: “Yes, I know. I have a young lady who calls regularly.” After a period of Bible study both were immersed and now, with their children, they serve the true God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Ever since the call to serve where the need is great went out in 1957 there has been increasing interest in this field of service. Some have already gone overseas and others are trying to get into other lands. A greater number have moved to where the need is great in Britain. Here the proportion of publishers to population is best in the south and lowest in the north, particularly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Society’s frequent references to this avenue of valuable service are causing many to consider it and make preparations to move.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A family of three moved to a northern town that was very much in need of help. The brother writes: “We are now very happy that we did come here and we feel that if many of the brothers in large congregations really appreciated how great the need is they would come north immediately. But it has to be seen to be believed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year 1958 has certainly been packed with blessings and the greatest of them was the Divine Will International Assembly in New York, which 1,850 British delegates attended. It is impossible to measure the good this has done for the work here, but we do know that all have come back with a much keener appreciation of Jehovah’s organization and a more fervent desire to do the divine will than ever before.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark98"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark258"></a>MALTA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The little congregation there has had its difficulties but has managed to keep the meetings going and to keep preaching the good news. This is a place where the need is very great, but the economic situation makes it very difficult for any but those with technical qualifications to get employment there. We are hoping that someone with means can move to Malta to give some permanence to the congregation. Now most of the brothers are out there for short periods of duty only.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark259"></a>BURMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Outstanding in the minds of the few Burmese who are preaching the good news of the Kingdom is the fact that one tenth of all their publishers, or twelve, were able to get to the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York city. The work moves steadily on in Burma and people of good will are being found. However, it moves slowly. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they are determined to preach this good news of the Kingdom and they feel as Paul expressed himself: “I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who delegated power to me, because he considered me trustworthy by assigning me to a ministry.” (1 Tim. 1:12) Their ministry is Burma and it is a hard place to work, but joyfully they press on and have interesting experiences, as the Branch servant shows in his report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The truth has spread to the Kachin Hills in northern Burma. The first Kachin man was baptized at a recent circuit assembly in Mandalay. Other Kachins in Mandalay are learning the truth, and through them the truth is spreading into the far north.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young girl whose father is a Hindu and whose mother is a nominal Christian came in contact with the truth and dedicated her life to serve Jehovah. Friends of the father, who is a prominent businessman, began to ridicule him for allowing the girl to go from house to house with the literature. He then became strongly opposed to her engaging in service and the girl had to endure much persecution, both mental and physical. The situation was aggravated when she graduated from high school and refused to go to college, announcing her intention of pioneering. The father said she would have to leave home, but when she began packing her things he was enraged and burned her Bible literature. He threatened to burn down the home of the witnesses to which she was going and to take them to court for abduction of a minor. He had the law on his side, so she was advised to be patient and wait till she came of age. She is eagerly looking forward to the day when she can serve Jehovah full time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah blesses sincere efforts made toward pioneering. It seemed impossible for a young brother in Burma to become a pioneer. He was the sole supporter of his mother, sister and young brother. Then his brother finished school and began looking for a job. The brother arranged for him to take his job and bring in the support while he took up the full-time service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark260"></a>CANADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">This has been a very eventful year in the forward movement of the Kingdom work in Canada. Jehovah’s witnesses there realize that “the blessing of Jehovah—that is what makes rich, and he adds no pain with it.” (Prov. 10:22) The publishers throughout the country were determined to accomplish their ministry more fully than ever before and increase their service on behalf of the Lord’s other sheep. They have done this with excellent results, as now Canada has reached a new peak of 35,324 publishers serving the interests of the Kingdom. In this country of many kinds of climate and nationalities the report of the brothers’ activity is very interesting. Here are some excerpts from the Branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are happy to report an increase of over three quarters of a million magazines distributed over our last year’s results. Brothers are becoming more and more alerted to the value of even one single magazine placement, as illustrated by the following experience: “A single copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> was placed with a young couple. This was followed by two return visits with very little result. A third call was made, and what a difference! They began to ask questions. They wanted to know more about what they had been learning from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> On that call they gladly took the two-book offer, and the week following a Bible study was started. The study continued with growing interest. Six months after that first </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> copy was placed with them they were ready for field service. Did they want to begin where they were unknown? Oh, no! They wanted to call on their neighbors and friends first! Three months later they were conducting three Bible studies of their own.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work in the Province of Quebec continues to make good progress. In harmony with suggestions offered by you, Brother Knorr, we prepared thirty-two-page booklets specially designed to appeal to the French Catholic population. Our aim was to try to overcome the prejudice of the Quebec householders, which is so difficult to break through at the initial call. Publishers in Quebec have been delighted to work with these new aids and some measure of success has been attained. Here is one thrilling experience, showing the effect of such a booklet, as related by one of the sisters:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Having placed a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Saviez-vous?</span><span class="font7"> (Do You Know?), we called back and found the lady happy to see us. Not only had she read the booklet but had passed it on to four others living in the same home. Our back-call sermon, based on the contents of the booklet and with scriptures read from the French Catholic Bible, stimulated more interest and brought forth this expression: ‘Why are we kept in ignorance when this is so simple, so clear and so good? We are told not to have a Bible because it is not a good example to our children.’ An invitation was extended to her to attend a public lecture. She accepted and stayed on through the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study. Afterward she remarked on the fact that we were such a wonderfully happy family of people. For three years this lady had steadfastly refused to have anything to do with Jehovah’s witnesses until a copy of this special booklet reached her hands and her heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No new court proceedings of any kind have been filed against Jehovah’s people in Quebec during the past year. Some violence and police interference have flared up from time to time, but warning letters and damage suits against police and mobsters have been effective in curbing such opposition. One damage suit against the Quebec provincial police was argued in the Supreme Court of Canada for two days. Decision is still pending. There have been no further developments </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font7"> connection with the Bill 38 case, which involves the effort on the part of the Quebec government to ban the work of Jehovah’s witnesses from that province. This case is still before the courts of Quebec.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the problems in this land is to reach sections of the scattered population, as many are away up in the northlands. Our brothers are doing what is possible along this line, as shown by the experience of three brothers who visited a remote Indian reserve. The only way they had to get there, in view of the lack of a boat, was to go in wintertime, when they could drive the two miles along the frozen surface of the lake, and then continue the remaining four miles by foot in deep snow. Their journey was well rewarded, for 106 magazines were placed and twenty-two subscriptions were obtained from the population of 112. From the very first call, which happened to be on the counselor for the tribe, good will was manifest on every side. He himself obtained a subscription for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and readily gave authorization to the brothers to work among his people. At the fourth call they met an elderly Indian who spoke the Ojibway language who accompanied the brothers and introduced them at each call. This was excellent assistance. These brothers were very happy and determined they would at the earliest opportunity follow up with more visits to such a fine group of truth-loving persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We were thrilled to learn of your decision to purchase a large new rotary press in Germany for the printing of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> in Canada for the people of this country. Still greater was our joy when it was delivered after our arrival back from the Divine Will International Assembly. Brothers from the Brooklyn factory are now here to supervise installation of the press, and very shortly we expect to start production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, words fail to express our joy at seeing so many of our brothers from around the world assembled in one place during the Divine Will International Assembly. In Canada we are specially blessed in being located so close to New York, so that 25,000 of our brothers and sisters could attend and partake of the strengthening food that was so liberally spread upon the Lord’s table on that marvelous occasion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>CEYLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The thought uppermost in the minds of the brothers in Ceylon during the 1958 service year was the Divine Will International Assembly. Fifteen from Ceylon were able to be present in New York. So the high point of the year was the report that these brothers brought back, talking about Jehovah’s invincible power, the great feeling of optimism for the future, the confidence that Jehovah’s spirit will be even more manifest among God’s people in Ceylon than ever before. Many experiences were had by the brothers en route, witnessing on ships and planes. Their joy was preaching the good things that they had learned. The Branch servant gives us some very interesting experiences in his report on Ceylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A second high light in this momentous year 1958 was the publication of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in the Singhalese language. This is proving a boon in spreading the knowledge of Jehovah’s kingdom among the Singhalese people, who comprise two thirds of the population here. The Tamil edition has built up a good circulation over the last couple of years and we look forward to similar results with the new Singhalese edition. This means that every person in Ceylon is now able to obtain </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in a language that he understands!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are happy to see the spirit of God moving more and more of the Ceylonese brothers to enter the fulltime service as each year passes. At the time of writing there are twenty-one Ceylonese brothers in the fulltime service, and, additionally, one is at present attending Gilead’s thirty-second class. Add to this the eleven missionaries here from other lands, and it can be seen what a strong force this makes in an organization of just 157 publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We were forcefully reminded of the 1955 yeartext, “He shall not be afraid of evil tidings,” during this year, for evil tidings and troublous times were rampant throughout the country. At the end of December devastating floods struck the eastern province, and just a few months later racial riots, accompanied by looting and murder, broke out. With a dusk-to-dawn curfew imposed and the army and navy patrolling the streets, many difficulties faced the brothers. Evening meetings had to be canceled and it might have been expected that the field activity would have been seriously affected. But to the contrary, the number of publishers kept up steadily; inconvenience and hardship were treated as a challenge, enabling us to conclude the year with a stronger organization than ever and a healthy over-all increase, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In fact, Kingdom fruitage resulted from the floods. One brother tells us: “The floodwaters surged into our home also, so we hurried to a small house on higher elevation. There were about twenty-five people gathered in that house and it was not long before the discussion turned to the cause of such a terrible flood. This was an excellent opportunity for me to give a witness, and since the householders were Christians, I asked them to bring their Bible. The wife of the householder was very much moved by my sermon proving that Satan is the cause of all these troubles. After the floods I revisited her. Her interest in the truth increased and she wanted to learn more. A pioneer sister was introduced to conduct a Bible study. After four or five studies this lady came out in the field service. Almost nine months have passed since then and now she is doing vacation pioneering and conducting a home Bible study of her own. This same lady once turned a pioneer couple away when they called at her home. Now she has a firm grip on the Scriptures and is able to face opposition from all her neighbors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those already in the truth were made stronger, because the floods enabled the brothers in other parts of the country to demonstrate the bond of love and unity that binds together those in the New World society. The experience of one family in particular proves the truth of this: A dedicated sister, her good-will husband and seven of their ten children had the misfortune of seeing their entire house dashed to the ground by the floodwaters. The problem of food, clothing and shelter was extremely acute. Their baby of about eight months had her liquid food below half the normal amount. First, a brother arrived by air from Colombo with emergency rations and some clothing; then, as soon as the roads were passable, one of the brothers’ cars, jammed full with more provisions and clothing, was sent on its way. The tears of gratitude of a family such as the above may be imagined when such gifts arrived with godly love from their brothers. This sister later told one of the special pioneers that they had vowed in their hearts to serve Jehovah as never before from then on. Four months ago their son of twenty years entered the special pioneer work to serve in another part of the island, the mother and another son of fifteen years are doing vacation pioneering for the second month, and two of the others are regular publishers. The father, though a man of physical infirmities, is to be immersed soon.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark262"></a>CHILE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is essential that everyone take part in the training program. Either we want to be helped or we want to help others. Paul said: “Let each of us please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding.” (Rom. 15:2) With this spirit in the hearts of Jehovah’s witnesses real progress is attained. This spirit certainly has reflected itself among our brothers in Chile. Excellent advancement has been made in gathering together those who want to learn the truth and good maturity has been gained by those already in the truth. It was a time of great joy this past summer when 110 delegates were able to leave Chile and come to the United States for the great assembly. All of their study and their training program had made them desirous of being with their fellow workers from all parts of the world. The Branch servant sends in some reports about the work in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Much teaching and training is yet to be done. The brothers in Chile appreciate the Society’s provisions to that end and so the new booklet in Spanish, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Learn to Read and Write,</span><span class="font7"> has brought some interesting comments. One congregation servant expressed that he had often wondered about the possibility of having classes with detailed instructions in reading as the time allowed, for the weekly Theocratic Ministry School does not give time for much needed correction in reading. The new booklet fills that need. Even well-educated brothers will profit greatly in the course, as it will train them to use the booklet properly in efficiently teaching others who desire to learn to read and write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The success of those starting the special pioneer work serves to encourage still more. As an example, one brother, after two unsuccessful starts by trucks that broke down, finally made the trip to his assignment by boat, accompanied by his wife and two small children. Upon arriving in his assignment, meetings were started right away, with eight persons in attendance; in only nine months the number had grown to twenty-seven, and eight were enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School. A new publisher was conducting four home Bible studies in that short time, while the total number of home Bible studies increased to forty! The wife does not have good health but she says that she does what she can. She has reported as many as eighty hours in the field in one month and fourteen home Bible studies!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many parents do not set the example they should in giving consideration to the daily text and comment, but the above-mentioned family does. Their formerly Spanish-Catholic landlady liked their consideration of the daily text so much that arrangement was agreed upon to have one of the children advise her when they finished breakfast so that she could join them for the daily text and comments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>CHINA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The year’s text, “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk,” proved to be most appropriate for the brothers in China as well as in all the world. In this country the State has risen up as the great savior of the people from all evils, and every man, woman and child is expected to support wholeheartedly the political activities and leadership. During the year the pressure of the State against Jehovah’s witnesses mounted. The State is determined to regiment every individual. Today there is only a small minority who are fearless enough to stand against the State, and it is Jehovah’s witnesses who have maintained integrity. It has been most difficult for the brothers and sisters in the truth to engage in secular work, because all workers are expected to be politically-minded and to join in the political meetings, which are held almost daily in the factories and offices after working hours. All men and women are expected to join in parades, voting and many other political activities. Jehovah’s witnesses have refused to share in such activities and have been declared antigovernment, or rightists, and have been severely criticized. Because of maintaining integrity four brothers have been detained. Formal charges have not been set against them and months have now gone by. They are not brought before the court, but are just kept in prison. The Chinese government tries to indoctrinate them with their philosophy of life. But again the year’s text comes to the rescue of the brothers, “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two missionaries who were sent to China eleven years ago were recently arrested by the Chinese government. What their fate will be is not known. But just before they were arrested the Branch servant sent in a very interesting report and excerpts are taken from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One alert brother is a tailor who has a very small shop of his own. A young woman called one day with a piece of cloth and asked him if he could make a dress out of it. Other tailors had said the material was insufficient, but the brother said it would be enough and he arranged to make the dress. The woman noticed the brother’s Bible on his worktable and mentioned that she too was a Christian. A discussion on Bible truths followed that greatly aroused the woman’s interest, and subsequently a home Bible study was started with the woman and her husband. At first the husband argued in favor of his old church teachings, but the wife accepted the truths presented. Before long the husband too became convinced that what the brother preached was the truth when he saw it so fully backed by the Scriptures and reason. They began to attend meetings regularly and both were baptized during the year. Now they are making good progress toward maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Often when professing Christians accept the truth their relatives will oppose them, but when a pagan accepts and becomes a Christian, that opposition can be very intense. We have a sister among us now who was a Buddhist a short time ago. One of her relatives is a sister in the truth, and this sister preached to her and convinced her that Christianity is the only true religion. The sister also preached to the husband, but he argued against it. The more he saw his wife getting interested in the truth the more he opposed, until he became very bitter and angry. He would follow his wife around the house remonstrating, threatening and bullying her into giving up the truth. She could take up any religion but not that of Jehovah’s witnesses. On one occasion he struck her in the face and injured her eye. The wife is by nature rather timid and submissive, yet she did not give way under such treatment. Just a few days later she was baptized, although it had to be kept secret from him. She is continuing to associate with the congregation and is growing more mature and courageous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are still two missionaries serving the congregation here in Shanghai. Meetings are held regularly, with an average attendance of about fifty-five. A small assembly was held during the year at which the latest spiritual food was enjoyed. The “Superlative Song,” Job’s integrity under test, and the worthwhile works of Kingdom activity were all greatly appreciated, and stimulated the brothers to activity. The largest meeting of the year was the Memorial, with 107 in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The flow of spiritual food to the brothers has been blocked recently, so that very little is being received. However, the brothers in the past have drunk deeply of the waters of truth, which have become “a fountain of water bubbling up to impart everlasting life” to the brothers and those to whom they preach. The brothers who are detained have no literature, not even the Bible to comfort them, but must drink from the fountain of truth already in them. Christ assures them they “will never get thirsty at all.” But too bad for any who neglected to study and associate when they had the opportunity, for in this hour of trial with their wells dry they face spiritual death. The brothers who are still “free” must keep in a spiritually healthy condition and walk in integrity until Jehovah, in answer to their prayers, delivers them into the glorious liberty of his new world.—John 4:14.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark264"></a>COLOMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The political situation in Colombia changed during the year. Greater freedom has been given to all the people, and this includes the missionary work. This has brought real happiness to the valiant soldiers who are on the watch in this South American country. They have not forgotten the admonition of Paul: “Go on waging the right warfare.” (1 Tim. 1:18) They are not doing it as the Roman Catholic Hierarchy did through its inquisition, but rather they are waging the right kind of warfare by preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and comforting those that mourn. However, the Hierarchy uses the same methods they have used for many years, trying to stop Jehovah’s witnesses from preaching. Some of the experiences in this regard are related by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several brothers who have come during the last few months to help us here where the need is so great are all happily located and doing a fine job helping us, two as pioneers, one as a congregation servant. And while at the New York assembly we were greatly enthused to interview and register some one hundred more persons interested in coming to serve in Colombia; thus our hopes and prospects are greater as time goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several special pioneer groups have been sent to open up new territories recently, and one group writes of their preaching activities in a city of 150,000. Trying to avoid problems, they work in a different section each day. However, on their third visit to Villa Maria, the waiting priest had police usher them off to the mayor. There they were told that, though they were doing nothing wrong, they should discontinue preaching in that vicinity so as not to disturb the priest. Being freed, the special pioneers visited the governor’s office, where they were encouraged with the assurance that they had full liberty to go ahead and preach where they wished. However, upon returning to the trouble section the mayor quickly spotted them and angrily made them leave, stating that the governor did not run him. Upon their returning to the governor’s office, the mayor was immediately advised by telephone that these ministers had freedom to preach, thus he became a changed man and the special pioneers have not been disturbed any more in Villa Maria. Integrity in their assignment had Jehovah’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two sisters working together close to a Catholic church and school were stunned as a priest walked into the home where they were witnessing, grabbed a Bible from the missionary and threatened them with arrest. The sister insisted that he return the Bible as she had paid for it and was the owner. Hastily the priest handed it back to her, perhaps because the missionary unknowingly had used the Spanish verb for “hit” rather than “pay.” Shortly the street was full of children from the school. Thinking it best to leave the territory, the sisters ventured forth to catch a bus and then the children showered them with stones, dirt or whatever was handy. A man with a milk truck, seeing the mob, came by and offered to take the sisters to the bus stop, which they accepted. Although Catholic, the man was very disturbed about such an unjust act and later, upon our visiting him and his family, it was learned that he had lost his job because of helping “Protestants.” The church had written to his employers using pressure to have him fired. But despite all this the man received the witnesses cordially, accepted a book, and is looking forward to attending our coming assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interesting too is the experience of a nun, formerly a good friend of a man that has become a very active brother. Taking advantage of his acquaintance to send her some literature by mail, the brother was surprised to receive the following reply: “My dear brother: Permit me to use this phrase in addressing; although as yet I do not belong to Jehovah’s witnesses, the day is not far distant that we will in truth be brothers. Please receive my greetings full of gratitude for your kindness toward me and please send me some </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Atalayas </span><span class="font7">and I pray that God will repay you. [Signed: An ex-nun]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite difficult economic conditions, with the help contributed through the Society, a total of thirty-two brothers from Colombia were able to attend the grand international assembly in New York. All returned bubbling over with enthusiasm. This contributed toward reaching a new peak of publishers at the end of the fiscal year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark265"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark266"></a>REPORT FROM THE COMMUNISTIC LANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">When we think of the wonderful work done by our brothers behind the Iron Curtain we cannot help but think of the text for the year and how they have walked in their integrity. Now the text for 1959, “Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments” (Rev. 16:15), is also very appropriate. In these eight countries behind the Iron Curtain Jehovah’s witnesses are alert to the world condition and the exact times in which we are living. All of them appreciate that this is no time for compromise or for slowing down. They have seen the hypocritical moves of the clergy to tie in with the godless State. During the past twelve months Jehovah’s servants in all this territory of Europe behind the Iron Curtain have stood firm. They have worked underground. They have preached to the people of good will. They have gathered together the other sheep by the thousands and today we see one of the most marvelous increases within Jehovah’s organization behind the Iron Curtain. It warms our hearts toward these brothers and it shows us so clearly that Jehovah’s holy spirit can operate upon our beloved brothers behind the Iron Curtain just as well as in any other part of the earth. The divine will is being done there because our brothers turn to God’s Word and follow it. What a joy it is to know that the good news of God’s kingdom is being preached in territories where the government is trying to turn every person’s mind away from God and to make them one-hundred-percent materialistic! Some brief reports from the countries behind the Iron Curtain are given here. It has been difficult to get some, but we know that our brothers still stand firm and preach. They are awake and have their ministerial garments on. May Jehovah’s blessing go with them, for here we see our brothers who “walk worthily . . . with complete lowliness of mind and mildness, with longsuffering, putting up with one another in love, earnestly endeavoring to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace.”—Eph. 4:1-3.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark267"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark268"></a>ALBANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are a few brothers in Albania that celebrated the death of Christ Jesus at Memorial time, and they have sent out word that, “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.” These faithful witnesses of Jehovah are continuing to do what they can. They have spoken the truth plainly to others and have even tried to publish some things. They are grateful for the meat in due season that has reached them on occasions, but evidently the communistic rulers have closed down all communications from the outside world as far as these brothers are concerned. What these haters of God have done to our brothers we do not know. However, during the 1958 service year they were preaching and comforting those who mourn within the oppressive totalitarian rule that the Communists have put upon the people of Albania. While the rulers of the land may separate the brothers in Albania from the rest of the New World society, they cannot cut off the operation of God’s holy spirit upon them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>BULGARIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">News comes through occasionally about the faithfulness of our brothers in this land. One of the principal representatives finished his earthly course, and he had walked faithfully before God all these years under great oppression. This brother, feeling that his end was near, informed others through a message that said: “Till here I have walked—from here on the Lord God,” which meant that from now on he entrusted his spirit into God’s hands. The book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Faith on the March</span><span class="font7"> has gotten into Bulgaria and has brought comfort to many. Word was received that the whole family celebrated the Memorial, which indicates their close relation to Jehovah God through the communal offering of Christ Jesus. They are anxious to feed at the table of Jehovah, and doing that they certainly want to do his will. The brothers must be very cautious as to their work, and in a communication it was stated that the circumstances are much different to deal with there than in free countries. The communication further stated: “You will understand that it is not possible to describe the troublesome life that is ours under a regime where one lives like a prisoner. I believe you are fairly well informed about the regime of the ‘people’s democracy.’ ... It is best to open one’s mouth only at the dentist. Even if one could speak freely, what good would it do, for everyone has but one thought, and that is how to gain his daily bread, which requires a great effort? People have become indifferent to everything else. But as for me, despite this impossible atmosphere, I want to continue studying that which brings complete contentment and peace and so shall be glad if you will send me further books and booklets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our brothers live in hope and crave more food, and some has been reaching them, to their encouragement and upbuilding.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark270"></a>CZECHOSLOVAKIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia are determined people. They have full faith in their God, Jehovah, and they know that “the word of God is not bound.” Excellent progress was made in this country behind the Iron Curtain during the past year and the publishers were determined by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness to have a 10-percent increase. They accomplished this goal, and they expressed joy and gratitude to Jehovah, who, as they say, ‘has given us an 11-percent increase!’ As ministers of God throughout the whole world looked forward to the month in which the Memorial is celebrated, so did all the overseers and publishers in Czechoslovakia. They had a most marvelous gathering during the Memorial week and everyone was stirred to increased activity. The result? A new peak in publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They are very grateful for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> the meat in due season, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> and the other publications of the Society. They do not hold this information just for themselves. They continually urge upon each one the need of having a home Bible study with another, and one district reports that they have reached their sixth goal, of one study per publisher. This must bring great joy to their hearts. The ministers of God must do their preaching by word of mouth mainly. They do not have a large supply of the publications of the Society. They lack books, booklets and magazines, so what few they do have they lend to interested persons and study with them. Their literature passes through many hands, and they are appreciative hands too. Most of their witnessing is done in a manner that we would call incidental witnessing, and here is one experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“On a summer Sunday a sister wanted to go out to the forest with her son. They missed the train. They decided to wait for the next one and waited in the train station. Behind her some people were speaking. The man about whom the two were engaging in the conversation had had both of his legs severed because of an injury received in a railroad accident. The doctor in the hospital noticed that this man had the head of Christ tattooed on the soles of his feet. The doctor questioned what this meant and the man replied that he hated Christ so much that he wanted to continually trample him under his feet. The doctor informed the man that it was necessary to amputate his legs and that he would not be able to do this any more. The woman telling the story about the man having his legs amputated seemed to be a believer in the Bible, so the witness of Jehovah engaged in conversation with this woman. She turned out to be a Protestant by belief and she was </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">very</span><span class="font7"> much interested in what the sister had to say and noticed she was so well versed in the Bible. She wanted more information and she asked the sister to help her. A week later a Bible study was started in her home. Her husband joined in the study along with two grown children. It was not long until they accepted the truth with great joy. A year later the whole family symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by being baptized in water. Today the members of this happy family have seven home Bible studies themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So it goes by following through on incidental witnessing, and this is about the only way that Jehovah’s witnesses in Czechoslovakia can carry on their service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The report out of Czechoslovakia shows that every week there are regular Bible studies, there are regular </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> studies and service meetings and that Jehovah’s people have deep appreciation for the spiritual food and the attendance at meetings in their service centers is almost 100 percent everywhere. These people are hungry for truth and for good association and they stick together. They are interested in their own teaching and their salvation as well as that of others. They are on the watch and are keeping their ministerial garments on. They have a daily fight, but the stirring articles in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> strengthen them powerfully, they report, for Christian combat. They pray daily to Jehovah to give them the necessary strength to meet the problems that face them. Their great desire is to be able to say, as did Paul: “I have fought the right fight, I have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith.” Closing their report they say: “We take this opportunity of assuring all our brothers and sisters who render true worship to Jehovah God in all the world of our warm love. In the indestructible bond of service we want to glorify with you our heavenly Father, Jehovah God, and his King, Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark271"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark272"></a>EAST GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">How true it is of our brothers behind the Iron Curtain that “two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if one of them should fall, the other can raise his partner up. But how will it be with just the one who falls when there is not another to raise him up?” (Eccl. 4:9, 10) So with strength from Jehovah and aid from their brothers the witnesses of Jehovah in East Germany have pressed on diligently. A goodly number of the brothers who live in Berlin, which is situated in Eastern Germany although portions of it belong to the West, were able to get to the Assembly. One hundred and thirty-one delegates enjoyed to the full the spiritual feast of fat things and the warm theocratic companionship they had with their brothers in the New World society from all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As to communistic East Germany, the pressure upon our brothers has increased and about eighty of them were incarcerated during the past year as compared with fifty the year before. At the present time there are 440 in the East German penitentiaries. When Jehovah’s witnesses are brought before the court the same old lies are used to bring about their sentences to prison. Stock terms are heard constantly. For example, these people are “under the meanest religious camouflage,” they are “instigators of hatred, boycott and war,” “agents of American capitalism doing espionage work&quot; and carrying on “propaganda against the Socialist countries,” in order that the “American imperialists could more easily accomplish their atomic war plans.” All these accusations are ridiculous, for the Communists as well as the rest of the world know of the strict stand for neutrality all of Jehovah’s witnesses have taken toward the political and military issues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite this terrible pressure and persecution, it does not scatter the sheep, nor those persons who are sighing and crying because of the abominations that are done. The ingathering goes on. Despite the fact that there is no visible organization, the seed of truth really takes root with more and more people every day. A young boy going through high school had a Bible study with a publisher. Before his graduation from school he was called on to sign up and serve in the Communist East German army. All of his class did so except him. He was put under pressure by the school officials, but he still took his stand, declaring he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses although he had not yet been baptized. He was therefore barred from further attendance at the schools in East Germany and he finally had to leave the country as a refugee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Brothers have opportunities to give incidental witnesses, and so one brother at work spoke to a woman. Immediately she was interested in the world woes. It was not long until the witness learned that some time ago she had obtained the books </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.”</span><span class="font7"> She moved away and lost association with the witness. Now she has begun to study again, telling other people about the wonderful truths that she is learning. Now she is no longer a person perplexed on why there are so many troubles in the earth, but she has found the truth through the witnesses and is seeking the first opportunity to be baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few years ago the Communists tried to keep all the witnesses whom they incarcerated separate from one another so that their faith would be weakened. However, the prison keepers soon noticed that this was a mistake. The witnesses, it seemed, got stronger instead of weaker because they were always preaching to fellow prisoners and converting some of them. They have changed their policy. They said the best thing to do was put all the witnesses together and then they will broil in their own fat, believing that no one can get along peacefully. However, to their dismay the brothers did not start fighting one against the other, but encouraged one another and became stronger in spiritual understanding. The newly arrested brothers are always welcomed by those in prison because they bring in reports of the latest </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers,</span><span class="font7"> conventions and theocratic news, and they learn of the great prosperity Jehovah God has given his people around the world. Communists cannot understand this kind of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, any opportunity Jehovah’s witnesses in prison have to preach to others is seized upon and often prisoners swarm around Jehovah’s witnesses like bees because they see in these people happiness, contentment, and they would like to have some of it. When they listen to the truth they do get it. Many families are taken to prison one after the other because they believe the Bible and teach it to others. One sister, sending through a report telling about a trial in which she was sentenced to four years in the penitentiary, said: “Although our hearts beat with excitement, we had our trust in our heavenly Father to put the right words in our mouths.” And, on the other hand, one of the guards remarked: “This crazy gang, behaving as if they were going to a wedding.” Was it not Jesus who said: “Happy are those who have been persecuted for righteousness’ sake, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them. Happy are you when people reproach you and persecute you and lyingly say every kind of wicked thing against you for my sake. Rejoice and leap for joy, since your reward is great in the heavens; for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you”? (Matt. 5:10-12) Here we see the holy spirit of God operating upon his servants behind the Iron Curtain, giving them the same strength the apostles had, and causing them to rejoice under persecution and scourge. These brothers behind the Iron Curtain in Eastern Germany send their love and greetings to their brothers on the other side.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark273"></a>HUNGARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Our brothers in Hungary report that the “proclamation of the truth cannot be stopped by any devilish means, be it persecution, oppression, violence or prison. With the psalmist we can say: ‘Had it not been that Jehovah proved to be for us when men rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us up even alive.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the past service year pressure from the authorities has considerably increased. The police have questioned numbers of our brothers and have warned them to stop all meetings. They have invaded homes where the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> studies were in progress. However, these experiences have not instilled fear in Jehovah’s witnesses. They appreciate that they must go through trials for the truth in order to prove their integrity, and so it has been their firm determination to maintain unity in their ranks and to continue doing the divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The authorities also started a newspaper campaign against Jehovah’s witnesses. Some newspapers declared that the witnesses were sending out alarming news on war prophecies and other papers said that the rumormakers had succeeded in causing a panic among the population and therefore foodstuffs were being hoarded in many areas. Another paper stated that the Bible students, Jehovah’s witnesses, incite the people to resistance against the people’s democratic regime. The papers threatened that there would be a purge against those not for the government. This is common practice. The only way that the communistic government can keep the people in line is to feed them false propaganda  and  to try to get the populace to hate those who stand for truth and righteousness and who want to serve God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One sister took an interested person with her in the field service work. A policeman found them and made his report. Soon the sister was arrested at night. She was questioned for three days and three nights. The police wanted to find out all about the activity of the organization, obtain names of responsible servants and also the names of those going from house to house and who was carrying on correspondence with the West. The sister answered the flood of questions with, “I don’t know; I didn’t hear." They threatened her with internment, prison and even the gallows, and to this she answered: “Here I am, you can do with me what you want, but note that I shall not become a traitor to my brothers. I prefer to die rather than to say anything about anyone.” Seeing the fearlessness of this sister they stopped demanding that she give information about others. Then they tried to persuade the sister that she should have those who were directing the work get authorization from the Office of Church Matters in the government. She pointed out that Jehovah’s witnesses would have no fellowship with this old world and that they were not looking for the government to authorize whether or not they could preach the good news. One of the officers told her that they would “fight against Jehovah.” And another expressed himself like Pharaoh, saying: “Who is this Jehovah? We don’t know him.” Finally, like the religious rulers in the times of the early Christians, they asked her to promise that she would not go from house to house again. When she refused to promise this, they requested her to refrain at least from preaching from the twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew, because it speaks about the end of the world. So with threats upon their lips they let the sister go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another witness doing incidental preaching found a zealous Catholic woman and gave her a witness concerning the Bible and the name of Jehovah. The Catholic woman did not believe the name of God was Jehovah, so she went to her priest and wanted to find out from the Catholic Bible whether such was true. The priest would not show her a Bible. It was only after many calls and finally getting to the curate that she got the Bible and read in the footnote: “The Hebrews worshiped God as Jehovah and this is the name of God.” The woman was highly pleased with this and agreed to have a study, and her husband joined her with the witness of Jehovah. Soon she found an interested man who was so enthralled with the truth and the Bible that he started to copy the Bible. But it was not long before one of the publishers provided him with one. Since this time all three persons of good will have dedicated themselves to Jehovah and are happy to be able to show still others the way to life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When one stays by his teaching and looks after himself and his integrity he will also be able to save others. An excellent increase was enjoyed on the part of the publishers in Hungary during the past service year. We rejoice with them in their zeal and determination to preach the good news of the Kingdom everywhere.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark127"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark274"></a>POLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is with overflowing joy that the brothers in Poland send a report concerning the past year’s activity. No longer do they have a Bethel home and a printing plant, nor is there any possibility for the servants to meet together to discuss Kingdom interests. Yet their hearts are filled with ardent zeal that no one can take from them. The circumstances under which Jehovah’s witnesses in Poland live are most distressing. At any moment one could face arrest and so the way the publishers feel is: “We want to use every month as if it were our last month for service.” With this spirit among the brothers in Poland the organization has had twelve successive peaks in publishers, which means every month of the service year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The greatest reason for the rapid growth of the work in Poland during this past year has been the great increase of the home Bible study activity. Those more mature in the truth have seen that there is a great need for this and the home Bible studies have increased 100 percent over the previous year. During the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses the talk among the brothers was “every publisher once in his life a vacation pioneer.” All these brothers were with the Assembly at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds in spirit and their hearts were filled to overflowing when they saw a picture in the daily newspapers in Poland on August 17, showing the Yankee Stadium crammed to the very limits. The picture was taken during the public discourse on August 3. The caption said that on the occasion of the great convention a quarter of a million people were assembled there. The Polish brothers were very glad to have this picture and to tell other people of the tremendous crowds of Jehovah’s witnesses that were assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One experience tells of an eight-year-old girl who is a regular publisher. While attending to two she-goats of her parents on the grass plot near her home she also was reading a very large Bible. Two young ladies passing by wanted to know what the big book was that the little girl was studying so earnestly. Approaching her one of the ladies said: “Little girl, your parents are Jehovah’s witnesses, aren’t they?” “Yes, they are,” she answered. “Then you are one of them too, aren’t you?” “Yes, I am.” The other young lady asked with an ironic smile: “Then your goats are also Jehovah’s witnesses, aren’t they?” “No,” said the young witness, “both goats are Roman Catholic." “How do you know that?” “Oh, I see that because neither of them is reading the Bible,” answered our young friend with great firmness. The first young lady now seized her companion by the arm and said: “Come along, it’s better we go before she pounces down on us again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the past year the interest on the part of persons in Poland has become very great. At Memorial time many, many thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses with interested persons assembled together to celebrate the death of Christ Jesus. One young man asked his manager in the plant where he worked if he could leave early to go to this service. On answering the manager’s question on what the reason was for his wanting to leave early he told him that Jehovah’s witnesses had invited him to attend this celebration. The manager told the young man that he was looking for Jehovah’s witnesses and had been doing so for the past three months but had not been able to locate them. He asked whether he might accompany the young man to the special meeting. He was accommodated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A baptism was arranged for in a bathing establishment in one of the cities of Poland and the onlookers totaled a thousand. Many were attracted by the songs of the singers. All were deeply impressed by what they saw. The next day the radio station of the city broadcast the following message to the journalists: “Press reporters! Where are you? You are found everywhere except where you ought to be. The whole city is talking about the baptism of Jehovah’s witnesses in the city baths, and none of you were there to report about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Then came the great New York assembly. Right at the beginning the Polish radio broadcast news about it. Thus we learned that 170,000 witnesses who came from 123 countries were present, ‘among them also a delegation from Soviet Russia.’ On July 31 the press reported that the day before 7,000 persons were immersed in the greatest collective baptism that had ever taken place. In Poland we also baptized 1,530 publishers in July, the greatest number ever immersed in one month in this country, but it was done in several places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Polish brothers through the Branch representatives send greetings to all their fellow workers throughout the world and say: “Together with you faithful coworkers we will continue to serve God’s people everywhere and seek the other sheep.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark131"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark275"></a>ROMANIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The past service year in Romania has been quiet. There has not been too much disturbance among the brothers as far as the government officials are concerned. There has been a steady ingathering and the organization has grown during the past twelve months. Quietly they go ahead preaching the good news. They have in mind what Paul says: “Who will separate us from the love of the Christ? Will tribulation or distress or persecution or hunger or nakedness or danger or sword? To the contrary, in all these things we are coming off completely victorious through him that loved us.” (Rom. 8:35, 37) The brothers have spent many more hours in preaching the good news this past year than in any previous year. They are indeed interested in preaching the Kingdom message and their main goal is to preserve unity among themselves and to find the other sheep. During the past year many more came to the Memorial than have gone out publishing, which shows that there are tremendous numbers interested in the good news, and a goodly number of Bible studies are being held weekly with those who are interested. While things are quieter and there have only been a few arrests and imprisonments, the brothers continue steadily keeping on the watch and doing the work that is assigned to them. They rejoice that they are a part of the great world-wide organization of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark133"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark276"></a>RUSSIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The secret police in Russia have done everything that they can to silence the witnesses, but everyone who hears the truth and finds that it brings great comfort to him desires to bring like comfort to others. It does not take him very long to feel like Paul, who said to Timothy: “The things you heard from me with the support of many witnesses, these things commit to faithful men who in turn will be adequately qualified to teach others.” (2 Tim. 2:2) The teaching work goes on, the preaching goes on from east to west and across the whole continent of Asia and Europe. For some time it appeared that the Russian police were trying to break down the witnessing by arresting everyone they could find, but recently it seems the policy has changed and now they just question people and let them return home. The ones they are really interested in, as they put it, “are the leaders, those who are directing the work within Russia,” and not the people who are doing the house-to-house witnessing. Another method they use is trying to scare people away from listening to the truth by giving great publicity through their newspapers about the terrible things Jehovah’s witnesses are doing. The papers contain horrifying lies about God’s servants and about the three presidents of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. It is useless on the part of the brothers to try to show the authors of these writings that their statements are wrong. All that can be done is to let the matter go without acknowledgment or saying anything about it except when people inquire and then to explain how matters really are. Those of good will will turn to the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is certainly no use for Jehovah’s witnesses to try to refute lies. Our purpose in life is to preach the good news and to declare the Kingdom message and bring comfort and hope to the people. So Jehovah’s witnesses throughout Russia are really occupied in a constructive work, not in trying to destroy a work that in itself is destructive. What the devilish organization is trying to do is build up a mistrust among the brothers so that they will think that within their own ranks there are hateful people, those who lie, those who are working for other governments, but if all of Jehovah’s witnesses keep their eyes on God’s Word, the Bible, and preach what he has commanded and continue to do the divine will, then the unity that exists among God’s people will continue and a much greater witness will be given throughout all this great territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been a splendid increase in the number of those who have taken up the preaching of the truth and those baptized during the year. It is marvelous to see how the work has continued to expand. So behind all the Iron Curtain there has been a steady increase, a wonderful ingathering, and it appears absolutely certain that before the battle of Armageddon strikes the witnesses of God in these lands will be wide awake, and just as the yeartext says for our 1959 meditation: “Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his parts of shame.” (Rev. 16:15) It certainly appears that our brothers throughout the area behind the Iron Curtain are still very much wide awake, active in their service and looking after Kingdom interests. Certainly they will have nothing to be ashamed of when Jehovah God strikes against the king of the north and brings him low at Armageddon. Our prayers go out for all these brothers and we make supplication to our heavenly Father in their behalf that they may be filled with holy spirit and be zealous even during their great time of trial.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark277"></a>COSTA RICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses in Costa Rica know that to love God is to obey his commandments. (1 John 5:3) During the past year they have proved their love by obeying the commandments and by announcing the good news of the Kingdom. Like Timothy they follow Paul’s admonition: “This beautiful trust guard through the holy spirit which is dwelling in us.” (2 Tim. 1:14) Because of the hard work on the part of the publishers during the last ten years practically every nook and corner of their territory is reached, but the witnesses in this land fire certain there fire more of the other sheep yet to be found. It was a joy to them, too, to have seventy delegates from Costa Rica attend the Divine Will assembly in New York. The Branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Practically all the thickly populated territory in the country is covered regularly, so there has been an effort to reach out into isolated places. A circuit servant arranged for a man with a small motorboat to take him to a group of small islands in the mouth of a river to visit the few inhabitants there. This territory had never been worked before but good interest was found. The people had very little money, but by trading for eggs and other foodstuff some literature was placed. Arrangements were made for a pioneer to make regular trips to visit these people and instruct them in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As in other parts of the world many parents do not take seriously the training of their children. This was noted by a special pioneer while conducting </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> study with a woman of good will. It was mentioned several times that the children should share in the study, but the woman always put the older ones to caring for the younger children. One boy, a youngster of thirteen years, always tried to listen from the adjoining room. One day this boy told the pioneer that the mother had left word that she would be unable to study for two or three months as she had to go to work outside the home. Then he asked if he could study. He is showing good progress and wants to study two or three times a week instead of the one hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another special pioneer reported studying with a couple that had lived together thirty years without being married, a very common condition in Catholic countries. This couple showed real appreciation for the truth, and after much difficulty arranged all their documents so that they could get legally married. They were baptized immediately after and were able to attend the international convention in New York. Now the wife is taking up vacation pioneering with the hope of continuing as a regular pioneer. Both fire very happy that they overcame their difficulties and became dedicated witnesses of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Showing what can be accomplished when there is a real love for the service is a congregation located in a swampy, isolated region. To work part of their territory some of these brothers will be gone from their homes five or six days, walking and witnessing the entire time. But in spite of such difficult territory, since its organization in 1954 this congregation has never failed to average a 20-percent increase and has more than eighteen hours and one study per publisher. The circuit servant reports that there is not a happier or more unified congregation in his circuit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark278"></a>CUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Many new persons loving truth and righteousness began publishing the good news of the Kingdom in Cuba this year. While there has been much internal strife among the political factions, still within Jehovah’s organization there has been peace and unity. “Abundant peace belongs to those loving your law, and for them there is no stumbling block.” (Ps. 119:165) By moving ahead peacefully in a disturbed land wonderful comfort can be brought to those who fire sighing and crying because of the distress and abomination within the country. Our brothers fire becoming more conscious of the necessity of conducting home Bible studies. There was a marked increase in this division of service during the past twelve months and it brought about excellent results. The Branch servant gives us some interesting experiences, showing the joy and progress of the brothers in Cuba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We never know just who may be benefiting from our preaching. One special pioneer used to eat at a certain cafe because the owners would listen to the message. A young employee working in the kitchen also was listening, although the special pioneer had given little attention to him. The employee became sick one day and during his following few days of illness he read and studied the truth very much. On seeing the special pioneer after recovering from his illness he wanted to go in the service. The owners of the cafe became opposers. The young man has become a publisher, and a pioneer at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We rejoice to see that our magazine placements have gone over the one-million mark, although much can still be done in this field. One district servant tells that many publishers he knows fire exchanging magazines for any kind of products, especially eggs and fruit, with very good results. They fire surpassing their quota of magazines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One sister who cannot read or write has thirty persons on her magazine route. Many publishers can do the same if they only try with faith in Jehovah and his organization. Also, magazine routes furnish many unusual and productive opportunities to feed the sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The congregations have taken firm action against immoral people. Over a hundred persons have been disfellowshiped. Those living unclean lives must either legalize their marriage, as in the case of consensual living, or be disfellowshiped. Many brothers have taken the right course to straighten up this problem; others chose disfellowshiping. One couple from Oriente writes how Jehovah God has blessed them spiritually after legalizing their marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This year has witnessed some of the strongest revolutionary activities on this island. We have to cancel assemblies occasionally now in the eastern part of the island due to the danger of bombs being thrown in a crowd of people. Also, constitutional guarantees and newspaper censorship have been greatly affected, the former being taken away and the latter put in effect. Ten days before the service year ended a circuit servant and a congregation servant disappeared in Oriente province, where there fire frequent clashes between the government’s forces and the rebels. We have six circuits in that province. As yet we have little information about them. Some seem to think that they fire prisoners in an army stockade, although army authorities deny this. Early in January one special pioneer publisher was brutally murdered in this province. One side blames the other for this crime. No one is certain as to who did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of these obstacles it was during the worst week of terrorist activity that Cuba reached a new peak in Memorial attendance—22,070! Thousands of brothers and also thousands of good-will persons put this annual celebration to Jehovah’s honor first!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thirty-nine different newspapers published 676 column inches of convention news in Cuba. Planes were chartered for the convention and four buses. Over 500 delegates from Cuba were present.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>CYPRUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The political situation in Cyprus became worse and more chaotic during the past year. Satan the Devil has tried to break the integrity of the brothers by bringing threats against them, even to the point of killing the witnesses. The Greek fanatics have tried to make Jehovah’s witnesses take a stand on their side against the Turks. This Jehovah’s witnesses refused to do, as they kept in mind the text for the year and their neutrality: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.” In the territory under the Cyprus Branch there fire many kinds of people: Greeks, Turks, British, Jews in Israel from all nations, as well as Arabs. But it makes no difference, for God’s servants appreciate the words of the psalmist: “Praise Jehovah, all you nations; commend him, all you clans.” (Ps. 117:1) It is Jehovah’s command to his people that they should preach the good news to all kinds of men and so the work goes on in hostile nations. Cyprus and Israel fire troubled lands and the Branch servant in Cyprus sets out some interesting experiences from both places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">People generally, including, naturally, brothers, fire now facing another danger—that of the Turks, who, when someone of their race is killed, turn their vengeance against any Greek they meet on their way. The two communities now live entirely separate. Greeks who once lived in peace in Turkish vicinities abandoned their homes and moved into the Greek vicinities for safety, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Witnessing in villages has become very difficult indeed. Young fanatic persons fire approaching all persons of good will, burning their books and magazines and threatening them that they will even burn their homes and kill them if they continue to accept Jehovah’s witnesses in their homes; they often cause disturbances, with the result that brothers fire driven out of the villages. On various occasions their transportation means, like cars, motorbikes and bicycles, were damaged considerably. Not all persons of good will, however, succumb. In one instance an old man in a village, who has now started to be a publisher, was warned that his wheat would not be threshed with their threshing machine but, on the contrary, burned if he would not cease to have fellowship with Jehovah’s witnesses. He did not give up. The government heard the story and did the threshing themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young American couple who learned the truth in Cyprus a few years ago have proved to be very zealous and theocratic. They opened their beautiful home for organized studies in English, with the result that as many as twenty now attend the meetings. Their car is in constant use taking brothers to the field and persons of good will to the meetings. The sister, although having to keep clean a big house and take care of two </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">very </span><span class="font7">young children of eight months and two years old, is very punctual in her service from door to door, back-calls and Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A high light of the year was that a congregation of almost a hundred publishers in a village of less than 2,000 people was able to build a beautiful and spacious Kingdom Hall. This they did entirely by means of their own contributions and hands, with the result that a building that would normally cost more than $8,000 cost only half that much. This Kingdom Hall was built under adverse conditions because the enemy tried to intimidate the brothers by threatening them that they would destroy it by bombs or fire immediately when it was completed. Brothers, however, like Nehemiah and his fellow workers, went on because they knew well the purpose for which they were tolling was to bring honor to Jehovah God and they could therefore trust in him for protection. When two marriages at the same time were performed in the hall last June, all its space was packed up with almost 300 persons in spite of the priest’s threatening with excommunications.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark280"></a>ISRAEL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the Society was able to send two more missionaries into the country, and we fire grateful for this help, as Israel is really a vast field with comparatively few publishers. This now brings our missionaries to a total of four, which means that they can, along with the help of local publishers, achieve much if they will abide in unity and love and if they will put all their heart and energy in seeking and feeding the Lord’s little sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A victory that was gained during the service year was that the government, after much struggle with our missionaries, approved of our being authorized to perform marriages, even if members of our organization were formerly Jews by religion. It is believed that the effect of the Divine Will assembly was great upon them, as, when one of our missionaries in course of conversation with some of the higher officials of the Ministry of Religion mentioned it, they said they were acquainted with this big event. It must have impressed them so much as to overlook the smallness of our community in Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two of our missionaries, while on board a Jewish ship on their way to the assembly, had the chance to give an excellent witness about the truth and the convention. A Jewish couple, fanatic Zionists, caused much trouble on the ship and ridiculously complained to the steward about permitting Christian missionaries on a Jewish ship. Their attitude aroused the interest of more passengers, who surrounded the brothers to hear more about the Messiah and the assembly. Some of them were quite impressed and promised to attend the assembly; a lady whom they met later by chance in downtown New York spontaneously said that she had been there and was amazed at the crowd.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark281"></a>DENMARK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There is a general attitude in Denmark running from indifference to resistance to religion and the Bible. This is a difficult thing to combat. Because of disbelief many individuals fire irritated because Jehovah’s witnesses visit their homes and try to encourage home Bible study. However, there fire still to be found many who want to gain everlasting life and, regardless of the attitude of the populace, Jehovah’s witnesses know that “this means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) So they preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Society has built and is now operating its own printing plant and we see a marked improvement in the distribution of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font8"> magazines, and undoubtedly 1959 will be better in this regard than 1958. More than 300 brothers and sisters were representatives of Denmark at the Divine Will assembly, and these delegates shared their happiness by relating experiences at their own great assembly in Copenhagen. The Branch servant gives interesting experiences from Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, all of which come under the jurisdiction of the Copenhagen Branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The activity of Jehovah’s witnesses in preaching arouses the interest of many good-will persons. One day a sister called on a Baptist woman who for more than thirty years had felt the need of greater religious activity in her church. She asked the sister in to talk about the Bible. A study was soon started in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font7"> This woman requested two studies a week and quickly progressed to the point of withdrawing from her church. The pastor visited her later, and in explaining why she thought better of Jehovah’s witnesses she said it was because they visit people and study the Bible with them. He said that he could study with her and that she could call God Jehovah and go from house to house and still be a Baptist. She explained that she had learned more in four months of study with Jehovah’s witnesses than in thirty years in the Baptist Church, including their special halfyear study course against Jehovah’s witnesses. That was the last she saw of the pastor, but she has progressed fine and attended our follow-up assembly in Copenhagen from beginning to end and has also begun to go from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although there is no unassigned territory in Denmark, there fire many small towns and rural districts that fire not worked very often by the small scattered congregations that fire assigned to these districts. To help them the congregations from the larger cities whose own territory is worked many times during the year accept an assignment to support a rural or small-town congregation during the summer. These brothers have had fine experiences spending many weekends working this territory, encouraging the publishers and helping them put on public talks. One congregation rented a large section of a camping place on the island of Bornholm for publishers to spend their vacation here. For many weeks during the summer this place was alive with theocratic activity as some came and others left, but the brothers not only had a fine vacation, they got better acquainted, they grew spiritually and accomplished good work.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark282"></a>FAROE ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In one small isolated village of about forty-eight inhabitants two special pioneers, a married couple, worked part of the territory and placed forty-two booklets and six magazines. Coming back four weeks later they placed seven books, eighteen magazines, obtained two subscriptions, had several fine back-calls and started one study. A Sunday-school teacher who had taken literature before came to them to get additional items. He said: “Now I don’t believe in the hell doctrine any more.” Quite a statement when one considers how deeply rooted this dogma is here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is with much difficulty that the pioneers visit this village, for the trip takes an hour by boat through rough, rocky, coastal channels, two hours of hard cycling and then one hour of vigorous hiking, but they visit here regularly to care for interested persons. The priest of the Danish church has less than a two-hour trip but he seldom visits his congregation here. The local parish clerk, a farmer, reads sermons each Sunday in church, but he wants to be better qualified to preach. Now the pioneers fire helping him with a Bible study so he will soon be able to preach the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the many fishing boats that come in at Thor-shavn for water and supplies fire several Russian boats. The Russian fishermen fire not permitted to leave their ships, but our brothers go down to the docks and walk along by the side of the boats—their “unassigned territory”—and hand up to all whom they see copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and booklets in Russian. Some persons often put such inside their jackets, perhaps to read later, while others take the literature up to the captain immediately.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark283"></a>GREENLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The result in staying many months in one village is shown in the fact that the pioneers were able to report up to fourteen well-established Bible studies in the area of Egedesminde, many of whom could speak and read only Greenlandic. By Memorial time two of the young Greenlandic men assembled with our two brothers to celebrate this together with Jehovah’s witnesses worldwide. After the Memorial talk was given these two young men related some of their experiences in telling what they knew of the truth to others, even in very isolated outposts. For several hours they discussed their problems with the pioneers and eagerly received much counsel and instruction on growing to maturity and being productive servants. It was well past eleven o’clock when the two went home, but the evening had been a great source of joy to these brothers, holding their Memorial away north of the Arctic Circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of these young Greenlanders has been especially active in preaching to others. One day, quite on his own initiative, he went to the one in charge of the hospital and got permission to read to a number of patients parts of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Good News of the Kingdom.” </span><span class="font7">Since then there have been many grateful expressions from these patients who found the message a source of joy and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One day this same young man was approached by the priest of the Danish church, who asked him angrily: “Is it true you have become one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” The young man replied: “I hope to be someday, but I have to learn more and be baptized before I can really be one of Jehovah’s witnesses.” The priest snapped: “There have been seventy persons already who have become Jehovah’s witnesses [an exaggerated number]. If you do this you will be cut off from all sacraments.” Later the priest ridiculed the young man, saying: “That new world Jehovah’s witnesses tell about will never come,”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark284"></a>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The fierce persecution that raged against the brothers last year drew a powerful glare of unfavorable publicity upon the Dominican Republic and the dictator of that land, Trujillo. The freedomhating Roman Catholic clergy were exposed through the thousands of letters of protest that came into the capital. This protest seemed to calm down the persecution considerably. The opening days of this service year were dark ones for the brothers in the Dominican Republic. They fire still under official ban and now for the first time in twelve years the brothers find themselves without any aid from Gilead-trained missionaries. Scores of brothers and sisters fire behind prison bars. Many others fire unemployed because of their religious beliefs. Mature brothers who fire still free look after the theocratic organization. Meetings fire held, underground of course, and the brothers fire gaining strength. The Kingdom proclamation continues and Jehovah’s rich blessing and holy spirit rest upon the brothers. While there has been a decline in the number of publishers, still those that fire strong fire helping those that fire weak. Our brothers in the Dominican Republic “go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God, being made powerful with all power.” (Col. 1:10,11) Here fire some of the things that fire happening in the Dominican Republic, as reported from one on the inside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is not easy to witness in a small country where spies abound. As one of the brothers in charge of the work put it: “Every time I go out in the service I just make up my mind that I’ll be put in jail and so I stop fearing it. We must use caution. But most of all we must use caution that we do not fail to preach God’s kingdom.” Though the number of publishers is still considerably lower than prior to the ban, it brings joy to see that it is steadily growing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Prison bars cannot take away the freedom with which Christ has set us free. A group of ten brothers and sisters were arrested in a raid by police in the home of a witness in the capital, Ciudad Trujillo, during the month of December. They were sentenced to three months in prison and a $100 fine. They were put in the main prison, La Victoria, where seventeen other witnesses were serving sentences, four of these being prisoners who had learned the truth after being put in jail. All together they made up one of the biggest and by far the most active of all the groups in the country. They averaged monthly 19.2 hours, over 17 back-calls, and .4 Bible studies per publisher, and in the months of March and April reported seven public meetings held inside the prison!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of the eighty-some brothers arrested since the ban, only about nineteen still remain behind bars, most of these serving two-year sentences. One brother of some sixty years of age died in the prison at Julia Molina, apparently from brutal treatment received from the guards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Dozens of families in the rural sections abandoned their homes and moved to the larger cities due to the fact that where they lived it had become nearly impossible to meet together and even more difficult to witness for God’s kingdom. In some places efforts were made to force parents and their children to attend the services of the Catholic Church. Keeping their integrity meant more to them than their homes and material possessions and so they ‘shook the dust of those places from their feet,’ left their homes behind, and gave God’s kingdom first place in their lives, trusting in Him to provide all needed things.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark285"></a>ECUADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Another year of walking in integrity has made the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Ecuador most eventful. They have been thinking of the apostle Paul’s counsel: “Do not loiter at your business. Be aglow with the spirit. Be slaves to Jehovah.” (Rom. 12:11) So together the special pioneers, pioneers and congregational publishers have pressed on preaching the good news. There is plenty of territory in Ecuador to work and the Branch office there has done well in helping persons who want to work where the need is great to leave their home countries and come into Ecuador. One of the experiences set out in the Branch servant’s report is about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We fire more than encouraged by the wonderful response to the Society’s call to serve where the need is great. In the course of this year we have received letters from some seventy families who fire desirous of filling the need in this country. Taking care of this correspondence has almost doubled the amount of work to be done in the Branch office, but the results bring us delight. Our missionaries, circuit servants and others fire constantly on the lookout for secular positions that these brothers might fill, and we fire happy to say that we already have four families working with us and another five fire due to arrive within two weeks. We fire thrilled to have them, and they fire also happy to have the privilege of working in territory where the need is so evident. Most of them find that they have more time for field service in this new assignment and five of them fire working as pioneers. One of these just wrote to say: &quot;What the brothers back in England would give for just a little bit of this territory!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Among the forty-six delegates to the Divine Will assembly in New York there was one brother who was attending his first assembly and who had learned the truth only a short time before the convention. Having seen the name Jehovah in a book, he set himself to find out more about who Jehovah is. Not knowing that there were brothers in his own city, he traveled some hundred miles to the capital to search for a people called by Jehovah’s name. On locating them he procured some literature and began to study. A regular Bible study was started with him in his own city. Along came the news of the convention and to be there was the one thing in his mind. Not only was he there but he was the one Ecuadorian candidate among the throng of baptized ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another outstanding evidence of how the brothers fire endeavoring to walk in integrity is the higher appreciation of the lofty Biblical standards on morals. So many brothers who could not be accepted previously for baptism have taken steps to legalize their marriages this year. Even in the short time spent in writing this report four couples have stood before the government’s marriage officer to properly formalize their union. In fact, this officer reports that of all the marriages that he has performed this year, one third of them were for Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark286"></a>EGYPT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Even though there has been constant unrest in this section of the world and, further, Christendom’s clergy have led the campaign of wicked misrepresentation against Jehovah’s witnesses, trying to disrupt the work and bring about conditions that might cause the banning of the organization, still Jehovah’s witnesses preach and have freedom to do so. The authorities in Egypt have shown that they fire not willing to listen to the lies of the clergy, and a goodly number of people fire anxious to learn what the Bible has to say. Due to earnest endeavor by the witnesses of God they have in mind Paul’s advice: “Keep your balance in all things, . . . thoroughly accomplish your ministry.” (2 Tim. 4:5) The publishers in Egypt and the Sudan must certainly use the spirit of a sound mind in presenting the good news and this they have done with success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That “a faithful envoy is a healing” not only spiritually but also mentally can be seen in the case of a middle-aged person that remained shut in his room for two years because of a severe mental breakdown. Psychiatric treatment had failed him. He had become an extremely introverted person and had to stay home for more than eight years. His reading of the Bible for twenty-eight years had not helped him either; he needed assistance to get the truth from Jehovah’s Word. He was then contacted by a publisher in the house-to-house work and soon thereafter a regular Bible study was started. After a year of study both he and his wife were baptized. The man who did not want to meet people because of his severe nervous condition now conducts seven Bible studies every week. He is no more a gloomy, egocentric, mentally sick person but an active and joyful publisher of the good news reporting as much as eighty-five hours a month and serving as a congregation book study conductor. Truly, “pleasant sayings fire a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and a healing to the bones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Kindness brings results. A Jewish lady whose husband has been in the truth for many years never took her stand with the New World society. It happened that she fell sick while her husband was away on business. A couple of special pioneers paid her a visit showing loving care. That gave them an opportunity to discuss Daniel chapter nine. The lady was thereby convinced that Jesus is the Messiah. A few months later she was immersed, then engaged in vacation pioneering and now enjoys the full-time ministry as a regular pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tracts should not be underestimated. In an unassigned territory a young man wrote to the Society after having read a tract, and a special pioneer was asked to call on him. The young man was very glad to have the special pioneer call on him, because no lectures were given to him but rather Bible discussions in which he could have a share. His family and friends uselessly tried to interfere with his study of Jehovah’s Word. He was so thrilled with the New World information he got that he began talking to those who had hearing ears. Within a short period of time he had contacted twenty different persons with whom he placed fourteen books and fourteen booklets in different languages. He continues to talk to all his acquaintances about his finding the treasure of truth. All this because of an initial tract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Youthful ministers can certainly do much in gathering the Lord’s other sheep. A sixteen-year-old student had raised several Bible points during the religion classroom study. When the teacher happened to comment on Jesus’ words, “Happy fire the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth,’’ the student asked him how he could harmonize this with the statement that good Christians will all go to heaven. The many questions he asked the teacher stirred the interest of several classmates and he arranged a regular Bible study with two of them besides the numerous discussions with others. The teacher sought to have the young publisher dismissed from school because of his embarrassing questions and complained to the schoolmaster. This, however, resulted in the giving of a good witness. Booklets were later placed and back-calls made right in the schoolmaster’s room,</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark156"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark287"></a>SUDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The little group of twelve publishers is doing its best to meet the spiritual needs of the people. Exceptionally great is the need for more workers. Being a new independent republic, the Sudan can use the services of many a technician, and it is hoped that it will be possible to have some foreign brothers help the publishers there under the provision of serving where the need is great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society periodically sends full-time ministers from Egypt to help the publishers there. During the year we were glad to be able to send a special pioneer and then a missionary that stayed in the country three months each. Both were a great help to the Khartoum congregation, and now one of the local publishers has enrolled in the regular pioneer service and is doing an excellent work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Sudan was one of the countries represented at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Two of the twelve publishers managed to join the world delegates to the assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark288"></a>EIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In spite of the many difficulties and troubles encountered in preaching the truth in Eire the Irish brothers remain optimistic about the future of the New World society in Ireland. Having in mind that it is a responsibility of God’s servants to plant and water and that it is Jehovah who gives the increase, they continue to preach, firm in the hope that those who are of good will and who show a sheeplike disposition will come out of the old system of things and move on into the new. Anyone who is seeking wisdom from God’s Word will certainly find it and gain life, just as the wise man said: “For the one finding me [wisdom] will certainly find life, and gets good will from Jehovah. But the one missing me is doing violence to his soul; all those intensely hating me are the ones that do love death.” (Prov. 8:35, 36) The publishers of the Kingdom are enjoying fine experiences, and a few of them are reported here by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Interested people are not easy to find in Ireland and the brothers have learned to follow up the least spark of interest. A young lady took magazines from a sister in England, but when the sister returned the following week to make the back-call she found them moving. They were moving to Eire. The lady was willing to give the sister her new address but the husband was reluctant. Knowing the bigotry and intolerance of many in Ireland, he was fearful of jeopardizing his new job. However, he relented and the address was given. A special pioneer sister newly assigned to this town was given the call to follow up. A study was immediately started with the young lady and her mother, who was living with her. They came to the public talk on Sunday and the husband accompanied them. When the sister went for the next study she was asked if she could come at a different time as the husband would also like to study the Bible. His love for the truth soon overshadowed his fear of losing his job. Both he and his wife were immersed six months later at the next circuit assembly. The mother is also progressing in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today the brothers in Eire sometimes find themselves cultivating the seeds of truth sown many years ago by faithful brothers. Almost ten years ago a brother and his family left their home in Ireland and moved to England. The witness work ceased in this town, but they had left behind a young man who had studied and shown interest in the truth. The years passed and then in the summer of this year two special pioneers were assigned to work this town. One day the brother walked into this young man’s shop and presented the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines to him. He was delighted to contact Jehovah’s witnesses again and immediately subscribed for both magazines. When a study was started with him he asked which book would help him the most in giving a witness to the people. His wife, an ardent Catholic, was fearful of the damage it would do to his business, but he was undaunted and has found that people listen to him very readily as he witnesses to all he meets. His business has not suffered at all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark289"></a>EL SALVADOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There are a goodly number of persons in El Salvador who have the hope of everlasting life in God’s new world. Like others of Jehovah’s witnesses they are lovable, enthusiastic people and have a childlike eagerness to learn. They show this eagerness so much that fifty-three delegates from El Salvador came to the Divine Will assembly. Twenty-six of these delegates were natives of El Salvador, and for many of them it was their first trip outside their country. They were amazed at what they saw at Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds during the eight days of the great gathering. But now back in their assignment they remember: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves.” (Eph. 5:15, 16) The reports of the Branch servant show that they are really doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work being done by Jehovah’s witnesses has gone far and wide in this country of over 2,000,000 people. The effects have been felt even in parts where we have never penetrated as yet. Such was the case when a person living in a far-off village took home the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> when it was placed with him during a visit to the capital, San Salvador. At home he became involved in a religious discussion with a friend and, not being able to answer his friend’s questions, he gave him the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font7"> which he had not read himself, and said: “Here, take this and read it. It may help you.” The friend took the book home and read it. The more he read the more he thought to himself: “Why, that’s just the way I believe!” As he read the chapter on “Caesar’s Things to Caesar,” he mused to himself: “Why, that’s just the way I have thought all along.” “That’s right!” The more he read the more he liked it, and finally he said to himself: “Why, I must be one of Jehovah’s witnesses and don’t know it!” He set out to find some more who believed the same way, and did so in San Salvador, where the book was placed originally. He was directed to the Branch office, where he had further questions answered about our work and took more literature to study at home in his faraway village. He wanted to be baptized, but upon questioning him, it was learned that he is not legally married to the woman with whom he is living. Further communications with the Branch, though, have indicated that he has set about to get the necessary papers to legalize his marriage to this woman by whom he has two children, and then he wants to publicly symbolize his dedication to Jehovah by water baptism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite a Catholic-sponsored public-address-system warning to the people not to have anything to do with Jehovah’s witnesses, one lone special pioneer in the village of Opico, in the interior, continues in his door-to-door ministry. During one afternoon’s witnessing he was followed and finally accompanied by a man carrying a machete at his side for the purpose of intimidating our brother. The man kept berating Jehovah’s witnesses and their beliefs. This person, the leader in the local Catholic organization called “Gentlemen of Christ the King,” was asked if he had ever read the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses. The answer was no. Our brother said: “Then, how do you know what I believe? You cannot tell by looking at me what I believe any more than I can tell by looking at you what you believe. You have come to me with a machete to convince me that I am wrong in my views when you do not even know my views, for you have not investigated them. I do not even have a razor blade and do not need one, for I fear and trust only in Jehovah. It is the word of truth, the Bible, that I should like to use in showing you what I believe.” With that the brother opened a discussion so amazing to the man that he finally agreed that in order to be a real “Gentleman of Christ the King” he should study the Bible, and arrangements were made to have the brother come to his house for that very purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vacations are usually spent doing something other than the usual, but not so with Brother L----, a special</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">pioneer minister in the city of Atiquizaya. Relatives belonging to the Church of God had written from the neighboring country of Guatemala wanting to know more about his being one of Jehovah’s witnesses. His fleshly brother, in fact, was the pastor of a Church of God congregation. Brother L--- decided to spend his</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">two-week vacation visiting his people and witnessing to them. When he arrived they immediately began to ask him all manner of questions about the beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses, and his brother was impressed with his answers to the point of wanting him to talk to his congregation that night. One hundred and forty persons were present to hear the brother discuss “How the Bible Solves Life’s Problems,” and on subsequent occasions he was heard by 200 persons and then fifty as he further discussed the Scriptures with them and they followed along with their own Bibles. His pastor-brother now says that Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ones that are preaching the truth. He has quit his pastorship and now wants to really study the Bible with Jehovah’s witnesses. It was a busman's holiday, so to speak, for Brother L----, but such an enjoyable one that he could hardly</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">wait to write the Branch about his experiences when he got back to his assignment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark290"></a>ETHIOPIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">When one reads Paul’s description of trials and difficulties that he went through one thinks of our brothers in Ethiopia. Paul’s words are quite fitting for some of our faithful Ethiopian brothers serving in that country. Paul said he was “in dangers from my own race, in dangers from the nations, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers.” (2 Cor. 11:26) This is true concerning the faithful followers of Christ Jesus in this land</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">in Africa. In spite of these difficulties that have haunted our brothers day and night there has been progress and increase, for which all express their heartfelt gratitude to the Most High. Here are some of their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Trials and tribulations, though difficult to bear at times, have their good points in that they bring a test upon the true heart condition of those who profess to serve Jehovah God. Following the ban on our work last year there were many upheavals inside the organization. Some became fearful and scattered, while others became rebellious against the Society’s representatives and even brought some of the faithful into government courts, accusing them of working for an illegal organization. Others have suffered imprisonment for their faith, while police continue to follow still others. One brother was not only driven from his home but was even driven away from his own village because of his religion, and he reports that despite protests made by him before the officials no action has yet been taken by them to correct the wrong and protect his rights. But all these persecutions have simply served to strengthen the faithful and to rid the organization of many “tares&quot; who were trying to corrupt it from within.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Our brothers appreciate the many letters that freedom-loving people from all parts of the world wrote in protesting the ban on our work and the deportation of the Society’s missionaries, but thus far these letters have only brought forth the anger of top officials who oppose the message preached by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An example of rewards for faithful endurance in right works can be seen from the following experience: One of our brothers became ill and had to enter a local hospital for treatment. Because there were several other patients in the same room with him, our brother immediately looked upon these as his temporary “territory&quot; from which to seek out more of the Lord’s “other sheep.” In the weeks that followed, all these patients received a thorough witness concerning Jehovah’s name, purposes and established kingdom. A regular Bible study was begun with two patients who showed intense interest in this new message that they were hearing. Being confined to their hospital room day and night, they saw no better way to use their time than to have their Bible study daily, thus taking in as much knowledge as possible while they had time on their hands. By the time one of the patients had recovered sufficiently to leave he had decided to take his stand for the truth and was immersed in symbol of his dedication immediately upon his release from the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Restrictions are increasing and conditions are becoming more difficult, but, like Paul, our faithful Ethiopian brothers can say: “For [we are] convinced that neither death nor life nor angels nor governments nor things here nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creation will be able to separate us from God’s love that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” —Rom. 8:38, 39.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark291"></a>FINLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Again an excellent witness has been given in Finland, that land to the north, which on a map appears to go to the very top of the earth. The people in this land have accepted the truth in great numbers and ‘they continue applying themselves to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching.’ (1 Tim. 4:13) From this faraway land of Finland 268 were able to get to the New York convention, and since then they have rejoiced over their own local Divine Will assemblies, two in the Finnish and one in the Swedish language. So they continue studying the Word of God and as they gain greater knowledge they preach it to others. The report of the Branch servant shows what they have been doing in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are conscious that home Bible studies are undoubtedly the best way to find the sheep even though we are sometimes not able to use any provision other than the Bible. One lady was interested in the Bible but did not want to hear a thing about the Society’s literature. The publisher explained that they could study just the Bible, which the lady approved. The study had continued for some weeks when the lady asked the publisher what was the secret to helping her find the places in the Bible quickly for each of the subjects studied. The publisher revealed the secret. She had held the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> in her lap during the study without the lady’s seeing it, as she sat on the other side of the table. Using the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> as an aid, the publisher had chosen subjects and discussed the scriptures that were in the book, explaining the meaning of them to the lady. After this the lady wanted to talk about the Society’s publications; she wanted one for herself immediately, and she wanted to do door-to-door work also, offering them to others. She said: &quot;How can I get along without </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and the Society’s publications?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There has been opposition, but it too has a favorable effect at times. One of the publishers was forbidden to work in a group of apartment houses. The prohibition came from the manager of the buildings. As the publisher was explaining the legality of the work he was treated violently and a policeman was called who stood up for the manager and took the publisher to the police station. The situation finally developed so that it had to be taken to higher officials, and the result from the consultation was that one of the higher police officers took up the side of Jehovah’s witnesses, defending the legality of their work, stating that he had known them for forty years. The situation got worse and finally an endeavor was made to get the tenants’ opinion built up against Jehovah’s witnesses. The owner of the building together with the police officer first mentioned wanted to continue hindering the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. The owner went from door to door getting the names of those who did not want Jehovah’s witnesses coming to their homes and he called the police again on seeing Jehovah’s witnesses coming there again to preach. The police tried to hinder the work but just at that moment one of the windows opened in the building and one of the apartment owners called out: &quot;Are you Jehovah’s witnesses?” and on receiving an affirmative answer he added: “Come up to us; at least you can preach here.” The policeman was left helpless, and muttered: “If you are directly requested into a person’s home, that I can’t prevent.” The owner said later that he had obtained fifty-two names out of the 120 apartment owners and admitted that there were tenants in the building that wanted to be in contact with Jehovah’s witnesses. He has not tried to interfere in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses since his defeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Family theocratic activity is also to be taken note of as it also is of great importance. One family had requested from a school organization an English girl who had come year by year to their home in connection with a student exchange to keep company with their daughter who wished to learn English. To this young foreigner the family was different from the ordinary. No one smoked. The day was begun with prayer and the daily text. Certain evenings were reserved for meetings and others for preaching in people’s homes. It was explained to the girl what was being done and the special zeal and enthusiasm of this family for the truth made a strong impression on her, to the extent that she began to study for herself. She stopped smoking; attending meetings became interesting although she did not understand the language, and she wanted to go out preaching with others. The months went by quickly and time came for going back home, but excitement grew as to what they would say back home. Anyway, she had decided to make immediate contact with Jehovah’s witnesses, which she did. Her surprise was great on finding out that the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s witnesses was only a five-minute walk from her home, yet she had to travel all the way to Finland in order to get the truth. Now she has two studies of her own and has also symbolized her dedication by water immersion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark292"></a>FRANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Twenty-three new congregations have been formed and many isolated groups of publishers have been established in France during the past twelve months. A new peak of 12,141 publishers was reached, but still there is much isolated territory in this large country. It is the truth that “the tongue of wise ones does good with knowledge” (Prov. 15:2), and the brothers throughout France know that their big responsibility is to reach the other sheep class with knowledge of God’s kingdom. Many of them have transferred from one section of France to another and have gone into sections where the need for publishers is great. The Branch office in Paris not only takes care of the work in France but also gives us reports on Algeria, Cameroun, French Guinea, Senegal and Tunisia. Some of these places are small as far as the number of publishers is concerned, but it is with small beginnings that great work is done throughout the world. The report is interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The following letter comes from vacation pioneers: “I am happy to be able to tell you of our activity as vacation pioneers in unassigned territory. We were ten vacation pioneers—the youngest ten years old and the oldest sixty-five years old. We could not find accommodation in the territory assigned to us, so, undaunted by the inclement weather, we decided to camp from place to place. Jehovah directed our steps and we did not have need even for the tent. On arrival in the territory we found a farmer who gave us the use of his barn. Then one day we met an elderly sister who was able to put us in touch with an interested family with whom we found accommodation, and while with them we were able to strengthen them in the truth. From this family alone five persons participated in the field service and one of them put in eighteen hours’ service in one week. The father of this family has requested the Society to send someone to help them and has put a large room at the disposal of the publisher.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another letter says: “After hearing the calls from the Society during the assemblies to serve where the need is great, my wife and I decided to leave our home town and go where the need is great. We had thought of going to a foreign country where the call for help is urgent but, seeing that we have two children, aged three and four, we were obliged to defer such a decision. After discussing this matter with the circuit servant, we decided to go to Annecy, where there was just one pioneer sister and a small group of isolated publishers. We got in touch with the sister in order to find work and accommodation. After much effort she found me a job but no accommodation. In spite of this we decided to leave our home town, where I had a good situation and where we lived in a new house. Furthermore, my employer offered me an increase in salary if I would stay and work for him. We made our decision to move out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We sold all we had and arrived in Annecy, where we had to spend the first night in a hotel. The next day I went to look for a room. That same day I found two furnished rooms for $38 a month. Now after five months we are living in a nice apartment, and next month I will change my employment for I have found something better. We have all we need; we lack nothing. When we arrived in this town there was no confnegation, for there was just the pioneer sister and a ew persons of good will. A month later we organized a baptismal service for the immersion of three brothers and one sister. Shortly afterward the circuit servant visited us and an application to form a congregation was made. It was accepted and now we have a congregation of seventeen publishers. In April we had a 100-percent increase. There is a fine spirit in the congregation and we are all working for further increase. There is much to do for the brothers we have found, for they need to be brought on to maturity. My wife and I had the joy of conducting a study with a lady and her two children. She had known of the truth for some time but had not seen the privilege of engaging in the field service. We explained to her how necessary it was to have a share in gathering in the Lord’s ‘other sheep.’ She was grateful for the explanation and gladly agreed to accompany us in the field service. Her sons also came with us in the field service and now they are all regular publishers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">From the thickly populated north of France, where there is the most concentrated number of publishers, comes this report from a circuit servant: “I would like to tell you of something extraordinary that has just happened in my circuit. The Wattrelos congregation, which has now been split up into three units, works its local territory once a month. The brothers and even the servants were saying that there were hardly any people of good will left and placements were becoming increasingly difficult. When the training program was put into operation and closely followed by the congregation servant and his assistants, then a great change was brought about. As a result of the circuit servants’ refresher course in Paris I began to counsel the brothers concerning the training program. During seven months forty persons of good will in the local territory have become publishers, and at the circuit assembly eighteen brothers from one unit alone symbolized their dedication by water immersion. I think this is wonderful!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark293"></a>ALGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">This experience shows the need for following up the placement of magazines. One of the special pioneers writes: ‘‘Some time ago I placed some copies of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">with a lady who owns a store. I called back shortly afterward and found she was interested and agreed to subscribe for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> Then I arranged to start a study with her in the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Let God Be True.’</span><span class="font7"> However, this lady was often absent when I called to conduct the study with her. So one day I told her that if she could not keep her appointment for the study, I would not come to see her any more. From that time forward she received me regularly. Later I had to leave Algiers, so I handed this study over to another sister. A few months later this lady wrote to me the following: ‘I am delighted to be able to tell you that I am going to be baptized next Sunday. I have gradually come to see my obligations. I now attend the meetings regularly. How things have changed from the time when I used to be absent when you came to conduct the study with me! How I regret the precious time I lost when I could have been in your company for the study! I bitterly regret all this and wish to thank you with all my heart for having had the courage to shake me out of my ignorance and stupor. Where should I be now if you had not insisted? How necessary it is to be firm with certain &quot;sheep.” * ” “And what is more,” writes the pioneer, “I had the joy of meeting this sister and her husband at the district assembly in Paris.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effectiveness of the home Bible studies is shown by the faithful service of another special pioneer, who writes as follows: “I conducted a home Bible study with a man of good will for some time, but when I saw that he did not make any move to attend the meetings or to engage in the service, I dropped the study. Later in the house-to-house work I contacted a couple and began a home Bible study. It progressed well. After a few months this couple informed me that they had a cousin who had heard of me and would like me to call on him. I called on him and after an interesting discussion a home Bible study was arranged. Then I learned that this person had heard of me through the person I had abandoned. Now that the study was started this same person would like to take up again a study of the truth. So he was invited to come to his cousin’s home to join the study that was a result of his own recommendation. Four months later the couple I contacted in preaching from house to house were immersed. Then the man I had abandoned was immersed a short while after and his wife, also the cousin and his wife. All of these are now publishers and are attending the meetings regularly in Algiers.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark294"></a>CAMEROUN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The special representative of the Society who visited Cameroun during one of the district assemblies reports on the method of study to show how the language barrier is overcome. He reports: “In all studies except those in English, the book used is in French. The French language is not used in the study, but the conductor himself translates the questions extemporaneously and the reader translates from the French as he goes along. This sounds very difficult, but the brothers have developed the ability to do it and also prepare carefully beforehand.” In this way the brothers in Cameroun get the spiritual food in their own language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We have twenty-five special pioneers in Cameroun and they are doing good work, as is shown by the following report: “A few days after the arrival of a special pioneer in his assignment, all the population were informed of his presence, including the religious ‘wolves.’ The first pastor who heard of his arrival advised all his flock and warned them of a false prophet. At the outset the special pioneer got a cool reception, so much so that he thought that he might get chased out of town. However, he persevered in spite of remarks such as: ‘We knew about you even before you came here. You will certainly find no one who will be crazy enough to associate with you.’ The brother persevered three months without finding even a single person who showed interest and who could share in his happiness in serving Jehovah. Even so, he was not to be discouraged. He kept on in the work and at the end of a year he had found twenty persons of good will and, of these, eight were publishers reporting regularly each week.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another letter reads: “All my family were Protestants and I had a position of responsibility in the church—I was the secretary-general. I was in a good position to become the president of the congregation. One day I was called on by a pioneer and I soon learned that the position I held in the church could never bring me everlasting life. During the celebration of the Lord’s Supper in the church I made it a point to be absent. My husband asked me why I, in the position I held in the church, was absent from such an important ceremony. For reply I simply told him to read Psalm 69:22, 23. Soon all my former friends were against me except my husband. The pastor, the elders of the church and other dignitaries of the church came to advise me and to encourage me to stay on in the church. But I stood firm, thanks to the pioneer who came to visit me. I was thus comforted and became strong in the truth. I persevered, and the result is that my husband, my children and all the family now form a fine study center. We have already begun to preach from house to house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Cameroun also had delegates at the Divine Will International Assembly. There were three to make the long journey from Cameroun up to Paris and from there by charter plane to New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark295"></a>FRENCH GUINEA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There is a population of over 2,000,000 in French Guinea, but the number of Jehovah’s witnesses is only two—thus one witness for 1,000,000 population. These two publishers are brothers and both live in Conakry, the capital. Both are colored. One is over sixty years old and the other is in his early thirties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Now the Society has arranged for a special pioneer to visit them. This was a wonderful encouragement to them, for the pioneer showed them how to prepare a sermon, how to present the publications, how to make back-calls and how to conduct home Bible studies.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark296"></a>SENEGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There is just one small congregation of twenty-two publishers in the whole of Senegal. This congregation is in Dakar. Thus these publishers are truly isolated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister contacted a man who showed good interest in the truth. She called back on this man and found that his wife also showed interest, in fact, more than the husband. A study was started but the husband did not attend because of his work in an adjoining room. However, he could hear the discussion and one day he came in to the study because he was so impressed. This couple made good progress in the truth, came to the meetings, began to preach and were baptized. By correspondence they tried to preach to their parents in Algeria. Only the parents of the sister showed a little interest and subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> Later the brother and sister went to spend their vacation with the sister’s parents. When the mother and father heard the truth from the lips of their daughter, they became very interested. The sister began a study with them. This man and his wife came to Paris and attended the district assembly and were both thrilled at what they saw and heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The special pioneer and his wife, who is a general pioneer, had the joy of attending the Divine Will International Assembly in New York. Thus isolated Senegal had two able delegates who have now returned to their assignment strengthened and uplifted by that great assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark170"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark297"></a>TUNISIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There is just one small congregation in Tunisia and this is to be found in Tunis, the capital. Being somewhat isolated, it was a great joy for these brothers to be visited by the circuit servant, who was able to show them the film “The Happiness of the New World Society.” There was a fine attendance of 120, which shows that there is much interest in Tunis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer conducted a home Bible study for some months with a tailor who did not seem to make much progress. One day while the brother was conducting the study two young ladies came to visit the tailor. He introduced them to the brother. One of these ladies was the tailor’s sister. The pioneer explained the purpose of his visit and these two young ladies showed keen interest. They attended the following studies at the tailor’s home and one of them began to preach after only two months of study. As for the tailor, he stated: “Now I feel ashamed. My sister who would not listen to me has now become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. As soon as I can arrange my affairs I too will make that decision.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another experience reads as follows: “A young interested man began to associate with the congregation and showed much zeal. He began to talk to his wife, but she being a fervent Catholic would not listen to him. The brothers counseled this man not to force the truth on his wife. Later he began to preach from house to house, and this enraged his wife. Later his wife’s mother died and this gave the husband a fine opportunity to witness to his wife. This time she was shaken and began to attend the meetings with her husband. He patiently continued to explain the truth to her. He engaged openly in the preaching work, and his wife is now attending the meetings regularly and is very impressed by the fine spirit that exists in the congregation. This calls to mind the words of Paul: “Husband, how do you know but that you will save your wife?” —1 Cor. 7:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tunisia also had its delegates at the Divine Will International Assembly in New York. From the small congregation of about thirty publishers there were three delegates.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark298"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark299"></a>FRENCH EQUATORIAL AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is a difficult thing to train the African people and to bring them around from their old customs to following the simple teachings of the Bible. The Catholic and Protestant religions have been allowing the peoples of the different lands to do as they please just as long as they become followers of their particular faith. Momentary conversion is not the important thing, but it is learning the truth and sticking with it. If one does not live the truth after learning it from God’s Word he will go back to the same thing that he was before. “The saying of the true proverb has happened to them: ‘The dog has turned back to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.’ ” (2 Pet. 2:22) Jehovah’s witnesses should not allow this to occur to those professing the truth. If they do follow such a course they are put out of the organization. Our brothers in Africa see the importance of keeping clean and living morally correct and preaching the good news of the Kingdom. A report on the work in French Equatorial Africa follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For a long time the witnesses of Jehovah living in the cities have attracted much attention by their manner of living according to the principles of the Bible. The Catholics and the Protestants practice the festivities of circumcision and the dances of fetishism for the deceased ones, whereas the African witnesses of Jehovah broke long ago with these heathen practices. Wherever congregations were formed, the committees watched carefully to keep the assembly clean and to be sure the candidates for baptism were clean morally and had sufficient knowledge of the fundamental doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although the government is not opposing our work and we can meet freely, it is not possible to use the publications of the Society, with the exception of the theocratic concordance and a few booklets and the special Sunday study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This year, for the first time, we could assemble together in a circuit assembly authorized by the government. Measures have been taken for three assemblies in this territory. The assembly at Brazzaville was a great feast for the brothers and sisters; many of them had to walk hundreds of kilometers to attend. The peak attendance was 7,810 persons, and 294 were immersed. Now we wait for the results of the assemblies in Bangui and Pointe-Noire that will be held shortly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark300"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark301"></a>WEST GERMANY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The year 1958 was a significant year of intense training and teaching, since the Society has taken up the slogan “better and more ministers” as its goal. The publishers are proving themselves to be more skillful workers and they are able to meet the obstacles that are presented from time to time with greater success. Our German brothers have always felt: “Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news!” (1 Cor. 9:16) And this they have been doing with the aid of books, booklets and especially magazines. Great was the joy for 1,626 of our German brothers who were delegates to the New York assembly. Since then they have been able to relate many experiences to the assemblies held in Germany. The Branch servant at Wiesbaden gives us some interesting experiences along with his lengthy report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a sister’s territory there was a Protestant home for old people and incurable people. For a long time she was reluctant to call at this house, feeling somewhat restrained because she had been told it was fully in vain to call there since Jehovah’s witnesses had been rudely refused before. But one day when accompanied by a brother she entered the building thinking that the good news had to be brought also to the people living there. Asked what the purpose of their visit was, she answered: “We would like to speak to the people here about God’s Word the Bible.” They got free passage into the house with the words: “Please go to room 10; there is a girl that is interested in such things.” And indeed, they there found a girl for many years completely paralyzed who showed great interest in the truth and said that she had heard much about Jehovah’s witnesses and had asked repeatedly why nobody called on her. She even had had the intention to write to the Society, but then had failed doing so simply because she believed God himself would help her find the way to the truth. At the occasion of this first visit a home Bible study was started. Since that time this paralytic girl has made good progress in the knowledge of God’s Word and is on the way to becoming a praiser of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In order to increase the number of home Bible studies, it is necessary to be alert. The publishers have to take advantage of every opportunity, be it in favorable or unfavorable season, and often just a tract is the starting point for a home Bible study. A brother has reported a visit with an interested woman who, because of an unknown reason, did not want to accept any literature. Later he found out that she had not taken anything because her mother, who opposes the message, was present. The brother left a few tracts and carefully noted the address and soon called back. This time he met the interested woman alone and was able to speak to her and provide her with some further study aids. At the second back-call a study was started. Soon the young woman recognized her responsibility and told other people of her hope, and now she is preaching alone from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At another place, a sister, while waiting in the waiting room of a physician, managed to give a woman a tract just before she was called in to the doctor. One year later when the sister was going from house to house she met the lady again. At once she recognized the sister and was extremely happy to meet her. A week later a home Bible study was started with her. Now five members of the family are baptized and are preaching the good news.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark302"></a>GHANA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In Africa there are many persons who are illiterate and therefore need extraordinary care and help. Sometimes after individuals come into the truth there is a drifting away from the organization because they have not been brought on to maturity in their appreciation of the new world and its Creator, Jehovah. Those who are thoroughly grounded in the truth and who have an understanding, and particularly the overseers, must remember Paul’s words to the Galatians: “Really, then, as long as we have time favorable for it, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those related to us in the faith.” (Gal. 6:10) Everyone must realize his chief responsibility for the spiritual lives of our brothers and aid them in every respect. They must be prepared for baptism by being brought to maturity, and after baptism they must continue to study so that they may be firm. Overseers certainly have a responsibility. The Branch servant in Ghana reports on territory under his jurisdiction, which includes Ghana, Gambia, Ivory Coast and French Togoland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To be baptized in symbol of one’s dedication is a serious matter and the one being baptized should have a full knowledge of what he is undertaking. This requires study of God’s Word and active association with His organization. To insure that each candidate for baptism is in a good position to realize fully the importance of the step he is taking by symbolizing his vow to serve Jehovah forever, it has been required that the individual be associated with Jehovah’s witnesses no less than six months prior to the time of baptism and he is to have completely studied through the publication </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> with a witness. This gives the person a good foundation knowledge and appreciation. Each congregation servant has the responsibility to insure that a proper Bible study is conducted with new ones during this first six months of association. This has greatly aided us in overcoming the weakness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The effect of these requirements for baptism has been to weed out those who were being baptized because ‘we like to be baptized,’ those who were being baptized as a passing fancy, as a ‘good thing,’ as it were. Only those persons who have their hearts set on doing Jehovah’s will and are determined to dedicate their lives to him are now being baptized, and once baptized they are staying true to their dedication vow because of their mature understanding of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More than 70 percent of the people in our field are illiterate; they can neither read nor write. Many of those taking their stand for the truth are among these illiterate ones. With such a high percentage of illiteracy and so many languages and dialects to contend with, the problem of teaching reading and writing is a big one. However, this, too, has been coped with during the year and with good success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Regular literacy classes, held once or even twice each week, were begun in all congregations throughout the territory. The government has a “Mass Education” program in effect and an agreement was made for them to train our literacy teachers free of charge and supply the necessary readers and charts for literacy instruction at a nominal cost. This method has proved very effective indeed. A year ago only thirty out of every hundred persons could read and write, now fifty out of a hundred in the organization are able to read and write, and many more hundreds are quickly learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a result of this program the quality of field service has risen sharply. Especially is this true concerning the number of home Bible studies being conducted. There are now many more mature ones to aid the new publishers coming into the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An interesting experience in destroying the power of false religion came in from a brother, who writes:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We began witnessing at a large village where almost all the inhabitants were of pagan religion. Therefore, we used the Bible sermon ‘The True God, Jehovah,’ showing how he has set a glorious new world of righteousness before those who will render him sacred worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“There was a priest of Tigari in the village who approached us, saying: ‘I could not sleep the whole night as I am serving a false god leading to destruction. What may I do to be a pure servant of the True God?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“I advised him to move his images away and follow us in preaching the message of the Kingdom. He was afraid to move them himself and asked if we would be able to do so. At his house we met a crowd of people waiting to see what would happen. After asking Jehovah’s protection we broke the high altar of the tigari and leveled it to the ground. We then gathered together the various ‘jujus’ and the broken tigari and disposed of them at the public latrine. After this act eight persons immediately began going from house to house with us that very day. A mature brother remained behind in that village for two weeks to train them for the ministry.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark303"></a>FRENCH TOGOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There is a very serious responsibility resting upon every dedicated servant of Jehovah God. Not only is it necessary to maintain integrity if one is to attain to the reward of everlasting life but it Is also imperative that one’s life be a Christian example, so that we might not be the cause of stumbling someone new or weak in Jehovah’s organization. Unfortunately this situation has arisen in the central congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Due to immoral practices the former congregation servant and the assistant congregation servant along with two others were disfellowshiped from the New World society. When ones entrusted with so much of the Kingdom interests go wrong and take themselves out of the truth they certainly can be a cause for stumbling. As a result the main congregation is now in a very weakened condition and some of the weaker ones have been turned aside from following the way of righteousness. This has resulted in a decrease during the past service year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark304"></a>GAMBIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Only one publisher is active in the field service at the close of this service year, and although he is conducting about three home Bible studies, it does not even begin to get the good news of the Kingdom preached. However, the brother’s efforts are not without some good results, and it was a pleasure to see thirteen gather together to hear a talk by the zone servant during his last visit to the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is good to be able to report that a graduate of the Bible School of Gilead has now been assigned to take up the missionary work in Gambia.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark305"></a>IVORY COAST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It was just a little over one year ago that a brother was assigned as a special pioneer in a large town away from the only existing congregation. Reports of interest had reached the office of the Society from this area from time to time, and when the brother arrived he found that the interest was great there, and the work found good growth right from the start. An isolated group of publishers was formed just a few months ago, and in August sixteen persons were associating together to do the divine will. Arrangements have been completed for another special pioneer from Ghana to join those at this new center to push the work even farther and reach many more with the Word of life. We look forward to even greater increases this year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark306"></a>GREECE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Owing to the systematic persecution raised against true Christians, conditions in Greece are very hard upon Jehovah’s witnesses. This opposition comes from the established religion of the state. Church and state work together and the church sees to it that the political authorities take medieval measures against the minority religious group of Jehovah’s witnesses. Constantly Jehovah’s witnesses try to get greater freedom through legal channels, and recently they did win a case. For a long time the authorities said that all literature of the Society going through the mails had to be marked “heresy,” but now we can use the mails by marking the literature “Publication of Jehovah’s Witnesses.” There were seventy-eight of our Greek brothers who were able to attend the great convention in New York and take back the good news and comfort our brothers in Greece. Some of the experiences that the Branch servant gives will show you just how the work is carried on and what problems they have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a town of Macedonia one sister used to hide </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> from a neighbor when the latter visited her at home. As the neighbor’s visits were frequent, the sister asked her husband whether she ought to interrupt her study and conceal </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> Her husband told her not to interrupt her study or conceal </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> but even invite the neighbor if she wished to listen. So it was done. With tactfulness and enthusiasm the sister invited the visiting neighbor to attend the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> reading, and the result was that soon the neighbor, her husband and their twenty-two-year-old son came to a knowledge of the truth and now belong to the New World society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In an island of southern Greece the brothers suffered cruel persecution by certain clergymen. They were frequently brought to the law courts, now because of studying </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font7"> then because of having spoken to someone about the truth, and next because of having placed a magazine with somebody. In most of the cases, however, the local court discharged the brothers because none of these charges were founded. It happened on one occasion when this area was visited by the police officer that the priest hastened to meet him and make complaints about the increase in the number of Jehovah’s witnesses. The police officer told him: “You priests are responsible for the increase. You ought to go in search of them with the gospel. I also advised you not to have them brought before the law courts and cause an uproar every now and then. Those you referred to the court the other day were acquitted and then they went into the central coffee shop of the village and were reading </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> I tell you again that you are the one responsible. The persecution that you raise causes their increase. No Jehovah’s witness was in the village before, but now there are. By so doing you are going to make even the court judges themselves witnesses of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Back-calls and efforts toward arranging Bible studies prove again that they render a person steadfast in the truth. A pioneer sister placed the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> with a married couple who showed some interest. Just a few days later the sister called back on the couple, along with her husband. They gave a further witness and rejoiced in noticing that the householder and his wife had already gone well ahead in studying the book and had even started talking to their neighbors. They arranged for a Bible study to be held the next week. But right from the next day they were assailed by prejudiced neighbors. The wife of this good-will man, though just a beginner, courageously faced these attacks. Next day her husband went to the pioneer sister’s home and asked her to come sooner to the couple’s home, so that they might learn more of God’s truth. He told the sister: “Give us powerful weapons to fight with.” A regular Bible study was conducted, much to the joy of the pioneer sister and of these good-will persons.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark307"></a>GUADELOUPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Good work has been done on the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique during the year. Both islands had new peaks in publishers. The people in the islands have shown real interest in reading the publications of the Society. It is evident that the work being accomplished through the home Bible studies is bearing results, because the number of studies has increased greatly over previous years. In fact, in Guadeloupe a year ago the witnesses had sixty-one Bible studies going weekly and now they have 122, so the people on the islands are getting to know about the truth. The Branch servant sends in some very interesting reports of experiences concerning Guadeloupe and Martinique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Once in a while publishers meet people who tell them to keep the change from the contribution given for the literature. One wonders then if he should accept the extra money or give it back in order to show his ministry is without selfish aim. The following experience is of interest in that regard. A lady got three magazines and gave twice as much money as was requested for a contribution, and she said: “Please, keep the change.” The publisher, after offering to give it back anyway, but in vain, concluded: &quot;I will use it for someone who will not be able to afford the magazines.” It was not long after that in another house a lady showed great willingness to get the magazines, and she began earnestly searching for money, but to no avail. Said the publisher: “It looks as if you should not worry any longer about getting the money as someone else has already paid for you.” And when he explained how, the lady gladly accepted the magazines and a back-call was arranged. Later on a study was started and, showing more and more the appearance of one of the other sheep, that lady is already attending the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Attending the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York has really been the high light of the year. Nineteen from Guadeloupe were there, and how wide open were our eyes to register all we could see, and our ears so we could understand! Not just the unusual extent of land, which is surprising when coming from one of the small islands of the Caribbean, nor the tremendous buildings towering high up in the air, nor the astonishing heavy traffic in the streets, but having before one’s eyes the amazing sight of great crowds, yes, all brothers and sisters from the four corners of the earth, peacefully and unitedly worshiping the one true God. Two huge stadiums filled with them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some among us could have wondered before going if it was worth while going to that assembly without any understanding of the English language. But that question certainly did not trouble anyone coming back! Not only was it possible to get a resume of most of the talks during four mornings at the French sessions, but what our eyes saw during the eight days of convention are priceless strength-giving memories.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark308"></a>MARTINIQUE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">With only one congregation operating for the whole island, there is still much unassigned territory left and one does not know when it will be reached. Nevertheless, some of the Society’s literature gets out to these places by different means. For example, there is the opportunity of witnessing to drivers of trucks bringing bunches of bananas from the thirty-two communes of the island to load special boats. At times fifty or more of these trucks are waiting in line at the gates of entrance to the docks. The alert publisher will use the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazine and offer it to the driver of the first truck and work from one to the other through the whole line. A pioneer reported: “I placed more than thirty magazines within an hour’s time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Four were delegates to the international convention in New York city, and even six, as a couple completed Gilead’s course and graduated on the opening day to come back to Martinique as missionaries. Newspaper clippings and convention reports are put to good use in the field. A brother was explaining them to a blind person of good will when a man entered visiting; he joined in listening to the explanations and enjoyed it so much that he requested to be visited soon. A home Bible study has been started now with him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark309"></a>GUATEMALA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There was a hectic five months of provincial rule following the shooting of the Guatemalan president, but the preaching work had to go on. There was some disturbance in the arrangement of circuit assemblies; after a week-long riot and suspension of constitutional rights, the first assembly was canceled in Guatemala. However, with surprising speed constitutional guarantees were restored and meetings permitted and things moved along well for the assembling of God’s people. Not only have the brothers had excellent assemblies in Guatemala, but sixty-nine delegates from there were able to get to the Divine Will International Assembly in New York. Our brothers appreciate that they cannot forsake the assembling of themselves together in these last days but it is necessary to meet with one another and to build one another up in the most holy faith. Among the distressing times and troubles in governmental affairs and among parties trying to get control, Jehovah’s witnesses continued neutral, preaching the good news. They have had an excellent increase during this period. Here are some of their experiences as sent in by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Officials have been most co-operative in towns where the films have been shown. In the isolated state of Peten, the governor, returning from a trip to the capital, found that permission to use the plaza had been given by the official left in charge. He not only cooperated but gave orders for the military band not to begin their weekly concert until the film was terminated. They stood with instruments in hand for one hour waiting for the film to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the showing of the films on two consecutive nights far in the jungle at one of the larger chicle camps where there is a congregation of four publishers, the congregation servant wrote: “Jehovah has closed all their mouths. They are silent. Jehovah reigns.” He reports that even some on the outside were heard saying to one another, “Jehovah’s witnesses have the true religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Showing the importance of following up on magazine placements is this experience of a missionary. Calling back where magazines had been placed with a young woman, she placed the latest copies with the young woman’s mother. Returning the second time with the latest issues, the mother asked the missionary to examine her Bible to tell her if it was all right. Explaining that the truth can be found in any Bible translation, the missionary took the opportunity to show </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> and, after placing it, arranged for a study. The woman said that in all her years in the Catholic Church she had learned nothing to strengthen her faith and recently had left the church disillusioned when a young priest had asked embarrassing questions in the confessional. She was invited to see the film “The Happiness of the New World Society” the following week and came. Thrilled with the film and having been introduced to the Kingdom Hall and some other witnesses, she began attending all the meetings. Within two months she went from door to door and was telling all her friends about “having found the truth.” Their cool response to her find has not in the least dampened her zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The radio program “Things People Are Thinking About” is bringing good results. The broadcasts, three times a week, are being heard by persons far in the interior. Working isolated territory near the Mexican border, a circuit servant placed literature with a man who showed interest. He said he knew the Bible foretold false prophets and deceivers in the time of the end, but as for Jehovah’s witnesses, he knew they were not, as he had heard their radio programs from the capital and their message was important and Biblical. He took three books to carry to his village to study.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark310"></a>HAITI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">This country in the Caribbean has undergone another year of political difficulties and, additionally, has suffered much with the passing of hurricanes. As the Scriptures have said, there would be an increasing of lawlessness and all kinds of distressing things that will cause people to wonder why such things must exist in the earth. Some of the Haitian people have said, “It is a condemned country,” but conditions here are only similar to those in other countries. What the people need is the truth. Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching this with good success and there has been a fine increase during the year. Thirty-eight of the brothers from Haiti were able to be delegates to the Divine Will International Assembly in New York. Some of their experiences in the field follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the capital’s higher-class district a sister had been studying with a woman for two years. The sister had decided that this would be the last study with her due to diminishing interest. On this study, however, her daughter, who had only attended three studies, showed exceptional interest, so the sister said, “I have studied two books with your mother, and we now have a new book that I could study here if you will be here for every study.” Amazingly, the girl went right along in the field service after three more studies. This brought about a strange reaction: The mother, who had received so much help, now opposed the forward steps of her daughter. The dear girl cried when her mother interfered with her being immersed. While the sister was on vacation three of her studies were cared for by this young, enthusiastic girl. She says that nothing will stop her immersion at the next assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A baker in the capital had been a subscriber for the Society’s Spanish magazines for many years. The second day of an assembly the cafeteria servant went to him to get another lot of bread, since he was giving it to us at a discount. Something had made the baker excited. He told the cafeteria servant: “I have just read about the terrible treatment of your people by the authorities in the Dominican Republic. You are certainly doing a good work.” He then offered to supply the cafeteria with enough bread to last until the end of the assembly as his contribution to a worthy cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer contacted a young Catholic girl who took an interest in the truth. During school vacation a Bible study was conducted with her. Convinced that this was the truth, she began taking her stand by abandoning her place as president of the “cross association” at church. When she was back in school, the lady director expelled her for not attending Catholic mass. Efforts were made to reinstate her, showing that since she was no longer Catholic, mass was not her duty. Then the department of education was written. Note, please, that the new minister of education was a Catholic priest. Finally the answer came: the department held that she did not have to attend mass. But in the same school Baptist and Adventist children continue to attend Catholic mass with no objection; only Jehovah’s witnesses do not, thanks to the brave stand of this girl. She was immersed at the next circuit assembly in her town and now talks of pioneering. Further, despite missing much time at school due to the issue, she passed her exams and received her certificate of study that same year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark311"></a>HAWAII</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Becoming teachers, and not preachers only, has been stressed by all the servants in the Hawaiian Islands during the past year and it has brought forth wonderful results. The need of proper overseers was also observed, and those who are eager to teach the publishers and set the right example are greatly appreciated. An overseer follows the admonition of Peter, who said: “Shepherd the flock of God in your care, not under compulsion, but willingly.” (1 Pet. 5:2) The overseer thus gets wonderful results. Here are some of the experiences from the teaching and preaching field in Hawaii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Just as Moses’ father-in-law wisely instructed him to distribute his duties among well-qualifled men, so today distributing duties to those caring for service groups has had the effect of bringing the publishers to maturity. Not only have the publishers become proficient in preaching sermons and in the distribution of magazines under this arrangement, but also individual attention is given them as to the back-call and home Bible study activity. It has been found that by the study conductor’s being well acquainted with each one assigned to his service center and giving him individual attention, much good is being accomplished. This arrangement has instilled the desire in the publishers to follow up on their initial calls, start Bible studies and then </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">teach</span><span class="font7"> those of good will about Jehovah. Now today even the young ones are being properly trained in directing interest to the organization. It is not unusual to walk into any one of the many Kingdom Halls and see these teen-agers sitting with new ones at their side, thus aiding them to partake of the life-giving water of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“One Sunday morning I placed a book with an elderly Japanese Buddhist woman whom I felt took the book only to get rid of me. I kept thinking, however, of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> suggestion to call back the same day or, at the most, waiting just a few days before returning. It just won’t work in this territory, I told myself. Three days later I called while working with the circuit servant, who was making his regular visit. I felt that this lady would be irritated at seeing us. To my surprise we were invited in and she listened to the sermon with great interest, and responded with a ready ‘yes’ to a suggested Bible study. On returning the next week the thought still occupied my mind that her ‘yes’ was only to impress the circuit servant as a special representative of the Society. This was a wrong conclusion, for I found her waiting with the lesson studied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“It was even more rewarding recently when I called for the study and noticed that a huge shrine that she kept on a table with her late husband’s picture beside it was gone. During the study she stated that she had read the chapter on ‘Images’ and, not wanting to displease Jehovah, she had given the shrine away. Following the study she picked up her study books and Bible, placed them on the table with her husband’s picture, and smilingly stated, ‘Looks much better now.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pioneer learned that we cannot be hasty in judging the people in our territory. She relates: “While working with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscription offer I called on a man and found him to manifest interest in our message. However, he did not take the subscription because his wife felt they could not afford it. Later a pioneer from a nearby congregation asked me to contact this woman as he had started a study with her sister. Reluctantly I called, and she just stood at the door looking as though she was bored with my return again to their home. However, she did agree to another call. After making the call I told my husband that this person certainly did not merit another call. It was only because my husband had a call in the same vicinity the next week that I returned, feeling that at least my time would be utilized. As I approached the home I could see this woman hurrying through the house, and as she opened the door a warm friendly smile covered her face and she welcomed me in. Since my last call she had done much thinking about the things I had told her. Immediately she subscribed for both </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> and agreed to study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The next month she attended the district assembly without missing a single session. Also, she used her car to assist in picking up the arriving delegates at the airport, and engaged in the field service for the first time. Six months later at the circuit assembly she symbolized her dedication. Shortly before my husband and I left for the Divine Will assembly she enrolled as a vacation pioneer. Later she joined us at the convention and upon returning she again joined the ranks of the vacation pioneers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Being able to attend the international convention in New York, over 250 delegates from Hawaii returned convinced that Jehovah’s divine will must be done.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark312"></a>HONDURAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">At the close of the service year in 1954 there was an average of 410 publishers. Uncleanness developed in the country, which shocked all the publishers and did great harm to the work. In 1955 the publishers dropped to 407, in 1956 to 343 and finally by the end of 1957 the average publishers was back to 408, still two less than in 1954. Today the brothers in Honduras are filled with heartfelt thanks to Jehovah because he has poured out a blessing upon them again. Now they have an average of 440 publishers and a new peak of 481. During the past four years they have had to rebuild, close up the breaches and get on solid ground again. So Jehovah’s people appreciate that to keep a clean organization is essential, for uncleanness can do great harm. Filled with joy, sixty of the brothers in Honduras came to the Divine Will International Assembly; and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness they are determined to continue, staying awake and keeping their ministerial “outer garments” so that no one can look upon their parts of shame. The Branch servant gives us some interesting experiences that have brought joy to their hearts during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A witness tells of working a small town and inviting the local people to gather at the park to listen to a Bible lecture. The local priest on hearing about it began to start a disturbance. He began ringing the church bells and also put on a loud-speaker to drown out the speaker. After it became apparent that it would be impossible to continue and when the people all began to leave, as they could not hear well, the brothers gave out tracts and magazines to all. The people voiced their disapproval of the action of the priest, and one businessman asked the speaker to come to his place as he wanted to hear all about this work. This town will soon be worked again and we are sure that the people will receive the message much better than they did before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One might think that all our trouble would come from the Catholics, but most comes from the “Evangelists.” They have put out tracts during the year and have warned their people against us, telling them not to discuss the Bible with us. When a town is opened up by special pioneers they put on a campaign, but it only lasts about two or three weeks. In one town, a few weeks after the special pioneers began working it, tracts appeared against Jehovah’s witnesses in which they mention their age-old statements that we are Communists and do not believe in the trinity and hellfire. When this happened the special pioneers used the tracts covering these points to good effect. The special pioneers mentioned that after they had about twenty studies between them the local pastor took another step. He tried to get the local peace officer, or </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">commandante de armas,</span><span class="font7"> as he is called here, to get the pioneers to leave town. The Branch sent them some information, mentioning among other things that this country has freedom of religion, and after the circuit servant visited them and spoke to the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">commandante </span><span class="font7">about our work and explained the law of the land to him, all went well and the special pioneers have not been bothered since.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A native special pioneer writes that while working from house to house he met an Adventist who told him that we lied to the people about the sabbath-day law. Asked to prove it, he produced the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> and gave a short talk on the chapter of the sabbath in front of other people of the house to disprove it. After the Adventist was finished the brother took the same book and, together with the Bible, gave a twenty-minute talk on the same subject and then asked the people which sounded the most reasonable. He then asked the Adventist the same question. The Adventist mentioned that he would have to study the subject better before he could answer him. The result was that the other man of the house took two books and is being called on regularly and a study has been started with him.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark313"></a>HONG KONG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Right next door to the Communist country of China lies Hong Kong. Many Chinese people have fled from China and have sought refuge in Hong Kong, since China has started regimenting all people. The publishers of the Kingdom in Hong Kong have a difficult time because the people are steeped in tradition and it takes a constant dripping of the water of truth to wear away some of their traditions to let them see the glories of God’s kingdom and the wonderful God of the universe, Jehovah. The truth must penetrate the mind, and this requires great diligence on the part of each publisher. Those who are coming to a knowledge of the truth must feel as the psalmist who said: “Create in me even a pure heart, O God, and put within me a new spirit, a steadfast one.” (Ps. 51:10) After curiosity has been aroused then comes the time, which is often lengthy, for the bringing about of a new spirit. The experiences that follow concerning Hong Kong and its people are very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To do the back-call work you have to be prepared to overcome all obstacles. One pioneer wrote in this amusing experience: “One day when I worked the business section of Hong Kong I had the opportunity to witness to a man operating an elevator. The man eagerly accepted a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> in Chinese. I called back, not at the man’s home, but in the elevator, for the man’s working hours were so long. The man was very impressed with the magazines, so a regular back-call was made in the elevator. Often I had to travel up and down the elevator, but the man insisted on hearing more. Truly, regardless of how different the situations are in crowded, cramped Hong Kong, we have to overcome them in order to reach the people with the New World message, but back-calling in an elevator is something out of the ordinary!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another sister “received a pleasant surprise visit from a young man contacted several months previously while working isolated, unassigned territory. Upon first contact he had asked many searching questions on the trinity doctrine and had shown surprised interest at the answers offered from his own copy of the Catholic Bible. His antagonistic father refused his son further opportunity for discussion. In Chinese family life the father’s influence over the son persists even into the son’s adult life. It seemed then that I could do nothing more except simply leave my own address with him in the hope that he might seek to contact me. He did call and told me of his desire to study the Bible. His school lessons, exams, and father’s opposition made opportunities for study very intermittent. But slowly his Bible knowledge grew, and one day he confided that his hope had been to become a Catholic priest following his sister’s footsteps, she already being a nun. He had studied in a Catholic college but was very disappointed in its failure to prove Catholic doctrine with Scripture. Now he knew he could never serve the true God, Jehovah, as a Catholic priest. He then began to consider the ministry and modern organization of Jehovah’s witnesses. I loaned him the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Faith on the March. </span><span class="font7">That did it! From that day on he never looked back. While his father still did not entirely approve of his son’s course, the young man began to attend the congregation meetings. While I was away attending the Divine Will assembly in New York, the courage-giving truth caused him to start his training in the house-to-house ministry. I have never ceased to be grateful that I thought to leave my address on that first visit when the circumstances seemed so discouraging.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yes, truly, the truth is breaking the power of proud tradition in the minds of many young Chinese, whether of Christendom or of pagandom. One young lady who, after having studied the Bible with one of the missionaries, had her first eye-opening taste of the witnessing work wrote this letter: “The work of preaching from house to house is so new to me but it gives me the chance of knowing that there still are more Chinese who do not believe God than I had thought. This task is so interesting and worthy that I cannot help going to the place where we met together yesterday ... I have been studying in Christian schools since I was just a little girl. I was taught to believe God and I did believe too. I believed everything that was taught without thinking. Going to the church became a habit of mine, but I was just lukewarm, neither hot nor cold. No group of people led me really deep into the Bible before I met you Jehovah’s witnesses. Now my eyes begin to open and I realize that to be a Christian is not all that easy and simple. Though to be a real Christian requires one to do more, I have never been so eager to know God’s will as now.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During this service year we saw up to twenty different brothers take up the vacation-pioneer work and the minds of some of these are now turned seriously toward the regular pioneer work, for those who entered the vacation-pioneer work have seen some of their calls blossoming into Kingdom publishers. They have learned, too, that pioneering is the most fruitful of New World society activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of course, all of us in Hong Kong are thrilled that three from our ranks were called to the thirty-first class of Gilead. This international class experienced the largest graduation ever and was witnessed appreciatively by thirteen very privileged Hong Kong delegates present at the Divine Will International Assembly in New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark76"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark314"></a>INDIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The year’s text for 1958 concerning walking in integrity before Jehovah has helped those seeking truth and righteousness in India. Living in a world hostile to the principles of love and constantly surrounded by satanic allurements of one sort or another, the way of compromise is ever open before those in India. The majority of the people take the easy way. It is so easy to conform to the ways of the old world, but the ministers of God press on even among the poor, unbelieving people filled with superstition. All of this makes the work difficult, but the Branch servant is very happy to report a good all-around increase. The country has enjoyed four new peaks in publishers, a large increase in the distribution of magazines, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> is now being printed in six Indian languages. There are a number of most enjoyable experiences reported by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some of the outstanding experiences of the year come from isolated publishers who are opening up new territories. One sister living in a village twenty-five miles from the nearest town writes enthusiastically about conducting sixteen home Bible studies largely by correspondence. She visits the town twice a month and spends a whole day in door-to-door work and making back-calls and conducting studies. Then, during the month, she corresponds with the interested ones and continues the studies by letter. On one such visit she and her newly interested husband witnessed to the students and teaching staff of a theological seminary. She writes of this experience: “I used to read of the condition of Christendom in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> but now I saw it with my own eyes. One professor tried to argue that Satan was destroyed long ago and that all the book of Revelation was past history. He tried to make out that only the sting of sin and the poison of it now remained. Another professor was courteous but became quite embarrassed when I talked to him about Armageddon and the new world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another interesting experience comes from a pioneer working in isolated territory. He had witnessed to a Hindu man and started a home Bible study. This man had a brother who was a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sanyasi</span><span class="font7"> (Hindu ascetics noted for their long dirty, matted hair and beards) who had visited almost every place of pilgrimage in India. He came to live for a while with his brother and was surprised to find him studying the Bible, so he, too, started reading the Bible, resulting in much discussion with both the brother and the pioneer. The pioneer writes: “Now, to our astonishment, the long dirty, matted hair and beard, which had not taken the perfume of oil or cream for years, had disappeared. He came out with us in the service yesterday and attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">study along with his brother.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Most people know that India is a land of many languages, but it is difficult sometimes to convey an adequate idea of the problems this makes for Jehovah’s witnesses. A pioneer tells of finding much interest among a group of Tamil-speaking Catholics in a town where Tamil is not normally spoken. The pioneer’s mother tongue is Kanarese, but he knows English. To get over the difficulty of conducting Bible studies with these Tamilians, twice a month the pioneer took along a local man who knew both Tamil and English and together they conducted a home Bible study with an English book. A sister writes: “Oh, you should have been at our </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘Everlasting Life<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font7"> study last Tuesday. Twelve of us were there: Kanarese, Malayalam, Marathi and English-speaking people. Brother S—— explained what was said to the Kanarese folk, then Brother A----said the same to the Malayalees, and I spoke in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hindustani for the Marathas. It was such a happy group.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work in India is opening out and becoming more and more truly Indian. It is often a case of getting down to the mud-hut, simple-life type of people more and more. Just very recently the three-year-old daughter of one of our poor Indian brothers died. They were associated with a newly formed unit in Bombay. News of the girl’s death soon spread around and the brothers immediately rallied round the bereaved home, got to work and made a little coffin, and called at the Branch office to ask if we would arrange the funeral. Without incurring any expense for an undertaker, we telephoned the cemetery, arranged for a grave and conducted the funeral for them, all in a matter of a few hours. The funeral talk was delivered in English by a member of the Bethel family and translated into Marathi. Even the gravediggers standing beside the grave were seen to give rapt attention to what was said in their own language. It was all so very simple, but very effective as a witness to the hope of life by resurrection. It was typically India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was a very fitting climax to a year of happy service to be invited to attend the Divine Will International Assembly at New York. Twenty-one delegates were there from India, plus four students who graduated from Gilead at the assembly. It was truly an outstanding experience for all, but some experiences are worth telling. An Indian sister lost her watch at the stadium. Her husband was disinclined to bother going to the Lost and Found department to look for it, thinking that it was hopeless. However, they went, and there in a tray of watches was the sister’s watch! The narrating of this incident to people here in India has made quite a big impression. Two of our missionaries found themselves accommodated with an Indian family living in New York, much to the joy and appreciation for the truth on the part of the householders. It was a most happy assignment.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark315"></a>INDONESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Seeking men of good will and bringing them into the New World society is a most enjoyable work that enriches one’s life. It brings many happy experiences. Jehovah’s witnesses find that true happiness comes in giving spiritual food to these that they are finding. Even children have been used to do this work and to give praise to Jehovah. The Bible has this to say on the point of young ones doing good works: “Jesus said to them: ‘Yes. Did you never read this: “Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have furnished praise”?”’ (Matt. 21:16) Not only does Jehovah God use men and women to do this gathering work, but children who love Jehovah praise him also, and the experiences from Indonesia give us proof of this. The Branch office in Djakarta reports on Java, Sulawesi and Sumatra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One does not have to mature in years to engage in the preaching work. Those young in years often have surprising success. A young ten-year-old publisher working from house to house in Djakarta placed his first subscription with a young man of eighteen years. This young ten-year-old publisher called back alone a few times and started a study. The study has been carried on for some time and now this person is attending the service meeting and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study. The congregation servant speaks of the thrill it is to see this young publisher sitting next to his person of good will so much taller than himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this same congregation an eleven-year-old sister has been doing excellently in back-call and Bible study work. This little eleven-year-old has in the last four months averaged 18.5 hours, 8.5 back-calls and two Bible studies per month. She has been conducting a study with another eleven-year-old girl friend in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.”</span><span class="font7"> After studying one month this other girl began attending the meetings and going in the field service, was baptized, and now conducts her own study with a ten-year-old friend who, in turn, has begun to publish. The little eleven-year-old sister mentioned first in this experience now conducts two other studies with school-girl friends, both of whom are now attending the meetings. She trains them in the field service and in giving comments at the meetings, and she herself has been a vacation pioneer during the school holidays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant visiting isolated interested ones in a town in East Java reports: “We found so much interest here we regret to leave this town. We have established ten home Bible studies in the two weeks we have been here. We visited the most interested persons nearly every night and the results were excellent. Many asked why we did not establish a congregation in this town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“We contacted a member of the Assembly of God church in the house-to-house work and he subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> We took the opportunity right there and then to make an appointment for a back-call. He promised to invite some of his friends. When we arrived for the call six persons of the same church were on hand and listened attentively to the talk I delivered on 'Who Is Jehovah?’ After the talk questions were asked about the gift of tongues, and the clear explanation from the Bible resulted in some arguments among the church members present. Some of them rejected the gift of tongues that same night. Further fruitful calls were made on the more reasonable ones of this group.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark157"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark316"></a>SULAWESI</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Sulawesi have been through some trying times in the last few months. A rebel government was set up in their territory last February and then in</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">June the government forces invaded the area and fierce fighting ensued. Fortunately, not one of the brothers lost his life, but many lost their possessions. The brothers in Java have responded with a spirit of brotherly love and have sent clothing, food and medicine to aid the brothers in Sulawesi. Two sisters have been serving in a missionary home in Manado, and, along with the rest of the population, they had to evacuate after the rebel government was proclaimed. They were able to carry on with their preaching work until the invasion took place, and much new interest was located during this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The sister who is missionary home servant writes of some of their experiences during the invasion: “You should have seen us in our bamboo hut where we stayed during the invasion. We had to walk ten minutes to get to the brook for bathing and drinking water. To the right and left of the hut were bushes where we rushed every time the planes came over. The circuit servant dug us a shelter and we were thankful for this when the fighting got nearer as it was a protection from mortar shells. Cooking on an open fire is no more a difficulty for us, but, of course, getting the necessary fuel was. We gathered up wood, bamboo and coconut shells for fuel. We had to look for vegetables in the woods and we learned to eat all kinds of leaves. Later the people who lived in the neighborhood came to our bamboo hut and brought bananas, vegetables and other fruit. They became so attached to us that there was not one day when we did not get something, fish they had caught themselves, and one day even meat. It was lovely that we could implant some truth in this nice family that helped us so much.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark158"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark317"></a>SUMATRA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Sumatra are more strongly devoted to their Moslem religion than are the people of Java. Nevertheless, many very diligent sheep have been gathered from among Islam people, particularly in the city of Palembang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A publisher calling back on a magazine placement with a young man who was studying to be an Islam teacher finally succeeded in establishing a study. Despite great family opposition, this young man came into the truth, was baptized and later became a pioneer in his own home town. He has found much interest among his cousins, all of whom are Moslem. Some of these, too, have gone through strenuous trials because of family opposition, but trials and persecutions have not stopped those hungering after righteousness. One young girl was so persecuted by her relatives that she left home and stayed with one of the brothers. The parents later allowed her to return home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This congregation has a spirit of great love, affection and consideration. The brothers really incite one another to love and right works, and especially the youths show much zeal for Jehovah. Some of them go out in the field service with the special and regular pioneers nearly every day. Especially noteworthy is this congregation’s magazine average, 74.9 magazines per publisher per month for the service year!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark318"></a>ITALY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">A marvelous thing has happened in this land during the past ten years. Theocratic expansion is on in this country. It is wonderful to behold the increase that has come from all sides. Only a seed of truth needs to be planted and almost immediately thereafter grows a tree of righteousness dedicated to Jehovah. Italy is part of the world, which is our field, and it abounds with fruitage for gathering. Those gathered into the New World society must be taken care of and brought on to maturity, for we remember the scripture: “My son, to my words do pay attention. To my sayings incline your ear. . . . Keep them in the midst of your heart.” (Prov. 4:20, 21) Those who do—and there are thousands—are preaching everywhere in Italy. There are a number of very interesting experiences that have been sent in by the Branch servant and a few are printed herewith, about Italy, San Marino and Libya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The magazine distribution has had an excellent increase and the results obtained show the wisdom of the Society in stressing the magazine work. Often one copy of a magazine is sufficient to bring much fruitage. A letter was recently received from a scientist. He stated that he had just read his first copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font7">and said: “Before reading this copy, I thought I was the only one who gave any thought to these sublime things. . . . Finally, only today I have had the joy of knowing you! I would like to confer with a representative of yours to see what I can do to help propagate </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> on a larger scale.” Shortly thereafter the district servant visited this scientist and found him to be a very humble man who was highly impressed with the Bible knowledge that Jehovah’s witnesses were disseminating. He obtained literature, a Bible study was arranged and the local brothers now hold a study in his home regularly. Every evening he studies with them, even though they are simple farmers and not as educated as he. This scientist has written us recently expressing his joy in attending the first congregational meeting and getting a wonderful impression of it. Truly the Lord’s other sheep recognize His voice when they hear it regardless of their worldly knowledge or the lack of it on the part of his servants. The spirit of Jehovah and the love of truth unite men of all classes regardless of education or social standing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While preaching from house to house a special pioneer made arrangements to return to discuss the Bible with three men associated with the Waldensian Church. They came to the discussion with notes prepared to talk on the trinity doctrine. The brother easily confuted their arguments by means of many scriptures. Surprised to read these scriptures, they answered: “We never knew these existed!” After several discussions they began attending congregational meetings. Finally, one day they declared: “Last night we stayed up quite late examining the Scriptures and we have concluded that Christ is not God, and so now we are with you.” The oldest one added: “We were assigned by our pastor of the city of T---- to convert Jehovah’s witnesses in this city, but,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">instead, that has happened to us.” When the pastor of this city heard about the change of heart of these young men, he began warning his parishioners from the pulpit the following Sunday about Jehovah’s witnesses, accusing them of teaching falsehoods. At this point up jumped one of his parishioners and shouted: “I don’t see where Jehovah’s witnesses are false. I have been having a Bible study with them for two months and everything they teach is from the Bible.” Now the three men above mentioned are actively engaged in the preaching work and are distributing much Bible literature among their friends. One of these was a monitor in the Waldensian Church teaching Sunday school, and now he is anxiously waiting for six months to pass so that he might be able to engage in the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young man in northern Italy who came from a strong Catholic family felt urgently the need to serve God and preach his message. In preparation for this he enrolled in a seminary. To his great surprise, he found out that he was being taught contradictory things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So after seven years in this seminary he decided to abandon it and go back to the world. Here his spiritual state worsened and he came to the point where he even doubted the existence of God and began thinking about becoming an atheist. One day he met his cousin who was one of Jehovah’s witnesses and he heard the truth from him. Almost immediately he accepted it, becoming a publisher, and later he gave his experience at a circuit assembly. Seven years in a seminary had destroyed his faith in God, and one visit from a minister of Jehovah’s witnesses had restored it! Truly, the Lord is finding his sheep wherever they may be!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another interesting experience is that of an insurance agent seeking to sell life insurance to a brother. In an easy manner the brother brought the subject around to the new world and the promise of everlasting life. The discussion went on for over three hours, not on financial insurance but on a real life-insurance policy for the new world. Two days later he came back to talk with the brothers and asked questions for several hours. He obtained literature and was invited to attend the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study in his home town. Returning three days later, he expressed his great joy over the study. He obtained some bound books, and a Bible study was started then and there. It was noticed that he did not smoke at all during the study. Then he explained that while at the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study he noticed that no one smoked and, having a great urge to smoke, he inquired if he could. He was told yes, outside. An explanation was given to him as to why Jehovah’s witnesses do not smoke. A month later he was baptized and he now is a regular Kingdom publisher, attending all meetings together with his wife. Thus a life-insurance agent has been insured to gain life in the new world by the lifegiving knowledge obtained by incidental preaching.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark319"></a>SAN MARINO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Two special pioneers are regularly going to San Marino to preach. They have obtained some subscriptions and left many Bibles. In this country the Bible is not sold anywhere, but, thanks to Jehovah’s witnesses, it is now being made available in the country. Some studies are being conducted also. San Marino is a country living almost entirely on the tourist trade, and the people are busy making money and do not have the time necessary to dedicate to the truth. Nevertheless, some progress is being made in finding interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LIBYA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The service year has seen many court trials brought against the brothers because of their preaching activity. Most of these have been either postponed or appealed to a higher court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">However, we are facing a difficult legal situation in this country. When we lose a case, our only hope is to appeal. When we win a case, as we have done twice, the judge does not write out his sentence and register it. It appears that pressure is put on him and so he is fearful about registering it. And, according to Libyan law, when a sentence is not registered within a month it is considered null and void and must be reheard. So, whether we are right or wrong, it appears that the local officials are determined to stop the preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society has worked considerably with the brothers seeking to assist them in their legal battles. An application for legal registration that was made by the Society has been turned down by the government. The Society has taken this case to the Supreme Court, where we are now awaiting a decision concerning the legal registration of the Society in Libya. This decision will have a far-reaching effect on theocratic activity in Libya and possibly in many other Arab countries, hence the Society is giving utmost care and attention to this case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Despite these difficulties, it is a joy to report that during the year the work has made excellent progress and we have had new peaks in publishers. In this manner we have overcome the purpose of the persecution and the work continues to forge ahead just the same. The prospects for the future are very promising and much fruitage is yet expected from Libya.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark320"></a>JAMAICA</span></h2>
<p><a name="bookmark321"></a><span class="font8">There is now one Kingdom publisher for every 370 persons on this island. This is the result of continuous proclamation of the good news of the Kingdom, and the words of Isaiah are fitting: “How handsome upon the mountains are the feet of the one bringing good news, the one making peace to be heard, the one bringing good news of something better, the one making salvation to be heard, the one saying to Zion: ‘Your God has become king!’” (Isa. 52:7) With real fervor the publishers press on bringing people the good news, and the report of the Jamaican Branch on Jamaica itself and the Cayman Islands is very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If any one point stands out above others in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Jamaica during the 1958 service year, it is probably the Bible study work. During the year a new peak in number of Bible studies was established, with publishers averaging .8 each for the peak month and .7 each for the year. People in Jamaica have strong religious convictions, and the pleasure of seeing the light of truth dawn in the eyes of these persons through home Bible studies has been the thrill of 40 percent of the publishers in Jamaica. It is to be hoped that many more will join these and so swell the numbers of those conducting weekly home Bible studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Experiences in this wonderful field of the ministry have been many. A pioneer was holding a home Bible study with a lady showing good will, when one day her husband entered the home brandishing a large machete, threatening the pioneer and warning her never to come back to his home again. What should the pioneer do? Why, just calmly say good-by. But what about the study? Often, as the pioneer worked in the area, she would meet this same man on the road. She always greeted him friendlily, and eventually asked him to convey her greetings to his wife. The pioneer’s next step was to ask the man politely if he would take the latest </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> to his wife, to which he agreed and contributed for the two magazines. On the next occasion a friendly invitation to attend a public lecture was extended, to which the man responded. Truly, all this was heaping coals of fire on his head. At the public lecture he was so enthused that he invited our pioneer sister to come to his home once again. At the second visit the pioneer found this man conducting the study himself, and his enthusiasm made him leave his place of business to attend a district assembly at the other end of the island for all four days. A little tactful perseverance can go a long way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As announced in the 1958 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font7"> Brother Knorr gave approval for the building of a new Branch office and home in Kingston during the service year. We have now moved into this beautiful reinforced-concrete structure. A joyful dedication was held on the last day of the service year, with 1,276 present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No account of the 1958 service year in Jamaica would be complete without mention of the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York city. Many from Jamaica began to plan to attend as soon as the convention was announced in 1956. It was not easy, but extreme effort was put forth, and more than 200 delegates from Jamaica traveled to New York to say: “It is the divine will for us to be here!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark322"></a>CAYMAN ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Geographically isolated, the Cayman Islands lie to the northwest of Jamaica. But there is no place too isolated for Jehovah’s witnesses, and two Jamaican special pioneers have been working there almost two years. Work has been slow among the islanders, but as the service year closes reports are being received from six publishers in addition to the two special pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The high light of the service year in the Cayman Islands was the attendance at the Divine Will International Assembly of the two Jamaican special pioneers there. The wonderful spirit of that assembly simply filled them to overflowing, and how thrilled they were to find many formerly uninterested persons, including many of the officials, in Grand Cayman anxious to know about this tremendous assembly! Who knows what the spirit of the Divine Will International Assembly will accomplish even in the tiny Cayman Islands?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark84"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark323"></a>JAPAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The preaching work in the islands of Japan got started off with a new peak of publishers in the very first month of the service year. There have been nine peaks in a row and an increase by May of 55 percent. Over one thousand publishers reported for each of the last six months of the service year. While many persons of good will are coming in rapidly, those who are in the truth and who have dedicated their lives to God’s service have this in mind: “Let us, then, as many of us as are mature, be of this mental attitude; and . . . to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.” (Phil. 3:15, 16) There is no turning back once a person has started in this work. Faithfulness is required on the part of all, and our brothers in Japan are certainly showing this kind of faith and are walking orderly, helping everyone that they can. The experiences sent in from the Branch office in Tokyo are for Japan and Okinawa, and they are most interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To crown the year there was the great privilege enjoyed by sixty-three delegates from Japan, in attending the Divine Will International Assembly in New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The attendance of many of these was made possible by the contributions of the brothers throughout the earth, and we express our heartfelt gratitude for this assistance. Most of the conventioners returned to make a full report at Japan’s own Divine Will District Assembly in Kobe, August 28-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Here, in Kobe, our joy again overflowed! So enthusiastically did the returning brothers present the entire New York program, and describe everything that happened in New York, that it was like living the Divine Will convention all over again. Typical of the many expressions by the local brothers, one said: “I feel as though I had actually been to New York and seen all these things for myself.” The Resolution was most heartily adopted by 622 persons, and 881 attended the public talk. Seventy-two were immersed in Japan’s biggest immersion to date, and the same evening an Osaka television newscast gave this excellent publicity for three minutes. The assembly made news throughout Japan, but, above all, it stirred in the brothers’ hearts the desire to make 1959 an even greater year in doing the divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Kingdom work has expanded into many new sections of Japan. During the past year six new missionary homes were opened and others were closed where strong congregations already existed. The Japanese brothers have manfully shouldered responsibility where this has been given to them. In six months after the missionaries left, the Kyoto congregation increased from thirty-three to forty-seven publishers, as well as supplying seven special pioneers to serve in isolated cities where the need is greater. The largest congregation composed entirely of Japanese brothers is in Osaka, and this kept moving right along to a peak of activity in the last month of the year, with nearly 120 publishers in the field, of whom seven were in vacation pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A missionary sister tells of one of the people with whom she studies and who started in the work just one month before she herself was reassigned. She was a bit apprehensive as to how the new publisher would make out, as there were only new publishers in that service center to help her. Two months later this new publisher wrote the missionary a letter, and included her report for the month. This read: 72 hours, 50 magazines placed, and, to the missionary’s amazement, six home Bible studies! In the letter she said she thought she had better become mature quickly so that she could really take over where the missionaries left off. Two months later, when she came to the circuit assembly to be baptized, she brought along one with whom she studies to be baptized, with her, saying she was determined to look after this new sheep, too, and aid her to become mature. The Tuesday night book study is now held in her house. Maturity can surely be attained by those who strive for it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another special pioneer made a back-call on a churchgoer who also worshiped at the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">butsudan</span><span class="font7"> (household Buddhist shrine). “'Does your church allow that?” asked the pioneer. A discussion followed on the “soul,” a study was started and, in spite of the opposition of the church, the person quickly became a Kingdom publisher. Both church and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">butsudan</span><span class="font7"> have been moved right out to make room for the one pure worship of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An elderly couple in Osaka who were nominal Christians could not agree with their clergyman’s teaching that the soul is immortal. Just before the husband died they arranged that if there was life after death, he would surely by some means communicate with his wife from the “other side.” The husband died. No messages came from outer space. Then a young pioneer sister happened to call on the widow. The Bible truths concerning the state of the dead, the future resurrection and the paradise earth provided an immediate answer to the aging widow’s questions. She and her daughter studied diligently, and the daughter, despite bitter opposition from her husband, soon became a Kingdom publisher. The widow, though unable to go out, is also heartily in accord with the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Honesty witnesses, too. A pioneer sister found an envelope in the street. It contained Japanese yen to the equivalent of $300. Since there was an address on the envelope, she took it to that address. The owner was delighted to receive the money that he had taken as lost. When the sister identified herself as a representative of the Watch Tower Society, the owner received another surprise. It so happened that a different publisher had called at his home the previous Sunday, and he had subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> Impressed by the pioneer’s honesty, he said he would read the magazines with added interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark324"></a>OKINAWA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Here is an example of how the truth changes family life. A family started to study with Jehovah’s witnesses. The husband was good-natured but sometimes he drank too much. One night, coming back late from drinking, he asked his wife, “Are you angry with me?” She replied, “No,” and showed him the last part of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Good News of the Kingdom,”</span><span class="font7"> which explains how a wife should behave toward a husband. He said, “Oh, I’m sorry. You are too good for me.” Since then he has stopped his drinking and has begun to attend the meetings regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Some sisters in Okinawa are doing very well in the face of persecution from their husbands. One sister was even threatened with death if she did not desist from preaching, but this only made her more determined to keep publishing. She regularly preaches and attends the meetings, and always takes her children along with her. Jehovah blessed her stand. One day she was doing farm work. She took the opportunity to do incidental preaching to a woman who came to work the farm nearby. She gave her the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> and, finding that she had many questions, invited her to the local book study. Soon the woman was preaching, was baptized, and now she engages in group witnessing three times a week, as well as holding a study with her daughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To cap off the year’s thrilling experiences, Okinawa had its first district assembly, just two days, August 24, 25, but what packed-full days they were! About ten of the brothers returning to Japan from the Divine Will International Assembly were in attendance, and the Okinawan brothers were able to feast upon all the good things provided at New York. The assembly got off to a fine start with sixteen persons symbolizing their dedication by water immersion—more than the total of those immersed in Okinawa throughout the preceding three years. Then 112 attended the public talk, and eighty-two enthusiastically shouted </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Hai!”</span><span class="font7"> to the Resolution. It is hoped we will soon have that many declaring the divine will from house to house in Okinawa. This is another field ripe for the harvest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark87"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark325"></a>KOREA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The joy and happiness of Jehovah’s witnesses in Korea is expressed in their year’s report. Twenty-five Korean brothers and missionaries were able to attend the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York and they very much appreciated the contributions made on the part of the brothers around the earth to help them get there. They are now telling all their brothers of the good things they received at the convention. Jehovah’s witnesses in Korea certainly want to be “signs and wonders” in that land to the blessing of all. They appreciate that “Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it.” (Eph. 5:25) So all those who are overseers and mature publishers want to show their love for the congregation and express their love toward all the people of good will. The experiences set forth by the Branch servant in Korea prove this fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The increase in numbers was not as great this year as in times past. But we feel the increase reaped this year will be more stable. In previous years many baptized persons have fallen away because they were baptized too soon, without enough basic knowledge of the Scriptures. A desire to live in God’s new world is not enough reason to be baptized. Certain ones were immersed with the motive of wanting salvation for themselves, but did not fully understand that their dedication was to a life of service to God. The motive was selfish. Then, too, some were baptized by reason of yielding to the wish of the family head or parents. These motives are not enough. Therefore, early in the service year, by your direction, we restricted baptism to those who have spent at least six months in study of basic doctrines of the Bible and who could indicate their understanding of basic principles through an oral examination. As a result of this screening the number of baptized persons this year was only 472, to compare with 747 last year. This will eventually lead to a more stable organization and strengthen it for proper service. We appreciate your wisdom in instituting this procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The increase in maturity kept on apace, however, and this is indicated by the progress of the home Bible study work. The number of studies conducted in the country rose from an average of 1,915 last year to a peak of 3,531 this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These Bible studies are each one a joy to conduct as we watch them bring real happiness and hope to the good-will people. Here is an experience showing what a Bible study meant in the lives of two Korean war amputees. The circuit servant writes: “On a recent circuit visit to the Seoul Tongbu Unit I was greatly impressed with the activity of two young brothers, amputees who lost their legs during the fighting. Before learning of the truth one of them was very depressed and felt that life held nothing for him. Then his friend, a fellow soldier in the same hospital, gave him a booklet he had just read that had given him much hope and comfort. The depressed soldier read it and recognized it as truth. A study was arranged with both amputees. Hope filled both of them. They began to realize they must preach. They did not ask, ‘Lord, how can we preach? We have no legs.’ They sincerely wanted to serve Jehovah. One got a wooden leg and a cane and began to practice. He learned to walk. The other got crutches, along with two wooden legs, and he too began to practice. Slowly and surely he too learned how to walk. Korea’s narrow lanes and rocky paths are not easy to walk on with two strong legs like mine. But these brothers, now baptized, keep up with the best of them. While going with one to a Bible study over a hill I wanted to stop and rest, but he went on and laughed at me when I caught up to him. He is a congregation book study conductor now. The other one can give a wonderful three- to eightminute sermon and handle the Bible skillfully while balancing himself on his crutches.” The truth brought to these brothers through their Bible study gave them their only real hope and it gave them the incentive to overcome their handicap. In the new world they will be among the literally “lame” that will “climb up just as a stag does.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are still many places where the need is great in Korea. Some isolated groups need qualified overseers in order to be organized into congregations. Still nearly half of the congregation book study conductors in the country are sisters who are serving until some qualified brother is available. Some brothers have moved where the need is great and are reaping good results, but many more must do so before the good-will people can be adequately cared for. One sister reports that when she moved from Seoul to Cheju Island to work as a congregation publisher in a small congregation she was worried that she would not progress spiritually as fast as she would in the larger Seoul units. Later she wrote that in the smaller congregations she was called upon to participate more often and received more assignments in the meetings than when in Seoul. Actually she progressed even faster and she has since arranged her affairs so that she can pioneer. Now she is enjoying many times more satisfying privileges of teaching others than she would have had she remained where she was.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark89"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark326"></a>LEBANON</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The eyes of the world have been upon the internal struggle in the Middle East among the Arab states. While distress and perplexity rage, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to move to and fro looking after the interests of the Kingdom that Jehovah has placed in their care. There have been some very good results in gathering together the other sheep, and this despite the struggles and strife in and between nations. When conditions arise as they have in this part of the world, we must remember what Paul told Timothy: “Do not become ashamed of the witness about our Lord, neither of me a prisoner for his sake.” (2 Tim. 1:8) This is a time when brothers must stay together and this is the time when they must speak the truth. When they do so they receive a rich blessing from Jehovah. The Branch servant in Lebanon gives reports on the territories under his jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the constant preaching of the witnesses one prominent Catholic priest during the year staged a series of eight public talks to expose the doctrines of the witnesses. With each passing talk, however, the attendance decreased. In fact, it can be said that the attendance would have been even smaller yet if some of the brothers had not supported it in order to see what was going to be said. As usual, nothing worth hearing was said, so perhaps next time the brothers will make the clergy’s position even more ridiculous by not even contributing to its success or failure by their own presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the lecture failure he formed a flying squad whose objective was to come immediately to the home of any Catholic family where Jehovah’s witnesses were preaching and refute their arguments. However, after a few families had telephoned and the priest found himself running all over town trying to answer all the arguments of scores of witnesses, the whole plan dissolved and today this priest, his lectures, and his feeble religious effort have all been forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The neutrality of the witnesses was shown in some very fine experiences during the months of war. One brother, trapped in his home in a rebel-occupied territory, remained there over ten hours during a particularly heavy battle. Upon trying to leave his house he was captured by a soldier and taken to a military court. When the lawyer who was trying cases learned by his Bible and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> that he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he said: &quot;Oh, I know you, you’re one of Jehovah’s witnesses; don’t worry, you are free to go. I know you people and I know that you are not involved in politics or in political activities. Since it is late this evening, would you like to stay here tonight and preach to our prisoners? Or, if you like, remain here with us and preach to the people in our territory. But if it is really your desire to return, I will provide you with two escorts to help you arrive safely!” The brother accepted the latter proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One brother at his place of employment was approached by a committee of rebels to feel out his political associations. As they began to try to draw him out as to his stand a fellow worker boomed out: “Don’t ask him what his views are or you’ll get him started preaching about God’s kingdom, and he’ll be talking about it the rest of the day.” In the end this brother and the congregation servant were able to talk the rebels into a safe-conduct passage through their own lines to bring their wives down from villages where they had been isolated when the insurgents captured the territory.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark78"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark327"></a>IRAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">In one letter from the two faithful pioneers who opened up the work in Iran, they requested that some mature brother be sent over to help them to get the work and the meetings better organized. Unfortunately, there was no one available. Shortly after this and during the visit of the circuit servant three persons were baptized. Then when the zone servant visited Iran two more persons were baptized. Following this a publisher moved into Iran from Germany and not long after this a sister came to “serve where the need is great.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the new sheep was found in a most unusual way. One night while trying to start their motorcycle the special pioneer noticed a European woman standing on the street corner with her baby in her arms. He suggested to his wife that she approach the woman and witness to her. His wife at first felt hesitant but after a moment approached the woman while the pioneer continued to try to start the motorcycle. The conversation between the two women proved fruitful, a back-call was arranged and today, after only several months of study, this person is a dedicated and zealous publisher. She admitted to the pioneers after she had become friendly with them that before meeting them she had been praying to God for some comfort from His Word; “so how amazing that I should meet you not long after I prayed to God!” How glad that pioneer was that his motorcycle would not start, and how glad this new sister is that the pioneer and his wife should take advantage of every opportunity to scatter the seeds of truth, even under such incidental circumstances!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark328"></a>IRAQ</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The year 1958 saw the beginning of a battle to deport the missionaries and to close down the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society in Iraq. From almost the beginning of the service year the opposition began. Missionaries were followed in their house-to-house work, their home was watched and people of good will whom they contacted were questioned by the police as to the purposes of Jehovah’s witnesses. At first only called into the security office for questioning, they were later arrested and imprisoned overnight while their home was sealed and later searched. A mine detector was even used in a vain effort to find hidden weapons. When nothing harmful could be found, the missionaries were freed and given a statement clearing them of all Zionist charges and subversive activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But a short time later they were told to leave the country, and when a reason was requested, the answer was made: ‘Iraq is a sovereign state and therefore does not have to give a reason for its decisions.’ On the day the missionaries were leaving, that government suddenly fell, and the king, his family and others were murdered. Unfortunately, the new government is no more favorable than the previous one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Yet in spite of this and when the last appeal was being lost, three of the Lord’s other sheep suddenly and rapidly took their stand for the truth and were baptized. So while five have been scattered to new virgin territories, Jehovah has already replaced them by three other zealous new publishers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark329"></a>JORDAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Every piece of the Society’s literature is forbidden in the Jordan and it is even forbidden for one of Jehovah’s witnesses to enter the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Ramallah the police imprisoned the special pioneer there several times, and finally he and his wife were forced to leave the country. Later when the wife, who is a native Jordanian, tried to return to visit her sick mother, she and her husband were arrested and escorted to the border, where they were told not to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Bethlehem a brother who had worked for years for the post office was arrested for having in his possession copies of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> magazine. During his court trial he was freed on the grounds that the copies of literature in his possession had all legally entered the country before the ban was pronounced. The attorney for the prosecution, however, appealed the case and this time the brother was brought before a military court. Here, without the benefit of legal counsel and with no appeal permitted, the decision was changed and the brother was sentenced to one year in prison or a 100.000-dinar fine. The brother went to prison and is still there. However, his spirit is good, he has gained weight and has studied the Bible through twice, as well as having read the Greek Scriptures more than seven times. His faith is strong and he encourages his brothers to stand firm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In spite of all the difficulties, one brother in Amman, the capital, has tried hard to continue serving Jehovah as a pioneer and he has succeeded. Although almost alone and in a country that shows very, very little interest in the truth, he, his wife and a handful of others have continued preaching and sharing in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. We pray always that this brother will not give out, knowing that everlasting life will be given only to those who endure until the end.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark163"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark330"></a>SYRIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Brothers from a small village were told to report to the police in a nearby town for investigation. Upon reporting as directed they were arrested without charge, imprisoned, slapped many times about the face, and their heads were shaved as a sign of reproach. After a number of days of such treatment they were released by the authorities without comment. The brothers went away rejoicing that they had been privileged to suffer for righteousness once again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The one Kingdom Hall in Damascus was forcefully closed during the year. Congregational records of the peaceful Christians were scattered about by the security police, equipment was thrown down and the names of all the brothers assigned parts on the meetings were recorded. Prior to this dictatorial treatment these same security men had attended some of the meetings and had even had a home Bible study to see the nature of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is clearly written that Christians will be brought before governors and kings for the purpose of a witness. When this happens it is time to witness boldly and to stand firm. This can be accomplished only if we have perfect love for Jehovah God and count him as most important in our lives. To compromise at this point is to make null and void the very purpose for being dragged before these existing authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The difficulties in Lebanon caused Syria to close her borders, and communication for some time was completely cut off between the brothers and the Branch, yet during this time the brothers in Syria were thrilled to read about the wonderful Divine Will International Assembly in their own local newspapers. When it was impossible to communicate to the brothers in Syria the happy convention reports, a newspaper there carried a report, and this was widely read in Damascus. So the wonderful assembly in New York aided these brothers directly and they were able to rejoice along with their brothers all over the world.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark331"></a>KUWAIT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Only one active brother has turned in a report from this oil-rich Moslem country. This is an experience he had one day: “At the company where I am employed I was able to talk to a Moslem about spiritism. He mentioned that by means of spiritism one can talk with the dead. He asked me for my opinion. I replied that it was a very old belief and related Saul’s experience with the witch of Endor and that it displeased God. He tried vainly to argue for his belief, so I asked him this question: ‘Do you believe in the writings of Solomon?’ He replied: ‘Of course; all good Moslems do.’ So I read to him what Solomon said at Ecclesiastes 9:5-10, about the dead not knowing anything. So how could anyone talk with the dead if the dead had no thoughts? After that he began to listen attentively and I spoke to him about the good news of God’s kingdom. At the conclusion he was amazed at the message and asked how he might obtain a Bible to learn more about this message of truth. I promised not only to help him to obtain a Bible but to help him understand it as well.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark130"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark332"></a>QATAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For some time no witnessing was done in Qatar on the Persian Gulf. Now, however, one of Jehovah's servants is there preaching and spreading the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brother is doing quite well and distributing some literature as well as conducting some Bible studies. In one group there are eleven persons studying and in another place six. Perhaps in time some of these will prove to be persons with the right heart condition. We will look forward to next year’s report and hope that there will be others there. This country offers an opportunity to serve where the need is great, and certainly a mature brother would be of real value to the lone witness serving there at present.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark333"></a>LEEWARD ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus said to Peter: “Feed my young lambs.” (John 21:15) Many of these young lambs are found in the numerous islands of the Caribbean. Jehovah’s witnesses in the Leeward Islands rejoiced over the many encouraging experiences that they had during the past service year. All have been working diligently among the people month by month and there has been a very good increase throughout the territory assigned to the Leeward Islands Branch. Special pioneers and vacation pioneers have reached out into the remote parts of many of these islands and have given an excellent witness. There was some loss in number of publishers when some went to England to find work, but generally there has been a steady increase of publishers in the entire group of islands, totaling about 6 percent. So the ministers press on and have had good experiences, some of which are reported herewith.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark334"></a>ANTIGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Many of our publishers are becoming better-qualified ministers, able to handle situations with greater ease and effectiveness. What an aid vacation pioneering is in this regard! Those who arrange their affairs to enjoy this feature of service can testify to this fact, as did one young brother. He writes: “In April, while working as a vacation pioneer, I approached a young man and spoke to him about the Kingdom. Before I could read my second text he said, ‘Wait a minute. If you think you are going to convert me you are wasting your time. Do you know why?’ ‘No, I’d like you to tell me,’ I replied. ‘I’ve been a Sunday-school teacher at the Anglican Church for eight years,’ he continued. ‘Unfortunately, I am a backslider. Truly, I don’t think there is anyone who could let me see the straight and narrow road again.’ I showed him from the Scriptures that he could get back onto the straight road again if he was willing. He showed real interest and subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and has since been studying regularly and making rapid progress.” This young brother was overjoyed at this experience and well remembers the time when he could not have handled such a situation. Vacation pioneering has made him an able minister.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark335"></a>ANGUILLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Two special pioneers were assigned here early this year to aid the few publishers and to better care for the needs of the good-will people. One of the special pioneers says: &quot;The people are very kind and listen readily to our sermons. They believe that anyone who talks about God is good. However, they always tell us they are not going to leave the church that their parents followed.” Proud tradition has a firm hold here as it does in so many West Indian islands and only a real love for Jehovah and his Word will break it. It is hoped that the many Bible studies being conducted will help some to break free to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark336"></a>DOMINICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">“Exert yourselves vigorously” was the sound advice of Jesus. During the past year our brothers in Dominica have been doing just that, and a fine witness has been given throughout the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Be always ready to make a defense,” advises a sister. While she was returning from witnessing one day a group of people stopped her and asked how many people she had persuaded to follow her. She quickly pointed out that she was not interested in getting people to follow her but she was concerned about telling people the truth from God’s Word. A sermon was given with excellent results. One woman, formerly opposed, became very friendly. Two men took magazines and another subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> Never miss an opportunity to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An elderly sister was among six who did vacation pioneering in August. “These two weeks were weeks of real joy,” she said. “Repeatedly Roman Catholic people would express appreciation for what they learned as I studied </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom’</span><span class="font7"> with them.” Why not use this same booklet in your ministry and bring real joy to others?</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark337"></a>MONTSERRAT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in Montserrat with the two special pioneers have worked hard during the year, covering the island many times. Although they have seen no numerical increase, they have many Bible studies started. They realize that only by a study of Jehovah’s Word will one ever be freed from the power of false religion. Their hope is that some will break free to serve Jehovah as they grow in knowledge and understanding.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark338"></a>NEVIS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Our brothers in Nevis appreciate the value of personal study and the need to study with others. One or two who have failed to study have grown cold and dropped off. But the majority who study well are alive and busy studying with others. How powerful the Word of God can be in one’s life! A brother studied with a Methodist lady for some time and then she decided to be baptized. Her husband bitterly opposed such a step and came to the immersion scene to prevent it. All returned to the assembly hall, and when the husband had gone out of sight a taxi took this person and the brothers to another spot and the baptism went right ahead. The husband was furious when he found out, and there was no peace in the home that night or for weeks after. But accurate knowledge has carried this sister through and she continues to be a teacher of the good news.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark138"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark339"></a>ST. KITTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the zealous brothers in this island have spent their weekends witnessing in the country villages where the need is great. Because of this the island has been well covered. Those publishers caring for the Kingdom interests have many joys. Imagine their joy at the results of their magazine effort for August. For the first time the island averaged twelve per publisher for the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Have you ever had a clergyman come and take the attention of a person just as you were going to place some literature? One publisher in St. Kitts had this happen, so he left and made a return visit another day. He learned how the priest had denounced the witnesses and then asked the woman to come back to church. When she told him it was of no use because she could not understand him, he twisted her ears and said she was rude. What a good thing that this publisher called back! This woman was just waiting for a Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ST. MARTIN</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark340"></a><span class="font7">St. Martin is a beautiful, peaceful little island of some 8,000 inhabitants divided between the Dutch and the French. Here the peaceful message of God’s kingdom and the new world reaches every ear. The message has been encouraging to many, making them desire to do the divine will. Supporting this a missionary writes: “I was preparing my breakfast at seven o’clock one morning when two women, mother and daughter who had been studying the truth, came and wanted to be baptized. What should I do? I was all alone. I quickly went and got another brother and we had a baptism before breakfast! Happy were those two new sisters who returned home determined to do the divine will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The same peaceful message has a disturbing effect on the clergy. Recently a young Catholic woman took up the truth. She was immediately visited by the priest, who was disturbed to think that such a good member of the choir and Sacred Heart Society should become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. “Why, I can see danger,” he said, “when such an intelligent woman like you leaves the church. You could lead many others away.” As a last resort he offered her financial aid if she returned to church. To this day she continues in the truth, which is worth far more than money can buy.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark135"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark341"></a>ST. EUSTATIUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Good service is given the good-will people on this island by the circuit servant, who makes regular visits. The work is well respected and the magazines are well read. During the year a prominent Seventh-Day Adventist elder challenged the circuit servant to a public debate. The circuit servant saw no way out and, after some thought, accepted. The whole island turned out as the S.D.A. elder had boasted that Jehovah’s witnesses would never again visit the island after he had finished with them. During the debate several points were touched and the elder never gained a point. Finally he jumped to that good old S.D.A. theme, the law. He made his biggest mistake when he told them that the sabbath was the greatest commandment ever given. The circuit servant calmly read Matthew 22:36-40 to the crowd. Here the debate ended, with the truth magnified in the minds of the people and the elder leaving in a rage.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark342"></a>LIBERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York had a telling effect on Liberia. The newspapers in this country published nine separate articles about this great convention. A large picture was published of the delegation to the convention from Liberia, which numbered twenty-two. When these delegates returned, people stopped them on the streets wanting to know about this wonderful event. No matter where one travels in the world he sees how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity. (Ps. 133:1) So here in this land of Liberia our brothers dwell together, united in the one cause, that of preaching the good news of God’s kingdom. They have had some very interesting experiences and a few are here related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theocratic marriage is something altogether new to many persons living under native customary law sanctioning polygamy, and under conditions and social standards making adultery or “girl-friend, boy-friend palaver” commonly acceptable. So proper marriage is highlighted at every opportunity. At a circuit assembly arrangements were made to perform a triple wedding ceremony before the public talk. This greatly interested local residents, because long before the time almost 300 had crowded into the hall to hear the ceremonies, which were translated into the local dialect. So appreciative was the audience that almost everyone remained for the public talk that followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The importance of conducting Bible studies even with illiterate persons who show interest can be seen from the following experience sent in by a pioneer who reports the happy results of such a study: “In our territory are many Moslems, and recently one of them, a well-known expert woodcarver, stopped going through the daily, repetitious, monotonous prayers to Allah at the Mosque. Now he happily associates at our Kingdom Hall and daily preaches the thrilling Kingdom message from house to house. He has turned from the Ramadan fast to feasting at Jehovah’s table. This created a furor among the Mohammedans. They accused him of being ignorant of the Bible, never having read it, to which he replied that most of them had never read the Koran, yet believed in it. When questioned as to why he left Islam, he simply replies: ‘I have sense enough to know what is right from what is wrong. The Moslem faith gives no promise for a future life on earth. The idea that the earth will be burned up and all Moslems will be taken to heaven does not make sense. The true Christian faith holds out the hope of enjoying everlasting life on earth. For twenty-three years I have been fooled by the Moslem religion. I am now determined to stand for the true religion, cost what it may.’ One of the white lady missionaries of the local Episcopalian order who had known this man for years was so surprised to hear of his conversion that she sent for him and wanted to record his experience in his own words on her tape recorder.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sticking to Jehovah’s right principles can result in saving others as well as ourselves, as illustrated in the following experience. Although seriously ill, a young isolated sister strongly resisted treatment from a man who promised to cure her through witchcraft. Her superstitious relatives then angrily carried her to a medical station. The medical assistant in charge became quite amazed at this young girl’s knowledge and love of Jehovah’s laws, her determination to maintain virtue despite family efforts to prostitute her, and her willingness to die rather than eat blood. “What kind of a religion is this?” he exclaimed with interest. After she proved that the Bible forbids the use of blood, he declared he would not accept any payment for her treatment. Thereafter a missionary sister and her companion arrived to visit the patient. Realizing that this had meant a seven-hour walk for these sisters, the medical assistant was struck with the love and unity within the New World society. This prompted him to ask many questions and he received satisfying answers. Soon afterward the circuit servant visited and remained for two nights, during which time the medical assistant accompanied the brother in the house-to-house work and then later interpreted the public talk. He plans now to become one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and his happiness is due in large measure to the young sister who kept walking in her integrity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark94"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark343"></a>LUXEMBOURG</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In this small country in the central part of Europe “this good news of the kingdom will be preached” the same as it is being done in all the inhabited earth “for the purpose of a witness to all the nations.” (Matt. 24:14) Good progress has been made. Diligent efforts have been put forth by the ministers of the good news and sixteen of the brothers there enjoyed the international assembly in New York. The delegates returned home full of joy and enthusiasm and all were convinced that this assembly will contribute in a large measure to the further expansion and the fortifying of the Kingdom work in Luxembourg. Just ten years ago, in 1948, there were sixty publishers and now there are 268. The experiences related in the Branch servant’s report show why this growth has been so constant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the magazine work a lady was contacted who was very downhearted because of the many disappointments that she had experienced during her lifetime. She accepted a magazine and this opened the way for a back-call to be made. Well-planned back-calls then led to a home Bible study with the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True.”</span><span class="font7"> Regular study quickly convinced this lady that she had found the true religion. After six months we saw her among the candidates for baptism at our district assembly. Much earlier she had begun to attend the meetings, which had also stimulated her for the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The home Bible study was continued by the sister after this lady was immersed until they had also studied the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font7"> together. In the meantime eight further months had passed since her baptism and our new sister was anxious to do still more. The Memorial month with its special activities came and she registered for vacation pioneering. This taste of full-time service so satisfied and enthused her that she took up the regular pioneer service the following month, although she has already passed her fiftieth year. Home Bible studies are a wonderful means of helping people of good will to recognize their responsibility in Jehovah’s organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A lady who was interested in the truth was contacted in the service from house to house and she accepted some literature. At the first back-call she asked for further literature and her husband also showed interest. A little later she subscribed for the magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">Then the publisher was suddenly taken sick and had to cancel the next back-call by letter. Most unexpectedly she then received the following letter: “Since you have visited us we find ourselves in a mental conflict . . . We have always led good and pious lives and fulfilled our Christian duty. And now suddenly should everything be changed? And what about our boy? How are we to educate him, seeing that everything is Catholic in the schools? These are all problems which cannot be overlooked. My husband reproaches me; he fears we might do wrong. He says we have been worshiping Christ Jesus till now, and he would not feel really satisfied without the Sunday mass. Anyway, we will get ourselves a Bible for a start, and will study the booklets well. Perhaps we will find the way we must go ourselves.” That was on October 29, 1957.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the publisher recovered she decided to visit this family again. To her joyous surprise she was received with great pleasure. In the meantime both this man and woman had read all the booklets and the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">magazine regularly and were convinced this was the truth. The woman said: “If you had not come to us now, then we would have come to you.” A study was started. In January the film was shown in their home, and the same day they began to attend the congregation meetings. At the circuit assembly in April the man accompanied a publisher in the field service. Today they are both active ministers and are planning to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah by water immersion at our district assembly. Love for the other sheep demonstrated by conscientious back-calling bears good fruit.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark100"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark344"></a>MAURITIUS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus stated that while the seeds of truth would be liberally spread and would germinate in the minds of people represented by several kinds of soil, yet for various reasons not so many would allow the seed to develop to maturity. It is not that the missionaries have not worked diligently, for they have. It can be said of them as it was of the early disciples: “I did not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” (Acts 20:20) Despite this there has not been a great increase in Mauritius, but the work still goes on. It has been only a few years that missionaries have been in these lands, and by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness a few publishers of the good news are being found. Some experiences are set out here from Mauritius and then Madagascar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The missionaries have been working hard. One sister reports that Bible studies can be kept alive and interesting by aiding persons of good will from the very beginning to memorize key texts and to use their Bible. If a question is asked each week at the end of the study as “homework,” this too encourages personal study, and the results have been amazing. A Bible study was started with a married couple, and soon all the family joined in the study. Although they have only finished studying </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom,”</span><span class="font7"> two have already been out in the service and one is able to give sermons fluently himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another sister, after just two studies, was introduced to the lady’s husband, who, after many questions, admitted that not only were he and his wife very interested in Jehovah’s witnesses but many people at work were too. However, the priest had told him that he would see to it that he would lose his job if he associated with us. He feared for his wife and six children. The missionary made use of several scriptures showing the need for knowledge to make one strong, so the studies continue. They have just been to see the film; their courage is increasing and they are progressing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark345"></a>MADAGASCAR</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One of the outstanding features of the year was the first circuit assembly which was held in March. The service meeting attendance was thirty, and ten were immersed. Even though there is just one congregation on what is one of the largest islands in the world, they have a circuit servant who makes regular visits. So not only are we providing the fine spiritual food from Jehovah’s table to our Madagascar friends, but our organization is ready for expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Tananarive, the capital, a Malagasy woman came into possession of a copy of our tract </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a New World</span><span class="font7"> in her native language. She had searched for some time for our representatives, but now it was not long before a study in French in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> was commenced, and after some months she was attending the regular studies. She was baptized at the recent assembly. So a little tract in the Malagasy language is able to start a person on the way to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another special pioneer says that when visiting an </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> subscriber for a renewal he met one of his work mates, and he, too, wanted to know about Jehovah’s witnesses and their beliefs. Later, at a home visit this one explained that he had become a Baptist because he believed they were more in line with the Scriptures on the subject of immersion. Now from our literature he was astonished to learn that the Baptists were in error on the subject of eternal torment and the trinity. Later his Baptist pastor called to try to recover his straying sheep. He tried in vain to defend the trinity doctrine and departed in fury. His attitude was all that was necessary to encourage this person of good will. He shortly dedicated himself and was baptized and happy to be a praiser of the name of Jehovah to his Malagasy friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While no one has been able to visit the island of La Reunion for nearly three years, the amount of continued interest there is surprising. Here is an opportunity for French citizens wishing to serve where the need is great.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark346"></a>MEXICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Kingdom ministers in Mexico have pushed on and have attained new peaks in every field of activity. This has not been accomplished without trials and difficulties, or persecution on the part of the religionists. Of course, there are many Catholics who think that Jehovah’s witnesses should not preach as they are preaching throughout all the country. But those in the New World society feel just like the apostles, who through Peter and John said: “Whether it is righteous in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, make your decision. But as for us, we cannot stop speaking about the things we have seen and heard.” (Acts 4:19, 20) So kindly, but with determination, the witnesses press on preaching everywhere they can. It is stimulating to the members of the New World society to know that 503 from Mexico were able to attend the international assembly in New York. Here are some of the experiences from that land that have taken place over the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A person of good will attended the national assembly in Mexico City, where, to her surprise, she sat down next to her son’s mother-in-law, who was also studying with one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The two attended the assembly every day and were very happy. Before returning to her home this person of good will expressed her desire and the desire of thirty other persons who live in her little town for the circuit servant to visit them and show them how to publish and to organize them as an isolated group. How did they know about the national assembly and the truth? A publisher from the Federal District visited them faithfully every weekend by first riding away across town on his bicycle, loading his bicycle on the bus and, after a bus trip of eighty-two miles, riding his bicycle again for the last two hours of his trip to study with these interested persons!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A district servant gives this experience concerning the film: “The thirtieth of March of this year the newspaper </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Eyipantla,</span><span class="font7"> San Andres Tuxtla, Veracruz, published an article about a mob that was formed against the special pioneer and his wife in Comoapan, Veracruz, while working there. It was in this same place on the fourteenth of August that I decided to exhibit the film ‘The New World Society in Action.’ The results? There are ten of Jehovah’s witnesses in Comoapan, but 553 attended the showing of the film!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Wherever the Catholic Church reigns much immorality is found, with people living consensually and in common-law marriage. In such countries Jehovah’s witnesses stand out even more as a clean God-fearing people. This is true in Mexico. They are highly respected for this stand by all persons who love righteousness. In 1951 it came time for the brothers living consensually to get married legally or be disfellowshiped from the organization. An experience of interest just came to my attention concerning one group of forty-five couples that were married legally in El Salto, Durango. The judge performing the ceremonies was deeply touched, and later, when giving a talk in the town plaza, he said: “We claim to be such good patriots and citizens, but we are put to shame by Jehovah’s witnesses. They are an example to us because they don’t permit a single person in their organization who is living in common-law marriage and has not legalized his marriage and, you Catholics, almost all of you are living in common-law marriage and have not legalized your marriage.” At this same time another couple was legalizing their marriage and their several children were present. When the judge asked the father: “Do you accept this woman as your wife and companion for a lifetime?” one of the little girls quickly raised her head and looked up at her father and tenderly said, “Tell him ‘yes,’ Papa.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> readers will remember the mob in Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas, where the fanatic Catholic element pelted a bus entering the city thinking it carried a load of Jehovah’s witnesses, only to find none were on it but it carried the priest from Comita! On June 4 I received a letter from the district servant, who comments on the aftermath of this mob in these words: “Letters from the congregation servant of Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas, show that the people who participated in the mobs against us while we were gathered together in assembly last month in April have changed completely, including the authorities. The city attorney told the congregation servant: ‘That priest will not have his way on another occasion.’ He told the brother that if the same thing that happened this time happened again when we were gathered together in assembly, he would personally recommend the expelling of the priest in order to throw him out of the place! The congregation servant also mentions that several persons of good will are extremely interested because of the exhibition of the film.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that the Catholic Church takes such an unchristian action against the truth-spreading, peaceloving witnesses of Jehovah shows that their biblically unfounded religion is in danger because it cannot stand against the truth. Some of our brothers have lost their lives because of such fanatic persecution, but in spite of it all the brothers are undaunted, and in the spirit of Jehovah, which cannot be quenched, they continue giving Jehovah exclusive devotion. This we are determined to do in Mexico along with our brothers in all other parts of the world, including those behind the Iron Curtain!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark347"></a>MOROCCO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In just a few short years the work has moved ahead well in Morocco. Did not Paul say: “Did not God make the wisdom of the world foolish? For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not get to know God, God saw good through the foolishness of what is preached to save those believing”? (1 Cor. 1:20, 21) So today it is necessary for Jehovah’s witnesses to go places and preach to save those who are believing. There are some very interesting experiences in this regard in Morocco, and, incidentally, twenty delegates came to the Divine Will International Assembly from Morocco and have now returned, showing great enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister arrived to serve where the need is great. Although a grandmother, she did not think that the work in North Africa would be too difficult for her. Upon her arrival in Casablanca she immediately applied herself to learning a French presentation. Two days after her arrival she was in the territory. Her first day in the service was very encouraging. She was able to place many magazines although her French was very limited. The following day, in the same territory, a young student who had taken magazines from the sister came running at top speed to see her. He wanted to know if he could write to the Branch office to obtain more information about the Society. 'No, that wouldn’t be necessary,’ replied the sister. She immediately arranged for a study with the young man and invited him to attend the public lecture on Sunday. To her surprise, just four days after her arrival she had this “sheep” down at the Kingdom Hall participating in the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study. Within a few days she was happily blessed when this individual became a new praiser of Jehovah’s name. One month in the country, and already one new publisher!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is an experience of a large family of ten. Eight of them live in the small town of Marrakech. Years ago a publisher distributed some literature among the people of Marrakech. The family in question obtained a book from him. No back-call was made. The book was put aside because it was “too difficult to understand without someone’s help.” In 1958 the Society sent a married couple, special pioneers, to this town. Other publications of the Society were placed with this family, the difference being that back-calls were regularly made week after week. The weekly attendance at this home Bible study averaged about twelve persons. The regular, well-prepared spiritual meals faithfully served to this family of the Lord’s sheep proved to be strengthening. Can you imagine the joy of the two special pioneers when one after another all of the family began sharing in the preaching activity? Just think of their exuberant happiness when they further witnessed four of them being immersed in water to symbolize their dedication to Jehovah! Yet the joy of the pioneers would not have been complete if two other members of this family had not been baptized in France at the assembly held in Mulhouse this year. The parents now have already decided to be baptized, with their two remaining children, at the earliest opportunity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark104"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark348"></a>NETHERLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Surely there is no point in gathering together a lot of material things when you cannot take them with you and when, while you are alive, it takes up so much of your time to look after them. How true Paul was in giving fine counsel to the young man Timothy: “For we have brought nothing into the world, and neither can we carry anything out”! (1 Tim. 6:7) So the important thing is to preach the good news, which our brothers in the Netherlands are doing. There are so many opportunities that arise for one dedicated to Jehovah God to preach that a publisher should never become discouraged, but always seek for opportunities to talk to someone to whom he can bring this wonderful message. The experiences from the Netherlands show this. But before reading them we would like to say that 170 delegates returned safely to the Netherlands from the Divine Will assembly and these are spreading the infectious spirit of the grand feast throughout the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a very scenic part of the country, a sister was surveying the garden in front of her lovely home when a man walked up to her and asked her if it would be possible for him to put up his tent in the woods back of the garden. She answered that her husband would have to make that decision, but, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, he was at the moment busy preaching from house to house. “When he comes home you can ask him,” she said. When the husband came home he approved of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That same evening the stranger asked some questions, and a good witness was given. About four weeks later he came from his home city, Rotterdam, together with his family and they set their tent up and were to stay for about ten days. In the meantime a study was established in the home of this brother, and this stranger and his family attended and became very much interested. Without doubt this gesture of hospitality by the brother and his wife had much to do with this aroused interest. This man returned the show of hospitality a few days later by letting the publishers in that place have his small bus to go to work isolated territory; the owner of the bus went along too and had a good time with the publishers. After he returned to Rotterdam the study was continued in his home. During the convention the brother and sister were invited to stay at the home of this interested man, and he had the pleasure of attending the national convention held in Rotterdam. Such are the results of following the way of hospitality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Perseverance in doing what is good does produce good fruits. A brother was working from house to house, and at the door of a certain home a woman furiously scolded him and slammed the door in his face. The brother likely had a queer feeling in his stomach when by sheer chance he found himself ready to ring the doorbell at the same house some weeks later. The son opened the door as the parents were away that afternoon. At the moment when he was about to leave, the man of the house and his wife came up the walk. The brother was now ready for almost anything and everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But as it turned out, all ended happily. At the moment the couple had no time, as the man was celebrating his birthday. The brother tactfully took leave, leaving two magazines behind. This friendly meeting opened the way for many back-calls, and it later appeared that the woman had been so nasty due to her experience with false religion previously. But she was really a lover of truth. The man was in the army but was sick and tired of that. It was not long before a study was started here, really a reward for endurance and maintaining a positive attitude of mind even under trying circumstances.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark349"></a>NETHERLANDS ANTILLES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There is a group of three islands making up the Netherlands Antilles and scattered throughout these islands are many of Jehovah’s witnesses. They are helping the people who love righteousness to gain a knowledge of the truth, and the way they feel about their Christian work can be expressed in these words: “In the morning sow your seed and until the evening do not let your hand rest, for you are not knowing where this will have success, either here or there, or whether both of them will alike be good.” (Eccl. 11:6) So diligently they sow seed and throughout the year they gather, and year after year sees marked increases in this territory. Here are some of the experiences from the Branch servant as he relates them.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark350"></a>CURASAO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the assembly while Brother Henschel was here eighteen were immersed, which is the largest baptism we have ever had here in Curacao. For the year twenty-eight have been immersed, and that is nearly twice as many as were baptized in Curacao in any previous year. We are encouraged by this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since returning from the assembly we have been playing a different talk of the convention each Sunday night from a tape and it has increased our meeting attendance wonderfully. Even those that attended the convention are excited about hearing the talks again. One of the more appropriate subjects for our territory is the talk “Keeping Strict Watch on How We Walk.” It was appreciated and commented on by many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While going from house to house a missionary happened to call at the home of an American lady where there was a meeting of the American women’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">club. After the missionary presented the subscription offer the first lady to speak came out with a firm refusal to take anything, but the lady of the house was not swayed by public opinion. She said she knew </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> from Texas and, while she did not agree with everything in it, she admired the zeal of Jehovah’s witnesses, so she subscribed. Then a doctor’s wife spoke up and said that when they were in Europe on vacation in 1955 witnesses were all over the place. She also subscribed, so two new subscriptions were obtained in an unlikely setting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last October a brother, his wife and son of seven years came to Curacao to serve where the need is great. The brother obtained a very good job; and the sister, being able to drive their car, has been a big help to the congregation by taking groups in the service during the week. She has enjoyed some good experiences too. One experience was when she called on a prominent Catholic lady and found a lot of interest because recently the nuns at school had painted such a horrible picture of hell that one child could not sleep for a couple of nights.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark351"></a>ARUBA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Without a doubt the biggest event of the year for the friends in Aruba was the Divine Will International Assembly in New York. Of the fifty delegates from the Netherlands Antilles, more than half of them were from the smallest island, Aruba. Now that most of them are back home, the convention is the topic of conversation between the brothers and people of good will that read about the convention in the local papers and other publications coming into Aruba from the U.S.A., Jamaica, Trinidad and British Guiana. From every direction news of the convention poured into Aruba.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The article in the September 8, 1958, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> about Aruba’s solving its water problem, which was sent in by an </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> correspondent in Aruba, really caused a sensation in Aruba. That issue went like hot cakes and many government officials came looking for copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When we had the circuit assembly in Aruba in March the friends had a pleasant surprise. The husband of a sister that had been opposed to the truth got baptized. He had been showing interest for some time, and he told the congregation servant he had made a dedication and planned to symbolize it by being immersed at the assembly. He did not tell his wife, however, and when he sat in the front row during the baptism talk she thought he was in the wrong place. But when he stood up to answer the question—well, you have never seen such a happy crowd at a baptism. One was reminded of Jesus’ parable at Luke 15:1-7.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark352"></a>BONAIRE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">At the last assembly in Bonaire one sister went in the witness work for the first time and, even though she was working “Church Street,” one of the so-called toughest territories in town, she placed more magazines than anyone. This was a source of encouragement to her and to the other publishers too. To this sister from out of town, Church Street was the same as any other street, so she went to work it with a positive attitude and Jehovah blessed her efforts. All of Jehovah’s witnesses should have a positive attitude about the preaching work, trusting in Jehovah, and he will bless their efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the friends of Bonaire obtained a bigger and better Kingdom Hall right on the main road between Kralendijk and Antriol, the largest towns on the island; they are about one mile apart. The hall has a nice sign on it and many people see it and are favorably impressed. Even people from Curacao that go to Bonaire on business or for the weekend come back telling about seeing the fine Kingdom Hall there and saying that they are surprised that we have a congregation in Bonaire too. Fine Kingdom Halls give stature to the organization.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark353"></a>NEWFOUNDLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Christian witnesses of Jehovah in Newfoundland have been very interested in goals during the year, their principal one being preaching the good news and qualifying for it. They had in mind the scripture: “I am pursuing down toward the goal.’’ (Phil. 3:14) Of course, they were fixing their eyes on the right kind of goals, which meant they needed wisdom, putting their knowledge to work, as is stated by the Proverbs: “Wisdom is before the face of the understanding one, but the eyes of the stupid one are at the extremity of the earth.” (Prov. 17:24) The ministers in the thirty-one congregations were really interested in the training program that the Society had outlined, for it surely would make them more able ministers. Here are some of their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The training program moves ahead. There are many more who, upon seeing the progress others have made, are eager to be assigned in the training program. Several letters have been sent to our office asking for help in the teaching work. One such writes: “I am anxious to have a part in preaching the good news. Will you please advise me how I can get in touch with the nearest congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses as I would like to have some help in the service.” Another writes: “I have neglected the ministry too long. I would like once again to associate with the New World society in the preaching work. Would you please advise me of the location of the nearest congregation, as I would like to take an active part in the service. I do need a lot of help.” When the brothers are so eager to be trained in the preaching work it is a real joy to assist them. We shall continue willingly and anxiously to help such ones as companions in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In one of the settlements the local clergyman decided to visit the public schools to stir up the children’s interest in the church. He began by asking the children Bible questions, such as, “How many books are there in the Bible? How many books in the ‘Old Testament’? How many in the ‘New Testament’? Who was the first Bible writer?” etc. These questions were asked of a student body of about twenty-five, and of all the students present only two could answer the questions. These two students were Jehovah’s witnesses who were enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School. When the two young students were asked how it was possible for them to answer the questions, they answered, “It was by taking full advantage of the Ministry School, especially the written reviews.” However, there are some who do neglect the Theocratic Ministry School and they can certainly take a lesson from the foregoing experience. As Christian witnesses of Jehovah our goal should always be: “Never miss a meeting if at all possible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The climax of the service year came when more than 50 percent of the regular ministers in Newfoundland made their way to New York for the grand Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. What a joy it was for the 218 delegates from Newfoundland to be there and receive the rich spiritual blessings Jehovah had in store for us!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark354"></a>NEW ZEALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are very grateful to their God for the bountiful spiritual blessings poured out upon them during the year, and the report sent in by the present Branch servant indicates this. The former Branch servant, Brother Lazenby, finished his earthly work after faithfully serving full time in Jehovah’s organization for twentyseven years. All those who knew him knew of his exclusive devotion and they rejoice that he is included among those of whom it is said: “Let them rest from their labors, for the things they did go right with them.” (Rev. 14:13) He was faithful to the very end and saw many of the rich blessings of the year come to pass. The report reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The 1958 service year has been the most eventful one in New Zealand’s theocratic history. Toward its beginning we had three outstanding “Life-giving Wisdom” district assemblies. Then in March the Society moved into its new Branch headquarters in Auckland, the country’s largest and most progressive city. A few days later 4,119 attended the Memorial celebration throughout the dominion. June 13 saw the opening session of a three-day dedication program for the Society’s new Kingdom Hall and Branch buildings coincide with a one-day visit of 150 Australian brothers who were on their way to the international assembly in New York. The occasion was exceptionally stimulating. Then and later 152 local delegates left for the Divine Will International Assembly to represent more than half of our eighty-seven congregations. These great events have infused new life into the brothers, as indicated by the new peak in August of 3,346 publishers, a 21.8-percent increase. Now there is one publisher to every 616 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If you have a study with a housewife who has an opposed husband, have you tried taking a brother along to talk to him? This sister did, with these results: The sister started the study and the husband went out to the back shed. After a while the brother went out to talk to the husband. Tactfully he talked, showing the real purpose of the message and what it would mean to him. The husband led the way back into the house and manifested more interest. He sat in on the study the following week as well as subsequent ones. At the next circuit assembly both he and his wife were baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many youths are learning the truth in New Zealand and some are taking their stand firmly amid much opposition, as in this case: “A schoolboy, fifteen, while on school vacation sat in on two Bible studies with his sister-in-law and also attended congregation meetings. He showed real interest, expressing the wish to continue a Bible study back at boarding school. That was arranged. Also, he attended local meetings on weekends. Soon he was faced with the requirement of compulsory attendance at Sunday evening church service. His knowledge of the truth would not allow him to go. Now he was threatened with instant dismissal for his solid stand for true worship. Neither the college principal nor the youth’s opposed mother could move him to compromise. Although he was only in the second year of his four-year scholarship (all free), he left rather than share in false religion. Now at home with his bitterly opposed parents, he contemplates symbolizing his dedication as he continues his schooling and his theocratic training by attending all meetings, speaking in the Ministry School and engaging zealously in preaching the good news.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark114"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark355"></a>NICARAGUA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It is good to see how richly blessed the organization in Nicaragua has been during the past year because of faithfulness in preaching the good news. Many have been gathered in and their experiences have been just like those of other brothers throughout the world as they go about this work: “For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God.” (2 Cor. 10:5) They do the preaching in the large cities and out in the little villages and country places, and it is expected it will not be too long before everyone in Nicaiagua will have had the opportunity of at least hearing the truth. They will have to decide whether to accept it or not. Here are some of the experiences sent in by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We are very glad for the increase in publishers and also to see that the work is expanding into new territories. A circuit servant relates that he had to leave his wife at a congregation and travel by horse, oxcart and on foot, with the congregation servant guiding him, to get back into a place where the brothers had been witnessing. A great deal of interest was found as studies are being conducted more or less regularly. In fact, there is no other organized religious activity there, ours being the only meetings held. There is no town, just groups of farms. Besides those already studying, many more of the people note the good work of the brothers and how much love they show in feeding the sheep. At one group thirty-one attended the public talk. One married couple with their three-month-old baby walked five miles through rough country to go in the service and to attend the meetings. On the next visit, four months later, one of these groups was organized into a congregation and there are good prospects for more in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In another part of the country, in practically virgin territory, two brothers got a ride on a truck going to a small village. When they arrived everyone came out to see who the two strangers were and to meet them. One brother took out his Bible, gave a sermon and offered the literature. The people came up with their money and took all the books they had brought with them. Thus with one sermon nearly all the people in the village were reached. On the ride back to town a good discussion was had with a schoolteacher who lives away out in the “bush,” and he took literature with him too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While the work slacked a little during July and August, with twenty-nine away at the assembly, it was not really a loss, as all the brothers returned greatly enthused and we look forward to doing the divine will in the years ahead and to helping many more to do the same thing.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark356"></a>NIGERIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">About 60 percent of the country of Nigeria is still unassigned territory. The only way to care for some of this territory is by sending special pioneers to it to get it worked. Even then they have other difficulties because they meet up with many people who are not believers at all in God’s Word. Those in the truth who are doing missionary work in these isolated places often recall to mind the scripture: “What partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness?” (2 Cor. 6:14) But despite their troubles and problems the brothers press on, and marvelous increase has been attained during this year in Nigeria. The Branch servant gives reports on Nigeria, Dahomey and Fernando Po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The special pioneers have also contributed their share to our 50-percent increase in home Bible studies this year, although they sometimes have difficulty in keeping the studies running in intensely Catholic areas against the opposition of the priests. Starting a study with a storekeeper in the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,<sup>1</sup>”</span> a<span class="font7">special pioneer called back for the second study and found the man very fearful because the “Reverend Father” had visited him and warned him against receiving Jehovah’s witnesses into his home because they are deceivers. The pioneer reports: “Having known his objection it was easy for me to give an impromptu sermon on ‘How to know a deceiver.’ I used the Scriptures to show him that men would arise taking to themselves titles, like ‘Reverend’ and ‘Father,’ that belong only to God, that they would forbid to marry and command them to abstain from eating meat on certain days and would hinder people from reading the Bible.” The storekeeper could easily see from this who was the deceiver, but another Catholic present became angry and tried to push the pioneer out of the store. The storekeeper intervened and told the opposer that he could see that the Catholic Church has no Scriptural evidence of being the true church and that he can no longer blindly believe the “Reverend Father” as many do. The study continued and now the storekeeper is a publisher. Not only that, but the opposer thought about the matter and then went to the “Reverend Father” and began asking him why they have such titles and other such embarrassing questions. He was told: “Do not be in doubt,” which he found to be such an unsatisfactory answer that he sought out the pioneer he had formerly opposed and subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many of the missions have taught their people to refuse all literature of Jehovah’s witnesses and not to talk to them. The brothers often have to use original methods to overcome this. Meeting a mission schoolteacher, a publisher found it hard to give a witness and impossible to leave literature. “If you got a letter from a friend, would you read it?” inquired the brother. “Why, of course,” replied the teacher. The brother then got his name and address and went home and wrote him a kind letter including a fine sermon. On the back-call the brother found the man had read it and looked up all the scriptures and was now quite ready to listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We could not close the report without mentioning the great climax of the year, the Divine Will International Assembly. Nigeria was represented by twelve delegates and they are now busy relaying the news to the brothers all over the country. One of them, a district servant, recently wrote: “Although the assembly finished in New York on August 3, it is just opening here in Eastern Nigeria.” As he traveled back through his district he had to stop at every large town and give a personal report to all the brothers who had come in from miles around. At one place they had hired a hall and filled it with 700 people. He talked until midnight and they drank in every word about that wonderful event. Yes, the returning delegates are doing a wonderful reporting job, and here in Nigeria, thousands of miles from Yankee Stadium, the full impact of the assembly will be felt in coming months as each one of our 24,000 publishers gets down to doing the divine will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DAHOMEY</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark357"></a><span class="font7">Dahomey is a country in which superstitious idol worship abounds. Although many nominally profess the Christian faith, either Catholic or Protestant, all are held fast by their jujus. A pioneer reports meeting a man in a village and trying to witness to him. The man said: &quot;Can’t you see I am busy? Today I am making a great feast for my juju and I am spending 35,000 francs on it. Come back another time.” Accepting him at his word, the pioneer returned some weeks later and found the man lying very sick on his bed. Going into the room he began to comfort the sick man from the Scriptures, describing the blessings of the new world, where sickness will be no more. Seeing that the patient was reviving a little in spirit under the soothing influence of the oil of God’s Word, the pioneer inquired: “Did I not see you a few weeks ago making a great sacrifice to your god? How is it, then, that he has not blessed you but has allowed you to become so sick?” The man agreed that his sacrifice was of no avail, but expressed fear of displeasing his god. The pioneer then built up his faith in Jehovah and assured him that if he would serve Jehovah no juju could harm him. “No good came from your expensive sacrifice,” said the witness, “so stop sacrificing now and you will see also that no evil will come either, for God’s Word says that these wooden gods can do neither good nor evil.” On returning some time later the pioneer found the man in good health and convinced of the worthlessness of his god that could do neither good nor evil.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark358"></a>FERNANDO PO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is good to be able to report once more that the good news is being preached on the little island of Fernando Po. Since 1951 we have been hoping for an opportunity to reach the island people. Many Nigerian laborers are at work there in the plantations, and among them are a few brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They report that conditions are hard. Hours of work are long and religious tolerance is not practiced. They have to use great discretion in declaring the good news.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark359"></a>NORTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">For a number of years now the territory of Northern Rhodesia has been worked every week, there being one publisher for every eighty persons in the country. Many of the publishers who can arrange their affairs to travel to other lands as special pioneers do so, appreciating that the need is great. Jehovah’s witnesses know that there is a broad road leading to destruction, and they want to show the narrow way to everyone they can. As the Bible states: “Go in through the narrow gate; because broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction, and many are the ones going in through it.” (Matt. 7:13) So in this vast territory in Central Africa under the Northern Rhodesian Branch we have most interesting reports. These experiences come from Northern Rhodesia itself, Belgian Congo, Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A village headman who was a polygamist attended a showing of the film “The Happiness of the New World Society” and heard the comment that those congregated in the New World society have abandoned the practices of this old system of things, including polygamy. As soon as he returned home he immediately set apart his second wife, living as husband with only his first wife. When the circuit servant called at the village this man of good will arranged to have his marriage registered with the Native Authorities. But he needed to do more, he needed to gain an accurate knowledge of the truth; so the circuit servant arranged for a home Bible study to be commenced in his home, and this is completing the process of transforming that good-will person’s personality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Though the constant witnessing by the many publishers in this land has made a clear division for and against the truth, there are still new ones coming in, making their minds over and becoming captive to the truth. A circuit servant relates this Nicodemus-like experience: “The news of the public talk was heard by the leaders of a nearby mission, and they sent word to ask me to come and speak to them also. ‘Do not be worried because we belong to our church, but we need you to come to us. Please come in the evening.’ When I arrived fifty-nine people were already gathered, and they greeted me warmly. A talk was given explaining the New World hope and the basis for gaining life in the paradise earth. In conclusion, the latest magazine was presented, and twenty copies were placed. One of the mission leaders said, ‘Surely, this time I have heard the truth.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year new laws were passed by the government designed to give them more control over the holding of open-air public meetings and the formation of societies. The new Societies’ Ordinance requires that all societies of ten or more persons be registered or receive official exemption from registration. Every congregation of any religion has to apply individually. Apart from the confusion naturally resulting from implementing a law like this, we have met with little difficulty and up till the present almost half of the congregations have received exemption from registration under the ordinance, and we expect the remainder to be exempted in due course. Interestingly, every registration or exemption from registration is listed in the official </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government Gazette,</span><span class="font7"> and the large number of listings of congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses has been a witness in itself. Under the heading “The ‘Witnesses’ Predominate in Ordinance Exemption” the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Northern News</span><span class="font7"> of August 13, 1958, commented: “The Jehovah’s witnesses . . . were by far the most numerous in the exemptions column of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Government Gazette</span><span class="font7"> this week, when registrations and exemptions under the Societies’ Ordinance were published.” The number of exemptions for other religious bodies were few by comparison.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark360"></a>BELGIAN CONGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">For the first time verbal permission was obtained from the local government authorities for the brothers to hold congregation meetings, this despite the fact that the legal ban against the work has not been lifted. Up till this time no congregation meetings had been possible, and meetings of just small groups for Bible study in homes had been held. Now the brothers got busy and arranged as their first organized congregation meetings the Memorial celebration, and at the five Leopoldville units a total of 1,019 were present. Onlookers marveled, not only because the meetings were held at all, but to witness the joyful spirit of Christian fellowship manifest by the brothers. It caused several there and then to see that here was a people different from the other religions because ‘they manifest love among themselves.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The city servant was later brought before a local administrator for the city and told that the authorities could not find anything wrong with the brothers’ form of worship, and permission was given for them to meet regularly three times a week, “to sing, pray and study the Bible.” One of the unit servants writes: “The field service is going along all right, thanks to Jehovah. Brothers and sisters enjoy the gathering together and freely praising the Creator. While we meet we are often visited by inspectors of the government, who verify how we study. We thank Jehovah God, who has given us these privileges, and we keep on asking him for guidance through his holy spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is hoped that the coming year will see the way opened for better supervision to be given to the work in the Congo, and that mature brothers can be sent in to help in this. We look to Jehovah in prayer that he will direct the matter according to his divine will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark361"></a>KENYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The arrival of two married couples well qualified to serve where the need is great has truly been a blessing to the congregation in Nairobi. The congregation servant writes: “Now we have three pioneers. Even with their help there is still much more interest than we can cope with. There are people of good will just waiting for someone to study with them, and so we look forward to seeing many more respond to the Macedonian call.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An outstanding feature of this year’s activity has been the number of young people coming into the truth, some in spite of family opposition. One young brother had to leave home in order to have freedom to practice true worship. Already he has pioneering as his goal. Another young man who was witnessed to at his work came to a study and enjoyed it so much he kept coming along regularly. After a few weeks he attended the congregation meetings and soon was happily sharing in the field service. One young girl who, because of her former religious associations, could not agree with the trinity doctrine attended a meeting and was so impressed by the happiness of the brothers that she began to study. After completing the chapter on the trinity in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> she saw that the true God is no trinity. The truth having set her free, she is now enjoying the happiness of the New World society, sharing in the activities of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We were glad that three delegates from Kenya were able to attend the Divine Will International Assembly in New York. The brothers in Nairobi were also able to entertain brothers from Rhodesia and South Africa who passed through on their way to and from the assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark165"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark362"></a>TANGANYIKA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Honest-hearted ones are quick to see who really are ministers of God’s Word who turn the people to the Bible and help them to understand it. A Lutheran obtained a copy of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom.” </span><span class="font7">Shortly afterward a warning was given in his church that the congregation should not have anything to do with the “ministers of the Watch Tower” because their teaching was not good. Then the minister asked if there were any questions. This good-will person then asked him if it was bad to follow what the Bible had to say, because “I myself am in contact with these people and have learned many things from them that have made me think about buying a Bible. I have been with you for many years, but up till now it has never given me the desire to buy a Bible.” This man is now going out in the service and being trained also to become a minister of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The release of the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> in Swahili and Kinyakyusa will be a wonderful aid to the work in the coming year, and we confidently look forward to an even better increase in 1959.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">UGANDA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although there was no increase in the number of publishers during the past year, yet a much greater witness was given in the territory than in 1957. The few publishers there worked hard. For instance, during the four months of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign ninety-two subscriptions were obtained, nearly all of them by just two publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the year the brothers in Uganda begged for some literature in Swahili and Luganda, the African languages for the country. How happy they were to hear of the release at the Divine Will assembly of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> in these two languages, and they are already busy sharing in their distribution.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark363"></a><span class="font7">Uganda, with more than five million people, is also a country where the need is great, and the small group now publishing there will be glad to have assistance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark118"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark364"></a>NORWAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The 1958 service year has been a wonderful one for those in Norway and great blessings have come from the hand of Jehovah. A new peak in the number of publishers was reported as part of their happy experiences during the year. They appreciate that all these new ones that are coming into the organization need help and must be treated as though they were their own brothers. Having in mind the scripture at Leviticus 19:34, which says: “The temporary resident who resides for a while with you should become to you like a native of yours, and you must love him as yourself,” from one end of Norway to the other, in the isolated places and where the need is great, new ones are being gathered in and love is shown toward them, as it is toward all within the organization of Jehovah. For these reasons the work prospers. Here are a few experiences from the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To encourage newly interested ones to attend assemblies serves as a real stimulus to them to become active in serving. This was shown by a couple with whom pioneers who had been in their town for a time had studied. They had read in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> of an assembly to be held and they came a long way to attend all four days of the assembly, which they enjoyed very much. When the circuit servant visited their isolated town and talked to them, the man asked if he was going to go in the service and if he could go along. A date was made and the time and place for contact were decided. The newly interested man was there with a brand-new briefcase he had bought for the purpose and filled with literature he had obtained at the assembly. It also contained a new Bible. They were in the service three different times during the week the circuit servant was there. This new publisher wanted to have a regular share in the service and so asked how he was to go about it. The circuit servant was glad to explain to him how he could have a share, how to report his service, and the need to study. “If only someone could move here to help these people and many more like them where the need is great,” were the concluding remarks of the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Several brothers have moved out to work where the need is great. Four new congregations have been organized this year as a result of congregation publishers’ moving out. More will soon be organized where other brothers have moved and where yet others will move. The interest in and response to moving out has really increased during the past months of this year. Surely all who do move to serve where the need is great will receive many blessings at the hand of Jehovah, who rewards his willing servants. One brother who moved with his wife and two children writes: “It is now four months since we left town and we are not sorry we have taken this step. We left my home where I was born, but by putting Jehovah’s interests first and seeking his will sentimental ties become of secondary importance. We now have a congregation of ten publishers and all are growing stronger every day. These joys outweigh all other things.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark365"></a>NYASALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Work in this African country of Nyasaland continues to grow and there are all kinds of obstacles and difficulties to meet, but the brothers stand firm. When a great disaster came upon many of the brothers in a fire at an assembly, the overseers conducted themselves well and today we see the brothers in the congregations still firm, seeking spiritual food as of more value than material things. A great responsibility falls upon overseers to look after the best interests of the congregation, and this is well expressed at Acts 20:28, where it reads: “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased.” The interest of the overseer must always be in the publisher, to give him strength and comfort no matter what the difficulties or how serious they may become. The report of the Branch servant on Nyasaland and Portuguese East Africa follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In November of this service year fire swept one of our district assemblies. Since the brothers lost all their belongings, we were much concerned about their spiritual health and their outlook toward the organization following the fire. Our worries were unfounded. Month after month the brothers progressed and became stronger and more determined to walk faithfully in their integrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This attitude of the brothers and their conduct following the fire were a living testimony to the power of Jehovah’s spirit in remaking the minds of imperfect man. For there were none of the pagan customs connected with the burials, no chanting or witchcraft that is so prevalent among the people outside the New World society. This lack of old-world thinking impressed the police very much, for they had never dealt with such a well-mannered crowd, such an obedient people, or a group that desired to co-operate so fully. Everything was smoothly organized, and they were present more as observers than for their usual duties as law enforcers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All the brothers who lost their belongings in the fire greatly appreciated the help that was made available by both funds donated for relief and used clothing sent from the neighboring African territories. It impressed our brothers to see their European brothers in other countries come to their aid, and many had tears in their eyes as they received their allotted portion of clothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the new Bethel home and Branch office were completed and dedicated in June, the African brothers were very much surprised to see over forty Europeans in attendance. For many years the work in this country has been primarily with the African inhabitants, but in recent months the European congregation has grown from seven to twenty-two and now has over twenty-five in regular attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A circuit servant was threatened with arrest unless he obtained a license to distribute books. When taken to the police station and questioned he defended his position as a minister and said that as such he did not need any permission to do his work. Then he was surprised to find the station officer coming to his rescue. He said: “We are troubling this man unnecessarily, as this is similar to what the churches do. They preach and receive money, but they do not have a license.” The brother then was released with a warning not to sell but he was told that he could </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">distribute</span><span class="font7"> the publications. When the policeman was questioned by other people as to whether Jehovah’s witnesses were selling anything, he would simply answer, ‘No; they are just distributing.’</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark366"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark367"></a>PORTUGUESE EAST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The problems of maintaining integrity amid persecution, oppression, imprisonment and torture would be insurmountable if we could not rely on Jehovah. This is certainly the case in Mozambique, for our brothers are confronted with the constant threat of being forced into slave labor as punishment for their preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The past year has certainly proved that the power of Jehovah is superior to the opposition offered to our ministry. Many brothers in Nyasaland have heeded the call to serve where the need is great and Jehovah has blessed their efforts by granting them added increase during the past year. The office is continually receiving requests for help: “Could you send someone to instruct us?” “Please send someone to teach us.” “Teach us how to go from house to house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is encouraging to hear from one group that had arranged for a baptism service. Ninety-eight were present for the talk; then, afterward, thirteen new brothers were baptized. They followed up their service with a public meeting, and 112 were present for this.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark121"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark368"></a>PAKISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">During the past year Jehovah’s witnesses in Pakistan have had a happy time in the service of the Most High. While there are not very many publishers in the land, still eight were able to go to the international assembly in New York and everyone returned giving wonderful experiences. Those wholly dedicated to Jehovah God fully realize that they must follow the counsel to become ‘imitators of [Paul] and keep your eyes on those who are walking in the way that accords with the example you have in us.’ (Phil. 3:17) So no matter where they are, working in Pakistan or traveling to faraway places, Jehovah’s witnesses must still be imitators of Christ Jesus and preach the good news. During the past year the first witnesses entered Afghanistan, and this country also makes a brief report along with the Pakistan report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Often careful and consistent watering over a long period of time is necessary before a reward is manifest in the production of Kingdom fruitage, as the following well illustrates: The first contact was made as far back as 1951 when a study was started with an interested woman. For a year and a half the study continued, but during this time lack of interest on the part of the husband together with mounting active opposition from her mother and brothers brought this lady to a state of confusion, until she decided it would be best to cancel her study for a time. On account of her attitude of good will the missionaries kept contact until, in 1955, the sudden loss of her eldest daughter caused her once more to seek solace through her studies. Now this person, once a very keen follower of bingo, is a dedicated and zealous publisher. Just recently her husband and son dedicated their lives to Jehovah. The remaining family members are also studying and making good progress in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the difficulties and stresses of modern living, how often we feel that we would like to take a holiday and just do nothing! Such were the thoughts of a group of missionaries who were returning by boat to their homeland for leave from their foreign assignment. One missionary writes on his return: “Day by day we met such interest and good will among the many migrants that we found ourselves busy just filling the days with healthy, joyous theocratic activity. Discussions would take place up until as late as two a.m. Gradually a happy group was gathered together, and we would sit for hours at a time discussing New World truth.” Upon reaching their destination the missionaries were able to hand in many names to the Branch. The one who wrote the letter remarks: “I am convinced that no real servant of Jehovah can resolve to do just nothing, especially as far as the service is concerned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With the call going out in all the world to serve where the need is greater, many, at the cost of much to themselves, are loosening their tent pegs and are trying to fit into their true place in the New World society. Not long ago an English couple decided to sell their home and come to help in Pakistan. It meant that they would have to forego the privilege of attending the assembly in New York, but they felt that it was Jehovah’s will that their talents be employed in other fields. Now, over six months later, both can look back happy in the thought that they have responded to the call. The wife is enjoying rich blessings in the pioneer field, while the husband, a study conductor in one of the congregations, is giving a zealous and enthusiastic lead to the local brothers. These brothers have appreciated the help, response has been fine, and good progress is being made in the congregation as a result of this timely assistance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark369"></a>AFGHANISTAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Quite a few people knew we had gone to New York city to attend the assembly and most were curious about what went on there. We loaned the new </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise</span><span class="font7"> book to one inquirer who said after reading it, “I was against your religion before I read that book. It shows that people should not jump to conclusions before they are informed.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font7"> copy of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> has since been placed with her and a study may soon be started.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After receiving a thorough witness one free thinker said: “Jehovah’s witnesses certainly know the Bible. The thing I like about your religion is that you do something about it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The origin of Christmas and why real Christians do not celebrate Christmas was explained to a Hindu. He was astonished and proceeded to tell professed Christians about it. He found that they were as astonished to learn these things as he was. They, in turn, wondered how he, a Hindu, could teach them their religion.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark122"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark370"></a>PANAMA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Early in the service year work was begun on the new Branch office and missionary home, and all the publishers in the country were anxiously watching the progress and wanting news on it month by month. The structure will be a real asset to the organization. Another thing of outstanding interest in Panama was the number of Bible studies conducted during the year. The special pioneers are averaging 11.6 Bible studies every week, which is very good. They fully appreciate the expression: “You ought to be teachers in view of the time,” and they are teaching. (Heb. 5:12) The pioneers are doing very well also, as are the congregation publishers. Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses is cognizant of the fact that maturity is the big thing needed to do teaching work. It is not just a matter of coming into an organization, but it is a matter of working with all those in it. So Panama moves on, progressing very well, and here are some of the experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the Canal Zone the work continues to go ahead In spite of a transient population. During the year several publishers left for other parts of the world, but others are being found to take their places. House-to-house work is not permitted in some sections and in these parts the value of incidental witnessing is well illustrated. Reports one of the missionaries assigned there:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Many of the local publishers do secular work in these areas and they are always alert to witness as opportunity affords. During our district assembly last January two publishers gave me names of persons they had talked to on the air force base here, and before the month was out I made the calls. One was definitely not interested in the truth, but the other readily subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and showed me the literature that she had brought from the United States but had never read. When I called back the following week, she said she had been reading but did not agree with what the publications said about the death of the soul and about there being no such thing as torment after death. I showed her some of the key texts in the Bible as to the death of the soul and as to hell being the common grave of all mankind. Smilingly she said, ‘You are the only person I have ever talked to about this that has not confused me.’ We studied a few paragraphs in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom’</span><span class="font7"> and I left with an appointment for a fixed hour for the next week. Now we have already studied several chapters.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This report would not be complete without mentioning the outstanding event of the year for Jehovah’s witnesses, the Divine Will International Assembly in New York. Panama had eighty delegates privileged to be present at that great event.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark371"></a>PARAGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Dedication vows are taken seriously by Jehovah’s witnesses in Paraguay. They have full faith that there are many more interested persons in this country and they want to find them, so they press on diligently through Bible study activity. They believe Jehovah’s Word: “And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep mine ordinances, and do them.” (Ezek. 36:27, AS) The small group of publishers are determined to get the work done, and here are some experiences about their activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit assemblies helped greatly to strengthen the brothers during the year. After a most enjoyable assembly in a town where missionaries had been working for only six months, the local Catholic priest, chafing under the continued preaching, set up a loud-speaker opposite the house that served as a missionary home. But if he intended to intimidate the missionaries he was unsuccessful and too late—the couple had moved to another home that very day, so the priest directed his tirade to an empty house!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the visit of the zone servant there has been a greater turnover of Bible studies. This has not resulted in a loss but in better students, culling out the ones that only wanted others to visit them but did not respond readily to the Scriptural rule that they should become teachers in view of the time spent in study. The missionaries especially appreciated this and they have not only increased their studies by about 30 percent but they have better Bible studies, prospective Kingdom proclaimers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the Society’s films were to be shown in a town near the Brazilian border the police acceded to the objections of the priest and denied our permit at the last minute, after much advertising and preparation had been done. A hurried call on the acting police authority on the Brazilian side of the border brought the reply: “Of course you can show the film here. Come on. I’ll help you.” The brothers fairly flew, getting seats arranged and renting sound equipment. As eight o’clock, the scheduled time, approached, one of the missionaries remained at the original site and directed the people to the new theater, which seated 300. The doors had to be closed as the crowd inside grew to more than 400, and another successful showing proceeded. The next night the Paraguayan missionary home patio was utilized and 200 saw the film. Surprisingly enough, the third showing in the same location was witnessed by the very official that had denied us the right to meet in the first place!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark125"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark372"></a>PERU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Many more people of good will have come into the organization and have started to preach the good news alongside those who appreciate that God’s kingdom rules. These new ones appreciate that the servants of God are not peddlers, as Paul well showed when he said: “We are not peddlers of the word of God as many men are, but as out of sincerity, yes, as sent from God, under God’s view, in company with Christ, we are speaking.” (2 Cor. 2:17) Those who within the last year or so have associated themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses realize that God’s servants are wholly devoted to a cause and the right one. Many of them came to the international assembly in New York, and when the final count was taken it was learned that eighty-two delegates came from that country. They were overjoyed with the whole arrangement and have now returned to Peru to express their joy by telling the truth to others along the coast and high in the Andes, wherever there are ears to hear. Here are some of the experiences our brothers are enjoying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer working on the eastern slopes of the Andes, in the part where the jungle begins, returned home one evening and found a man waiting on his doorstep. As it is nothing uncommon to have people standing or sitting on one’s doorstep, he did not think anything of it. However, after he had entered the man knocked on the door and asked if he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses. This man turned out to be the nephew of one of the persons with whom a Bible study is conducted. He had received some information from his uncle and then had walked all day, a distance of fifty-five kilometers, in order to obtain more knowledge and some literature. The same man returned to visit the pioneer about six weeks later, again walking in from the small village where he lives, and again he took back a supply of literature with him. He said that there were several in his village who were very interested and wanted to know more about the truth. Naturally, we want to keep in contact with such people who are willing to put themselves out so much in order to learn of Jehovah’s purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many brothers have answered the call to enter the pioneer field, and many more have tasted the joys of pioneering through the provisions made to be vacation pioneers. To illustrate the devotion of the brothers, this experience was sent in from a small town to the north called Chimbote: “A young brother of thirteen years of age desired to be a vacation pioneer. He is the only one of his family in the truth, and when he told his mother and father of his wish they arranged for him to work long hours in a restaurant, so that he would be kept busy until late at night, and so kept from the service. When his assignment as a vacation pioneer was received, the congregation servant advised him. The boy had been working for the first fifteen days in the restaurant, so decided that he would now leave the restaurant without telling his parents and go pioneering. Of course, his parents found out, and they punished him, also threatening him with all kinds of additional punishment, but when he was sent back to work in the restaurant he ran off again and went pioneering. This happened several times, until his parents got tired of worrying him, and they let him go his way and pioneer during the vacation. He was very happy, and worked hard in the service, spending, on an average, nine hours a day with the other pioneers, and he is thankful that Jehovah removed the obstacle from his path. He is looking forward to another opportunity to enjoy vacation pioneering again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A large number of our publishers are located in isolated places, for they came in contact with and learned the truth among the brothers where there are congregations, and then they moved off to work in isolated places, where the message had not yet been carried. One brother who left Lima to work with a mining company in the south has had very good results in his preaching work. He is working in the territory when he has his day off each week and has placed much literature. Naturally, he talks to the men he works with, and one of these, a member of the Pentecostal religion, opposed him greatly. He slandered Jehovah’s witnesses, trying his best to destroy the good work that the brother was doing. But all the time he was hearing things about the Bible. One day he came to the brother and said: “Look, I find that I have learned more in what I have had to listen to from you during a short time than during all the years that I have been a Pentecostal. I have decided that I want to be a witness, and I would like to know where the nearest congregation is for my wife, so that I can send her to them to learn also.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark373"></a>PHILIPPINES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There is still much work to be done in the Philippine Islands, as there are millions of people that must yet be reached with the message of the truth about the Kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses in these scattered islands fully appreciate that “he that is watching the wind will not sow seed, and he that is looking at the clouds will not reap.” (Eccl. 11:4) It takes conscientious effort on the part of each individual to bring about profitable results, and that is what is accomplishing the ingathering. With good success the brothers in the Philippine Islands have moved ahead during the past year, and here are some of their experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Special pioneers have performed splendid service in going to un assigned territory and developing interest. One who was sent to the island of Palawan reports that a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study was started the first week with seven in attendance. The third week there were eleven in attendance. In a town in Bohol the home of two special pioneers was stoned night after night, but they stuck to their assignment. At the end of their first month in the assignment they were able to report eleven publishers. Eight months later there were twenty-three publishers in the assignment, and the group was waiting to be organized as a congregation on the next visit of the circuit servant. In another town of Bohol the local priest warned his flock to have nothing to do with the witnesses of Jehovah and said that to show any interest in them was a mortal sin. But the local Catholic people could not agree with the priest because they believed that the law of God is to love your fellow man, not just your fellow religionist. Soon group studies were organized, using </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and a bound book as study aids. There are now eleven publishers reporting in this special-pioneer assignment. This has disturbed the priest very much and he is reported to have said that Jehovah’s witnesses are now very many, whereas he is saying mass at the very smallest chapels, with no reward for his hard labor. Thirty-three new congregations have been formed during the year, mostly due to the good work of the special pioneers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One devout Catholic lady vigorously opposed the Bible study her husband was having with Jehovah’s witnesses. She took his books and hid them under the eave of the roof. She went to two different Catholic priests asking for advice to overcome her husband’s change of religion. One advised her to leave her husband, but this shocked her because she knew the Bible taught that “what God has yoked together let no man put apart.” So she went alone in tears and prayed before the high altar of her church that God might show her the true religion. Then she went out and bought a Catholic Bible and started to read it. What she read made her eyes of understanding pop wide open. Her husband’s patience and persistence were rewarded. She joined him in the Bible study with Jehovah’s witnesses. Now this woman and her husband are pioneering together right in their own community of Bohol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The high point of the year was the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Our delegation, totaling eighty-one, was the largest ever to leave this country for an international assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark128"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark374"></a>PORTUGAL</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The Kingdom ministers in Portugal have enjoyed a feast of fat things over the past year. There has been a healthy increase in the number of ministers in this land. They keep in mind, as do all of Jehovah’s witnesses around the earth, the words of the psalmist: “Sing to Jehovah, bless his name. From day to day tell the good news of salvation by him. Say among the nations: ‘Jehovah himself has become king.’ ” (Ps. 96:2, 10) This good news has comforted many, and when individuals have the right heart and hear the right song, then they take the right course. Here are some experiences for Portugal, Azores, Madeira Islands and Cape Verde.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A lay preacher of the Evangelist church some time ago came in contact with some of the Society’s literature. He told his neighbor who showed him this literature that it should be burned, but he himself kept some of it and his wife began reading. She liked what she read and began pointing things out to her husband that raised doubts in his mind. Later he met a family who gave him the address of the local meeting place of the brothers, and after some months he decided to contact them. The result of this contact was that a number of his doubts were cleared up, and the members of the mission were advised that their local minister was studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. The mission was held in this lay preacher’s house, so the local brothers were invited to come and give some talks. The result was that the mission was turned over completely for the use of the brothers, and not only the preacher but some twenty members of the mission are studying with Jehovah’s witnesses. The mission room has been turned into a service center for the congregation, and three people are already publishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One day a sister was in a butcher’s shop, and the butcher, knowing her to be a witness of Jehovah showed her a photograph of an immersion service in the United States that had been published in a local magazine. Another person in the shop showed interest in the photo and inquired if that was the true baptism. On being assured that it was, and having the matter explained to her, she expressed a desire to know more, and a study was started with her and her husband. After about one month they both began to attend meetings, were soon immersed and are now regular publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Two publishers working from house to house one day came to a shop. It is not customary to enter business premises here, but the publishers decided on this occasion to do so, and they began talking to the assistant. This person said she was a Catholic and would never leave her church. The publisher asked if she had confidence in the Bible, and on receiving an affirmative reply he began to show a number of scriptures. The owner of the shop came into the conversation, and the publisher eventually left them both some literature. Returning the following week with Bibles they had both asked for, the publisher showed them further texts, and the ladies were surprised that the Bible did not agree with so many things they were practicing. The following back-call found the owner of the shop with tears in her eyes, impressed with what she had learned and saying that she would never go back to church, and she gave the publisher all her images to destroy. These two ladies quickly associated with us; one has now been immersed, is a regular publisher, and has made application to go into the pioneer service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark375"></a>AZORES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">One young man on one of the islands went to live with his sister-in-law who is a witness of Jehovah. Although the young man was brought up as a Catholic, he was not very much interested in his church and had tried several religions to try to find the truth. When he saw his sister-in-law’s literature he recognized in it something different and quickly appreciated that it contained the truth. Within one month of his first contact with the literature he was attending the meetings and he also came out in door-to-door work with the circuit servant. He has since expressed his desire to be immersed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark376"></a>CAPE VERDE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is with pleasure that we are able to report that during the year some work was done in these islands for the first time. A brother from the United States, a native of the islands, paid a visit there and was able to introduce the message in several of this group of islands. He left a considerable amount of literature and contacted a number of persons who showed much interest. A number of these took subscriptions for the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> magazines, so they are now receiving regular supplies of spiritual food. Contact is being maintained with these people by means of correspondence from Lisbon, and it is hoped that someone from the Society may be able to visit these people during the coming year. A publisher in Lisbon is holding a home Bible study with one of these people by means of letters, a somewhat laborious but nevertheless effective way of helping one of the Lord’s other sheep to get the truth. We hope that shortly we may hear of several of these people becoming publishers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark96"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark377"></a>MADEIRA ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are a goodly number of people of good will on the island, as evidenced by the thirty-two who attended the Memorial. Two brothers symbolized their dedication to Jehovah by being immersed during the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One of the outstanding experiences for the brothers was seeing the films for the first time; eighty people saw the two films, which were taken out from Portugal by the circuit servant. These were very much appreciated by the brothers, giving them even closer contact with the organization than they had previously had. Many were the expressions of appreciation on the part of those who saw the films, particularly the people of good will who were appreciating the organization for the first time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark129"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark378"></a>PUERTO RICO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Excellent progress was enjoyed by the ministers of the good news in Puerto Rico during the year. Outstanding was the fact that 400 of our brothers and persons of good will were able to attend the Divine Will International Assembly from Puerto Rico. They returned rejoicing because they had met so many of their fellow workers from different parts of the earth and they could truly say: “All the ends of the earth will remember and turn back to Jehovah. And all the families of the nations will bow down before you. For the kingship belongs to Jehovah.” (Ps. 22:27, 28) Our brothers in Puerto Rico and the islands that come under the jurisdiction of this Branch know that there are still many more who will be bowing down, recognizing the kingship of Jehovah, and diligently they go out to find them and to teach them and to show them the way that leads to life everlasting. Here are some interesting experiences from this territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A missionary, while in her regular service, came to the home of a person who had already subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> The missionary gave her sermon and the woman listened eagerly and wanted to look up all the texts in her own Bible. She then brought out her magazines, neatly kept in their folders, never having been read. The missionary showed what a wonderful aid they are to Bible study and her interest was more keenly aroused. In a few weeks she was visiting the Kingdom Hall and going out in the service. The day that the missionary arranged to take her along to call back on their first placements the missionary was not able to go. This person of good will waited awhile, and when the missionary did not come, she went by herself, taking with her her personal copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font7"> and she was able to take an order for a book during the short time that she was out. She had so much appreciation for the things that she learned from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> that she wanted to make back-calls on everyone that subscribed so that they would not leave their magazines in the wrappers as she had done, not realizing the valuable information that they contained. The point is to make back-calls on all subscribers, for among them are sheeplike ones such as this woman was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Vacation pioneering added its bit to the great witness that was given during the year. More and more brothers, young and old, as well as those physically handicapped, are taking advantage of this wonderful provision of Jehovah to send his Word forth. One month saw fifteen brothers out in the field service as vacation pioneers, and during the year forty-one different ones spent from two weeks to six months in this branch of the service. One was a seven-year-old boy who simply amazes the people with his Scriptural knowledge and the dexterity with which he handles the Bible. Another was a blind brother who spent two months as a vacation pioneer. He went off to his home town in the interior to publish the good news. His young son led him around to the homes and he did the preaching. He has learned the sermons and has the people look the texts up in the Bible. He was able to place 459 magazines during those two months. He regularly conducts six Bible studies. A number of those who were vacation pioneers are now general pioneers. Thus vacation pioneering can be the first step to a goal: general pioneer, special pioneer, Gilead and a missionary assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This experience started at the bedside of a sick lady and in the presence of three visitors. “I gave my sermon and placed a magazine with the sick lady. The next day while visiting from house to house I came to the home of one of the ladies that was present at the sick lady’s home. She was very happy to see me and said that she had prayed to God to send me to her, as she wanted to understand the Bible. Gladly I presented the back-call sermon, and a study was started in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">‘This Good News of the Kingdom.’</span><span class="font7"> As I could not stay to follow up the study I turned it over to a special pioneer. Four months later at a circuit assembly who should I meet but this same lady and her son. They were overjoyed, and you can imagine how I felt. They were baptized at this same assembly. It all started with a Bible sermon.” This illustrates the fact that good sermons are effective and that it is just another means that Jehovah is using to locate those who are to become his children and who will enjoy an abundance of peace.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark134"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark379"></a>ST. CROIX</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The work had slowly gone down to almost inactivity in one of the two congregations after the missionaries left, and the congregation servant of the other congregation had undergone a very serious operation. Things were in dire straits. Then a young couple, filled with zeal, wanted to go somewhere where they felt that they were more needed. On learning of the situation on the islands they said: ‘Here we are; send us.’ The brother gave up his excellently paying job as second mate on a ship and, with his wife, moved to the island to establish themselves. They say they are the happiest that they have ever been and would never want to go back to the way that they were living before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers had some wonderful experiences that are of interest. One shows the importance of talking to the people on all occasions. A sister has a beauty shop and she is always talking about the Bible to her clients. The head of public education in the island came into the beauty shop and naturally the conversation was tactfully directed to the Bible. This person, who had definitely not been interested before, found herself listening with keen interest and felt her viewpoint on Jehovah’s witnesses changing. It so happened that she was to be in New York at the time of the Divine Will International Assembly, and the sister invited her to attend the public lecture on Sunday. She was so impressed by what she saw that on her return to the island she offered the use of the school auditorium for the circuit assembly and offered to pay the plane fare, round trip to Puerto Rico, for any one of her students, if one of them would attend the Divine Will District Assembly and give a report on it on his return. So many times the incidental preaching accomplishes more with certain persons than the regular preaching.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark380"></a>ST. THOMAS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The outstanding event for the brothers on St. Thomas was the Divine Will International Assembly. It was very far away, it is true, but it had its good effect on the inhabitants of the island. Thirteen members of the congregation attended the convention as representatives. One brother took his wife and three children. For them it was a great undertaking and required long-range planning. The brother tried several jobs on the side, besides his regular job, to augment his small savings. Finally, it was the sale of a property that made it possible to gather together sufficient money to take the whole family. So by much hard work, careful planning, and faith in Jehovah that it was his will that everyone that could should be present, he was able to spend eight wonderful days at the convention. Since the return of all the delegates many persons have had the chance to see with their own eyes the new releases, as well as to hear about the counsel and instruction that were given, including new light on the prophecies. This has served as a good witness to the Word and name of Jehovah as well as stimulating and more firmly cementing the faith of the brothers in the truth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark381"></a>TORTOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">There are several things that happened on the island that make the past service year a marked one for the twelve publishers. For some time the brothers had been working on a spacious Kingdom Hall that had been badly needed. It was finished sufficiently by last March to use it for the first circuit assembly. The assembly served as the inauguration of the hall and gave it good advertisement to the local population. Eighty-four attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pioneer tells of the following experience encountered while in the service: A study was being held with a lady, but it appeared that it was not going to produce results, as there was no evidence of progress. He decided to hold a review over the material covered in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> to see if the person had learned anything at all. He asked some questions of the lady but she could not answer any of them very well. To his surprise when he asked a question, a voice from the other room answered the question correctly. Another question was propounded and again a correct answer. At this moment the unseen person was invited to join the study. She did and has studied regularly ever since. In fact, now she attends all the congregational meetings and shares in the field service, having put as high as twenty hours in the service in one month. Her husband is of good will and they both hope to be baptized soon. It is as Jesus said: “My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.”—John 10:27.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark137"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark382"></a>ST. JOHN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Eight hundred people out of more than two billion are not very many, are they? Cast away on an island that is a mere speck on the map one would think that they would hardly be worth bothering with, but not so with Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The circuit servant’s visits, usually three times a year, are eagerly looked forward to. To the brothers it is something special. The meetings can be carried out more fully those weeks and a public lecture or two can be advertised. Some new ones come to listen and the hopes of the brothers are raised that maybe among them are true sheep that will join them in their studies and in the service. The last time that the circuit servant was with them a good-will person went around inviting the people to the public lecture, and the attendance was surprisingly good for such an isolated place. Thus the brothers can feel the loving care of Jehovah’s organization over them and are able to continue to walk in their integrity.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark148"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark383"></a>SIERRA LEONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s spirit is manifest in every segment of the theocratic organization. No matter where you find Jehovah’s people on the earth they are delighted to preach the good news of the Kingdom, for as the psalmist said: “O taste and see that Jehovah is good.” (Ps. 34:8) Whenever one partakes of the table of Jehovah and appreciates what is provided, the individual wants to praise the Giver of every good and perfect gift. The great responsibility falls upon Jehovah’s witnesses to see that these good things are taken to all nations, kindreds and tongues, and here are some of the experiences of our brothers in Sierra Leone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A special pioneer working isolated territory reports: “My service companion and I were giving a sermon to a group of about twelve people who were outside warming themselves by a fire when we heard a shout of a juju man in the nearby bush. Immediately all the people in sight fled to their houses, locking their doors behind them. We alone were left outside. The man approached with his juju, but seeing no fear in us he quickly left. Sometime later the people began to come out of their homes. We questioned why they ran away. They replied that anyone seeing the juju would die instantly. They were astonished that we had not died. A fine discussion followed showing how Jehovah is allpowerful and able to protect those who believe and trust in him. The entire group was so pleased to know that juju will soon be destroyed that arrangements were made at once for a back-call.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Catholic householder asked a publisher if he could possibly secure a Catholic Bible for him. The publisher returned on the agreed date with the Bible ordered and a back-call sermon from its pages. The householder exclaimed: “I have always wanted a Bible but our priest forbids all Protestant versions. Although I had never seen a Catholic Bible before, I asked a priest to obtain one for me three years ago and he assured me that he would. Whenever I inquired about it he explained that he still was not able to get one as they were very scarce. So when you promised to bring me one I didn’t believe you either.” A study was started the same day in the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Way Is Love.</span><span class="font7"> Attending his first meeting at the Kingdom Hall was another surprise for this truth-starved good-will person, since each person had his own Bible. He observed that there was no Bible shortage among Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SINGAPORE</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark384"></a><span class="font8">Singapore, with its one and a quarter million inhabitants, is literally an island of the sea in southeast Asia where Jehovah’s witnesses are telling forth Jehovah’s praises just as is stated in Isaiah 42:12: “Let them attribute to Jehovah glory, and in the islands let them tell forth even his praise.” So throughout the territory that the Branch office in Singapore looks after, the praises are being told, in the island where North Borneo and Sarawak are located and in the peninsula of Malaya. While the work appears to be making slow progress in these countries, yet gradually people of good will are taking their stand for the truth and are proclaiming it along with the missionaries who have entered these lands to fulfill the command of Christ Jesus to go to all nations. The report from the Branch servant in Singapore gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early in the year the Society sent the missionaries out of Singapore into other territory where the need is greater. This has had a wholesome effect on the organization, since local dedicated publishers have taken on the responsibility of preaching the good news in this island. While shouldering the responsibility of taking the oversight many brothers have advanced to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The need of calling back upon people who receive our literature in the house-to-house work cannot be overemphasized. A young man listened to a publisher’s sermon and consented to take the two-bound-book offer “for his father,” who was already a subscriber for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font7">However, before passing them on he decided to read one of the books just out of curiosity. By the time he finished </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> he became exceedingly conscious of his spiritual need and proceeded on to read through the second book, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.”</span><span class="font7"> He then asked his father: “Where can I get hold of these people, because I would like to study the Bible with them.” The father replied: “You will find Jehovah’s witnesses in Singapore.” Contact with the witnesses was made and a regular study started, but, additionally, in order to deepen his understanding the young fellow began to read through a portion of the Bible every day. After the third study he asked, “How much knowledge does one need to have to be baptized?” Do you let the sheep go in search for you or do you call back on them and feed them as Jesus commanded?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A pioneer met a Japanese businessman who interrupted his sermon. “Oh, you people are Christians,” he said. “You claim that you have the only true religion. But, you know, it was you Christians who dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing and crippling innocent people!” Tactfully he was shown that the so-called Christians who did that were far different from true Christians like Jehovah’s witnesses who follow the example of Christ Jesus and who truly ‘love their neighbor as themselves.’ The publisher was then allowed to finish the sermon, and the man not only gladly accepted the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“New Heavens and a New Earth”</span><span class="font7"> but also expressed his desire to have a copy of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Eleven delegates from the Branch territory were privileged to attend the Divine Will International Assembly in New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark385"></a>MALAYA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">At the beginning of the service year Malaya became an independent nation—the then eighty-second member of the United Nations. The constitution of this Moslem country states: “Islam is the religion of the Federation; but other religions may be practised in peace and harmony.” Jehovah’s witnesses have a message that brings peace and harmony to people of all races and nationalities, and that is the good news that God’s kingdom rules and His righteous new world is now near at hand. This good news they have preached to many people in Malaya during the last year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A new missionary home was opened up in Kuala Lumpur, where much interest has been found. A missionary placed the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> and the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World</span><span class="font7"> with a British serviceman and his wife and when calling back found that they had read the booklet over and over again. After a few studies both admitted that this was the truth, but the wife said, “We could never preach as you do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A few days later a neighbor lady, also an army wife, came over full of excitement over a wonderful booklet she had been handed by someone. It was the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Basis for Belief in a New World.</span><span class="font7"> This started off a three-hour discussion, with the lady who had studied with the missionary answering question after question. At that moment the husband came back from work and he took over for another three hours, covering such subjects as the year 1914, the 7,000-year Sabbath and many other doctrines. He said, “If you want to meet Jehovah’s witnesses you just wait a little while, because tonight they come to study with us.” When the missionary arrived he met the lady, but she had had all her questions answered. So the good-will persons who “could never preach as you do” spent their first six hours preaching—all in one day!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark116"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark386"></a>NORTH BORNEO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The colonial officials in this country have shown great prejudice against Jehovah’s witnesses. A law that forbids taking collections from house to house without first obtaining a police permit has been applied to the work of preaching from house to house as carried on by Jehovah’s witnesses. The circuit servant, while visiting the congregations, was threatened with arrest and prosecution if he persisted in preaching from house to house without a license. So a law that was primarily enacted for the purpose of preventing secret society gangsters from making public collections is now being applied to the charitable and educational work of a Bible society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Twenty Filipino brothers have been faithfully serving where the need is great, although the nature of their work has restricted their witnessing territory to the camps where they are employed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark146"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark387"></a>SARAWAK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While engaging in the magazine work a missionary contacted a Chinese schoolteacher who had graduated from the Shanghai University. He was a Methodist, but after having had his many questions answered from the Bible he agreed to have a home Bible study. After the first study he asked if he could invite his friends to the next study and also offered his house as a meeting place. A few weeks later both he and a fellow teacher stated that they could clearly see the falsity of church teachings such as the trinity and other doctrines. They are making good progress in their study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The grandchildren of a one-time notorious headhunting Dyak chieftain are now studying the Bible with one of the missionaries. The Dyaks are a warmhearted and hospitable people who dislike falsehood and dishonesty. In studying the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Good News of the Kingdom”</span><span class="font7"> they were disgusted to find that the church had been teaching them false doctrines such as hell-fire and immortality of the soul. They were especially indignant to learn that Christendom’s clergy had been trying to hide the name of the True God Jehovah from the people. The entire family is fast learning the truth and it will not be long before they start sharing what they know with others of the Dyak community.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark388"></a>SOUTH AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Throughout the South African Branch’s territory it has been another year of increase that has brought great joy to all the publishers. They appreciated the Divine Will International Assembly and their spirit has been like that of Paul, who wrote to the Romans and said: “Let us pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another.” (Rom. 14:19) Jehovah’s witnesses in South Africa, as in all parts of the world, know that love builds up and they have shown this love by going into all their territory to preach the good news of God’s kingdom. Strangers coming to the assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses are greatly impressed by the wonderful spirit existing among the brothers. The general consensus of opinion among people of good will is that Jehovah’s witnesses alone have been able to produce complete unity in this multiracial country. The pure worship of the one true God has brought about this happy state of affairs in the New World society. The love and unity that exist among them are in striking contrast to the eternal squabbling that goes on among the various factions in the old world. So with Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere they pursue the things making for peace and the things that are upbuilding to one another. Here are the experiences as given us by the Branch servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers in the Union had an opportunity to give a practical demonstration of their love in October when we received an S O S from headquarters advising us of the sad plight of many of the Nyasaland brothers following the disastrous fire at one of their district assemblies. Within a matter of days 3,000 pounds of new and used clothing was dispatched for the relief of the brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In harmony with your instruction we have increased the number of special pioneers, and these brothers have done some good work. Two were assigned eight months ago in an area with boundaries that lie 115 miles to the north, sixty-five miles to the south, forty-three miles to the east and twenty-five miles to the west of their headquarters. There were several families who had previous contact with Jehovah’s witnesses, four of whom reported field service. Now, after the special pioneers have been on the job for eight months, the number of publishers has risen to nineteen. A local church magazine in a recent issue carried a warning article: “Samson—the Philistines are upon us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The African brothers are now meeting with more success in the placement of magazines. For a long time they were inclined to give lengthy sermons. Now many are using the short thirty-second presentation with greatly improved results. One pioneer congregation servant placed thirty-three in two hours and 114 in one month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Dutch Reformed clergyman who attended an assembly of the witnesses was much impressed by their beliefs, conduct and organization. In one of his sermons he extolled the virtues of the witnesses and told his parishioners that they should be doing what the witnesses were doing. He referred to their house-to-house preaching, their attitude toward the world, the love that exists among them, etc. In his conclusion he lifted his hands and, pointing to his audience, exclaimed: “May we all become witnesses of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society’s films are still giving a wonderful witness. They are most effective in breaking down prejudice and opening the homes of the people for the witness work. In one small village the principal of a school lent the school hall and the next morning advised the pupils, who, in turn, were instructed to tell their parents. An elderly man who had read the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font7"> three times thought he would like to do some advertising. He got onto his horse and rode from house to house inviting everybody to the film. He counted thirty-eight homes inhabited. Then he used the telephone and invited all the deacons and elders in the district to come too. The circuit servant and his wife worked the village through. The result? That night 117 packed out the school hall. From the time permission was given to use the hall until it was all over just thirty hours had elapsed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The year was climaxed by 123 delegates from the Union attending the Divine Will International Assembly in New York.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark389"></a>ANGOLA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Without any mature publishers to assist the newly interested ones, the work has been carried forward with difficulty during the past year. However, the little group that was formed at Luanda at the end of last service year has held together and regular meetings have been held throughout the year. A visit from the zone servant encouraged them much and they have now got down to regular activity, and reports are being received each month. The great need is for mature brothers who are Portuguese-speaking nationals to go to that country to help out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers who were held in confinement in the southern part of the country for some years have been released recently and have now gone to live in other parts of the territory. We hope they will continue to serve Jehovah faithfully and help in building up the work wherever they may be.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark390"></a>BASUTOLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The friendliness of the African people is outstanding. When people walk past one another in the street, greetings are always exchanged. The doors of the homes are generally open. When a publisher comes to a door he says, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Khotso,”</span><span class="font7"> meaning “peace,” which reminds us of Jesus’ statement at Luke 10:5, “May this house have peace.” The householder returns the greeting and the publisher is then invited inside and given a seat, even if it requires the householder to sit on the floor. Further greetings are then exchanged about their health before the publisher is free to state the purpose of his visit. As soon as the publisher brings out his Bible the householder will say, “Hold it,” and he goes off to get his own Bible to follow the reading of the scriptures or he will write the scriptures down to read more carefully later on. Any others in the home at the time are invited to come and listen while the publisher goes through his sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More attention is now being given to the training of children and this is proving most effective. For a long time some African parents regarded their children as being too young to understand the truth or to witness concerning the Kingdom. Now young publishers nine and ten years of age are giving effective three- to eightminute sermons. Even if some of them cannot read, the circuit servant and his wife or other mature publishers will help them to get started in the giving of sermons. The young publisher who cannot yet read will give his sermon and when he comes to the scripture he will cite chapter and verse and call upon the publisher who can read to read the scriptures to the householder. Of course, as time goes on, the literacy school will help such children to read and write so as to become fully qualified for the ministry.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark391"></a>BECHUANALAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A district servant was able to interview some of the leading African chiefs. He was informed that although the chiefs were now permitting other missions in addition to the London Missionary Society to enter the territory, it was only on condition that they would build schools and clinics. Although they have read some of the Society’s literature and must know there is nothing seditious in it, they do not wish to give us recognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At one center permission was refused by an African chief for a circuit assembly to be held, but just when it was thought the assembly would have to be canceled, a friendly stationmaster gave permission for a few Bible meetings to be held on railway property (which does not come under the jurisdiction of the chiefs). Several huts and a bell tent were used, the speakers alternating from one hut to the other. With a little adjusting of the program the assembly went smoothly and the brothers were delighted. The students at the ministry school gave their talks in the first hut and were counseled. Then they gave the same talks in the second hut. So the district servant was able to say, “The last time this brother spoke [which was just a few minutes previously] his weaknesses were ...” and he was able to check the progress made on the second attempt. For the baptism there was a river very nearby. People of good will were invited to the public meeting and seventy-three attended, including some who showed really good interest.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark136"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark392"></a>ST. HELENA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The brothers have again enjoyed many interesting experiences. Last year a book was placed with a woman who showed interest. After the husband came home he sent his son to return the book to the publisher. After some time this man came to be employed at the same place where this publisher works. Discussions on the truth took place and now this man and his family are studying in the book he once returned. The son is now sharing in the witness work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The film “The Happiness of the New World Society” was shown eight times, and 1,095 came to see it. All who saw it were astonished to see the multitudes of people at the assemblies in all parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the first Kingdom seeds were sown in 1928 no publisher in St. Helena has ever been able to attend an assembly overseas. Now for the first time two brothers traveled all the way to New York to attend the Divine Will International Assembly. Due to poor transport facilities they were obliged to leave in May and will not be able to return until November. What a grand time they enjoyed at New York and how they long to be back home again to share the good things with the other brothers on the island!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark154"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark393"></a>SOUTH-WEST AFRICA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">A semi-invalid man approached a publisher during street magazine witnessing and asked, “How can I join your organization?” The sister replied that there is no membership but he could attend the public lecture the next day and start his study with the two magazines she placed with him. After enjoying the public meeting and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study he asked for a home Bible study and an opportunity to propound several Bible questions on which no clergyman had given satisfactory answers. Within three weeks this man progressed so well through attending all congregation meetings and three hours of personal study daily that he started sharing regularly in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A month after his first contact with the truth he accepted an invitation to address a sports club along with two clergymen on the controversial topic of whether Sunday sports should be permitted or not. After the clergymen had asserted that the Bible prohibited it, the man of good will gave his discourse proving the law of Moses was not placed as a yoke around the necks of Christians, who are counted righteous due to their faith by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness. One clergyman came to him after the session to ask how he had gained more insight into Scriptural matters than he had in seven years of theological training. Our new brother is awaiting immersion at the next assembly and then pioneer service.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark394"></a>SWAZILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Increasing interest among the white population was one of the main features of the work during the past year. There are only some 2,000 whites in the country, but there are now eleven active witnesses scattered from one end of the land to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Public talks are given from time to time by visiting circuit servants, and at one small village not only were there a number of good-will persons seeking knowledge of Jehovah and his purposes in attendance but also a policeman, a detective, the town clerk and a Dutch Reformed Church minister were doing so for investigational purposes and that under a flag that has so long stood for freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Although still handicapped by lack of literature, the witnesses in Swaziland have forged ahead armed with the Bible and prepared sermons, and there has been a splendid increase during the past year.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark153"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark395"></a>SOUTHERN RHODESIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">The spiritual food that the brothers brought back from the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses to the others in Southern Rhodesia set the whole organization aglow. The fifty-one delegates who were able to attend received much spiritual nourishment and have had the opportunity to spread it not only after their return home but while they were on their journey. They appreciated that the words of Jesus are true: “Where there are two or three met together in my name, there I am in their midst.” (Matt. 18:20) And so as they stayed with their hosts in New York city they took advantage of opportunities to preach the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Three of our delegates were staying with a couple in New York during the Assembly who had volunteered their rooms, but it was not until one evening during the Assembly that any interest was shown in the work of Jehovah’s witnesses. This evening after the sessions the lady of the house admitted that she had had a Bible study in California, but the sister conducting it suddenly stopped calling for no apparent reason. Now, however, her interest blossomed again in a barrage of questions, with the result that she and her daughter were among the 253,922 in attendance at the public talk and they remained for the conclusion of the Assembly. Needless to say, they were impressed. Every day thereafter was filled with questions about the work from both husband and wife. This was followed by visits to the Kingdom Hall and the starting of a home Bible study; then the delegates had to leave to return to Southern Rhodesia. Just one month later a letter was received from the wife with the following expressions:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“You have opened a door for us to a very new and wonderful way of life. We now have Bible studies each Friday night and on Tuesday nights I attend the study center. My husband is showing what he has learned of Jehovah’s words to men he comes in contact with at the garage. We really have a wonderful life to look forward to. We give thanks to Jehovah for bringing you into our lives.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The doing of the divine will goes beyond physical handicaps. At a recent circuit assembly the district servant was checking on the program and he found that a blind African brother was scheduled to give </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font7">talk on the Friday night program. This talk turned out to be the high light of the evening’s session, during which he also took part in a demonstration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother on the following morning’s program sent a message that he would not be able to attend, so the blind brother volunteered to give the half-hour discourse and arranged </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font7"> demonstration, arising early in the morning to properly organize a very effective program. Following this service contact the district servant accompanied the blind brother into the field service from hut to hut and he was thrilled to see how the infirmity presented no handicap whatever to the brother’s effective and sincere preaching of God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark155"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark396"></a>SPAIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">For five years now Spain has had an increase of more than 30 percent in ministers taking up the preaching of the good news of Jehovah’s kingdom. Here we find our brothers walking in their integrity and undergoing many trials in order to continue preaching and teaching the good news of the Kingdom. But with Jehovah’s help and guidance they have been able to endure. Truly these faithful brothers have been saying: “To do your will, O my God, I have delighted. And your law is within my inward parts.” (Ps. 40:8) Those who have been able to arrange their time have gone into the special pioneer work and many are pioneers, but all together are diligent publishers. What follows in the report from the Branch servant shows why there has been such a marvelous increase and how this same thing could be effected in every country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The tremendous increases in Spain are due, in large part, to the chain reaction effect that the truth has on the lives of people here. Since the usual methods of preaching practiced in free nations are somewhat restricted, publishers are always conscious of the need to witness incidentally in order to reach more people. Here is an example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister, while waiting in a doctor’s office, told of the glories of God’s kingdom to another woman waiting with her daughter who was suffering from leukemia. The woman manifested interest and the publisher obtained her address. When the back-call was made the publisher found the family robed in black mourning clothes, for the child had died of that dreadful disease. What a pleasure it was for the publisher to see the sparkle and glisten come back into the eyes of these humble Catholic people when they learned for the first time of the real Bible hope of the resurrection! They were not able to keep this good news to themselves, for at the very first study that was arranged a neighbor, who was a barber, and his wife attended. Later a study was also started with a sister of the householder as well as with other neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the beginning the barber showed some cynicism, for most of his family were either priests or nuns, including one bishop of the Catholic Church. Then one day he met a priest who was an old friend and whom he respected very much. The barber had under his arm the Bible-study aid </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font7"> the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Moderna </span><span class="font7">Bible translation as well as the Roman Catholic translation in Spanish, with which he would always compare texts to see if there had been any changes. The priest said: “Son, what do you have under your arm?’’ The man replied proudly: &quot;Father, this is the Bible!” The priest retorted: “This is a Quixote [a usual must on the Spanish reading list]. Son, I am eighty years old and there are two books that I have never read: one is Quixote and the other is the Bible. And what is more, I never will read them.” Since this occurrence the barber’s progress has been rapid. He was soon witnessing to all his customers. His method is to leave a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> on a chair, and when a customer picks it up to read, a lively discussion follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The original one through whom all this interest was found soon not only joined in the house-to-house ministry but also spoke to those with whom he worked. Soon another study was arranged with one of his working companions. At first this young man showed hesitancy about having the study in his house. It was learned that because of conditions here, he and his wife and six children live in one of Spain’s many thousands of caves. The publishers found the cave to be spotlessly clean. The man’s righteous heart condition was manifested after the first study when he said: “I know that this is the truth. I won’t be able to study next week because four of my children are attending a school conducted by nuns in another city. I am going to go there to take them out of that school and bring them home so that I can teach them the truth!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Upon arriving home the children were at first very hesitant to listen to the preaching of the good news, for the church had so indoctrinated them against reading or even looking at a Bible. Soon these barriers were broken as the love that radiates from God’s Word filled the home. Since then this family has received great amounts of persecution and opposition. One neighbor threatened to kill them for studying with &quot;Protestants,” while another threw open the door of the cave and covered the floor and walls with a bucketful of human excrement, just barely missing one of the young girls, because of their “belief in God.” Instead of frightening them, these threats have only caused this family to draw ever closer to Jehovah and to his clean New World society. All of this happened just because of an incidental witness in a doctor’s office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark397"></a>SURINAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">There are now 332 publishers in Surinam and these are taking good care of the 185,000 population. This population is well scattered back into the wilderness, on plantations, in small towns and in the principal city, but wherever Jehovah’s witnesses are they know that they must “become steadfast, unmovable, always having plenty to do in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in connection with the Lord.” (1 Cor. 15:58) They feel a responsibility and that is why they have had such excellent increases during the past years. Maturity is the thing that they are interested in, too, in addition to bringing the people of good will into the organization, and it is good to see the number of Bible studies that they are conducting with the newly interested ones. Here are a few experiences sent in, taken from the Branch servant’s report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Divine Will International Assembly will have lasting benefits on the work in Surinam. We are overjoyed that twenty-six delegates were able to be present and could enjoy the association with brothers from all over the world. Two of our delegates symbolized their dedication at this grand assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Preaching as special pioneers in isolated territory may require great endurance and patience on the part of these full-time workers. Although special pioneers have been working in one of the coconut plantations since 1954, just during the last year results have been seen. One Catholic man who obtained a copy of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life”</span><span class="font7"> was so aroused by what he read that he wanted to check all the Scripture quotations in a Catholic Bible. After obtaining a copy from the priest he was amazed to find all quotations to be correct, and he realized he had found the truth. That same day he went about searching for Jehovah’s witnesses. Some people directed him to the house of the two special pioneers. What a joy it must have been for these two full-time workers to hear this man ask them: &quot;How can I become one of Jehovah’s witnesses?” Now he knows the answer. The following month he symbolized his dedication to Jehovah by water immersion and he has taken a firm stand for the truth. Now, after five years of hard labor, we have seven publishers reporting and bright prospects for the immediate future. Yes, endurance in the ministry, combined with love and patience, brings results.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark161"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark398"></a>SWEDEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">It has been reported from Sweden that all of those who attended the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 610 persons in number, had their expectations fulfilled. In fact, they received more than they expected. When they returned their enthusiasm ran high and when they met the brothers at home at their two district assemblies during the last weeks of August everyone was overjoyed. Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere appreciate the fact that “if anyone of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep on asking God, for he gives generously to all and without reproaching.” (Jas. 1:5) And how true that is, for all who are seeking the knowledge and wisdom of Jehovah God receive it in greater portion than can be absorbed! But we see the effects of knowledge, for, as the brothers have taken in this knowledge and put it to work, showing that they have wisdom and understanding of their relationship to Jehovah and his organization, they have pressed on whether they be young or old. Here are some interesting experiences as presented by the Branch servant about the work in Sweden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The work has been carried forward in the unassigned territory and the witnessing was enjoyed this year by quite a number of publishers. Among these was a party of five, a family of father and mother and two daughters, thirteen and nine years of age, together with an elderly pioneer sister. They worked a forested territory along the Norwegian border with very scattered population and poor roads, which often made it necessary for them to walk long distances. Some of the people they contacted said that they had had no call by the witnesses for almost ten years. In two weeks’ time they managed to place sixty-six books, 150 booklets, 280 copies of the magazines and obtained nine subscriptions. One day the two girls were calling upon a lady, and when they had given their sermon the lady told them to go and bring the rest of the party, as she wanted to treat all of them to a cup of coffee. When the parents arrived she told them she wanted to get to know just how they had gone about the task of bringing up such nice children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One circuit servant reported good results from a study started by him with a man whose father was in the truth, although the children had never taken any interest. Shortly thereafter the old father died, and now the children were in earnest that he should have a theocratic funeral, in spite of the local priest’s efforts to hinder that. They got in touch with the bishop who ruled that, whereas they could not have access to the church building itself, they could have the chapel in the graveyard and the parish assembly hall for a get-together afterward. The incident aroused much interest and curiosity and one hundred people came to the funeral, which was many more than there had ever been in that rural place. After the ceremony when they were gathered in the parish hall, the oldest son of the deceased brother with whom the circuit servant had started the study arose and expressed his joy that he was now able to understand the religion that his father had been embracing, and then he said: “I had often wondered why they use the name Jehovah, but a couple of months ago one of Jehovah’s witnesses visited me and explained it to my satisfaction. And as I know that there are many present now who are also wondering about it, I would like to have our friend here step forward again and tell us about that also.” And so the visiting funeral speaker could give them another good talk. A couple of weeks later fourteen of these folks attended the local circuit assembly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark399"></a>SWITZERLAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In the beautiful country of Switzerland, where the people are so content, the good news is being preached, and some are being aroused out of their complacency and they are seeing that the preaching of God’s Word is far more important than just settling down to enjoy life and its material things. Many are coming to appreciate that we are in a warfare, and they know “the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things.” (2 Cor. 10:4) With joy Jehovah’s witnesses go on with this work of ingathering and find all kinds of people, but they must be well equipped with the sword of the spirit. The experiences had in Switzerland prove this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Spiritism has increased to a very great extent in this time of the end. As one expressed himself, “It has increased in such a measure in recent years that one would hardly believe it.” It is very hard for persons who have once dabbled in spiritism to get free of it again. And yet it is possible for the truth to free such people from these chains, if they are honest and are searching for the truth. So one day a work mate of a brother came to him and said: “I have an interesting case for you. Would you come with me to someone who is interested in various religious questions? I am very interested to know whether you can give him an answer.” The brother agreed and so they went together one evening to visit a young man who had studied books on yoga, hypnotism and spiritism. A lively discussion ensued. The brother showed him that the Bible unmasked spiritism, and refuted some of his ideas. This stirred the young man up and worried him so much that he could not sleep the whole night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The next day the brother visited him again and laid the hope of a new world before him and invited him to come to his home. A few days later he began a Bible study with him and soon he began to attend the congregation book study. One evening during the book study he stood up and walked to the study conductor, laid several of his spiritistic books on the table and said: “I am convinced that what you are studying here is the truth.” Then followed a tremendous fight with the demons for him, but he held fast to the knowledge that he had gained and the demons let him alone, and he found peace again. Soon he accompanied the brothers into the service, and at the following circuit assembly he was immersed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We still have to cope with legal difficulties, although they are not so numerous as in past years. A number of cases where publishers were stopped by the police and accused of peddling without a license could be settled by giving the proper information to the officials about our preaching work. Two cases, however, were handed over to the courts and both were decided in our favor. The first case came up in the famous canton of Vaud. Two publishers were accused of peddling without a license and in violation of the Federal Law on Traveling Salesmen. The accusation involved the offer of subscriptions and was probably a new effort of the state attorney to hinder our work. When the trial opened, the wife of the local police officer appeared in court as a witness against the publishers. Other witnesses appeared in court and testified in favor of the publishers, and after a well-founded argument the judge dismissed the case, acquitting the publishers and stating in his decision that this activity does not come under the laws ruling commerce. This is another decision that strengthens our position there in the field of magazine distribution and taking subscriptions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark400"></a>LIECHTENSTEIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">It is good to report that some work has been done in this little country that adjoins Switzerland A special pioneer has been able to work in Liechtenstein for a little time. A Bible study has been started and a goodly number of hours have been spent in preaching the good news. We hope by the earnest efforts of this one minister that some people will learn of the truth and take their stand among those who are residents of the country. For many years all the territory around Liechtenstein has had publishers in it, and we hope that someday this little territory will be represented by a servant of the Most High.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark401"></a>TAIWAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Eleven million people make up the population of troubled Taiwan. These people need comfort from God’s Word, and Jehovah’s witnesses are in position to give it to them. All the world knows that the situation that exists in the Far East is not a pleasant one, and the people of Taiwan are constantly kept at high tension. This, of course, is disturbing to the mind. Some who are in official positions are even disturbed because others on the island such as Jehovah’s witnesses are so peaceful. The result is just as Jesus said: “Everyone that kills you will imagine he has rendered a sacred service to God.” (John 16:2) It does not make much difference which God; they still think they are doing him a service. Sometimes it is the god of war, sometimes the god of money, sometimes the god of false religionists, but through it all Jehovah’s witnesses must continue to study the true Word and live according to it. In that way they gain happiness even though it be under trial. Here are some of the experiences of our brothers in Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">To administer the needed comfort is often difficult. The service year began here with our work under government ban. However, the government decided to lift these restrictions, and in November our freedom to meet in Kingdom Halls and to do preaching work was restored. Nonetheless, our brothers have continued to encounter many difficulties. Particularly in backward sections, petty police officers, resenting this freedom and hoping to bring a reimposition of the ban, spy upon our brothers in the hope of finding excuse for turning in adverse reports. As an example, in July these raided the homes of two brothers in the Taitung district, confiscating literature and Bibles, all of which had prior clearance and license for distribution by communications officials. These brothers were charged with wrongdoing for possessing Bibles, which are obtainable in most local bookstores. These charges were finally dropped when it became apparent they were foolish and out of harmony with the very principles advocated by the government itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the Taiwan brothers verbal instruction is usually not sufficient. They need to see the improved preaching methods actually carried out as well. Filling this need inlarge measure, were our semiannual circuit assemblies, the first in the history of our work here. Here the brothers were able to view for the first time carefully worked out demonstrations as well as model service meetings and ministry school sessions that they could copy in their own Kingdom Halls. It was a joy to see the sisters as well as the brothers having a share in carrying out the demonstrations on the platform, something hitherto unheard of among the congregations. In holding such assemblies it was necessary to deliver three handwritten copies of each talk to the police officials. The co-operativeness of the brothers in complying with such regulations has brought increased good will on the part of several police officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Public meetings have had to take on a new role here, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font7">they are the medium through which most of the brothers receive Scriptural instruction. Use of the Japanese language having been banned by the government, and since most of the brothers are unable to speak or understand Chinese, it is necessary for a capable brother to interpret the Chinese </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> lesson into the unwritten Ami dialect for those in attendance to hear and understand. And although meetings are permitted in the Kingdom Halls, those in private homes are forbidden, which, of course, alters the congregation book study arrangement. The brothers are very diligent in supporting the Kingdom Hall meetings. In most of the small villages that have congregations, almost all or at least half of the inhabitants are usually witnesses. Thus it is not uncommon to see half of the villagers inside the Kingdom Hall, while those not Jehovah’s witnesses stand on the outside looking on with interest through open doors and windows.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark402"></a>THAILAND</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">When we think of the words of Jesus, “And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth,” it makes one think of Asia and its many countries like Thailand and Vietnam. How much preaching will be done in these places? Certainly these countries are well inhabited and there are millions of people to speak to. When Jehovah’s witnesses get the opportunity of entering these countries to talk to the people it has always been found that there are sheep there. Recently the Society sent some missionaries to Cambodia, but as yet there is no report. Some very good experiences have been had in Thailand and Vietnam and the Branch servant in Bangkok gives us some very interesting reports on both places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The opening up of new territory in Thailand also continues as special pioneers are being sent into virgin territory and are having wonderful success finding the “other sheep.” Let a special pioneer sister tell us of a recent experience after working but a short time in her new assignment. “Within a few days after we arrived in our territory we began to preach from house to house when I met the headmaster of one of the Chinese schools. He was a Catholic, but, being very interested in the Bible, he kept seeking to understand it better, so he studied with the Seventh-Day Adventists. However, he was still puzzled with the strange teaching of the sabbath. It was on the subject of the sabbath that I started a study right then and there. After this first study was over and before my leaving he obtained some literature and with a broad smile said, ‘Do come again whenever you have time.’ On my second call this man showed such Interest in the study of the Bible that he was not satisfied to wait a whole week before studying again, but asked to have a study twice a week. In order to quench his thirst for the truth, this was arranged. The weeks quickly rolled by and his knowledge rapidly increased. Then one day he said, ‘I believe you have been teaching me the truth and now I want to be baptized as soon as possible. How and where can this be arranged?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another experience shows how a new territory may be opened when a person of good will moves to an isolated territory and continues to show love for the truth. Shortly after moving away this person wrote a letter to a publisher asking for a visit in order to learn more of the Bible. The sister written to turned the letter over to the visiting circuit servant, who, in turn, sent her name to the Branch office. In due time the circuit servant was sent to visit her. The first day was devoted to answering her numerous Bible questions and informing her of the theocratic organization and its activities. On the following day the circuit servant went farther, he pointed out to her how she could put to use the things she had learned by going with him and preaching these things to her neighbors. After a bit of hesitation she agreed and made herself ready to go. Being a nurse in the village, she and the circuit servant were welcomed into every home. The persons called on gave rapt attention to the message by the circuit servant and the added comments of this person of good will. As a result much literature was placed during the three hours of witnessing and it turned out to be a thrilling experience for the new publisher of the Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The climax of all the blessings came when twenty-four of the brothers from Thailand were to be delegates to the Divine Will International Assembly in New York city. For the wonderful privilege of being in attendance we are grateful to Jehovah God and his Son. Grateful, too, are we to the visible organization that Jehovah is using and to our brothers who made it possible for us to be there.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark175"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark403"></a>VIETNAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">The first complete service year for the missionary group in Saigon, the capital of the Republic of Vietnam, was a blessed one indeed. The seed of Kingdom truth began to sprout and take root in this new field as well over a thousand </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> subscriptions were obtained, followed up by more than fifty home Bible studies. Visits of zone and circuit servants came right on time, giving needed help and stimulus, and now, as the year ends, good Kingdom fruitage is in evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister called on a French family whose attitude seemed to say, “Oh, it’s just another religion,” although they subscribed for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font7"> out of curiosity. Sample copies of both magazines were left, with a promise to call on the family again. On further return visits a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> and a French Catholic Bible were placed. By now the man’s interest was thoroughly awakened. He carried the Bible and literature wherever he went. Then on one call his first question was, “Do you have a Kingdom Hall here and regular meetings?” He attended the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> study the next Sunday and has been coming regularly since. A lively study is also being conducted with him personally. This man who had served with the French Foreign Legion had never been religious, though brought up in very religious surroundings. The fullness of his heart was expressed in a long letter he wrote to a close friend, a priest living in France. He concluded: “For once at least I believe in something. I believe in God. I believe in the Devil, from whom the mask of divinity has been torn—this guise under which he has been presented by the usurpers who have monopolized the religion of Christ.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark404"></a>TRINIDAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">David’s words are very simple but they are so filled with meaning, especially in this time of the end. He said: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk. O redeem me and show me favor.” (Ps. 26:11) It is wrong for anyone who has started in the truth to give up in the way that he is walking. He must be correct before Jehovah in spite of all the obstacles. No one should “give up in doing what is right, for in due season we shall reap by not giving out.” (Gal. 6:9) There are numerous problems that face Jehovah’s witnesses in congregations, in circuit work, in isolated territory, and individually each one must stand his ground. There were 110 delegates from the territory under the jurisdiction of Trinidad who were able to come to the assembly, and many of these, along with the other publishers, have had some interesting and hard experiences. Here is what the Branch servant says about Trinidad, Barbados, Bequia, Carriacou, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and Tobago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The value of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font7"> model sermons has been shown time and again A circuit servant writes: “I always use these sermons while training the publishers. A few months ago I was working with a congregation servant. I told him in advance I would be using the sermon ‘Who Is Responsible for World Woes?’ At the first house I got a one-year subscription. Since he had not rehearsed the sermon, I decided to use it at two more homes to get him familiar with it. At each home I obtained subscriptions. This congregation servant was very impressed with the results of the model sermons in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes those of us with full use of all our faculties do not do as much in service as we can. It is, therefore, an inspiration to see the zeal and enthusiasm of those who are handicapped, such as a young Chinese brother who is crippled and confined to his bed or wheelchair. Contacted in the house-to-house work, he asked intelligent questions and a home Bible study was arranged. Then he wrote the Knights of Columbus and Seventh-Day Adventists and a Moslem sect for information with which to compare this new religion. He advanced rapidly in knowledge and his insight was so keen the K. of C. finally told him their beliefs could not be reasoned out but must be accepted in faith. The S.D.A. had their faith in the Law greatly shaken by his questions, and the Moslems had the tables turned on them in much the same manner as Jesus did with his sly questioners. Although physically unable to attend meetings, he still participates by sending written comments on the daily text and answering </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> questions. From the time he began to publish he has turned in weekly reports of six to eight hours and two to four back-calls. Having no control of his fingers, he uses a plastic device with a hole for a pen or pencil, and placing his entire hand in the device, he moves it with his arm to write letters in spreading the good news. When he was brought to his first assembly he could hardly contain his joy, for it was the first time he had left his home for many years. He has since been baptized in his own home in a tub of water specially heated to body temperature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark405"></a>BARBADOS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Indicating the people’s love of the Bible is the high average of .9 studies per congregation publisher. Contacting an Adventist lady, a brother learned she had previously studied with the witnesses but decided to discontinue. Tactfully, from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True,”</span><span class="font7"> two important subjects were pointed out as of particular interest to her: the Sabbath and the Law. After studying them carefully she changed her mind over and began to attend some meetings. This infuriated the husband, who brought in the &quot;pastor,” but the seed had been planted and the truth could not be circumvented. Scripturally the &quot;pastor” was impotent and so accused the brother of deceiving the lady, saying she was devoid of understanding. Having made up her mind, she was immersed shortly after and for this was “read out” of the S.D.A. church. By perseverance and tact one of the Lord’s “other sheep” was rescued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Sometimes we hear the complaint: “Our territory is too small and we are too many.” Calling once a week seemed to be too much and so why order extra issues of the special magazines, they reasoned. What blessings they missed in the April campaign! The circuit servant reports: “With the friendly people of Barbados it would be no difficulty to work the territory once a day.” Where the people are contacted more often there the progress is greatest. One congregation’s entire territory was covered during the circuit servant’s visit. Since its inception six months ago a 60-percent increase of publishers has resulted.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark406"></a>BEQUIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">While progress is shown in the report for this island, there has been a letdown of activity toward the close of the year. Investigation reveals that the good efforts of two pioneer sisters are largely nullified by loose morals of those professing interest in the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is interest on the island if it can be found and nurtured. For example, the special pioneers reported an experience after one of their weekly home Bible studies with a lady who keeps a guest house. Two guests were introduced, one of whom was a subscriber for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font7"> The subscriber engaged the pioneers in a discussion, stating his family were staunch Catholics and that for thirty years he was fooled by such unscriptural doctrines as purgatory, hell-fire, etc. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> came to his rescue in clearing out these man-made teachings. Suddenly the other guest spoke up and wanted something to read and received the issue on “What Does It Take to Make You Happy?” His interest proved to be genuine, for after the departure of the pioneers the good-will owner of the guest house had to remain till late in the night answering his questions and explaining many points.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark407"></a>CARRIACOU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">“O taste and see that Jehovah is good.” (Ps. 34:8) Oftentimes just a sip of service is enough to bring the Lord’s sheep joy and spiritual good health. The help of the circuit servant was enlisted to stir the flagging interest of a mother of several small children. The problem: It was far too difficult to concentrate while studying with three children under the age of five years in the home. The answer: Why not accompany one of the special pioneers on her studies in the neighborhood while someone else cares for the children at home? It worked so well that the mother goes out regularly now, and what is more, she teaches the children at home now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It appears that the sheep are leading the shepherds in Carriacou. A servant discontinued a study with a young lady because “she asked too many questions.” A while later a special pioneer called and decided to invite the person out in the field service with her. To her surprise she discovered the person was already enjoying the privilege of service unaided by anyone, but she did not know about reporting her activity. It seems the shepherds feel there is no interest, whereas the pioneers report, “The marvel of it is that there is so much interest!” As long as overseers manifest a negative attitude they will retard the growth of the organization. Here is an excellent opportunity for some young brother to serve where the need is great.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark408"></a>GRENADA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Three persons, including the former servant, were disfellowshiped in keeping with Paul’s command at Romans 16:17: “Keep your eye on those who create divisions and causes for stumbling . . . and avoid them.” Such cleansing action brought results, as reported by the new congregation servant: “Evidence that Jehovah has not turned away is seen in that many of good will are manifesting themselves and have been waiting on the doorstep, so to speak. While the missionaries were away at the Divine Will International Assembly in New York several started coming to the Kingdom Hall.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Grenville assembly two children, aged eleven and fourteen, were seated among those to be immersed. Not knowing they wanted to be immersed, an attendant attempted to get them to move. To his amazement they convinced him of their intelligent grasp of the truth. On their own they conduct home Bible studies and take part on service meeting programs. During dark nights they walk many miles with flaming torches to light their way to attend meetings to fulfill assignments. Of them it is written: “Whoever receives one of such young children on the basis of my name, receives me; and whoever receives me, receives, not me only, but also him that sent me forth.”—Mark 9:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of the shortage of capable brothers in one congregation one brother is used to conduct several Bible study centers. He has to take his entire family with him, walking five to six miles per week, his wife by his side and their three children seated on a donkey. His example of zeal and determination is reflected by those with whom he studies. One young man offered himself for service, and though his secular employment often keeps him till late in the night, he arrived an hour early for the appointed time of service. Instead of staying two hours as intended, he enjoyed himself so much he stayed the whole morning. For speaking to his boss about the truth he was instantly dismissed and accused of being a Communist. Paradoxically, his boss raged, “Bring me a stone and tell me it’s your God! But this Jehovah! Never! NEVER!”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark139"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark409"></a>ST. LUCIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Holding a service meeting once every three months to stress full-time service has merit. After one such meeting a sister who had always taken a negative attitude about being a pioneer was convinced to try it for two weeks. Upon receipt of her application two weeks “looked too little to give the Creator of the heavens and the earth.” She applied for one month, and when approval was received it filled her with great joy. Placements are not easy in St. Lucia, as most people are very poor. Nevertheless, her enthusiasm yielded unexpected results: 23 books, 25 booklets, 120 hours, 5 subscriptions, 325 magazines, 54 back-calls, 4 home Bible studies and one highly elated publisher. In the face of the fact that this island is 95-percent Roman Catholic we can rejoice with this sister over the wonderful results obtained.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark410"></a>ST. VINCENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">During the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> campaign a special pioneer working a remote, hilly section of the country obtained seventeen subscriptions one month. How did she do it? Using the easy-payment scheme, she would collect 25c every week until each subscription was paid for. This worked a physical hardship on the pioneer as she walked miles and miles up and down each week. However, her blessings compensated for the physical strain, for she surpassed her quota of thirty by the end of the campaign. Others would do as well if the physical effort was put forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Consensual marriage is a problem as it is elsewhere. Many study and reach the point of dedication but hesitate to clean up their lives. As a result they drift back into the cesspool of Satan’s world. Those who do make the effort to clean up are greatly blessed. One couple who have lived together twenty-five years are only waiting for the missionary to receive power to legalize marriages. The district servant reported one man living forty years in common-law marriage without knowing it was wrong. Incidentally, he was the father of twenty-five children. The Society has applied on behalf of one of the missionaries for permission to perform marriages, and it appears it will shortly be approved. Because we do not charge a fee to marry anyone, quite a few persons will clean up their lives and legalize their marriage, including both above mentioned.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark167"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark411"></a>TOBAGO</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">An island of 30,000 inhabitants, once high in superstition, has become magazine-conscious! During the 1958 service year 16,794 magazines were placed by the small band of New World fighters there. Over 12,000 of these were placed by just six full-time servants, and of this number two special pioneers averaged 299 magazines each </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">every month!</span><span class="font7"> That this has softened up the territory is evident from the growth of the New World society: 26 percent over last year’s average!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Not satisfied with the quota of 150 magazines per month set by the Society, one special pioneer set a personal quota of 3,600 magazines for the year, just double the regular quota. The next step was to demonstrate faith and determination by ordering sufficient magazines. Then it was a matter of finding ways and means of effective distribution. During the April campaign one issue was left with a lady who promised to pay later; a second copy was left with the same promise. On the next visit the pioneer was surprised to hear this woman call from her house and he went to see her. “Three weeks ago I put this away for you,” she said, untying a knot in the corner of a cloth. It took her five minutes to untie it, but thirty minutes went by talking about the Kingdom. A back-call was arranged that developed into a study and still continues. By the way, this pioneer ended the year with 3,618 magazines placed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark412"></a>TURKEY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In spite of difficulties and legal trials, the zeal of the brothers for the preaching of the good news has gone on undiminished. Jehovah’s witnesses in Turkey are able to see the wonderful results that Jehovah gave them in their fight for pure worship. While the enemies of the truth tried to accuse Jehovah’s witnesses of being a sect and causing disturbance in the country, the trial failed to impede the activity of the theocratic ministers and good publicity was given to the decision on the first trial. The court declared with impartiality that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect, but rather a Christian faith separate from other Christian religions, and that the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses do not interfere with freedom of conscience. All the brothers brought to trial were acquitted. So they rejoice and are grateful to Jehovah for his undeserved kindness and give thanks for his leading them ‘in a triumphal procession in company with Christ Jesus, making the odor of the knowledge of him perceptible through us in every place.’ Here are a few experiences from our brothers in Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Tactful back-calls lead to fruitful Bible studies and produce new publishers, as shown by the following experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A brother calling back on a person of good will found some more people there who asked him many questions, mostly on doctrinal subjects. The brother succeeded tactfully to overcome their objections and a Bible study was arranged for the following week. Little by little, due to the help he patiently offered to them, their prejudice gave in and three of them progressed very well. During their study one evening a visitor came who had many questions. At the end of their study the brother learned, to his great surprise, that these goodwill persons were conducting a study with this visitor, the same way the brother was doing with them. The month of August all the three symbolized their dedication to Jehovah. They are attending meetings regularly and are striving to reach maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Preaching to our friends should never be overlooked or neglected. This is very well stressed by the following story related by one of our special pioneers:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Three years ago I met one of my old classmates and I had the opportunity to speak to him about the end of this wicked world and the New World to follow, where people will live in happiness forever. Although not very religious, yet he was adhering to the Moslem ideas, so he did not show much interest for my message. But I noticed that as I kept witnessing to him every time we were together his interest was increasing. A few months later and after he was finally established in the truth, he went to his home town. Through regular correspondence I kept helping him to progress in the truth. The last time I got a letter from him he wrote that ever since he returned home he started preaching to his father and his older brother and that he himself and his father are eagerly expecting the visit of someone of us, so that they can symbolize their dedication to Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While we were discussing Jehovah’s purposes in a study I hold regularly with some persons of good will, a friend of theirs came in. He was a stranger to me. After listening to our discussion for a while he remarked: “Eight years ago I heard the same things you are discussing now from two persons who visited the mill I was working in, in another town.” Upon hearing that I was really amazed, because I remembered very well the instance when another brother and myself had the opportunity to witness to some people working in a mill, in that same place. Without saying anything else, I asked the stranger to look closely at my face. After he did that for a few moments he exclaimed with great joy: “Why, you are one of the two persons I met there!” Further discussion followed and a new study was started with this lost sheep, originally met eight years ago.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark173"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark413"></a>URUGUAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses have been making great strides in preaching the good news in Uruguay. The reason is that they stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on as men and grow mighty. (1 Cor. 16:13) They want to have their ministerial garments on when Christ Jesus makes his inspection at the time Armageddon breaks out and the only way to be sure of that is to be busy constantly at their assigned duties. There are now 1,124 publishers of the Kingdom in Uruguay, and it is a joy to see the constant ingathering. Staying awake means progress. The Branch servant gives us some very interesting reports on Uruguay and also the Falkland Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What would you do about a person who bitterly shrieked at you: “There isn’t any God, and if there were then he is the cause of all the trouble,” then would not permit you to explain the truth to her? The angry woman who shouted these insults to a pioneer displayed a certain note of sincerity in her misdirected convictions and it caused the sister much concern. On quitting work the same day she purposely passed by the home of this lady to tell her that she realized how she must feel and that it made her very sad that she had blamed God for all the trouble, since God is love and is kind, not cruel. Now she was able to explain why God permitted wickedness to continue. The lady expressed sorrow for her actions and was much impressed by the scriptures in the sermon. She had never had or read a Bible, so she asked the pioneer to bring one. She did, and a study was started. In a few weeks she attended the circuit assembly and was so impressed that she began to attend regular weekly meetings with a neighbor who had overheard the previous conversation. A month later, during the circuit servant’s visit, she started in service. After hearing counsel after a book study to bring others to meetings too, she brought four more with her to the next meeting. So, if we detect a note of sincerity in the convictions of opposers, even these are worthy of some special attention when they change to a different mood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As a group captain do you check to see that all subscribers in your territory are called back on and that an effort is made to start studies with them? One missionary arrived at his new assignment and found that some </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> subscribers did not have a study and no one had called on them except to renew the subscription. A friendly visit on several of these brought good results. One subscriber even referred him to another interested person, of whom the missionary writes: “I talked to her about our work and found that she had never had a personal study. We started one immediately and in a month, when invited to accompany me in service, she responded immediately. The following month, in the special magazine campaign, she reported fourteen hours and placed fourteen magazines, and has been a regular publisher ever since.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Invalids need the truth, too, so we should always render sympathetic help to these less fortunate ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A sister met an interested couple through a subscriber. The husband, a paralytic for four years, quickly learned the doctrines in spite of severe opposition from their Catholic relatives, one of whom is a priest. His rigid body and silent lips only permitted him to answer questions in the study by a nod of the head, and his keen appreciation for explanations of new truths was manifest by happy facial expressions. Wanting others to benefit by and share his enthusiasm, the sister invited a nearby unprogressive study to accompany her. She writes: “So I invited the girl to accompany me. The sincerity and keen interest of this new couple impressed her so deeply that she asked to accompany me from house to house. Since then she has attended meetings regularly and has been a steady companion in the service.” Even the silent testimony of this enthused paralytic and his wife plays an important part in advancing the divine will.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark414"></a>FALKLAND ISLANDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">Meetings are held more regularly now and a little progress is being made. However, people are fearful of the religious “blackbirds” who continually search the field to devour any seeds of interest that might be planted in the hearts and minds of sincere truth-seekers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">How happy we were to have with us at the Divine Will International Assembly three delegates from the Falkland Islands! The assembly has done marvels in helping them understand and appreciate Jehovah’s organization. “Isn’t there someone who can come and help us?” pleaded one of these good-will persons who briefly told of the work in the islands on the New York convention program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the past year a missionary again spent some time with these new ones. These periodic yearly visits are like refreshing showers on a parched land. Normally, there appears to be practically no interest. During the missionary’s visit the waters of truth seem to nourish the dormant interest and make it sprout. Without continual watering, however, continued growth to maturity is very difficult in this rocky soil of religious fear.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark174"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark415"></a>VENEZUELA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">In all parts of the world there is plenty of work to be done in the ministry. Venezuela is one of these parts. So the brothers and sisters there accept Paul’s advice the same as those in Jehovah’s organization do everywhere, namely: “Keep watching the ministry which you accepted in the Lord, that you fulfill it.” (Col. 4:17) Excellent work has been done in this country and there has been an increase of 12 percent realized. Though there have been political revolutions and curfews, the publishers of the Kingdom have pressed on declaring the good news. They keep watching. They are not going to be without their ministerial garments. They have accepted the responsibility and they will stay on guard preaching. It is a delight to see so many people of good will coming into the organization in Venezuela, and the Branch servant gives us some interesting experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A missionary tells of a couple that advanced very rapidly in the truth. While participating in the magazine work she placed a copy with a lady at the door. Later she called back and a study was started. Very shortly a circuit assembly was held in the same city and the place chosen happened to be just across the street from the couple of good will. Being curious as to what was going on, they went over and found that the witnesses were getting ready for an assembly. They offered potted plants and a screen to help beautify the platform. They attended all sessions and from then on never missed a meeting, soon taking part in the service. When they heard of the New York assembly they began to make plans to attend, which they did, and were two of the 7,136 baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are all kinds of opportunities to extend the Kingdom message, as shown by this experience that began about seven years ago when a study was held with a Spanish woman here in Caracas. She made a trip to her home in Bilbao, Spain, and took a supply of literature with her. On returning she said one cousin had shown particular interest and before long he wrote saying that what he had read in the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> was the truth and he wished to dedicate his life to the preaching work. The missionaries sent the information to the Brooklyn office and heard nothing more for five years, as the woman left the country. Imagine the surprise when just before the 1958 international assembly in New York a letter came from the young Spanish woman saying that her cousin would be in New York and wished to contact the missionaries! He did, and it was a great joy to learn that he is a special pioneer and a congregation servant. The lady with whom the study was originally started in Venezuela has only recently been baptized in Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A circuit servant tells about an elderly man with poor eyesight who accepted the truth and began to witness in the mountains. He would go to all the homes and settlements on foot, and several times he got lost trying to And his way on the lonely trails. Most of his preaching was oral because very few could read, yet lots of interest was found. When the circuit servant came to the congregation it was arranged for him to visit the group. Another brother took him as far as he could go in his truck; then they went on foot along the river and up into the mountains for about three hours before they reached the place of meeting. When they arrived they found about thirty persons gathered, including the elderly man who had contacted them first. The people of good will had built a little hut with benches especially for the meetings. After the talk the circuit servant remained to conduct a Bible study with them for about two hours by kerosene lamp and encouraged them to meet regularly for study. Only two or three know how to read, so they will be anxious to get the new booklet in Spanish </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Learn to Read and Write.</span><span class="font7"> The elderly brother who was so zealous in taking the message to this isolated spot has now been baptized and is conducting regular meetings with this group of thirty. So the work goes ahead and is spreading to the far comers of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The district servant reports an unusual experience using the Society’s film. “At a circuit assembly I asked a pioneer sister to locate a place to show the movie in an oil-camp town, La Paz, where there is no congregation. On arriving I soon learned that the only place she had found was the grounds of the National Guard quarters. I had my doubts, as we have never used government property before for any of our meetings or assemblies here in Venezuela. I went to see the place and to talk with the officer in charge. He was not there, but some of the soldiers assured me that it would be all right. So the pioneer sister, my wife and I went ahead to visit and invite the people. Shortly before the hour arranged I went to set up the equipment and soon learned that the soldiers were very co-operative. They carried out chairs, helped connect the cable for the projector, and even acted as ushers, meeting the people at the gate and showing them where to sit. All this on their own initiative! It was a strange sight to see the people of good will being ushered in by soldiers with rifles strapped to their backs. Everything worked out very well, and about 125 persons attended. When we departed the officer said we were welcome to come back any time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark176"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark416"></a>YUGOSLAVIA</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">With real gratitude Jehovah’s people in Yugoslavia can look back over the past year and express joy because of the blessings upon the work. There has been a great ingathering of the other sheep in this country. The almighty power of the Supreme Sovereign has been manifest. During the year many good-will people have joined Jehovah’s witnesses in the ministry. Along with Jehovah’s witnesses around the world they have had the 1958 yeartext in mind: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.” And we can depend on it that in 1959 they will have in mind: “Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments.” They will continue to meet with opposition from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Here are some of their experiences from the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Church has launched a general campaign against us, especially in the Republic of Slovenia, and in every sermon from the pulpit the Catholics are warned against this “pest Jehovci.” The priests say that while the Catholic intelligentsia have proved to be immune to this teaching, “our best men and women become the victims of this dreadful disease. Added to this the witnesses are enemies of the state and their leading men were sentenced to death. Can’t you see in what danger you are running if you do as much as listen to the Jehovah’s? Flee this pest!” Such appeals can be heard in every Catholic sermon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As work from house to house is not permitted here, the publishers seize every other opportunity to witness. In one of our more important cities we have an elderly brother, an invalid, who worked as a shoe shiner at the station. He, too, used every opportunity to witness to his customers about the Kingdom. It happened once that he gradually drew a crowd of about ten persons around him, all listening to his message. But someone fetched a policeman and the brother had to appear in court. The charge was that he had organized a meeting. The law defines any group of more than three persons as a “meeting.” The judge ruled that he was to be deprived of his license. So the place where he had worked was empty. However, he could still be seen near there witnessing to people, but he was careful never to have more than two listeners at a time. In this way he did not violate the law. In spite of this his persistence brought him once more into the courtroom. After a long hearing he was promised that his license would be returned, for, said the judge: “One can do nothing with you Jehovci.” So the brother will once more occupy his former place with his familiar bootblack’s box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are still congregations without a Kingdom Hall, which is the main cause for their stagnation. In the cities where we have our own halls they are so full that on the occasion of public discourses many have to stand outside the door and windows. Thus in a city where we have a Kingdom Hall seating 250 persons, the public discourse on Sunday has to be given four times and every time the hall is crammed. Wherever we can, we give public lectures. In our own halls these are not forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is our daily prayer that Jehovah may continue to grant us his protection and his undeserved kindness, so that before the end of this old world we may help all the people of good will who desire to live happily in God’s new world. His love and goodness are assured us, and we do not want to slack our hands.—Zeph. 3:15.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark417"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark418"></a>ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE NECESSARY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">When one observes the tremendous growth of the New World society he cannot help but feel the responsibility that falls upon Jehovah’s witnesses. During the past few years there have been hundreds of thousands of newly interested persons leaving their old way of life and making their association with Jehovah’s witnesses. It is of interest to note that this increase is due to grown-up people having a mind of their own taking their stand for truth and righteousness. It is not like the increase in the religious organizations of Christendom, where the main growth comes through children being baptized and becoming members of the church. One often reads of great increases in the Catholic Church, the Lutheran Church, the Baptist Church and other religious organizations, but a great portion of this growth is because of the birth rate within these religious organizations. In some countries all the newly-born babies are enrolled in the State Church. They are so-called Christians from birth, but without knowledge. Those individuals that increase the numbers associated with Jehovah’s witnesses have done their own thinking and have made their own decisions. They appreciate</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Paul’s statement to Timothy: &quot;This is right and acceptable in the sight of our Savior, God, whose will is that all kinds of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) These individuals must accept the Savior and they must come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. This is something that babies cannot do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In just the past year of 1958 there were 81,425 more persons who associated themselves with Jehovah’s witnesses and preached the things that they had heard and learned. They were so enthusiastic about the new way of life set forth to them in God’s Word that they wanted to tell others. But with this great influx of persons coming into the New World society it places a responsibility upon all other members to see that these new ones get an accurate knowledge of the truth. These new ones appreciate the Kingdom, love it, and they see the possibility of everlasting life as a prize to be gained through Christ Jesus, their Lord. They have come to appreciate that Jehovah God, their Life-giver, should be given exclusive devotion and that one cannot serve two masters, God and the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All these beginners need help as far as further knowledge Is concerned. If all these new publishers of the Kingdom are going to stay in Jehovah’s theocratic organization, continually praising his name, they must be assisted. Paul wanted to give that assistance and did, and that is why he stated: “Become Imitators of me, even as I am of Christ.” (1 Cor. 11:1) It is a challenge to all who have been Jehovah’s witnesses for years, and a responsibility placed upon them, to see to it that all the 798,326 who are now associated with the organization grow to maturity and become strong, hardy Christians. All who are in the organization should feel just as Peter felt when he said: “Certainly if, after having escaped from the defilements of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, the final conditions have become worse for them than the first. For it would have been better for them not to have accurately known the path of righteousness than after knowing it accurately to turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them. The saying of the true proverb has happened to them: ‘The dog has turned back to its own vomit, and the sow that was bathed to rolling in the mire.’&quot;—2 Pet. 2:20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Peter helped early Christians by talking to them plainly about God’s Word and showing them what course had to be taken. Christians of today must do exactly the same. Read all of Second Peter, chapter three. Peter expressed the same idea that is stated in the year’s text for 1959, which emphasizes the need for staying on the watch, as otherwise one will be stripped naked because he has fallen asleep. Peter emphasized this point when he said: &quot;Since you are awaiting these things, do your utmost to be found finally by him spotless and unblemished and in peace. ... be on your guard that you may not be led away with them by the error of the law-defying people and fall from your own steadfastness.” (2 Pet. 3:14, 17) How necessary, then, it must be for each one to be on guard and awake prior to the battle of Armageddon! This is just as necessary for all the new ones as it is for the older ones in the truth. Each must keep his outer garments of the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If one does not keep his ministerial garments on, it shows that he has returned to the defilements of the old world from which he was saved. Certainly no one who has an accurate knowledge of the truth wants to see himself, or anyone else, slip back into that condition. As Jehovah’s witnesses draw ever closer to the final battle and the time for the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name, it makes our hearts rejoice because of the great crowd of other sheep that are coming into the organization. But with the coming of that great crowd it means greater work, harder work, on the part of those who are already Jehovah’s witnesses. These new ones must be provided with good spiritual food. They must have accurate knowledge. Therefore everyone who is dedicated to Jehovah God should feel the responsibility that falls upon the whole organization of Jehovah’s witnesses to help one another, and especially these 81,425 that have just come into the organization during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This heavy responsibility is not a new one. This great crowd has been making itself manifest year by year, as the following chart shows.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">During the last decade there has been a constant ingathering of the other sheep and this ingathering has increased year by year, from 40,000 a year up to over 60,000 a year. The growth has been rapid when we look at the average yearly increase of publishers. Now in this last year of 1958 the difference between the average number of publishers and the peak number is over 81,000. This throws an even greater responsibility upon Jehovah’s organization. Knowing of the great work that it is necessary to accomplish, we want all of these to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth and to be regular publishers during the 1959 service year. Are you, the more mature Kingdom publisher, going to give these new ones the necessary help? You must if you are going to save yourself and others also. These new ones may not neglect Bible study. These newly active persons are close neighbors of ours now, and we must love our neighbors as ourselves and help them to get a full appreciation of Jehovah’s principles and how one walks in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. Surely when they make their dedication and are baptized they must come to Jehovah clean and they must remain that way thereafter in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In looking at the report you will observe that there were 63,815 more regular publishers in the field this year as compared with last year and that those who were actually baptized in water this year totaled 62,666 persons. Here we find a difference of only 1,149, if we assume that those who became regular publishers were the ones baptized. And that means that in our peak number of publishers there are still well over 82,000 persons throughout the world that need to come to a full appreciation of God’s Word and be baptized. But before they are baptized they should know the Word of God and the course of action that it is proper for them to take. They should appreciate the high standard that God requires for Christians. This information is available for all, but it is the responsibility of the mature Christian to see that they get the information and read about it before they are baptized, not necessarily after, because that often is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah wants a clean, peaceable, wholesome organization, people who are wholly devoted to him and who know their responsibilities as ministers. Persons who are indifferent, or who practice drunkenness, overeating, and who are filled with the anxieties of this world might think that baptism makes them members of Jehovah’s witnesses. But if he should go through this process of outwardly expressing to all of Jehovah’s people that he is now dedicated to Jehovah God, he may because of his way of living bring great reproach upon Jehovah’s name and upon his organization. If he has not really escaped from the defilements of the world by accurate knowledge, then he is still asleep as Christendom is. When one takes on the responsibilities of a Christian he must stay awake. Only persons who are awake, clean and alive to their responsibilities are acceptable for baptism as Jehovah’s witnesses. Otherwise their dedication is not true to Jehovah God. It is hypocrisy, and so could not be accepted by the God of holiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The responsibility rests upon all other dedicated persons possessing an accurate knowledge of the truth to help these who have not gotten rid of all the defilements of the world, but who want to be with the New World society, to clean up and to get accurate knowledge. Let them appreciate fully what Jehovah’s requirements are. Let them count the cost. This much-needed help for the new ones can be given by calling upon them and visiting with them in their homes, talking to them about God’s Word and the high standards by which Jehovah’s witnesses live. One need not accuse these new ones of anything, but they should be told what will be required and what must be done by real Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Home Bible studies can be conducted in a number of publications, not just the latest ones like </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Your Will Be Done on Earth,”</span><span class="font7"> which is important, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.</span><span class="font7"> These new ones should know what the contents of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Let God Be True”</span><span class="font7"> are as well as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“This Means Everlasting Life.”</span><span class="font7"> Knowledge is essential to living, so let them get a broad knowledge and know what is required of them by Jehovah. It is observed that as these individuals grow in the truth and prove themselves to be men strong in faith, showing real love and engaging in this ingathering of the other sheep under the direction of Christ Jesus, they, in turn, become good teachers and they will want to spend all their time in this teaching work. They will eventually seek first the Kingdom and God’s righteousness.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark419"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark420"></a>THE FULL-TIME MINISTRY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">Having established these newly interested people well in the truth, having shown them the responsibilities of dedication to Jehovah God and the privileges that follow, in a little while they will want to go on to greater service; and so it has been true that many have entered the pioneer service, special pioneer work, missionary fields, and a goodly number have gone to Bethel homes and into the circuit and district work. Full-time service brings much joy to the individual. As we look at the chart, we see that only 23,772 brothers and sisters have gone into the full-time pioneer service. This is just 3 percent of all the publishers. Have you ever asked yourself the question, Can I be a pioneer? It is a wonderful field to enter. While the ministers in the congregation are doing a marvelous work and are gathering in the other sheep in the larger communities, there is still plenty of room for ministers who can devote all their time somewhere within Jehovah’s organization. Just how many of the 693,316 regular congregation publishers have prayerfully thought about getting into the fulltime service? Have you ever considered vacation pioneer work? That is a good way to start and affords one the opportunity to taste how good it is to be in the full-time service. It may lead you on into the pioneer work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">During the past year there were 18,857 ministers, on the average, in the general pioneer service. This is better than the year before, but still there is a tremendous field for pioneer service and we should observe, too, that there has been a great increase in the number of congregation publishers. It may be that thousands of these could engage in the pioneer service if they gave thought to the right planning. Pioneer service could be a steppingstone to special pioneer work and then this could lead on into Bethel service, missionary work, circuit work and district work. Capable men and women, wholly devoted to Jehovah God, are certainly needed in all these fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Society is pleased that the congregation publishers have made such generous contributions to the Society to help those who have been appointed to special pioneer work and to missionary activity. During the year it was possible for the Society to help these fulltime publishers to the extent of $1,662,428.01. Just as long as these contributions continue to come in from all parts of the world the Society will want to put on more special pioneers and more missionaries to reach out into new fields. By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness the Society has been able to increase the number of special pioneers in the world from 3,859 last year to an average of 4,915 during 1958. But there are more special pioneers needed in all parts of the world. In some countries we have sufficient to take care of the work, but in other places special pioneers are still needed. The missionaries, too, have done wonderful work in opening up new fields, and of the 2,176 graduates of Gilead who are still in the full-time service 815 are in the missionary field. Many of the other graduates of Gilead arc in the circuit work, district work and in Bethel homes. So full-time service is a grand privilege. Seek it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Remember, too, there is Bethel service. Any young, healthy, dedicated man who really wants to work fulltime in a Bethel home and who wants to make it his life’s work should write to his Branch office and request an application. What a joy to be in a Branch office and to be serving the brothers throughout the whole world with the things that they need so much in order to preach the good news of the Kingdom!</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark421"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark422"></a>CAN YOU WORK WHERE THE NEED IS GREAT?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">“The field is the world,” Jesus told his disciples, and he further instructed them that they go to all the nations and make disciples. What was his reason for giving this instruction? It was so that this good news of the Kingdom could be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations. Christians have taken these words seriously. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses left their own countries and have gone into new fields. The Society encouraged this work on a large scale in 1943 when it opened the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead. Since then thousands of persons have been sent into foreign fields for missionary activity. But this kind of work is not confined just to persons who are trained at Gilead School. Going “to all nations” and making disciples can be done by any dedicated person, a housewife, a husband, young or old, and so it is of great interest to all of Jehovah’s witnesses to know that many families wanting to work where the need is great have moved away from their homeland and have gone to other nations. This is something that everyone within Jehovah’s New World society can give prayerful thought to. Maybe your greatest blessing is going to be somewhere else in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A report comes from Australia that in the past twelve months fifty-one persons have gone out to many small islands of the Pacific. Twenty-eight of Jehovah’s witnesses have gone abroad from Britain. Two have left Canada. Five have gone out from New Zealand. Ten have left France and a goodly number have moved out from the United States, going to South America and Asia. Other persons have left Germany, Liberia, South Africa, and Finland for the purpose of preaching in other nations. These brothers have packed their belongings and have moved out into a territory where the need is great. That takes love and faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> shows where the work is being done and in some countries there are not nearly enough publishers to cover the territory. For the benefit of our brothers world-wide who are readers of the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook </span><span class="font7">we list below over one hundred places, countries, islands and territories throughout the world where some persons can go to open up the work or to expand the work that has already been started in these countries. Look the list over and think about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">When one reads the Acts of the Apostles and sees how they moved around into new territories, like Macedonia, Greece, Italy, along the coast of Africa, east into Babylon and to other parts of the world, it shows us that those of the early church were anxious to carry out Jesus’ words: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.” (Matt. 28:19) It makes us wonder how many of the first Christian families packed their belongings and migrated to another section of the world just to preach the good news.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is wonderful to see how today the Scriptures are being fulfilled by more migration on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses around the earth. It is their love for Jehovah God, their giving him exclusive devotion, their interest in the truth, their desire to preach the good news, that makes God’s people move on to new fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is the matter of one’s own country too. If the need is great in your own country, stay there. You do not need a passport, you do not usually need permission to travel, but all you need to do is find out from the Branch office what part of the country needs more ministers and then make arrangements to go there and take up your own occupation and continue preaching. Remember, Paul used to make tents and others assisted him, but they kept preaching and moved from place to place. Paul was a traveler, and he spread the truth in those early days of Christianity to so many places. How long Jehovah is going to have us preach this good news, how patient he will be toward the Devil’s organization before he brings destruction upon it, we do not know. But until that time comes we want to watch and be alert to all privileges that might come our way. Often congregation publishers can do more in getting into countries and preaching the good news than persons who are at it full time. But wherever one is, preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In a recent letter from Poland the brother in charge of the work said: “After those in prominent positions were released from prison and again had freedom they informed the brothers that now while the pressure has been relaxed and the work can go on, why not everyone get at it as though Armageddon was going to come tomorrow?” And the brothers took that attitude. Of all the countries in the world Poland is one of the few that has had over a 30-percent increase in publishers. They feel the responsibility that is theirs, and even though they do not have all the publications that other brothers have throughout the world, our brothers in Poland are excited and anxious and alert, on the watch, keeping their ministerial garments on, and are preaching with tremendous success. They meet together and study together so as to help the new ones. All we need to do is look at the report for the countries behind the Iron Curtain and see what a marvelous increase has been made by them. This is being done by congregation publishers too. It is hard to be a pioneer because everyone must work at something. But there are many of our brothers behind the Iron Curtain who become vacation pioneers. Together as a congregation they have searched and hunted for the other sheep and are bringing them into the organization until whole villages are Jehovah’s witnesses. This is a marvelous spirit and it is the spirit energizing the whole organization throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There is nothing better to talk about than the truth. Everyone should feel the urgency of being on the watch and be looking for the other sheep before the final end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let all of Jehovah’s witnesses grow to maturity, individually looking at themselves, ‘because of what benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul’? He will help others too, because a real Christian does not want to drift back to the old world and die with it at Armageddon. He wants to keep his ministerial garments on, preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and thus saving himself and others also. There is an urgent need for accurate knowledge both for ourselves and for others too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It has been a real pleasure to compile the information from all parts of the world into the </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font7"> for 1959. In all the letters and reports that have been written by the Branch servants expressions have been made that the brothers of their land want their warm love and greetings sent to all their fellow workers throughout the earth in other lands. They have expressed, too, their joy and delight at being present at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Letter after letter expressed appreciation for the help that their brothers gave them, making it possible for their delegates to come from distant lands to New York. What a warm spirit of real friendship, love and understanding permeates the entire organization! All this love, peace and joy is due to the fact that Jehovah’s witnesses have God’s spirit. They study the truth and are getting a better understanding of the divine will as the days and years go by. With this spirit of unity and our having God’s thoughts a tremendous work will be done by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness during the 1959 service year. May all of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere pray for His will to be done in us, and may we, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, accomplish the witness work to his good pleasure. Let us press on doing the divine will of our God Jehovah. With all my brothers everywhere I join in sending warm love and best wishes to all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Your brother and servant wanting to do the Divine Will,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">, President</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society of Pennsylvania</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark423"></a><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark424"></a>Annual Meeting</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">Pursuant to law and to the charter of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, the annual meeting of the members of the Society was held at 10 a.m., on Wednesday, October 1, 1958, at the Society’s registered office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The president of the Society, N. H. Knorr, presided. It was shown that the membership of the Society on October 1, 1957, was 457. During the year the membership was reduced by the death of sixteen individuals and the resignation of one. So the total membership as of October 1, 1958, was 440. There were two vacancies to be filled on the board of directors because of the expiration of the terms of Grant Suiter and Thomas J. Sullivan, who had been elected October 1, 1955, for a term of three years. By unanimous vote there was a re-election of Grant Suiter and Thomas J. Sullivan as directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania for an ensuing term of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The secretary read excerpts from many letters from members of the Pennsylvania corporation from all parts of the world, which letters showed the beneficial results of the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in all fields. These reports were enthusiastically received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">N. H. Knorr then gave the meeting a most interesting, informative and encouraging talk covering high lights of the work around the world. His remarks were based on Revelation 16:15, from which the yeartext for 1959 is taken. He emphasized the service privileges set before Jehovah’s witnesses for the ensuing three months and the carrying of the Resolution adopted at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses to the people in general and to all the rulers and clergymen everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were 1,047 in attendance, and all of these </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">289 </span><span class="font8">unanimously asked the Society’s president to carry the love and greetings of members and of those assembled, together with an expression of appreciation, to the Bethel family and to all whom the president will meet in his visits with the brothers during his trips abroad in the months ahead. The meeting was closed with prayer by Brother Knorr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On October 3, the annual meeting of the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was held at the executive offices of the Society at 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn 1, New York. The purpose of this meeting was the election of officers for the ensuing year. The entire membership of the board of directors was present. The meeting was opened with prayer. The officers unanimously elected were N. H. Knorr, President; F. W. Franz, Vice-President; Grant Suiter, Secretary and Treasurer; H. H. Riemer, Assistant Secretary and Treasurer. The board of directors wanted to go on record and give unanimous expression of their gratitude to Jehovah God for the blessings of the past year and the prospects for the future. All were grateful for the many rich blessings received at the assembly and appreciated the numerous releases. They wanted to go on record as expressing that it is recognized that the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses was so clean that the enemy organization has been unable to find a flaw in criticism and it appears that the assembly is a springboard leading to blessed events in the future. It is recognized, too, that all must watch and keep awake for the work that lies ahead, by Jehovah’s undeserved kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was the prayer of all those responsible for looking after the management of the Society that Jehovah’s rich blessing will be upon them and upon Jehovah’s people everywhere as they work together in unity to the honor of His holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments.”—Rev. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Staying awake is not a difficult task for one who is interested in his work. Jehovah’s witnesses are interested in their work. When charged with the responsibility to be on the watch and to see to it that the Kingdom interests are cared for, they know the urgency of being awake. Jehovah’s witnesses throughout the world want to keep the garments of their ministry. They have done well in these years. They have seen Jehovah’s rich blessing upon them and now just before the final battle of Armageddon they certainly do not want to be caught napping or in a sleepy condition. They do not want to have their ministerial garments taken away from them, as has already occurred to Christendom in their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses know the need of keeping clean, upright, wholesome, and of living in God’s healthy organization. This is no time for loose talk, filthy words, drunkenness, overeating and looking after the anxieties of this world and being absorbed in its hustle and bustle to the point of being blind to the great privileges of service that Jehovah has granted them in these days prior to the battle of Armageddon. This truly is a day for them to stay awake and at their post of assigned duty and to be ready to greet the Principal Officer any time he comes, for he does say: “Look! I am coming as a thief.” All those in the New World society want to welcome Christ Jesus at his coming at Armageddon to strike against the whole of the Devil’s organization and bring in the cleansed new earth, for they know that those who are asleep are going to have their garments removed and burned and then they will walk naked and people will look upon their parts of shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What a wonderful thing it is to be able to have the clear picture of Jehovah’s kingdom and to know that Jehovah reigns now and that God’s kingdom is the best government for this earth! It is the same government that ruled the earth when man was originally placed upon it, and that is the way true Christians want it to be, God-ruled, not man-ruled.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark425"></a><span class="font7">With the tens of thousands of newly interested persons coming into Jehovah’s organization each year, it is certainly necessary for each individual within Jehovah’s organization to be on the watch and to care for these, paying attention to themselves and showing such love for their neighbors as they do for themselves. By </span></p>
<p><span class="font7">doing this they not only save themselves, but others. These are important days, because it is much later than some people think. The years since the establishment of God’s kingdom in the heavens have gone by fast, and all must remember that it is in this generation that all these things spoken of by Christ Jesus are coming to pass and they all mark the “consummation of the system of things.” It will not be long until Christ Jesus comes as a thief, and what a happy moment it will be for every faithful Christian when he sees Jehovah God’s Principal Officer come through to make final check! The true Christian finds himself wide-awake, alert, looking after the things in his charge and having on his ministerial garments. He is proclaiming the good news of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth. What a joy it will be to every pioneer, special pioneer, missionary, person at Bethel, every circuit and district servant, the isolated minister and the congregation publisher and all those in Branch offices, those sick and afflicted, yes, every one of God’s people to be found wide-awake to their privileges of service, looking after the ministry that God has committed into their care!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are days of action, and when we read the year’s report in the 1959 </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span><span class="font7"> we can see that if we are going to stay in this organization we must be alert and alive to everything that needs to be done and move along with the whole organization. We do not want to get drowsy and lie down by the wayside while the rest of the organization moves forward. This is a time to study the Word of God, to be thoroughly acquainted with the divine will, to know His purposes, to follow His commandments. Nineteen hundred years ago the apostles were keenly interested in what was to happen in these last days and they asked Christ Jesus: “When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and the consummation of the system of things?” (Matt. 24:3) Jesus told them. He gave them a composite sign. He loved his followers and he was not going to keep them in the dark. He wanted them to be alert as to every evidence, and all those things were spoken for our benefit in this day during his second presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So how important it was for Jesus to say: “But pay attention to yourselves that your hearts never become weighed down with overeating and heavy drinking and anxieties of life, and suddenly that day be instantly upon you as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling upon the face of all the earth. Keep awake, then, all the time making supplication that you may succeed in escaping all these things that are destined to occur, and to hold your position before the Son of man.” (Luke 21:34-36) Yes, keep awake! Remain happy. Enjoy the wonderful things that God has in store for us. How good he was during 1958 at the Divine Will International Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses! What rich food he placed before all of us then! Now as the 1959 service year goes along we can feed upon it individually and collectively at the congregational meetings and more fully appreciate the divine will. Happy is our lot that we have on our ministerial garments, and happy we will be to stay awake and to praise Jehovah’s name, always doing the divine will.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of the earth.—Isa. 42:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font0"> proverb now about three thousand years old says: “He that is removing a garment on a cold day is as vinegar upon alkali and as a singer with songs upon a gloomy heart.” (Prov. 25: 20) The whole world today is of a gloomy heart, faced as it is with a disturbing present and a frightening future. Concerned people may not be in the mood for a song. But there is a song that can really cheer all people up, regardless of to what nation they belong. It is a new song that previous generations were not privileged to sing. If men are of good will toward the unusual creator of this song they will enjoy it, be warmed and refreshed by it and be lifted out of their gloom and sour attitude. When they get familiar with this song creation, they too will want to burst out in singing it. This will mean health, yes, salvation to them. Do we as Jehovah’s witnesses show by our zeal that we appreciate the privilege of singing this song?

We must take this stand to be acceptable for true worship of Jehovah. Our separation from the false worshipers makes it possible for us to cause Jehovah’s praise to be heard. With thanksgiving in our hearts we thrill to make known the wonderful works of God from the creation of man in the garden of Eden to the restoration of all humankind in the paradise earth. As Jesus Christ stood alone in declaring that the kingdom of the heavens is at hand, so we today are all alone in our announcement of God’s kingdom. We are telling the world that we are living in the last days of this wicked world. To let all persons of good will know the good news takes a great deal of preaching and teaching in the homes of the people. Are you doing your part to cause thanksgiving to be heard aloud? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Rev. 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since 1919 Christ has put before the faithful and discreet slave class an opened door by putting it in charge of all his spiritual belongings on earth. He opened before them the opportunity and responsibility to fulfill Matthew 24: 14. No man has been able to shut that door since then. This is not to our credit. It is to the credit of Christ, who has kept the door open and will keep it open till the witness work is done. The door to those Kingdom-time privileges has been shut to Christendom and Jewry, to all those of the synagogue of Satan. They have no works of Kingdom witnessing to show that they enjoyed this expression of love from Christ. Now they have to humble themselves before us and acknowledge that we have the works, we have the record and we are continuing the works. We are inviting all the other sheep yet to be found to come in through the opened door and join us in the work.

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah, the great Creator, has established a most marvelous relationship between himself and his dearly beloved Son, and that relationship is most precious. Men and women on earth are invited to come into the same close relationship with God and Christ and be blessed. This blessed relationship, as revealed through the Scriptures and the work of God on behalf of his people, is comparable to a shepherd and his sheep. Jehovah is the Shepherd of Israel, Christ Jesus is the Right Shepherd, overseers in the congregations are undershepherds and Jehovah’s people are the sheep. This unity is possible by obedience and dependence upon God, which helps all to be at peace and in happy contentment and to be settled in the assurance of God’s rich provision for them. We shall never want. As mild-tempered, sheeplike members of his flock, we do well to meditate on the blessings of this relationship.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus.—Phil. 2:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the tightwire performer balance is a state of equilibrium or steadiness on his wire. If he were to lean too far either one way or the other he would lose his equipoise and fall. The same is true with the Christian. He can lose his spiritual equilibrium by being an extremist, or by being careless, or by being indifferent to the need of cultivating good spiritual balance. The physical balance of the tightwire walker is governed in his head, and it can be improved with training. The Christian’s balance also is governed in his head, but it is spiritual, not physical. It too can be improved through proper training, by developing a good mental attitude. If he has a bad mental attitude his spiritual steadiness is affected, and he will eventually lose his footing on the narrow way of integrity. Persons who are cynical, hypercritical and complainers should take warning. Their Christian balance is endangered Because their mental attitude is not good, is not like that “which was also in Christ Jesus.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 5, 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 5:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Due to overconfidence and lack of vigilance, such faithful ones as Noah, Moses and David at times took a false step. And especially in Peter do we have a warning example. Surely he was wholly devoted to God and his Master. Yet how he stumbled, denying his Master three times, all because of his lack of vigilance due to overconfidence! And while Christians have ever had to take such warning examples to heart, today we have an even greater need for doing so. Thus it has ever been true that ‘the Devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.’ But in view of our living in the time when “the nations became wrathful,” we know that Satan has greater anger now, “knowing he has a short period of time, and that therefore he is waging war with increased fury against all those “who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” This stenped-up attack on the part of Satan requires increased vigilance on our part. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 5, 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I publicly praise you, Father, . . . because you have hidden these things from the wise and intellectual ones and have revealed them to babes.—Matt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">11: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We must take in knowledge with the proper attitude, as babes, in humble recognition of Jehovah and his organization, which he uses today to dispense spiritual food. We should have an attitude of gratitude for all the provisions made through the organization of God’s anointed witnesses, the faithful and discreet slave. God has his own good way and purpose in providing the spiritual food as he does. What is provided is good and we should study it to learn. When a person realizes that he does not know everything, and is teachable like a child, then be can learn; then he will gain spiritual discernment. If he feels proud and wise he will not understand. It is beyond the proud men of this world to understand spiritual things: “A physical man does not receive the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are examined spiritually.”—1 Cor. 2: 14. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Run, running, race—Paul in his letters frequently uses words such as these that pertain to a foot race. Why ? Because a race well illustrates the course that is set before us; because running expresses movement, action, going forward ; because running expresses the efforts we must put forth to win the prize of everlasting life in God’s new world. To encourage the Christians of Corinth to run so as to win the prize, Paul used the familiar language of the foot race. They knew that many runners ran in a race, yet only one received the prize; they knew that each runner put forth the most strenuous efforts to win that prize; they knew that runners ran to win the prize. Christians, Paul shows, must run in a similar way. Yes, run to win! Unlike the ancient foot race, however, in which only one received the prize, the Christian race offers a prize to all who run well, to all who reach the goal line. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 1-3</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6:1, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Paul was sharp in his speech to those who failed to tell others what they knew. He said: “Although you ought to be teachers in view of the time, you again need someone to teach you from the beginning the first principles of the sacred pronouncements of God.” (Heb. 5: 12) How long have you claimed to be one of Jehovah’s witnesses? Paul here is not talking to the overseers of congregations; he is talking to everyone professing to be a Christian. What are you doing about teaching others in God’s Word? Paul says: “You ought to be teachers in view of the time.” You have been going to the congregation of God long enough to know what the truth is. Why, then, are you not teaching it to others? Are you going on to maturity by studying with God’s congregation, and are you then going weekly to others not in your congregation and studying with them the things you have learned? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It is the time for the best meal of the day, the evening meal. Many an evening meal Jesus shared, giving out spiritual instruction as he enjoyed the householder’s hospitality. Now he invites us to have such a spiritually upbuilding meal with him. He stands at your door, Laodiceans. Will you listen to his knock, revive your affection for Christ, let him into your midst and let him teach you in a precious communion with him? If so, then you will receive his overseer, the angel of your congregation. Your overseer has opened the door for Christ to enter to feast with those who repent. Show that you were not vomited out of his mouth but are still members of his congregation by coming to all meetings of the congregation for study and service, for Jesus has promised to be present at a spiritual meal where as few as two or three are appreciatively met togther in his name.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Let anyone hearing say, '‘Come!”—Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each week we should spend some time to aquaint our home Bible study pupil with Jehovah’s organization and how it does its work. Tell him about the meetings and how they are conducted. Invite him to attend. As you tell him of your own house-to-house ministry, show him from the Bible why you do it that way. Relate an encouraging back-call experience to show that Jesus commanded that the sheep should be fed. On another occasion acquaint him with the training program; let him know that new ones are not sent off on their own but are lovingly assisted step by step until they feel qualified to help others. Do not feel you have to invite him in the service the first time you tell him about it. Prepare him for it. As the entire arrangement takes shape in his mind and from your studies he begins to see the urgent need for others to learn, he will want to have a share. Love based on knowledge will remove any fear of telling others what he has learned and will replace it with a burning desire to show his appreciation to Jehovah by responding to the invitation also to say, “Come!” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font0"> 20a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">So Ananias went off and entered into the house, and he laid his hands upon him and said: ‘‘Saul, brother, the Lord, . . . has sent me forth in order that you may recover sight and be filled with holy spirit. . . . and he recovered sight, and he rose and was baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Acts 9:17, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A point that is extremely important is that the command to “make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit,” given by Jesus 1,900 years ago, was given only to his fellow witnesses. It was only when persons came to them, received instructions and were baptized that they were filled with holy spirit, either just before the actual water baptism or not a long time afterward. The same circumstances are true today. It is only through his channel of communication that Jehovah now is using that an individual obtains accurate knowledge of the truth ; likewise, it is fitting that only persons devotedly serving Jehovah baptize those who dedicate themselves to serve God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">21: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the case of a child, it is the responsibility of parents to guide him properly so as to prevent stubbornness from becoming a part of his nature as he grows up. If proper guidance and discipline are neglected, such might very well cause him to receive Jehovah’s disfavor later in life. When parents are unable to cope with the situation they may solicit the aid of a mature brother or members of the congregation service committee, even as noted above in the case of the Israelites under the Law. Let the youthful servant of God know that by pursuing the course of self-will and stubbornness he will certainly come into disfavor with his God, Jehovah. Such qualities are manifest only in the world belonging to Satan; and for one of Jehovah’s children, youthful or aged, to display these qualities and persist in them would lead to that one’s being cut off from Jehovah’s clean organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> oO</span></p>

For sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness.—Rom. 6:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If our desire is to please ourselves, then we will serve ourselves, and we have become our own gods. We have become like disobedient Eve, who sought to be like God in making her own decisions regarding good and bad. “Am I seeking to please men? If I were yet pleasing men [including myself], I would not be Christ’s slave.” (Gal. 1: 10) There are many ways to worship, but only one that is right in the eyes of Almighty God. If we are to practice the worship that is right from the standpoint of God our Father, then we must do as did David, who was a man after God’s own heart. He did not seek to please himself or other men but said to Jehovah: “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.” (Ps. 143: 10) In those who find pleasure in giving him exclusive devotion Jehovah will find pleasure. He will bless them with everlasting life in his new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Thus Jesus stated an important principle, namely, it is endurance that wins. Endurance is required of all those who will retain their place in the New World society. “He that has endured to the finish is the one that will be saved.” (Matt. 24: 13) Once we accept the responsibilities that go with a theocratic appointment, faithfully sticking to that assignment is required. Never be a quitter, for quitters are disapproved by Jehovah and are removed from their places of appointment. Demas was such a quitter, one who forsook his theocratic privileges, simply because “he loved the present system of things.” Rather, let us be like the eleven faithful apostles who stuck with Jesus in his trials. Yes, let us with endurance prove faithful to our dedication vows, keeping a tight grip on the Word of life and never looking back. Doing that we will keep our place and prove worthy of living forever in God’s new world, to our everlasting blessing and, above all, to Jehovah’s vindication ! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15 17,</span><span class="font0"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Bible history glows with examples of appreciative lovers of righteousness. Abel was one. He correctly valued the favor of God and realized that his worship of the true God must conform to divine standards, not man-made rituals such as Cain’s offering of the fruit of the ground. Abel will be remembered in the resurrection because he appreciated the value of serving God in the right way. Abraham correctly evaluated the privilege of leaving his home in Ur to serve Jehovah in foreign lands, in typical missionary fashion. Abraham always upheld Jehovah’s way of life and won God’s favor as the father of the faithful. Though a world of more than two billion souls now is about to die from lack of appreciation, we can survive its end by copying the lives of such experts in the art of appreciating divine favors as the above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Note the action of God’s holy spirit at the time of sending out Paul and Barnabas as missionaries from Antioch in Syria. Paul and Barnabas were among five prophets and teachers in the congregation there. Then by some undescribed means the holy spirit was made to transmit sound, human speech, just like the action of radio waves upon a radio receiving set Since the representative men of the Antioch congregation laid their hands upon these two, is it necessarily said that they were made missionaries by the men who laid their hands upon them? No; the action of those men was only incidental and to show that they acted for God’s spirit in setting aside the two missionaries. The fact stands out that they were made missionaries by the holy spirit, for the Bible goes on to say about the two missionaries: “Accordingly these men, sent out by the holy spirit, . . . began publishing the word of God.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Gen. 1:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Man was made in God’s image, meaning he had the godly attributes of wisdom, power, justice and love. Jehovah’s giving man the attribute of wisdom meant that man was given a brain with the capacity and hunger for knowledge. God also made man with the attribute of power; and with wisdom to direct his hands in work, man has the power to perform many things that give happiness and deep satisfaction. If he gets his wisdom from God and uses his power in harmony with Jehovah’s will he happily gains “the peace of God that excels all thought.” But man may misuse his wisdom and power; to prevent this God gave man another divine attribute, that of justice. Man is a moral creature with ability to know right and wrong, and when the sense of justice is outraged the conscience is hurt and cries out. However, the quality that perfectly blends all faculties and powers is love. Its scope and importance are reflected in the brief statement: “God is love.”—1 John 4: 8. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 3-7</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The narrow road of Christian integrity is not a fruitless course. It has rich rewards now and in the future. They are prized rewards that are well worth seeking. But they will go only to those who are spiritually balanced. This means Christians with weak balance must correct their weakness and steady their footing without delay. It is a serious matter that cannot be blissfully ignored. Great peace of mind is one of the rewards the balanced Christian now enjoys. No matter how turbulent world affairs may become, he is not disturbed. He knows what the future holds and knows that he is walking the way that leads to survival. This dispels any fear of God’s coming destruction of the present wicked system of things. He has the joy that conies to those who love God’s laws, who live by his principles and who engage in God’s service. His conscience does not prick him because he acted improperly or failed to do what was required of him. His mind is at ease. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 25-27a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The facts all show that we are in the critical times hard to deal with when selfishness has gone to seed. So while the world has ever tempted the Christian because of its appeals to selfishness, its increased materialism and wickedness today demand greater vigilance on our part. The same is true regarding our flesh. How so? In that the flesh has increased inducements to assert itself. Just as “fulness of bread, and prosperous ease,” contributed to the delinquency of ancient Sodom, so today the material prosperity and increased leisure time that many enjoy furnish added opportunities for the fallen tendencies of our flesh to assert themselves.

<p><span class="font0">Time bought out by shedding distractions enables us to concentrate on the race. Since the word “running” embraces the whole Christian way of life, especially our vigorous efforts to preach the good news, it is imperative that we train for the race. Yet some try running without training; they neglect the spiritual training available at congregational meetings of the New World society. These meetings serve a vital function: they aid us in keeping our eyes on the prize. No wonder those who regularly miss meetings often drop out of the race; they lose a clear view of the prize and their powers of endurance weaken. Jesus, Paul and the faithful witnesses of, early times all ran with their eyes on the prize. Run as they did. Instead of decreasing, distractions will likely increase as this world nears its doom. While it is still today, buy out the time for running. Appraise the prize correctly. Train regularly. Shed weights and distractions. Strip down to bare necessities. Run to win: Run with your eyes on the prize! W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9/15</span><span class="font0"> 22, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The application among sincere dedicated Christians of God’s requirements governing the Christian congregation can, of course, result in only an effective ministerial society. The real effectiveness of it is the blessing of God upon our obedient response to his requirements. The two things, therefore, are necessary and they work together. That is, first, the obedient effort put forth by one who loves Jehovah supremely, and then, above all, the blessing of God upon such effort. This is seen on the individual and on the organizational level. It cannot be denied, because the earth-wide results are proof of it. Even as such has brought the theocratic New World society to its present spiritually prosperous state, so such must continue, that the New World society and all in it may continue to progress spiritually to Jehovah’s praise. Such effectiveness of obeying God’s requirements is noticed and often noted by those on the outside. It is a good sign that this is the case. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> 13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Shepherds are a gift to the congregation of God. They are God’s gift. The apostle Paul wrote: “He gave some as apostles, . . . some as shepherds.” (Eph. 4: 11) To such shepherds Paul spoke the words cited above. If, now, you are a shepherd among the the sheep, ask yourself the question, Am I paying attention to the flock for whom I am responsible? You were appointed as a shepherd by holy spirit; therefore you must not neglect such an appointment. You must not sin against the holy spirit, for Jesus said that sin against the spirit would not be forgiven. (Matt. 12: 31, 32) If you go contrary to the holy spirit you will be held responsible. Therefore you have cause for fear if you are not attending to your duties in a proper manner. Question yourself to see if you are living in fear of Jehovah, or has it not forced itself on your mind that he holds you responsible for the shepherd’s work? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The 26th Psalm shows David presenting his integrity and offering himself to Jehovah’s searching. He had confidence that he had walked in the right way, living according to the commandments of God. He was always anxious to do the right thing. As the upright king of ancient Israel, David was a man with real confidence in his Creator, the God whom he called Jehovah. He appreciated that over the years of life he had made many mistakes as a sinful, imperfect human, but he also knew that uppermost in his mind and heart was the doing of the will of his heavenly Life-giver. As the leading member of a nation dedicated to Jehovah God, David was concerned with the matter of integrity, as noted in this psalm. This he faithfully endeavored to do, as an example to all his subjects. He serves as a prophetic type for us today, the true followers of the Greater David, Jesus Christ. Are we, as did David, making the doing of Jehovah’s will uppermost in our lives so that we can plead for favor on the basis of our keeping integrity? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 2, 1</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Christ has the illuminating power of God’s holy spirit. His final judgment of persons who have been put in trust with the interests of the Kingdom is getting closer. This drawing near of the final accounting ought to stir us to remember that we have received and heard the Kingdom message and hence should make us appreciate our responsibility. Then, with deepened appreciation, we should wakeup and keep on the watch, reactivate our service efforts that were about to die, and keep our knowledge of the truth and keep our opportunity to preach, which knowledge affords. One of these days each overseer will have to give a final account to someone higher than the governing body associated with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. That hour will come as a thief.

<p><span class="font0">When a person makes a dedication to do the will of God, it means a complete change from his former way of life, a way common to this world under Satan. The dedicated person’s desires change. This change does not take place automatically, but is the result of calm, careful, sober meditation on God’s Word. The normal bent of man’s mind is toward sin, because our first parents chose to do the will of Satan instead of God’s will. Accordingly we have been shaped in iniquity under the condemnation of death. That is why it is imperative that a change take place, that new knowledge be taken into the mind, and this from God’s Word. There must be a continuous turning away from the old way of thinking and a remolding of one’s way of living according to the new pattern, as noted in Paul’s words cited above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—John 15:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being Christians causes us to believe and act differently from the world. It affects our family life, our relationship with one another and with those to whom we preach. Being no part of the world, we do not devote our time, energy and means to perpetuating it. We do not get involved in its political and social squabbles. We seek first God’s kingdom and his righteousness, knowing that it is the answer to mankind’s problems. And, copying the example of Christ, we go from house to house in all parts of the world as witnesses, preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Not as a pleasant pastime, although we find great joy in our ministry, but as the most important thing in our lives, we pursue our service to Jehovah as his dedicated servants. Those who are a part of the old world are not moved by love of God, nor do they long for his new world, but they bitterly oppose those who advocate it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 2:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When we feel the pull of wrong desires we must think; we must reason; we must let good judgment direct us, and not emotion; we must hold to the principles of God’s Word. Only thus can we maintain our spiritual balance. When we step on the narrow way of Christian integrity we leave behind the unlawful actions of the world. We turn our backs on its practice of giving no regard to the restraints of God’s Word. We have climbed out of the world’s immoral swamp and now walk a way of high morals. But it is not easy for us to maintain our balance on that way. It takes concentrated effort. It takes the help of God’s Word and organization, and it takes a constant desire to improve our spiritual equilibrium. If we as balanced Christians feel the pull of wrong desires or wrong influences we should think about the effects our intended actions will have upon our relations with God. This will help us to abstain from such fleshly desires. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 17-19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">While the unenlightened men of the world exist in fear and trembling because of worsening world conditions, as foretold at Luke 21: 26, we are calm and confident in Jehovah because he has given us accurate knowledge of what he is doing, and he has lighted the pathway to the new world; and we can say along with the psalmist: “Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.” (Ps. 119: 105) Of all people who have ever lived, we are blessed to be living now when God’s light of truth is shining so brightly. Jehovah has given us accurate knowledge so we can be sure of what we are doing, of what we are saying and of where we are going—so we can endure through being filled with it. He has poured out great love upon us and he has shown ug how to abound in love. With love and accurate knowledge we may be made flawless m our devotion, not stumbling others in actions or words, but, by using our tongues to utter knowledge aright, helping others to join with us in being filled with righteous fruit to God’s praise.

Money is a power and a defense, but it does not lead the seeker thereof to eternal life. Rather, it is godliness with contentment that is great gain. So it is better to rely upon the firm arm of Jehovah rather than on the weak support provided by wealth; or even on the strength of princes, lie who depends upon material riches builds upon sand, but he who patterns his life completely after God’s Word builds upon the rock-mass.

Materialistically, Balaam tried to turn his office of prophet into a business for making material gain. When God turned his intended curse into a blessing for Israel, then Balaam, working with the political power of this world as symbolized by King Balak, tried luring Israel into idol worship, by means of pagan girls whose bodies were dedicated to unclean handling by worshipers of Baal of Peor. Jehovah cursed those who yielded to the machinations of the gain-greedy prophet.

<p><span class="font0">In obedience to this Scriptural instruction the balanced Christian will seek companions within the New World society. Certainly when it comes to marriage it is even more urgent for a Christian to follow this policy of separateness. He has to live with his marriage partner; and if that partner is not a dedicated Christian and is not interested in obeying God, will he not find it more difficult to stand firm in the faith? Will there not be continual friction, difficulties and frustrations? Why bring on heartaches by agreeing to a union that is bound to cause trouble and create unhappiness? Why be disobedient to God’s commands as the Israelites were who married heathen Canaanites? The danger of being turned away from Jehovah God by an unbelieving mate is just as real today as it was in the days of ancient Israel. Therefore let all unmarried Christians heed the Scriptural principle of marrying “only in the Lord.” To ignore this principle is to reveal spiritual immaturity.

<p><span class="font0">Each star has its own individual orbit, each its predictable course in which it moves with precise timing; each is controlled by established laws of the Creator. Jehovah, by his own design and arrangement, has set the stars each and all in their places. Hence we may say that each star has a God-given position, a divine assignment, its proper individual place. So it is in all of Jehovah’s creative works. He is a God of orderly arrangement. “God is a God, not of disorder.” Hence all things in his organization “take place decently and by arrangement,” by divine arrangement, by divine assignment. It is only reasonable, therefore, to expect that in the New World society, which is also a special creation of Jehovah, there would be a place arranged for each individual member. An examination of the facts shows us that this is so. Are you serving iu your divinely arranged-for place in that society?

We also deeply appreciate the heavy responsibility resting on us to uphold the honor of his name and to carry out the commission laid upon us. Figuratively speaking, we have beaten our swords into plowshares and our spears into pruning shears and, although of many nationalities, we will not lift up sword against one another, because we are Christian brothers and members of the one family of God, neither will we learn war against one another any more, but we will walk in God’s paths in peace. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 17, 18, 20a</span></p>

So we see the danger that the Christian runner begins the race in joy and vigor but later lets the prizes of this world distract him and he takes his eyes off the prize. Then what happens? He slows down; he runs uncertainly, not as one seeking to win the prize of life. The things behind, the prizes of this old world, have distracted him, causing him to lose that incentive for running that comes only by keeping one’s eyes on the prize God offers. Demas took his eyes off the prize; the prizes of this world distracted him, and he stopped running. Let us imitate, not Demas, but rather the apostle Paul by keeping our eyes on the prize.

Materialism is out to conquer all the people in this world with its philosophy. Of necessity its conquest will be brief. Nonetheless, it will claim many victims, and that is why we must wage relentless war against it like a true soldier. There is a twofold lesson to be learned from Paul’s words cited above. First, a soldier cannot afford to have divided in-tereste. It is essential that he be singularly devoted to his cause; otherwise he will not be a real fighter. Second, a good soldier is keenly interested in victory. Just as a soldier wages relentless war against the enemy in order to gain the victory, so too must we fight materialism. Hence none of us can afford to relax for a moment. We must learn how to use the greatest weapon we have against materialism, the sword of the spirit.

If materialism is distracting us, we should realize that we will not die from lack of luxuries; but we will from lack of appreciation. If we value this world’s material things more than the precious truths of God’s Word we are poor appraisers of what is priceless. So let us cultivate appreciation by obeying Jesus’ positive command given above. Where our heart is, there our appreciation will be. If we put our heart into this doomed world’s treasures our heart will sink with them at Armageddon. But if we put our heart and soul and strength into Jehovah’s kingdom our heart will live as long as the Kingdom does—forever.

When a Christian has the opportunity to talk with another person about the good things of God's kingdom it brings him real pleasure. We do not need to fight, says Paul, to make a person understand. Rather, we must be tactful in our expressions as we try to teach our hearer new things. Private teaching is the big work of Jehovah’s witnesses in these last days of Satan’s world. Because the people have been so steeped in ignorance concerning God’s Word it is necessary to go into their homes, use their Bible and actually show them what is in it and where to find the truths concerning the kingdom of God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 1, 2a</span></p>

How much longer will the march go on before Armageddon begins? This generation of humankind is nearing its normal end. Jesus prophesied that this generation, which saw the Gentile times end and the beginning of world sorrows, would also see the end of those sorrows in the world’s destruction at Armageddon. (Matt. 24:34) We know not the day or hour, but the world’s end is near. The world’s end is nothing over which to be sorry. Should we be sorry because a new world, God’s righteous new world, is to begin after this old world ends in Armageddon?

For all your activities, gain knowledge by talking to your brothers. The right kind of ministers give good advice. While in many things it is true that in the multitude of counselors there is safety and help, it is especially true in spiritual things. Accurate knowledge in them is a defense. Knowing that God has almighty power and that he cares for his own gives us comfort and strength. It removes fears that would weaken and break down our defenses. For example, partial knowledge of the existence of demons might have one concerned over demonism, wondering whether demonism would have some power over one. But accurate knowledge puts the mind at ease.

<p><span class="font0">In this day of Jehovah’s power, if one refuses to dedicate himself to serve Jehovah his life will permanently end at Armageddon as a condemned sinner. In coming to the point where one wishes to serve Jehovah God with his whole heart, soul, mind and strength the question is not. ‘Shall I make a dedication?’ for that is the course outlined by Jesus. Rather, one should ask himself, Do I have the proper understanding of God’s will and what he requires in order for me to agree to be Christ’s follower, to do God’s will from now on? In coming to that proper understanding, there is no hesitation on the part of the person who sincerely wants to serve Jehovah. This positive step is outlined by Jehovah. To attain life we must take that step. One who decides to be a footstep follower of Christ and performs that decision is truly a Christian. Such dedication the obedient follower of Christ then publicly confesses and symbolizes before others by water immersion. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Yes, everything depends upon Jehovah. (Ps. 127: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1) </span><span class="font0">Among Jehovah’s servants who appreciated this truth was Nehemiah. When King Artaxerxes asked him what he wanted, Nehemiah at once prayed and Jehovah immediately answered his prayer, the king granting his every request; thus Nehemiah realized his heart’s chief desire, the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, The apostle Paul also appreciated this truth. He repeatedly stresses prayer in his letters, mentioning it scores of times. He did not depend upon his natural ties or upon his supernatural powers for results. He knew that it depended upon Jehovah God, not his planting nor the watering of Apollos, to make things grow. And so time and again we read of his asking the various congregations to whom he wrote to pray for him and his work. If the gifted apostle Paul recognized the need of God's help in performing his ministry, even more so should we! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 16, 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Rev. 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In these apocalyptic times the overseers are reminded that they are in Christ’s right hand and they must be guided and used by his hand and not resist or fight against it. Today there is no congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses at Ephesus near the coast of the Aegean Sea. But the condition in the congregation back there foreshadowed the condition that may be true in our congregations today. The conditions in all seven congregations were used to picture the different conditions obtaining here and there today among the congregations of God’s flock. It is therefore proper for the congregation &quot;stars,” the anointed overseers of all the congregations, to be notified of the conditions that correspond with those foreshadowed in Christ’s messages to the seven congregations in Asia Minor. They must then follow Christ’s instructions, as his right-hand men, in working to correct the improper conditions and to help all the members to overcome or conquer this old world now in its last days. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 2a</span></p>

Yes, so that in our association in the New World society we will not be harmed, only faithful shepherds will continue to serve. This means that our brothers serving as shepherds are most anxious on our behalf. They want us to get everlasting life. The sheep, however, also have a great responsibility toward the shepherd, which cannot be overlooked or side-stepped. The sheep must not only be submissively obedient to God and Christ but also be submissive and obedient to those who are governing the flock. It is not the prerogative of the undershepherd to make rules for the sheep, but he must explain and apply Jehovah’s rules for them, even as Paul shows above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font0">23, 25a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Everyone who receives of Jehovah’s spiritual provisions becomes obligated to dispense them to others. But he must first qualify. Today’s qualified minister of God needs to know how to nurture and bring to maturity many willing learners who are taking their stand for Jehovah’s new world of righteousness. Therefore study, continuous study, deep study, is a requirement in order for us to qualify as undershepherds directing the sheeplike persons into Christ’s sheepfold. Since the sacred interests of God are involved it behooves us to study with a purpose. We are primarily interested in pleasing the One who has called us to serve under Jesus, the great Teacher. We realize that if our service is acceptable we will receive life from God. At the same time we experience unmeasured joy from our engaging in the gathering work directed by our Leader, especially when our diligent activity prospers and succeeds, giving proof of God’s approval of our ministry. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">True worship is alive, progressive, productive. “The word of God is alive,” says the inspired apostle Paul. We must go on walking in the advancing light. Being a Christian is not merely a matter of learning certain doctrines, acknowledging as good a body of principles that govern life, and then ever after laying claim to the name Christian. Not at all! A Christian must be productive of right works that bring praise to his God Jehovah. Jesus said: “I am the light of the world. He that follows me will by no means walk in darkness, but will possess the light of life.” (John 8: 12) When called out of darkness into this marvelous light, we must appreciate its value enough to continue to walk in it, making no excursions back into the darkness that enshrouds the world. There can be no fellowship between light and darkness. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">5/1</span><span class="font0"> 1,2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Paul and Barnabas started a number of congregations over which men spiritually older were made overseers. How? By the holy spirit, but through Paul and Barnabas as intermediaries, even as noted above. Afterward Timothy became a traveling companion and co-worker with Paul. After he became full grown spiritually, Timothy was made an overseer with power to act in appointing other mature men as overseers and ministerial servants in the congregation at Ephesus and elsewhere. But what led up to Timothy’s becoming such a special overseer? The action of God’s spirit through Paul. As Paul describes it in his first letter to Timothy: “Do not be neglecting the gift in you which was given you through a prediction [which prediction would be by the spirit] and when the body of older men laid their hands upon you.” Yes, God’s spirit was necessary to this action. —1 Tim. 4:14.

<p><span class="font0">The helpful co-operation that exists between us is a healthy, uplifting and strengthening force that mutally aids both the strong and the weak ones. It is very much like the aid that the individual members of the human body supply one another. This co-operation is not simply in physical matters at congregation meetings or in helping one another in the public preaching activity. It also includes a harmonious unison with the Head in spiritual matters of teaching. There can be no divisions on belief and teaching of Bible truths. If, therefore, anyone in the organization would set himself up as an expounder of new, strange teachings not found in the Bible and in opposition to what God has brought to light through his theocratic organization, then that one would be wholly out of place, as out of place as leprous Miriam was so that she was quarantined outside the camp of Israel because of her insubordination. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 14, 15a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">We must be alert to any signs that indicate a lack of good spiritual balance. If we spot a weakness we must concentrate on overcoming it. Unless we do we may not reach the other end of the narrow road to life. When a tightwire walker sees a weakness in his sense of balance he works on it until he has overcome it. Do not we have even more reason to do the same with our weaknesses, since our objective is eternal life, either in heaven or on earth? Is that not of much greater value? We have the responsibility of following Christ’s example of preaching and of associating with fellow servants of Jehovah God. If we are irregular in our public ministry, doing it spasmodically, we manifest the symptom of unsteadiness. Our mental attitude toward our responsibilities as Christians is not good. We do not manifest joyful obedience to God’s commands. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 7, 9</span></p>

Could any prize this world offers compare with the one God offers—the prize of incorruptibility, of everlasting life in heavenly glory with Christ the King? Today there are hundreds of thousands of Christian runners who are not anointed by God to be his spiritual sons in the heavenly kingdom; God offers them also an unperishable prize. It is everlasting life in perfection on earth under the kingdom of heaven. Whichever prize we have our eyes on, it is worth expending just as much vigor and energy as the runners of the ancient games did ; indeed, we should run with even greater determination and vigor, for the prize God lovingly promises will never fade. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 5, 6</span></p>

But even if one of the parents is not in the truth, the believer would do well to see that the children benefit from this provision every day. Additionally, it shows deep concern for the spiritual needs of the children when the parents set aside an hour or more a week to conduct a regular Bible study with them. Time is taken to go to the homes of others to teach them and their families the Bible, so why not provide that same service for one’s own family? It is just as important as other field ministry, and such a regular study conducted with one’s own children who are not yet dedicated may be reported to the congregation as a home Bible study.

<p><span class="font0">By prayer we show that we appreciate our need to keep in touch with Jehovah, the Source of true wisdom and all strength. There is a tendency on the part of some to overlook the importance of prayer. It is very easy to neglect it or to let it deteriorate into a routine, formal thing. Such is a great mistake! Earnest and frequent prayer will help us avoid the snare of overconfidence. In urging prayer upon us the Scriptures not only give us express commands but also many injunctions and expressions that imply prayer. Only by prayer can we call upon God and throw our burden upon him, letting him sustain us. Nor can we ‘walk humbly with our God’ without prayer; for who does not engage in conversation with one with whom he is walking; and what is prayer but talking with God? And when we come to God in dedication, is it not in prayer that we say to him: ‘I am come to do your will, O God’? Truly. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 14, 22</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Heb. 5: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Children are always anxious to escape just a milk diet or that of softened food. They are anxious to eat the solid food that they observe their parents partaking of, because they recognize that solid food belongs to mature people. And so it is with Christians, as counseled by Paul above. The Christian should eagerly pursue knowledge so he might gain spiritual maturity and be better able to carry out his dedication and then help others, and in that manner help them to life. It can be likened to young persons growing to manhood or womanhood. When they reach this state of maturity and marry, they bring new children into the world. So it is with mature Christians. By their saying “ComeI” they bring others, and then the new hearers turn from their former course of action, and likewise study and come to the point of dedicating their lives to do God’s will. Christian maturity is a wonderful, happy condition to live in and to observe. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8/1</span><span class="font0"> 17, 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Even the terrible hydrogen bomb is nothing new. For billions of years God has been exploding hydrogen atoms that give us light on this earth. Yet, while there may be nothing new under the sun, this does not mean that there could be nothing new above the sun, nothing new beyond this natural realm or in the spiritual realm. Solomon was speaking about the things of this natural world and about the ordinary affairs of mankind upon whom the sun shines. There is no need for anything new in a natural way under the sun. But Jehovah is above the sun, for he is the Most High God. He can create new things above the sun, or in the invisible realm and also in the spiritual affairs that have to do with mankind upon earth. In this way he can give us the facts for the theme of an entirely new song that will make us tingle with irrepressible emotions of joy and ecstasy at the glorious meaning of it all. Being almighty and never getting exhausted in his supply of wonderfully new things for us, he has given us such a new song to sing.

<p><span class="font0">Our motive must be pure and single. We must look neither to the right nor to the left. This is the pattern set for us by Jesus, who said: “To do your will, 0 my God, I have delighted.” (Ps. 40: 8) No other course set before him, such as the materialistic temptation by Satan to give him all the kingdoms of the world, had any effect upon him. Paul was of the same mind when stating that nothing could deter him from his single course of complete servitude to God. (Phil. 3:7-14) No other interests could overreach Paul, and that included material things to make his life easier. How evident it is, then, that we must maintain complete separation from the political, ecclesiastical, commercial and materialistic things of this old world ! A returning to the world would certainly constitute reliance upon one’s own mental conclusions and would be a turning away from God’s Word of sound counsel.

One of his great joys was the bringing of the sacred ark of the covenant to the holy city of Jerusalem and establishing the place of worship of Jehovah there. On Mount Zion Jehovah’s altar was built and all Israel praised Jehovah there. Of .this place he said the words cited above. David wanted to measure up to those requirements and to be strong, not weak or unsteady. So he had to trust in God. “In Jehovah I have trusted that I may not wobble.” (Ps. 26: 1) David’s reliance and faith in Jehovah were unshakable, undisturbed, calm, and there was no wavering on his part, for he was walking as one should who loved the dwelling of Jehovah’s house.

He is not unmindful of such national action. He is certain to show his approval by blessing and protecting the nation and giving them the needed divine assistance toward keeping their godly resolve. Such national action took place long ago in the days of King Asa after his victory over Zerah and his million Ethiopians. Today the remnant is offering sacrifices of praise to the same God. In this worship they have been joined by hundreds of thousands of sheeplike ones in all quarters of the earth.

Materialism, opposed as it is to Jehovah and all his righteous principles, will never survive Armageddon, being doomed along with all other worldly philosophies. Today, however, many, whether fully aware of it or not, are being subtly tested by the menace of materialism, and not a few have had their spirituality snuffed out. Materialism appeals to the most selfish of desires, self-gratification, even as the apostle John shows in the words quoted above, and it must be resisted if we are to preserve our lives in these critical times. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 3</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">There is a vast difference between knowing some Scripture and having spiritual discernment. Satan once showed he was able to quote a few texts, misapplying them completely. But Jesus had the spiritual discernment. Satan could not understand the meaning of the Scriptures because he did not have the spirit of God with him. Jesus knew how to use the Scriptures and he used them well in resisting Satan’s temptations. Spiritual things are discerned only by those devoted to Jehovah who humbly seek for his treasures and to whom he gives his spirit. He commits his sacred secret to his faithful servants, and not to worldly-wise men who would try therewith to bring honor to themselves and not to God. This spiritual discernment is not something common, to be treated lightly. It is not something one can buy. It is a gift from God to those who approach him in humility, who study his Word and who use their knowledge to honor him.

<p><span class="font0">The great enemy of our spiritual need is materialism. (Matt. 5:3) What is meant by materialism? Not food, clothing and shelter. “Your heavenly Father knows you need all these things,” Jesus went on to say. It is not materialism to provide yourself with good food and nice clothes and a comfortable home. It is not necessarily materialism to have a television set or a fine car or a substantial bank account. But if we have a love for food that makes us gluttonous, a love for clothes that makes us vain, a love for house that makes us proud; if we have an addiction for television that consumes our time, then we have fallen prey to materialism. Material things are all right, but when they become an ism to us they are wrong. “Ism” means “a distinctive doctrine, ideal, system, or practice.” When material things become our chief aim or ideal instead of Jehovah’s kingdom, and their pursuit becomes as a guiding doctrine to us instead of God’s Word and service, then we are practicing materialism. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In Jesus’ day a highly privileged generation had the advantage of seeing God’s own Son perform great miracles in proof of his claim to be the long-awaited Messiah, fulfilling all the prophecies that assured of his genuineness. Failing to appreciate their privileges, that doomed generation lightly esteemed his kingdom proclamation and neglected to appraise it as worthy of wholehearted allegiance and support. Jesus wept at their lack of discernment. True to the warning of the Baptizer John, whose appraisal of Christ’s worth made John feel as noted above, that generation was baptized with fiery destruction. But appreciative men and women who correctly appraised Christ’s role received the outpouring of God’s holy spirit with power and life. Appreciation meant surviving the end of that system of things. Appreciation today likewise means surviving the end of this system of things. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">This is no time for true Christians to conform to the old world. Now, more than ever, with the increase that God is bringing, this is the time to push forward and work hard for further increase by his blessing. What a fatal thing it would be for us, and what a dishonor to Jehovah God, were our profession of faith to become a mere empty formalism, we relinquishing our glorious treasure of service and degenerating into merely a sort of “churchgoer”! That is unthinkable! Yet, practically speaking, it has happened to an entire world of formalistic practitioners of religion of all kinds who have been deceived and who have deceived themselves into thinking that they can violate the righteous requirements of God, be out-and-out materialistic, follow selfish pursuits of the old world, conform to the old-world standards, beliefs and practices and yet, because they engage in some religious formalism, be Scripturally discharging their duty and responsibility to God and to man. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Be vigilant with a view to prayers.—1 Pet. 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Christians we are in the world but no part of it. We are, as it were, ship captains, sailing from this old world or system of things to the postArmageddon new world. Right now many of us seem to have smooth sailing and so there may be a tendency to relax our vigilance. But we dare not do so, for our sea is strewn with dangerous obstacles, put in our path by the Devil, the world and the flesh, which can easily cause us shipwreck, loss of integrity toward God. What does it mean to be vigilant? Coming from a root meaning “a watching,” to be vigilant means to be alertly watchful, to be circumspect, cautious, attentive to discover and avoid danger, or to provide for safety. “Vigilance implies keen, courageous, often wary, watchfulness, especially in the cause of right.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Webster)</span><span class="font0"> To be vigilant, therefore, is just the opposite of being careless, thoughtless or sleepy. Impressing upon us the importance of vigilance are the warning examples of God’s Word as well as its explicit commands such as that above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Son and of the holy spirit. —Matt. 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being baptized in the name of the Son shows the disciple’s appreciation of the Son’s nigh authority and position, both of which God gave him. The Son as ransomer of repentant humans must likewise be known by the disciple. He would have to respect the Son as God’s anointed, reigning King, besides acknowledging the Son as the everlasting Father to all who through nim will receive everlasting life upon earth. The learner also comes to know that the holy spirit is God’s active force, that force that supplies willing humans with understanding of God’s will and purpose. It is the same force that inspired God’s prophets of old to write his Word. It is the force that has been directing Christians from Pentecost on to our time. It is this same force that is directing God's visible organization today. It is likewise that force that upholds and activates God’s ministers at this time of the end and to which they render themselves in submission. Do you thus render yourself? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Among the symptoms of spiritual unbalance is a wrong view of material things. The unbalanced Christian will permit love of material things to get out of hand and drag him into a quagmire of debt. He does not wisely live within his means, but allows himself to become enslaved to material possessions. His secular employment becomes of greater concern to him than his spiritual employment. Even though his secular work interferes with his theocratic activities, he is unwilling to make adjustments to put spiritual things first. The material things mean more to him than his ministry and spiritual health. He puts God’s interests and his own spiritual welfare second to such things. He is walking, not as a wise person, but as the unwise, who does not watch how he walks. Ignoring Paul’s wise counsel, he shows himself to be unbalanced and is in danger of falling from the narrow way of Christian integrity. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 20, 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The sin of forsaking Jehovah is the sin of rebellion and is due to reliance on self or on the judgments of another human creature. On forsaking Jehovah, a servant of God would find himself without any spiritual water. (Jer. 2 : 13) And where there is no drinking in of spiritual truths, persons suffer from spiritual thirst, and the continuance of this leads to eventual death. Those who turn to counsel other than that which Jehovah gives will find themselves in an utterly empty and calamitous condition. (Deut. 28:20) In Jesus’ day, just before his time to be taken, some of his disciples murmured at what he said to them. (John 6:60-69) When a person no longer believes Jehovah’s Word, it means that by his leaning on his own wisdom or that of other imperfect creatures his attention has been directed away from the course of true wisdom. This marks rebellion. Back there the murmurers forsook Jesus at that time. Continual murmuring today will result in Jehovah’s forsaking us. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1 </span><span class="font0">13-16</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">There is no question as to what Jehovah’s will for us is; he has expressed it in his Word. It is to mold our lives to the pattern that will merit his approval. (Kom. 12:2) As our minds are filled with the truth, we cannot help but be moyed by an overwhelming desire to make known our appreciation to Jehovah God for his innumerable expressions of loving-kindness to his creatures. We count ourselves happy to be numbered among his servants and to give him exclusive devotion. As the psalmist long ago said, so we respond: “Laud Jehovah, for he is good : for his loving-kindness is to time indefinite.” (Ps. 136:1) If we held back, we would feel as Jeremiah, who said that God’s Word was as a burning fire shut up in his bones. We can show this desire to serve by dedicating ourselves to God, symbolizing that dedication by water immersion and then living up to it by continuing to do his will. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 4, 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">How can lovers of righteousness, real Christians, live in a clean world with clean people? By associating ourselves with men and women of integrity, the ones who are practicing righteousness and speaking the truth in their hearts. We nave the same Word of God that David had, only more of it. Many prophets were sent to God’s chosen people after David’s death and their statements were written down in God’s Word for our admonition and learning. In addition to that we have the life of Christ and the Acts of the Apostles and the writings of the disciples, and now these many scriptures make up the complete Bible, the whole Word of God, for all mankind to follow. Thus equipped we today should and could practice righteousness and speak truth and have confidence in our integrity toward Jehovah as David had I Studying and understanding God’s Word and living by it should assure us that we will not wobble. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 8,4</span></p>

He should be outstanding like a star in letting the light of the good news of God’s kingdom shine to the members of the congregation and to the other sheep, those already gathered in or those yet to be gathered to form one flock with the remnant. Of course, in a general sense, all members of the congregation must shine with spiritual light from heaven. (Phil. 2: 15) Specifically concerning this time of the end of the world God’s angel prophesied to Daniel: “They that are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.” (Dan. 12 : 3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ASV</span><span class="font0"> Yes, all wise members of the congregation should shine like stars, but their overseers especially so.

He has delivered them from the authority of this old world and its abominable conditions and has transplanted them into his New World organization of light, liberty and happiness. This wonderful saving power of Jehovah toward his people was displayed by his setting of the chosen King upon the heavenly throne in 1914 and by the victorious war that followed. Particularly since 1922 the Great Shepherd and the Right Shepherd have been speaking comfortably to the sheep. All these delivered ones sing the new song of their deliverance from Satan’s world into God’s New World society. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 4-6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah’s name has long been reproached by Satan and his agents. They have caused many to blame God for the people’s ills. Actually, Satan is the cause. Setting himself up as an angel of light and his present system of things as the long-looked-for kingdom, Satan has induced nearly all persons to turn aside from true worship. Jehovah’s name people must meet the challenge flung at true worship by handling the word of truth aright and by providing the people with the accurate knowledge concerning Jehovah and his purposes, and the opportunity of coming out of darkness into God’s wonderful light. The people who have been on a starvation diet of husks must be provided nourishing food from Jehovah’s storehouse. Jehovah has caused his faithful and discreet slave to provide this spiritual nourishment. All may partake “without money.” But having received this spiritual food, a serious obligation rests upon us to obey Jesus’ words: “You received free, give free.”—Matt. 10:8. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1 </span><span class="font0">5, 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Heb. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is the life goal of so-called economic security really worth taking our eyes off the prize of life? Not for a minute! We must provide the necessities of life and yet at the same time never take our eyes off the prize. Paul made tents to provide some of his necessities; yet he never allowed tentmaking to take his eyes off the prize. So Paul did not pursue the fruitless goal of economic security; he knew that possessions are of no value without life. Even those attaining “economic security” often come to realize what a fading prize they spent a lifetime to win. But not so those who, like Paul, spend their lives in pursuit of the prize of everlasting life. Paul manifested endurance ; this he owed to his singleness of purpose, which, in turn, he gained by keeping his eyes on the prize. For us to endure we must do the same. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 10-12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">No </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us.—1 John 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we would have God hear our prayers they must be in harmony with his will. Jesus both taught us to pray for God’s will to be done and himself prayed: “Not as I will, but as you will.” That condition is so logical and obvious that it seems strange that most persons praying overlook it-— yet, perhaps not so strange when we note how selfish and ill-advised most prayers are. Do not God’s purposes take precedence? Are they not far more important than any interests we personally may have? Besides, do not prayers often conflict, as in time of war? Regardless of his omnipotence and his omniscience God could not answer conflicting prayers. Moses’ prayers when Pharaoh and his armies threatened the Israelites, when his people had made the golden calf and when they rebelled at the bad report of the spies were heard because they were in line with Jehovah’s purpose to have a people for his name. But that was not true of Moses’ prayer to be permitted to enter Canaan. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 7-9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">If we are truly wise we will be diligent to copy the virtuous examples of those who remained immovable regardless of painful trials and seductive temptations. There is a great cloud of these inspiring examples surrounding us, and Paul mentions a number of them at Hebrews 11 :l-40. Chief of such faithful witnesses was Jesus Christ; and what a perfect example he is of one who steadfastly kept his place! We read of him that he “learned obedience from the things he suffered.” (Heb. 5:8) And if it was necessary in Jehovah’s allwise arrangement of things to prove whether his perfect and only-begotten Son would obediently keep his place under stress, how much more should we be proved, we who are so imperfect! Obedience to Jehovah is the prime requirement of those keeping their place. It is the only way to remain in the organization whose God is Jehovah. By considering Jesus’ example we are helped to endure, keeping our place in the New World society. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font0">3, 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Isa. 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is the most remarkable day of signs and wonders in all the history of mankind. We mean visible signs and wonders from the invisible God of the heavens, for all men to observe. His signs and wonders, understood, portend that we are standing at the threshold of a peaceable, happy and lifegiving new world. This is the grandest news, although it means that we are living at the end of the worry-filled, problem-racked, insane, loveless old world. We want the new. We are eager to leave the old. What religious critics of Christendom or secular historians may have said about the Divine Will assembly is immaterial. It is only before Jehovah God that this gathering must stand condemned or approved. Why? Because it was with the divine will as our theme that we more than 180,000 witnesses assembled there. If we concentrate on furthering the divine will throughout the earth, that assembly will serve as a sign and a wonder from him, something that no nation or people on earth does well to ignore. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 5, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The “righteous sprout” is Jesus Christ. (Jer. 23:5) He reigns and has acted with discretion and executed justice and righteousness in our land, in our spiritually restored condition here on earth. He makes spiritual Israel to dwell securely although we are in the midst of this world, which hates us. He is fulfilling the name of honor by which he is now called, Jehovah Is Our Righteousness. To us he has brought the righteousness of God. He is the King that liberated us from Babylon. He has shown that Jehovah God is with us and for us, and that we have a righteous standing with God. Because of our exclusive devotion to Jehovah and our uncompromising separateness from this world, we stand vindicated, for we have brought ourselves more and more into conformance with God’s Word and have refused to conform to this world. It is our highest desire to have a part with our King in vindicating Jehovah’s universal sovereignty. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1 </span><span class="font0">35</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Of all who won God’s favor and upheld his sovereignty, Christ stands out as the greatest appreciator of God’s gifts and privileges. He is the perfect example of appreciation. His life of gratitude to Jehovah for all his blessings is the very antithesis of Satan’s. From his creation he highly appreciated the truth that all he is and has is a gift from his Father. Jesus never meditated an ungrateful usurpation of God’s place as did Satan. He appreciated the privilege of being among God’s universal family and always worked with appreciation toward the vindication of God’s name, being obedient as far as death on a torture stake. In contrast to the position of Satan, the haughty ingrate, now debased and knowing he has but a short time, Christ, the humble appreciator, has been exalted to a position superior to that with which he began. He looks to an eternity of appreciative service to his God. Do our actions show that we appreciate the example he set for us? —1 Pet. 2:20, 21. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Especially on the last day of his earthly ministry as a man did Jesus resort to prayer. Knowing he would soon leave his followers, he earnestly prayed for them, as recorded at John, chapter 17. And foreknowing the immediate future he especially prayed for Peter that his faith might not give out. Then, just before the mob came to take him, Jesus prayed three times regarding his Father’s will for him. No doubt Paul had this particular occasion in mind when he wrote that “Christ offered up supplications and also petitions to the one who is able to save him,” his heavenly Father. Not that we are to think that Jesus shrank back from death, nor from the kind of death that awaited him. Had he not told his disciples he would be put to death as well as the manner of it? (Matt. 16:21; John 12 : 32, 33) Rather, we must conclude that his great concern was because of the reproach that the death of the Son of God upon a torture stake would bring to his heavenly Father, Jehovah God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Acts 20: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How did the holy spirit appoint those older men of Ephesus overseers? In the appointing of the Ephesian overseers it was sent forth from God as its fountain. The first intermediary through which it operated from heaven was the Lord Jesus at God’s right hand. At Pentecost its operation was accompanied by a noise just like a rushing stiff breeze and by tongues of fire sitting on the heads of each of the 120 Christian disciples into whom it came, to fill them and make them talk with languages that they had not learned. Like the wind or like radio beams, God’s active force was unseen, but what it produced was seeable and hearable. By filling Peter and the other apostles of Jesus Christ and making them teach fundamental things of Christian belief the holy spirit was, in effect, making those apostles foundation stones of the New Jerusalem and main overseers of the Christian congregation. It was through these as intermediaries that the holy spirit appointed others as overseers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 9-11</span></p>

The remnant of them are signs to the generation in this the time of the end of this distressed world. These young children above noted are those begotten of God’s spirit to become his spiritual children. These. Jehovah has given to Jesus, even as Jesus said at John 17 : 6, 9, 10. The heavenly Father gives Jesus 144,000 of these to be his brothers in the spiritual family of God and to be his associates in God’s work. What work? That of being signs and wonders on earth.

<p><span class="font0">A Christian will pursue godly devotion and not materialism. Only by being aware of this satanic philosophy can he light it successfully. He must be convinced that it is better to be in Jehovah’s organization than anywhere else. He should want to do nothing that would jeopardize his chances for life in the new world. Then he will have everything he needs. He does not need the finest of everything to serve Jehovah. But he does need Jehovah’s organization, and he should stick close to it. Jehovah through his organization has raised up a mighty bulwark against one of Satan’s most clever devices, materialism. Avail yourself of all the provisions Jehovah has made to fight this menace. Keep your mind and heart on the new world with all its grand expectations, in line with Paul’s words quoted above. Keep abreast of the ever-expanding New World society, and have a full share in the ministry today. This will make you spiritually strong, fully able to resist successfully the subtle encroachments of materialism. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus also was baptised and, as he was praying, the heaven was opened up.—Luke 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In regard to prayer, as with everything else, Jesus set for us the perfect example. His appreciation of this precious privilege stands out prominent-y in the record of his earthly ministry. In fact, it might be said that no other earthling ever appreciated prayer as much as he did. Even though perfect in mind and body and having supernatural powers at his disposal, he was not overconfident but always conscious of his spiritual need. He continually looked to his heavenly Father for wisdom and strength, as well as voicing his praise and thanksgiving in prayer. Thus at the very beginning of his earthly ministry e was fully conscious of his spiritual need and so communed with his Father, seeking his help. He was in dead earnest; no lightheartedness marked his conduct. Nor can we conclude other than that he spent much time in prayer during his forty days in the wilderness. So when Satan came with his subtle temptations Jesus was not caught off guard. He was alert, vigilant. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 15, 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Isa. 8:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To be of any value and guidance, signs and wonders have to be seen that they may be studied, that their meaning may be read and understood with God’s key of understanding. “As signs and as wonders” the remnant must be out in front to the view of the people. Then the greater Isaiah can say the words cited above. In order to back up those signs and wonders a “great crowd” must be out front with them. The anointed remnant are “my servant whom I have chosen.” (Isa. 43:10) This servant class has to be seen; it has to let itself be heard in order to be witnesses of Jehovah. And in order to join with the anointed servant class in the world-wide witness work, the great flock of dedicated sheeplike persons has to be seen and heard with them. We must all be out in the open, conspicuous, to be seen, observed, heard. This is no time to hole up because of the anguish, distress, fears and threats of the nations of this world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">There are some whose word cannot be relied upon. They will quickly make a promise and just as quickly break it. Since they cannot be depended upon to keep promises to fellow Christians, how can they be depended upon to keep promises to God? Does their agreement to do God’s will really mean anything? Being unfaithful in small promises, will they not be unfaithful in this most important one? An undependable Christian is unbalanced and cannot be of real service to God’s organization. He is the type of person who fails to fulfill an assignment for the service meeting or the ministry school. He will show the same irresponsibility when he makes promises to be at a contact for field ministry or when he tells a person of good will that he will call back. His promises are empty words. Because he is undependable in little things, overseers in the organization refrain from giving him greater responsibilities. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 22, 23</span></p>

Then you will stay away from the wicked people because you are busy maintaining your integrity. All who learn the truth and take a right path, dedicating their lives to God’s service thereafter, do as David said he did in the words cited above. Christians of integrity have set their course. They will not sit with men of untruth. They will not have prolonged discussions with men of this world except to preach the Kingdom. The interests of this world are not our interests. We have bigger and more important work to do. Those who sit in the counsel of wicked men and support their schemes always end up in ruin and misery. Let us be like the happy man who does not walk “in the counsel of the wicked” but takes delight “iu the law of Jehovah.”—Ps. 1:1, 2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 12, 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">What is the particular type of work that brings the surrender and destruction of one’s clothing when dismissal from work occurs for going to sleep at one’s post? It is the work that comes under the supervision and control of the heavenly One who issued the warning : “Look I I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments.” (Rev. 16 : 15) It is Jesus that speaks. It is in the manner in which his professed followers conduct themselves now that Christ is keenly interested. Are they faithfully imitating him, or are they disloyally, hypocritically misrepresenting him before the world? Are they lovingly serving him, or are they serving the interests of the enemy world? Are they alertly doing the work he commanded them to do, or are they asleep to their Christian obligations? These are the questions to which Christ has to learn the true answers, by coming upon his professed followers at a time not known beforehand. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 1, 2</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark431"></a><span class="font0">The dividing of the twelve tribes of Israel into two kingdoms put a great test upon the Israelites regarding loyalty to the kingdom covenant. But there were Israelites that put God’s worship and his kingdom covenant above nationalism. Thus the priests and Levites who served at Jehovah’s temple in Jerusalem but whose homes were located in fortyeight cities scattered about the twelve tribes of Israel made a record for themselves, as noted above. Likewise the Israelites who were living temporarily in Judah did not revolt and stir up civil war but submitted loyally to the king who represented Jehovah’s kingdom covenant with David. In fact, throughout the reigns of a number of kings of Judah faithful Israelites deserted to the kingdom of Judah, because its king was enjoying the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah. All these are examples for us today. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 21, 23, 24</span></p>

Knowing that there is much confusion regarding what is the divine will and that there are many sheeplike persons who want to learn what God’s will is, we found it a most suitable occasion for making some statement of what the divine will is and for voicing our determination to keep on doing it ourselves and to help other men of good will to do it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Ex. 20:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dedication means voluntarily setting oneself apart, to devote oneself to a deity, a sacred purpose, or a particular person, a principle, a science, a nation or even a chosen occupation or way of life. Dedication is of the greatest importance when one solemnly offers himself to God. That means making your will conform to the will of God. Dedication to God must be unconditional. It cannot be a divided dedication because such a dedication would be invalid in God’s sight. He requires absolute or exclusive devotion. The perfect example of making a dedication we find in the Son of God. His devotion was entirely single. He did not permit anything else to infringe upon it. On earth Jesus was acquainted with his Father in heaven, whose law he knew and loved. He was familiar with what had happened to those who violated their covenant relationship with God. Such knowledge caused Jesus to be all the more eager to conform his own will to the will of his Father. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 3, 4</span></p>

Prepare yourselves for greater privileges that will be assigned to you when you prove capable of carrying a heavier load of responsibility. To this end take in knowledge of the Scriptures, both by personal and by organized group study, which knowledge will make you wise for salvation. Study your assignments ahead of time and come prepared to take an active part in the congregational meetings. Grow to maturity in spiritual wisdom and understanding not only by diligent study but also by taking part in the various forms of ministerial activity. Learn how to call back on interested persons and how to conduct home Bible studies with them. Show due respect for your parents as well as toward the overseers in the congregation.

<p><span class="font0">Rebellion was the first act of sin. It resulted in the adverse judgment to those who followed a rebellious course. Now, because the first rebel is making his final stand against Jehovah and His loyal servants, using diverse and subtle means, it behooves all of us to scrutinize carefully our thoughts, motives, conduct and every form of behavior, so as to be on guard. In being on guard as to our thoughts, we should recognize that man’s judgment or conclusions are correct only when they concur with Jehovah’s as manifested through his Word. When they are at variance in any way, it discloses that there is a tendency to be guided by the thoughts of creatures. This is a form of rebellion. It may be only slight at first, but when continually tainted by the wayward thoughts and decisions of men, it can lead to the condition spoken of by James in the words stated above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1 </span><span class="font0">1. 2</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Thus it is Scriptu rally true that human go-betweens have been used in appointing many overseers of the flock of God. But without God’s holy spirit men can do nothing that really counts with God or that plays a real part in his organization. As in the case of the Christian congregation in apostolic times, in the first century, for any body of men to be used in the appointment of overseers and their assistants, ministerial servants, they must have the holy spirit in them, yes, be “filled with holy spirit.” (Acts 9:17; Enh. 5:18) This was true of the governing body at Jerusalem in apostolic times, of Paul and also of Timothy and Titus, who were given instructions regarding men qualified to be overseers and their assistants. They were all filled with the spirit and moved by it. Can it still be true that the holy spirit appoints overseers over the congregations of true Christians today?

<p><span class="font0">When David was a young man he was chosen by God to be king. From the time of his anointing by the prophet Samuel he had special responsibilities.

When reading Psalm 26 one sees David in his joyful worship of Jehovah contrasting himself with the wicked life of sinful men with whom he did not want to be classed. David did not want to be judged by men’s standards of living. He knew what sort of man he was, a lover of truth and right things. He was honest and blameless. His one desire was to give Jehovah exclusive devotion. He knew what God’s standards were and he pleaded to be judged by them, as seen from the words cited above. Such righteous judgment brought him happiness. He was content, satisfied. He had assurance that he was walking in integrity. Today is our confidence in our integrity as sure as David’s was?

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Ps. 97:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Only the best government in the universe is good enough for this earth. That is the way that the earth’s Creator feels about it. For this, all men of good will can be glad. We can be thankful that the Creator does not ignore his creation, even though this earth is so tiny in comparison with the universe. We can be happy that he respects this tiny creation as the work of his own hands and desires to dignify it with the best form of rulership. He wants it to reflect credit to him just the same as all the rest of the universe does. (Ps. 19:1) Letting God govern his earth according to his divine way is not only most practical but the most reasonable, because it is the most beneficial, lastingly beneficial. This is all the more true now, for God’s kingdom now rules —it has already begun to reign over our earth. All who want to enjoy endless life in peace, health and happiness must now bow to it willingly. For the “earth” and the “islands” to rejoice in that kingdom we must tell them about it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font0"> 1, 6</span></p>

Through these past forty years we have lacked no good thing. Regardless of the most terrible and fear-inspiring world conditions, Jehovah and Christ have protected their flock. And as a floek we have been led, continually conscious of the antitypical cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. The presence of Jehovah and his Shepherd-King has been with us. We have feared nothing bad. How favored our lot to have them as our Shepherds !

They would really be a hypocritical part of this old world. At the time that he comes like a thief to destroy the old world Christ must make inspection and find out what has to be destroyed. He must inspect the religious realm claiming to be Christian and separate the hypocritical from the true. That is why he has to come to the spiritual temple of God.

A righteous king, a good government, in fulfillment of the covenant that God concluded with King David. Never was there a covenant more important than this covenant made by God himself with the man David. This covenant is unbreakably binding. It must and will be fulfilled. It may seem almost unbelievable that the Most High God would make a covenant or solemn, binding contract with a mere man on earth. Yet God himself has provided us with the written record of his covenants with men. The one he made with David could be nothing trivial. It must be something highly important to God and beneficial to man. This is what dignifies the covenant. Everyone thirsting and hungering for a government of justice, peace and perfect integrity must wait for God to carry out that covenant to the full.

But had that proved true, and had God unleashed the foretold battle of Armageddon at that time, these spiritual brothers of the Greater Isaiah under their spiritual bondage to the worldly nations might have been destroyed with the nations. They might have been like Sodom and Gomorrah. But God long ago gave Isaiah a son named Shear-jashub, which name means “A mere remnant will return.” To fulfill that name, Jehovah had to give Jesus Christ, the Greater Isaiah, a remnant of “young children,” his brothers, who had returned to Jehovah’s organization.

No possession, no material belongings, should ever be allowed to become so important, so big in one's life that it takes our eyes off the prize. In today’s world, it is not likely that a single possession will take our eyes off the prize; it is the multitude of things, belongings, pleasures, hobbies and the anxieties of life.

By Jehovah’s undeserved kindness we have advanced from being mere Bible students. Studying the Bible and other publications of the Watch Tower Society that explain it is merely a means to an end. That end is not to develop beautiful personalities. That end is that we might be instruments of God for an honorable use by him, prepared for every good work. As we study, our desire to study increases and so also does our desire to share with others what we have learned. We realize that the days are wicked ; hence we must keep a strict watch as to how we walk, buying out the opportune time for ourselves, making the most of every opportunity to increase in accurate knowledge.

Especially will this be true at the Kingdom Hall, at the congregational book study, or in the homes of the people when we are witnessing from house to house or when we are calling back on sheeplike persons interested in studying the Bible. All this serving of progressive knowledge out to others pleasantly makes us stir up the knowledge in our own mind and impress it there; and the process of explaining it to others helps us to understand it better ourselves. It gladdens us at perceiving that we have a grasp of the progressive knowledge and have positively made it our very own, useful to us as educators of God’s Word.

(Matt. 14: 23) Before choosing the twelve apostles Jesus “went out into the mountain to pray, and he continued the whole night in prayer to God.” What an example for us to supplicate God earnestly when faced with making weighty decisions! Then again, it was when Jesus took Peter, John and James up into a high mountain to pray that the marvelous transfiguration scene took place. In answer to Jesus’ prayer? Undoubtedly! And instrumental in our receiving the model prayer was Jesus’ own example of praying, even as noted above.

<p><span class="font0">When we sit down to study let us have clear minds, putting aside other things for the moment. What are you thinking about now? Are you concentrating on what you are reading? Or are you preoccupied with things in your home or what you are going to do tomorrow? You are spending valuable time reading this. Then is it not wise to be practical and absorb all the spiritual things presented here? Think about other things when you are not engaged in theocratic study. This is just one example. The same principle can be applied to any meetings we attend for Bible study. We can cultivate the quality of concentration. We shall achieve this only by being more interested in what we are studying than in anything else. When one is very much interested in a subject, concentration becomes almost automatic. One can cultivate the ability to concentrate by reminding oneself of this fact each time one starts to study, having the mental attitude of the psalmist, as above expressed. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 19, 20</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">If we have allowed the cares of this world to choke our appreciation we must quickly take the sword of the spirit and cut loose from such entanglements. Let its inspired counsel show us what Jehovah expects of us; then ask his help through prayer that his spirit and truth may set us free. Our mature brothers will do all within their power to help us show appreciation to God, they having the same attitude as Paul. If complacency or apathy has made us susceptible to the plague of ingratitude that paralyzes the mind and hands and weakens the feet that should be working and walking to meetings and out into house-to-house Kingdom service, hasten to take corrective measures. (Heb. 12:12, 13) Avoid the mistake Demas made in highly appreciating the value of anything this world has to offer.—2 Tim. 4:10. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 13, 14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Heb. 10:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">David wanted clean hands and innocency before God so that he could worship before Jehovah’s altar. In his exgression: “I shall wash my ands in innocency itself, and I will march around your altar, O Jehovah,” he must have had in mind the copper basin that was set near the altar and that was used by the priests. (Ps. 26: 6) David, however, wanted to have hands morally clean, cleansed by God’s truth. Today anyone that comes to the place of worship, pictured by God’s altar, must be clean. He cannot be contaminated with old-world living and its sordid activity. What the priests did back there we must in reality do now. After speaking about cleanness, in the words quoted above, Paul further urges not to forsake the gathering of ourselves. Yes, we must assemble in these last days, but must always be clean in our worship, which includes our daily and lifelong activities. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 18, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The facts show that in the year 1914 God’s kingdom in the hands of his Christ was brought to birth in the heavens. We are therefore in the “times of restoration of all things of which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets of old time.” (Acts 3:21) Since 1919 God’s organization has risen up to let the light of his glory shine amid the gross darkness of this world, and the time has come for the fulfillment of his promise : “I will make thy chiefs peaceful and thine overseers righteous.” (Isa. 60: 1, 2, 17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">LXX ; Thomson; Bagster) </span><span class="font0">We are living also in the time of the final fulfillment of Joel’s prophecy quoted above, telling of the outpouring of God’s holy spirit. Therefore, even though we are living almost nineteen centuries after apostolic times ended and the miraculous gifts of the holy spirit passed away, we should still expect the spirit’s activity to include appointing overseers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font0">18, 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Among the things children must be taught as they grow up is respect for others. If it is required of the child at home, it will be natural outside the home. If it is practiced by the parents themselves, the children will have a good example to copy. Dependability is important. Children must be taught to accent responsibility. They should he taught how to think reliably and how to make proper decisions. Reason things out with them, impressing on their minds the Christian principles that guide right conduct, the harm that comes to one from wrongdoing, and the blessings that result from following the right course. Merely commanding them to “Do this!” or “Don’t do that!” will not achieve that goal. Proper development of these and many other traits is at least as important as proper growth of the body. Parents are entrusted with this important assignment.—Jer. 10:23; Prov. 3:5, 6. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9/1</span><span class="font0"> 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Incline your ear and come to me . . . and I shall readily conclude with you people an indefinitely lasting covenant respecting the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.—Isa. 55:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A study of this word “loving-kindness” will reveal that it means more than being kind because of a loving motive. It establishes a relationship between the one expressing loving-kindness and the receiver of it. It is a kindness that lovingly attaches itself to the object of the loving-kindness and that sticks to him with a loyalty that will not let go until the worthy purpose of the loving-kindness has been realized. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font0"> in its marginal reading gives the alternate reading “loyal love” for the Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hhdsed;</span><span class="font0"> for this Hebrew word in the plural it gives “acts (or, eases) of loyal love,” “full loving-kindness,” or “full loyal love.” A recently issued Hebrew-English lexicon suggests that these should read “continual proofs of loving-kindness.” This repeated proving of God’s loyalty is what makes it faithful. God always shows himself loyal; do we? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">You who are young, why not direct your energies into the full-time service? A Bethel branch home, Gilead School and the pioneer service are marvelous goals. Work toward one of them. In fact, the greatest heritage you parents can bestow upon your children is the desire to serve Jehovah full time. Youth also must resist materialism, and parents can help their children much along these lines. Those who teach their children respecting true spiritual values provide a splendid means for combating delinquency. Set a proper example by attending and participating in the meetings regularly. Remember, good training in the early formative years will provide a real foundation that will act as a mighty bulwark against materialism in later years. Yes, parents, instill in your children the appreciation expressed above and gain untold blessings for yourselves and your family. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 14, 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At his thieflike coming the awake Christians, would keep possession of their outer garments. (Rev. 16: 15) Those found asleep would lose their outer garments. Christ would remove their garments from them, leaving them to walk naked and expose their parts of shame in disgrace. To what place, though, is it that he comes? To the spiritual temple of God. That is to say, to both the true and that which falsely claims to be God’s temple. Let us understand the matter clearly as to the temple. To true Christians or true followers and imitators of Christ, Paul wrote the words stated above. The Jews’ temple in Jerusalem was destroyed A.D. 70. Since then the only temple to Jehovah in existence has been the spiritual temple, in which God dwells by his holy spirit. The spiritual temple is made up of living stones, Christ himself being the foundation cornerstone and his 144,000 chosen followers being living stones built on him. This is the temple to which he comes as Chief Overseer. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 3, 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">And I said: &quot;I am not going to make mention of him, and I shall speak no more in his name.” And in my heart it proved to he like a burning fire shut up in my bones; and I got tired of holding in, and I was unable to endure it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Jer. 20:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To keep our Christian balance we must have steadiness. We must have the same mental attitude as did Jeremiah when he said the foregoing and as did the apostle Paul when he exclaimed: “Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news!” (1 Cor. 9: 16) Both were truly steady in their ministry. No one had to call on them month after month to encourage them to be active in it. They were moved from within by their own love for God and zeal for his truth. The same must be true of us today. Those showing unsteadiness in the ministry lack good spiritual balance. They walk as if they are uncertain of where they are going. Such are irregular not only in the field ministry but also in their meeting attendance. They do not have the appreciation for service that Jeremiah and Paul had, neither do they appreciate the counsel at Hebrews 10: 24, 25, not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.—Rom. 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dedication means the start of a new mental attitude that from now on shapes one’s life course as a firm and willing doer of God’s revealed will. In this respect dedication marks a decision that must be carried out. When we dedicate our life to Jehovah we expect him to live up to his promises, and there is no question that he will do so. Jehovah, too, expects the one whom he receives to carry out his dedication. There is no such thing as a partial dedication; that is, to hold back, or deciding within one’s own mind to dedicate to God in any limited manner. Nothing may be permitted to jeopardize the completeness of our dedication. So, truly a serious responsibility accompanies this dedication to God. We may not be lulled into the frame of mind that preaching God’s Word is merely discretionary. It is an obligatory part of the assignment to work, just as it was in the case of Jesus Christ. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 14</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">That fact that he resurrected him from the dead destined no more to return to corruption, he has stated in this way: “I will give you people the loving-kindnesses of David which are dependable.&quot;—Acts</span><span class="font0"> 13; 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">O so much depended on that sole kingdom Heir, Jesus Christ! When he died and was buried, it looked as if at last a man of the house of David was to fail to sit upon his throne, which was the throne of Jehovah. Prophecy long ago foretold that the prince of the covenant would be broken by a contemptible person, Emperor Tiberius Caesar of Rome. (Dan. 11:21) Jesus lay broken in death. Seemingly it was an impossibility now to revive the kingdom covenant with David. Yet the real impossibility was for God Almighty to let his covenant fail. His loving-kindness, his loyal love, which was promised in the covenant and which was righteously due to this loyal Son of God, Jesus Christ, could never let the covenant fail. God’s resurrecting Jesus was an expression of loving-kindness in support of the kingdom covenant with David. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 8, 9a</span></p>

What a tremendous responsibility ! The souls of all the hundreds of thousands of sheep have been placed under the care of God’s shepherd class on earth, the faithful and discreet slave. That class must give an accounting to God for their shepherding work. Det us not think that those who compose the shepherd class treat this responsibility lightly. They know only too well that God and Christ are holding them responsible for the lives of the sheep. We are heing served and cared for today by God-fearing men who are aware that their treatment of us is being constantly considered by those in heaven, even as Paul notes above.

<p><span class="font0">That the spiritual temple is the place to which Christ must come appears to have support in his mention of staying awake and keeping one’s outer garments to avoid having to walk naked and let people sec one’s parts of shame. This could be a reference to a procedure that was followed in God’s temple at Jerusalem in the earthly days of Christ. In that temple the sons of the ancient family of Aaron served as priests and the Levites served as assistants. The overseer of the Temple Mount was accustomed to make the rounds of all twenty-four stations of the temple during the watches of the night. It was therefore necessary for each watchman to remain awake at his post constantly in order not to be caught off guard by the overseer. It was also necessary to open the door to another officer that w’as in charge of casting of lots for the temple services. According to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mishnah,</span><span class="font0"> if a guard was found asleep the overseer of the Temple Mount would beat him and even had the right to burn his raiment. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 7,10, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It is well for us to realize thoroughly that while the increase is certain, due to the fact that Jehovah brings it, it is for his own good purpose that he does so. Why does he grant prosperity upon his worshipers? Because they give glory to his name and because of his own name’s sake. That this beautiful prophecy finds no fulfillment in any political nation of earth is evident in the practices of such nations. And yet the prophecy is true. We see it fulfilled upon those who are in fact today the Israel of God, spiritual Israel, the Christian congregation. If we are to share in the blessings of today’s spiritual prosperity we must not merely be aware of the increase Jehovah is bringing, but be awake to its significance, be associated with it, be attentive to God’s truth. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> 4, 5</span></p>

It was not merely an international assembly, it was also an interracial one. In reality it was a Christian human family assembly. Despite the way they look on the surface or despite the difference in languages that they speak, they are all one flesh, created by one God and redeemed by one sacrifice, his Son. Furthermore, their basis for thus assembling together rested not just on their natural oneness of flesh; it rested more solidly upon their oneness of Christian personality, where “there is neither Greek nor Jew, . . . foreigner, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all things and in all.” (Col. 3:10, 11) That assembly was thus merely one mammoth manifestation of the fulfillment of Jehovah’s prophecy by Isaiah, as noted above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 5, 6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Today the spiritual remnant stand forth as a sign to all the world. Like Shear-jashub of old, they are a visible proof from God that the remnant has returned. They are physical, tangible evidence that Jehovah is faithful to his word and has fulfilled the prophecy long ago pronounced in his holy name, as noted above. All men should watch this remnant as a sign from God. Since they were liberated as a sign, they must serve as evidence, as indicators of something to all the nations in this time of the world’s end. They must stand forth as living proof that Jehovah is able by his holy arm of strength to deliver and save his people from the power of the enemy. To this end he had to send the remnant, to make them known to the ends of the earth. This he declared he would do in order that he might carry out a global gathering of sheeplike people from the four quarters of the earth. —Isa. 66:18-22. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 23, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Paul warned that after his going away a forsaking of God’s way would take place due to some relying upon their own understanding, and that these would lead a still greater number to do the same thing. (Acts 20 : 29, 30) Further, Jesus warned that in the last days there would also be a failing away. So let us be aware and vigilant lest we fall into the snare of drawing our own couclusions and turning to a course of rebellion. Pages and pages of the Bible have recorded information for the guidance of those who desire righteousness and want to follow a faithful course. Jehovah does not license man’s judgment to sway his organization on earth, but requires man’s complete acquiescence to his divine judgment. Exclusive devotion to him is our obligation in view of our having freely volunteered our servitude and dedication of life to him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> 16, 17</span></p>

In fact, we should prepare our presentations so that we can do this, knowing that we may often meet circumstances where this is necessary.

Obviously he had reached the end of God's long-suffering. Moses’ reasons were purely sentimental, for his presence in the Promised Land was not at all essential to the carrying out of Jehovah’s purposes, for had not Joshua been appointed to lead the people? There are some sobering lessons in Moses’ experience for us. One is that our petitions are more likely to be answered if they involve Jehovah’s name. Another is that Jehovah is not at all swayed by sentimentality but is motivated and guided by wisdom, justice and love. Helping to wean us away from all such self-centered sentimentality is the model prayer that Jesus gave us, for it puts first things first: the universal triumph of righteousness in the vindication of God’s name by means of his kingdom. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font0">9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">With already upward of seven hundred thousand persons, speaking more than a hundred different languages, all congregated as a New World society around Christ Jesus as the Right Shepherd, it is most important for each one to recognize his proper place in the organization, recognize whether he is of the remnant of spiritual Israel or of the great crowd associated with the remnant. That those constituting the great crowd must also bear a heavy load of responsibility Isaiah’s prophecy shows, for after describing the condition of the restored remnant it says that those of the great crowd would be as strangers that feed the flocks and as aliens that serve as plowmen and vinedressers. So whether of the remnant or of this great crowd, each one is accountable to the one Master to take his place in the fertile, fruit-bearing organization and then discharge the duties assigned. None are exempt from the King’s service, even as Paul shows above.—Isa. 61: 4, 5. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 5</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A great miracle of deliverance will be performed at the battle of Armageddon, when Jehovah will destroy completely the wicked system of things and at the same time keep alive men of integrity, whom he will remember for their acts of loving-kindness. God’s servants of integrity today feel just like Nehemiah, because we are living in the time of the purifying of God’s people. All the true servants of God want to continue in right worship and maintain integrity and be redeemed or delivered through that battle of Armageddon. We want to see the time come when there will be no more discord, wars, selfishness or corruption and when everyone will be praising Jehovah and blessing him. That will be seen in completion after the battle of Armageddon. By faith we look to and work for that happy day, but we start living by the standards of that day now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 24, 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Paul and Barnabas were chosen by a special conference of the governing body at Jerusalem to read a special letter of instructions to congregations in Antioch, in Syria and in Cilicia, to advise them that circumcision was no part of Christianity. As good messengers and general overseers, Paul and Barnabas read this organization letter to the congregations. They took their assignment of service seriously, knowing they were appointed not merely by men of the Christian governing body in Jerusalem but by the holy spirit. They had to view the matter this way because even in the letter that they read to the congregations the governing body composed of men put the holy spirit ahead of themselves. This applied, too, with their appointment of Paul and Barnabas. The effect of all this was to make the congregations “firm in the faith and to increase in number from day to day.”—Acts 16: 4, 5. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font0">14, 15</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">When we study, our motive must be pure and our minds open. Our purpose should be the learning of something for future use in serving God rather than wanting to boast in our personal knowledge because we can answer some Scriptural questions for our brothers. By having the proper attitude toward the treasured light we can gain God’s spirit, which is the way to the understanding of the Word that was written under its inspiration. Personal study is the foundation part of the life of the true minister of God. We cannot get along without it. Just as the strong physical man maintains strength through regular exercise and proper eating, so the spiritual man must exercise his mind by having proper spiritual food regularly. Busy though we are in ministering to others, we cannot neglect our personal study. For a little while we may get by with hastily taking in our spiritual food while on the run, but later on we will feel a loss. Time must be set aside for this personal study, making oneself think, and the schedule must be held to carefully.

<p><span class="font0">This requires constant study of God’s Word as well as the application of its principles. It acts like the balancing stick used by a tightwire walker. As the stick helps him maintain balance, so the Bible helps us to maintain balance while walking the narrow way of Christian integrity. At times forces in this world push and pull us, making it difficult for us to maintain spiritual balance. We may be pulled dangerously far one way by the world’s materialistic attractions or we may be pushed dangerously far the other way by worldly persecutions. In either case our integrity toward God is severely tried. Our ability to stay on the narrow way will depend on how well we cultivate our sense of spiritual balance and upon how skillfully we use the Bible as our balancing pole. With concentration and effort we can keep our feet steadfast and unmovable no matter how hard the world tries to topple us. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 4,</span><span class="font0"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jesus taught his disciples to seek the Kingdom first and impressed upon their minds the need of love and humility. He not only told them to pray to God but showed them now to do it. He taught them to rely on God, to accept the things that sustain life as provisions from God. He built up their confidence in the Scriptures as God’s Word by quoting from them and explaining them. To a Samaritan woman he explained that it would be wrong to limit the worship of God to some city or mountain, because “God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.” (John 4: 24) In view of man’s relationship to God, he pointed out that it is only right that man’s works should be done, not for self-exaltation, but to praise God. Jesus had come to glorify his Father and to help men of good will to see their relationship to Him; so he made sure that these points were deeply impressed on the minds and hearts of his disciples.

<p><span class="font0">Abraham heard God swear by his own self to this covenant. Of all persons we today should appreciate the importance and value of that covenant. We today ought to see that it is highly necessary that the nations should bless themselves by a God-given means. Today all the worldly nations, including the republic of Israel, are in effect cursing themselves by materialism and militarism. This is not because the promised seed is not on hand for nations to procure the promised blessing. No; it is rather that the nations have no faith in God’s own covenant with Abraham and they are selfishly and proudly ignoring his seed. The sheer folly of the nations in doing this is plain for everyone to see. The question therefore becomes one of personal importance: Who will procure the blessing by God’s means? Arc you sharing in the work of making this question known so that lovers of good government may bless themselves in Abraham’s seed? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 4-6</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The priests and Levites serving at God’s temple at Jerusalem foreshadowed Christ’s 144,000 victorious footstep followers. Today, after nineteen centuries, there is only a remnant of them still on earth, and the number of them grows less from year to year. To these in particular Jesus’ encouragement noted above is directed. However, since the year 1931 a great crowd of worshipers of Jehovah out of all nations have associated themselves with the remnant of the spiritual house. Revelation 7: 9-15 foresaw the incoming of this great crowd of sheeplike worshipers of God and pictured them as being before the throne of God and ascribing their salvation to Him and his Lamb and also rendering sacred service to God at the temple day and night. Because of this mention of temple service at night, they also can well take heed to the admonition to stay awake directed to the spiritual remnant of the holy priesthood. They do not want to be like those who fall asleep and lose their garments. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Our work as faithful shepherds is to make sure that the voice of the Right Shepherd is heard, and to do that we have to carry that voice into every place possible. The sheep are lost; we have to search for them and keep on calling out so they will know the Right Shepherd is near. They want him, but they have lost their way. If we knew just where to find them it would be comparatively easy. But we have to search for them in house after house, street after street, and city after city. There is really great happiness when they are found, even as Jesus noted in his illustration of the shepherd with his one hundred sheep, of which one was lost. Often it takes strength, time and money to keep on looking for the lost sheep, but O the joy when they are found! So keep on sounding aloud the message of Jehovah’s truth. You heard his voice and now yon are happy. So keep on looking for the other lost sheep. Be a fruitful shepherd and gain the Chief Shepherd’s approval. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font0">15, 16a</span></p>

When it is understood that studying in order to be a better servant of God is a basic “must” in life, then one will take sufficient time for it. So let us include it in our time schedule. Put it on the top of the list. And do not begrudge the time thus spent. Remember that we have dedicated our all, including our time, to the service of God. So let us jealously guard such time and see that it is used in a manner pleasing to its Owner. By thus taking our study seriously we will make progress, which will be manifest to all others.

<p><span class="font0">Dedication brings with it a heavy load of responsibility, and faithfulness in carrying this load is mandatory, not discretionary. It means willing surrender of personal selection of a course or way of life in order that God’s will may be done. Regardless of what may be brought upon us in the way of hardship, reproach, ridicule, persecution, torture or imprisonment because of our choosing to follow the course of Jesus Christ, through all such circumstances we must keep on doing God’s will, even as we agreed to do. We must therefore have a positive attitude as to our responsibility, eager to go wherever Jehovah sends us, even as was Isaiah. (Isa. 6:8) As we learn God’s Word and recognize this responsibility, we do not feel that the responsibility is too heavy. Nor may we feel cowardly about it or fearful that we will fail. Since we expect to live in God’s everlasting new world, we keep on obeying His Word that we fear not, appreciating that those having the spirit of cowardice will have no place in God’s new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Because we were conceived in sin we continually need to pray, “Forgive us our sins,” pleading on the basis of Christ's sacrifice. Since God is faithful and righteous to forgive our sins if we confess them, how foolish to bear the burden of sin’s guilt when we can be relieved from it through prayer, resolving to do better in the future! It is also God’s will for us to pray regarding rulers, “in order that we may go on leading a calm and quiet life with full godly devotion and seriousness. Not that we are to pray that these might convert to Jehovah’s pure worship in spite of their inclinations, but merely that they should not oppose our ministry. Such prayers are therefore not selfish. Included would be requests that God’s will may be done in legal cases being tried or pending. Regarding all such matters we may, yes, should unburden ourselves in prayer to God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15 </span><span class="font0">13, 14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Note here that Jesus shows that these persons have a wrong sense of values. They place too much emphasis on material things, to the complete exelusion of the spiritual, and it will cost them their lives. When a farmer sees that the weeds are crowding out his crops he fights for the very life of his crops, using every means available to him to root out and cut down the weeds so his crops might grow and bear fruitage. Further, if the weeds grow too high they can shade out the crop that is growing up. So too if we permit materialism to grow alongside the fruitage of God’s Word in our hearts, then it can easily be shaded out by materialism. Just as the farmer fights for the life of his crop, so we as Christians should fight for the fruits of the Kingdom ministry and not allow the weeds of materialism to choke them out or stunt their growth.

<p><span class="font0">This is the day of perplexity Jesus foretold. Faced with mounting problems, with the stubborn unwillingness of the powerful ones of the nations to co-operate, and with the dangers of modern warfare, the world leaders are perplexed. (Luke 21:25) Amid this world-wide perplexity there should be a message of solid truth to guide human society. Of all persons on the face of the earth, professed Christians should have the message that can enlighten all peoples in the gross darkness that enshrouds all nations, not excepting Christendom. “I am the light of the world,” Jesus said. To Christians who faithfully follow him he said : “You are the light of the world.” (John 8: 12; Matt. 5:14) He definitely said that his true followers would have the one and only enlightening, saving message for this day of perplexity. Long ago Jehovah promised to provide his worshipers with the all-important message which it is our privilege to spread to the four corners of the earth as illuminators.

<p><span class="font0">Amid the cares and distractions of modern life the Christian runner must maintain a singleness of purpose. And he must be certain he is making progress toward his goal. Paul had his goal in view; there was never any doubt of it. We must run with such determination to win the prize, with such singleness of vision. By reducing distractions we make time for concentrating on running the race and winning the prize. It is this matter of keeping distractions at a minimum that enters into so many facets of a Christian’s life. Paul knew that marriage brought many distractions; so he advised singleness as the better course because of its permitting constant attendance upon the Lord without distraction. Yet, on the other hand, Paul knew that passion was a distraction and that it could be a dangerous one; hence he wrote: “It is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion.” Trying to get away from distractions —that is basic in a Christian’s life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 18, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The rescue of Lot and his daughters was an illustration for our own day, for the sheeplike people who are being gathered into the divine favor. They need to depend so heavily upon that same loving-kindness, that same loyal love of Jehovah, to preserve them through the fiery destruction of the world organization that is spiritually called Sodom. These “other sheep” of the Great Shepherd need have no fear that his loving-kindness may fail. For as many as twenty-six times Psalm 136 alone repeats the reason for lauding Jehovah, saying: “For his loving-kindness is to time indefinite.” When he declared his own name before the prophet Moses on Mount Sinai at the writing of the Ten Commandments, he described himself as above. This God, who resents being misrepresented and who demands undivided devotion, is correct in every detail in thus describing himself.

<p><span class="font0">Tests of integrity must come. Look how Abraham was tested. He was told to offer his own son Isaac in sacrifice. Because Abraham showed integrity and obeyed, God provided a Iamb in place of Isaac. On a later occasion Jehovah tested his people, Israel, when he brought them through the wilderness. (Deut. 8:2, 16) Testing is necessary, but integrity and endurance are happy rewards. How many of God’s dedicated people today will endure these wicked days and maintain their integrity to the end ? Those who stand faithful and maintain their integrity will be saved. Forty years, as in Israel’s case, is a long time to prove one’s love for Jehovah more than for anything else. Could any of us stand a test that long? Many have done so, even in this day of Jehovah’s judgment. Meeting the test of integrity means life. Hence Abraham kept his living son. The Israelites went into the land flowing with milk and honey.

The governing body always seeks the guidance of God’s holy spirit in appointing responsible men as servants. They do not act according to any personal favoritism or any bias. The things that make an individual worthy of being made an overseer or one of the ministerial servants are stated in God’s Word, particularly in chapter three of Paul’s first letter to Timothy and in chapter one of Paul’s letter to Titus.

<p><span class="font0">Foreseeing the deadly plague of ingratitude sweeping the earth in these critical last days before Armageddon, God inspired Paul to warn of it 1,900 years ago, that men of appreciation might survive the end of a world without gratitude. Ingratitude is the very opposite of appreciation. Honest men must now turn away from an ungrateful world in order to survive its approaching end. To turn away from a world of ingrates we must cultivate appreciation for all that is good, upright and pleasing to God. True appreciation is much more than simple gratefulness. To appreciate something is to esteem its full worth, to feel a warmth of satisfaction and approval in regard to it. If we would avoid the plague of ingratitude we must show appreciation for the things involving God and true worship by becoming skilled in setting values. We must have knowledge, understanding, but, most of all, sound Biblical guidance as to what is really worth while.

Now is the time to respond to the invitation to partake freely of these spiritual provisions.

<p><span class="font0">The Israelites had many blessings during their trek from Egypt to the Promised Land. Many miracles were performed on their behalf, yet they murmured against Jehovah. As a result they lost confidence in Jehovah and began to lean upon their own understanding. In their grumbling they even said that it would have been better had they remained in bondage in Egypt. Their rebellious attitude should warn us today that we do not fall into the category of rebellion by murmuring against Jehovah or against his organization at this time. Paul in the words stated above admonishes us as to what would happen to murmurers, and definitely advises us to avoid murmuring. This was recorded so we today might avoid such a tragic course.

We should daily exercise the ability to say no to ourselves in little things, for without the daily exercise of the faculty of effort we lose the faculty of effort. By denying ourselves small things we develop the strength to say no to ourselves when big issues arise. Being faithful in little, we will be faithful in much. Our failure in little things sets the pattern for failure in big things. Inability to deny ourselves can cost us our lives. Yes, as Jesus went on to say: “Really, of what benefit is it for a man to gain the whole world and to forfeit his soul?” W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6/1</span><span class="font0"> 22</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A principal symptom of the lack of proper balance is the placing of social interests ahead of theocratic interests. Certainly the person who thinks his social activities must come before his duties in the ministry has an improper mental attitude toward his Christian responsibilities and obligations. His evaluation of what is important is warped. He is ignoring his promise to put God’s will first in his life. He foolishly puts personal entertainment ahead of his service to God. Social activities have their time and place, but they should not be allowed to infringe upon congregational activities. The balanced Christian will allot them a reasonable amount of time and attention, but no more. He will do the same with any hobbies he may have. At all times he will put his Christian activities foremost. All in the New World society should take a close look at themselves to see if they have this or any other symptom of unbalance. If a weakness is spotted, work on it! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 28-30</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—John 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do you want to be a true and faithful undershepherd and also an obedient sheep? If you do, then you must follow the Leader, Jesus Christ. Consider his course so that his steadfastness, humility and courage may become your example. In ancient times sheep were preferably entrusted to the care of the sons or daughters, and not to hirelings. For example, David cared for his father’s sheep and on one occasion delivered the sheep entrusted to his care from a lion and from a bear. (1 Sam. 17:34, 35) David was a true shepherd. His foremost consideration was to protect the sheep. The Lord Jesus Christ did just that for the flock of his heavenly Father, endangering and finally giving his own life for them. What a Shepherd ! He is the one whom we all look up to and joyfully follow. The Shepherd, who is also the Lamb, is adored by all who are God's sheep. How blessed we are to know these marvelous things.' </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 11, 9</span></p>

For our own good we must take an active part in giving comments. By thus keeping close to the organization and by helping others with their study of the Bible, we ourselves can be filled with accurate knowledge. And the more we use our knowledge of the truth the more we understand and have spiritual discernment, for it is through use that we have our “perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5: 14) Spiritual knowledge has been provided for us in abundance. If we have filled up our minds with accurate knowledge we know how to walk before Jehovah and please him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15 </span><span class="font0">22, 23</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">There are a large number associated with us who profess to be fully dedicated to God's service and who are free of binding Scriptural obligations, yet, for one excuse or another, they attempt to beg off from assuming the responsibilities that go with pioneering. May it not be said that these persons are out of their proper place in the New World society? Are they not out of orbit, wandering carefree off course, attempting to remain free of the restrictions and routine of full-time pioneer service? This is certainly a foolish and dangerous course to pursue, for it borders on the attitude had by those in Jesus’ illustration who begged off from attending a special banquet. They were so preoccupied with selfish interests that they passed up an opportunity of a lifetime! True, it would have inconvenienced them somewhat, but what surpassing joys and blessings they would have had if only they had made room in their lives for the extraordinary privilege offered them!

<p><span class="font0">The proud in heart are detestable to Jehovah because they are not seeking him nor the truth that comes from him. Their thoughts are only on how they can exalt themselves. They refuse to give praise to Jehovah. Pride, arrogance, haughtiness—all these are characteristics of the wicked. The proud in heart not only fail to seek God but they oppose him and persecute his servants. Thus proud Pharaoh hotly pursued the Israelites, and that to his own destruction. Pride, in fact, lays a foundation for all kinds of wickedness, yes, to the reprehensible wickedness of teaching false religion, as Paul shows at 1 Timothy 6: 3-5. No wonder the proud, those puffed up with pride, are so offensive to God I But why so many warnings about pride if it is the eharacteristic of wicked ones? Because it can crop up in a Christian’s life and prove disastrous, because pride is a part of the old personality that must be put off if we are to run according to the rules.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Rev. 16:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the ancient temple of Jehovah at Jerusalem the priests had to wear drawers of linen, that their private parts might not show at any time, in any position, during their ministryin the temple. What, then, are the outer garments that the remnant of the holy priesthood at the spiritual temple wear and should keep possession of? Since failure to stay awake at one’s post of duty during the night was punished with the loss of one’s post of service at the temple and resulted in the disgrace of nakedness, the outer garments picture the insignia or the distinguishing marks or evidences of one’s holding the honorable office of being a servant of God and a fellow minister with his High Priest at His temple. The outer garments denote the honored service of being a witness of Jehovah, rendering public service to him at his temple. Such garments are a gift from God and hence can be taken away by God for the wearer’s not living up to responsibilities of his sacred office. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Not those who failed do we seriously consider to grasp the meaning of dedication ; but the long line of strong, faithful, courageous conquerors the Bible mentions. In their life course we see patterns worth copying. We can be just as determined as they were. We can be obedient servants of God as they were. Early Christians, including Christ’s faithful apostles, were anything but fearful. Then there were also men like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and David, and women like Sarah, Rahab, Deborah and Jael, as well as many others in that long line of courageous covenant-keeping witnesses of Jehovah that extends back to the very time of righteous Abel. They had a strong anchor of hope in Jehovah's supreme power, even to his resurrecting the dead, as Paul shows at Hebrews 11. Such we pronounce happy, and having a like strong faith will cause us not to fear the enemy even though it might cost us our physical life at this time. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Certainly Christ Jesus is with his people now in seeing to it that this good news of the Kingdom is preached and that the disciphng work is going on in a teaching manner in all parts of the earth. People are being taught, not only preached to, concerning the Kingdom; studies are arranged in the homes of the people and they are taught God’s Word. Paul informed Timothy, ‘You must be qualified to teach.’ So we must equip ourselves to do the same. Each individual Christian is going to be a teacher as soon as he can and therefore must be well versed in the Scriptures. His own integrity must be established through good works, study and service, and he must sometime be able to say as did David: “Judge me, 0 Jehovah, for I myself have walked in my own integrity.”—Ps. 26: 1. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Like the congregation, of ancient Ephesus, congregations today may have deeds and hard work and a record of endurance to their credit. They may not have put up with evil men, but have gone back to the apostolic teachings and ways of doing things by putting up a hard fight for the faith. For years they may have borne up for the sake of Christ’s name and not grown tired. But the question is, Have they left the love they had at first? Because of increasing lawlessness has their love grown cold? Has it been alienated by this materialistic old world ? Have they tired of showing affection for Christ, which calls for feeding his sheep and having the mental attitude that was in him? Christ holds it against them if they have left that heat, zeal and undividedness of the love that they had at first. If so, they need help to get back to where they were and to recover what they lost. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A tightwire performer concentrates on keeping his balance. He well illustrates the Christian who is walking the narrow way of Christian integrity. To stay on it he must develop good spiritual balance, just as the tightwire performer must develop good physical balance to stay on his wire. As one slip can be disastrous for him, so can it be for the Christian. A safety net stretched far beneath the performer can save his life, but he has a long climb to get back to his wire, and when he reaches it he may be so shaken that he has difficulty regaining his confidence and sure-footedness. One who loses his balance and falls from the way of Christian integrity that is high above the world’s swamp of improper conduct may save his life by sincere repentance. But his climb back is a long and very difficult one. Some who have fallen have not been able to make it. The course of wisdom is to avoid falling in the first place. But this requires good spiritual balance on the Christian’s part and constant attention to how he walks. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 1-3</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">We should not overlook how closely related to each other prayer and love are. Does not the precious provision of prayer reveal God’s love for us? On the other hand, love on our part causes us to appreciate what God continually is doing for us and will make us want to go to him frequently in the spirit of praise and thanksgiving and to linger in his presence. As the minds of lovers keep reverting to the object of their love, so, as lovers of Jehovah, our minds should keep reverting to him and his goodness whenever not occupied with things that require attention and application. And especially when deeply stirred because of some blessing received will love cause our hearts to overflow in spontaneous expressions of praise. So let us “in connection with everything give thanks.” If we find exquisite delight in Jehovah we will be continually praising Jehovah, yes, ‘seven times a day.’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 20, 22a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">When we look at the organization that has God’s holy name called upon it and that works hard to make the people remember His name, we can discern that Jehovah has raised up the promised faithful shepherds. He has raised up faithful, conscientious overseers along with their assistants. By these he has fed his sheep with spiritual food and led their steps into the paths of the right Christian activity and the right worship of the true God. These have led the members of the congregations out into the field to find and gather together all the sheep whom Christendom’s clergy have left to wander and to stray. Thus they have led all the flock of Jehovah’s witnesses into all the inhabited earth to bear witness to the grandest event of all time, the setting up of God's kingdom as the capital organization of the universe, for God’s vindication and for mankind’s blessing.

<p><span class="font0">In harmony with their function as signs and wonders, Jehovah has thus commanded his remnant. The signal that they raise up is the message of God’s kingdom. Already among 170 nations this Kingdom signal has been raised. Hundreds of thousands of sheeplike persons, “other sheep,” have beheld this upraised “signal.” With joy they have hailed it. They have assembled under it, giving their undivided support to God’s kingdom and placing themselves under its protection and under its commands. They have taken up the only worship that this heavenly kingdom authorizes and permits, the lofty worship of Jehovah God at his spiritual temple. Their gathering is a world-wide sign of the last days of this world, for in its time of the end is when Isaiah foretold that that would occur. (Isa. 2:2-5) So these “many peoples” associate themselves with Jehovah’s signs and wonders.

<p><span class="font0">Today there is merely a remnant left on earth of the spiritual men of loving-kindness or men of loyal love, that is to say, men who are pious or dutiful in performing their obligations to Jehovah. During World War I they fell short and so God became incensed at them and let them come into captivity. Why did he not cast this remnant off during World War I because of their shortcomings under the trials and persecutions of that time? Because of his loyalty to his covenant. Through Jesus Christ he had taken the members of this remnant into the kingdom covenant. Hence he obligated himself to express the loving-kindnesses to David that were promised in the covenant. (2 Sam. 7:14-16) While letting them suffer the blows of the sons of Adam, in 1919 Jehovah delivered the remnant who at heart wanted to be loyal to him. Then he set them to work as his witnesses to an extent never before known. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1 </span><span class="font0">12-14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">33: 6, RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A watchman who falls asleep cannot see or note the approach of danger to the city and so cannot sound the alarm and awaken others to the approaching danger. When Jerusalem was about to be destroyed by the conquering armies of Babylon, God warned Ezekiel, whom he had made a watchman to the endangered Israelites. Ezekiel was told to stay awake and keep on the watch and warn the wicked who were threatened with the sword of destruction. He did so. Unfaithful Jerusalem fell, the wicked ones died in its destruction, but Ezekiel kept his prophetic, ministerial “outer garments.” The watch of ministers is over precious lives or souls, as is emphasized in the instruction to Christians: “Be obedient to those who are governing you . . . , for they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will render an account.”—Heb. 13:17.

<p><span class="font0">When, now, the governing body designates overseers that meet the Bible’s plainly stated requirements, it is really the holy spirit that leads to the appointing of such overseers; it is really the holy spirit that makes such overseers. This fact becomes more evident when we note that it is also the fullness of the indwelling of the holy spirit in the candidate for the office of overseer that influences his appointment. The candidate must show that he is filled with the spirit by the way he conducts himself and his family (if he has one). He must prove that he has holy spirit by bringing forth its fruitage, which is “love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control,” and by impaling the flesh together with its passions and desires. (Gal. 5:22-24) He must show that he is moved, impelled by God’s spirit to take oversight over his flock of sheep. In illustration of this, note the reasons given above for selecting Stephen for service. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 22</span></p>

The increase must not result in our conforming to the old world. Large size must not result in our becoming just formalistic “churchgoers.” The increase in numbers must not result in complacency on our part, because we are not like idols, nor are we as the idol worshipers. (Ps. 115: 4-9) We have mouths, eyes, ears, noses, hands, feet and throats, and as Jehovah’s servants we must be alive, using our faculties and resources to the continued advancement of true Christianity, continuing to stand separate from the old world, bearing faithful witness to God’s name and his kingdom, to the blessing of our fellow man and to the praise of our God, who “is in the heavens.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> 8</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Murmuring on the part of one who claims to be a faithful dedicated servant might mean the beginning of a rebellions attitude and would cause one who indulges in this form of rebellion to suffer discipline eventually, if such a course is continued. Jehovah was displeased by the rebellious spirit manifested by his people in times past, and he made his feelings in the matter known so that those who would persist in such a course today might know for a certainty that they would come under his disfavor. “Neither be murmurers, just as some of them murmured, only to perish by the destroyer.” (1 Cor. 10: 10) A murmuring campaign against Jehovah or any part of his organization will not be tolerated. Those who have the oversight in the congregations are obligated to take action against those sowing discord by their murmuring and course of rebellion. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> 26</span></p>

In order to discharge it we must excel in learning, doing this whole-souled as to Jehovah and not to men. To bring to spiritual maturity the many persons of good will daily associating themselves with the New World society, we must do our utmost to qualify as workmen “with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of truth aright.” Regular attendance at congregational meetings, to listen and to learn Bible truths, and also regularly sharing in meeting the cost of maintaining the meeting place—these are fine acts of faith. But to wiu God’s approval more is required. May we be satisfied with attending meetings and just listening, letting others do all the work of communicating and explaining to still others the good things heard and learned? No, we must make public declaration of our hope in our meetings, inciting our brothers to love and right works. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1 </span><span class="font0">20, 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Not only did Jesus point to this commandment; he demonstrated it. He felt compassion for the crowds to whom he preached because they were skinned and knocked about like sheep without a shepherd. His heart went out to them, and that love attracted those who were of a righteous disposition. So we will be recognized as Jesus’ disciples if we manifest the enduring quality of love. With godly concern for the sheep let us therefore return to homes time and again, urging the inhabitants to become reconciled to God. True, we may have been coldly turned away or had the door slammed in our face the last time we were at a home, but love is long-suffering. It does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury. And since it is love that moves us to call on them, when we make repeated visits we should be just as eager to help them gain life in the new world as we were on our first visit. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Pull up materialism by its roots, exposing it to the scorching light of God’s Word and thereby cause it to wither away and die. Fight it lest it make inroads. Because it is so subtle it can easily make inroads and often goes unnoticed until it has a powerful grip on us. Hence the value of recognizing its symptoms so we can prevent its getting started. God expects us to provide the necessary material things, and we should not confuse that with materialism. As Paul shows at 1 Timothy 5:8, we must face up to the proper and Scriptural obligations we have and discharge them. Any other course would be displeasing to Jehovah and a violation of his Word. The point we want to keep in mind, though, is the one that Jesus makes in the words quoted above. So we must honestly distinguish between the providing of the necessary material things and going beyond that by leaning toward materialism. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1 </span><span class="font0">8,9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The time is now here when integrity keepers stand upon a level place, an open plain, where there is no more fear of stumbling and where true worship can be carried on. So in real happiness with all of God’s people we can say the words quoted above, as did David. In this frame of mind we look forward to Armageddon and the complete establishment of God’s new world of righteousness. Until that day arrives we will stand on a level place among the congregated throngs and bless Jehovah. Whatever troubles and persecutions may come from the evildoers, we will continue to say: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.” (Ps. 26: 11) Not only will we go from house to house preaching, but, when invited into the homes of the people, there we will teach them the truth, for our desire is to gather out from all nations all the sheep who love righteousness so that they too may join in praising Jehovah in the congregated throngs. These too must gain confidence in their uprightness. Will you be one of these prais-ers of Jehovah, walking in your integrity during the coming year? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 27, 28</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rejoicing because they had been counted worthy to be dishonored in behalf of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■—Acts 5: 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under Jesus’ perfect instruction all but one of his apostles became like their Teacher. The eleven and Paul all proved to be men of appreciation in every sense of the word. They suffered much for the truth and for the sake of the good news, but did tribulation stifle their gratitude? When the Jewish Sanhedrin flogged the apostles and released them under the charge to give up their preaching, did they reappraise their privilege downward? No, but “every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup” to teach and preach. No mistake about it, the apostles had appreciation. They did not overvalue self, nor money nor pleasures. They had gratitude for God, for Christ, for the value of godly devotion, and they proved true to its power. To these examples we may always turn with profit, particularly when a modern world without gratitude urges us to stop sharing in the final witness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Unstableness manifests itself in persons who are not firmly grounded in Scriptural truth, who are spiritually immature. Such ones reveal by their actions and decision that the truth is not in their hearts even though it may be in their heads. Because they have a head knowledge of it they are able to give fairly good comments, but their hearts are untouched. They are not moved to be guided by Scriptural principles in everyday living. They show a lack of faith in the wisdom of God’s Word. They are like the one James wrote about, ‘indecisive, unsteady in all his ways.’ The unstable person permits his own wisdom and passionate desires rather than the wisdom of God’s Word to influence his decisions. Unwisely he fellowships with persons outside the New World society who have no interest in doing God’s will. Thus he is like the Israelites who fellowshiped with the Canaanites contrary to God’s explicit instructions. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font0">12, 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In weighing the matter of dedication a person might think, ‘I love God and will serve him. But as for complete dedication, I just cannot do that.’ At first such may be one’s thoughts; but if a person is in that frame of mind, then he should continue studying, taking in accurate knowledge, because more mature thinking will help him to reach the proper decision. This is truly a vital decision, the full impact and importance of which can be summed up in Jesus’ words stated above. In their context Jesus showed that dedication requires that we soberly count the cost of taking such a course and holding to it to the finish. Nothing should be permitted to interfere with dedication. This can include the wife of a man, or the husband of a woman, or a family or anything else of this world that might be held dear. Dedication of oneself to Jehovah must be unequivocal in its scope. The person is duty-bound to render exclusive devotion to Jehovah.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Shepherd the flock of God in your care, not under compulsion, but willingly, neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly, neither as lording it over those who are God's inheritance, but becoming examples.—1 Pet. 5:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each undershepherd should let these words sink deep into his mind and should go over them time and again until he has made them his own, because this exhortation by the apostle must be obeyed by every shepherd in God’s organization. Otherwise he will be disqualified and disapproved. The dedicated brothers are God's flock. They are his inheritance. A great trust is confided in shepherds who are given the care of God’s flock. These sheep have been redeemed by the precious blood of God’s Lamb; so they are a purchased possession, a treasure owned by Jehovah. The sheep are not the property of the undershepherd, but are placed in his custody by the Chief Shepherd. Therefore they must be cared for as something done to God himself. All overseers over any part of God’s flock must realize the tremendous responsibility to God and Christ W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">3/15</span><span class="font0"> 1, 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I know my sheep and my sheep know me.—John 10:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As we carefully study Jesus’ method of instruction we will be happy to find our own teaching ability improve and our fruitfulness in the ministry increase. We should not expect that all will listen; not all listened to him. But the sheep recognized his voice and followed him because he is the Right Shepherd. If we teach the things that Jesus did and in the way he did, then through us the sheep will also be able to recognize the voice of the Right Shepherd and will eagerly turn and follow, not us, but him. It is one thing to tell another person, to preach to him; it is quite another to teach a person, to help him understand and believe. Jesus patiently taught his disciples about the Father, because he knew that their taking in knowledge of God would mean life. “The fear of Jehovah is the start of wisdom.” (Prov. 9:10) When they came to know Jehovah and have a proper fear of him, they would show wisdom, they would know what to do with the things they learned, because wisdom is the ability to use knowledge aright </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font0"> 3, 4a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Have you seen a man wise in his own eyes'? There is more hone for the stupid one than for him.—Prov. 26:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All of us today, even those not in positions of responsibility, can benefit from the experience of Uzziah. There is no reason to experience personally the crash that follows pride.' How does one benefit, then? By guarding against presumptuous actions, saying or doing things out of self-importance that one has no business to. Keep your place in the theocratic organization, never letting pride cause you to run in the wrong course, one leading to a crash. Correction and discipline come to all God’s servants. If we belittle the discipline that comes from Jehovah through his organization, refusing to take reproof in harmony with his Word, then we are like Uzziah, who stubbornly refused to let the priests deter him from his presumptuous course. So when correction comes from Jehovah’s organization, benefit by it. Do not justify yourself, do not be wise in your own eyes. Discipline, though at first grievous, yields peaceable fruit, righteousness and life. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15 </span><span class="font0">10, 12a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">There is need for all of ns to continue advancing to greater maturity for our own good and for the benefit of those we serve in the ministry. Millions of people have come into captivity to lies and are spiritually sick. We have been sent forth to carry the healing spiritual light, and as we increase in accurate knowledge we become more skilled in our work. We become more versatile, able to discuss many subjects and overcome many barriers. Like proficient doctors we are able to discern the spiritual ills afflicting the people and appropriately minister to them. Just as no one medicine can be prescribed for every type of physical illness, so we must determine how we are to remove the stumbling blocks in the way of the peoples of many religions. One sermon on one subject may serve for a certain group, but the advanced minister has a ready answer for every man.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">28:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When are the “outer garments” of the ministry at the spiritual temple bestowed? (Rev. 16: 15) When one believes in Jehovah as being the only living and true God and accepts his provision for salvation through Christ and then lovingly dedicates oneself to God in order to worship and serve him forever. The dedication being accepted, God takes the dedicated one into the sacred ministry and clothes such a one with the outer garments symbolizing his being in the ministry at God’s temple; and Jehovah bestows recognition upon the dedicated Christian by giving him sacred privileges of service. Foreshadowing this, the priests of Israel were clothed with official garments to denote their sacred appointment of service. It is an honor to wear the figurative garments of the true Christian ministry at God’s spiritual temple. Jesus was thus figuratively clothed when he went about on earth preaching the good news of God’s kingdom among the uncircumcised Jews. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 14, 15</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark434"></a><span class="font0">Although we live under differing forms of human government and different political rulers, we will not permit men who fight against God to break up our unity or to separate us from the theocratic organization. Rather, we will persist in praying for one another and will carry out the Scriptural instructions in an irreprehensible way. And even when persecution may get more intense and we may be scattered physically or be driven underground or deprived of our Bible-study literature, we will keep on obeying God rather than men and will preach the good news of the Kingdom, the only Godgiven hope of mankind, by the use of our Bibles alone, if necessary, or by just that divine Word stored up in our hearts. We will, in all these respects, strive to keep the commandment spotlessly, like our faithful brothers who today find themselves under totalitarian government and dictatorship and for whom we do not cease to pray. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">11/1</span><span class="font0"> 23a course of time any overseer turns out bad, we must remember that Judas Iscariot, whom Jesus himself selected, turned out bad, betraying his own Overseer, the Chief Shepherd, to his enemies to be killed. This required Jesus, after his death and resurrection and after the outpouring of holy spirit on the day of Pentecost, to select a different man to “take his office of overseer.” So today another man that has for some time shown the desirable qualities and the necessary good points must be put in office to replace the overseer that turns out bad.

<p><span class="font0">The people and the nations must know that we have been among them to give them solemn warning of their end. This may expose us to their abuse and persecution. Yet, like the apostles, we must become a theatrical spectacle. What, then, if we are talked against and opposed as a sign or are challenged because of our preaching the straight truths of the Bible? We know who is backing us up. It is Jehovah of armies. It is from him that we have the remnant of signs and wonders today. Hence he will see to it that what these signs and wonders mean and indicate is truly fulfilled. Since Immanuel is with us because we are preaching the good news of the Kingdom for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> final witness to all the nations, we know that God is with us. With such divine help and according to the divine will, we are certain to finish successfully the wonderful and significant work that Jehovah of armies has sent us to do.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">61 : 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The remnant have been anointed not only to call out Jehovah’s year of good will, which symbolic year has now almost ended, but also to call out the day of ‘vengeance of our God,’ which day is getting ever closer. In proclaiming the speedy coming of this day of God’s vengeance with its spoiling of the whole world by his King Jesus Christ, the anointed spiritual remnant have taken on the sign features of Isaiah’s son Ma'her-shal'al-hash-baz. They are proclaiming “Hasten, O spoil! He has come quickly to the plunder.” Multitudes of sheeplike meek people have seen and heard this sign and wonder and have read the meaning of it correctly. In the fullness of their belief and conviction, they have taken their stand alongside this remnant of Jehovah’s modern-day “signs” and “wonders.” More that that, they have taken up the message of God’s vengeance and have given it an increased spread to all the nations.

<p><span class="font0">The loyalty of God to the one whom he takes into the covenant with himself proves to be faithful, unfailing. This helps the covenant to stand firm no matter what the other party to the covenant may do. This makes it certain that the purpose of the loving-kindness will not fail in disappointment. Let this fact stand to His honor and credit: Jehovah God is loyal. The record of the loving-kindness of the great God who preserves his faithful worshipers glows with a comforting warmth. When it was first mentioned, Lot lived in the wicked city of Sodom. Lot was loyal to the two angels of Jehovah who came under his roof and, in turn, his surviving of the destruction of Sodom was a magnifying of Jehovah’s loyal love, for Lot’s uncle primarily, for with him Jehovah had made the covenant for the blessing of all the families of the earth. The. other sheep today are like recipients of Jehovah’s loyal love. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 10-13</span></p>

He should neither obstruct nor permit any obstruction of our march successfully to our destination beyond the battle of Armageddon. He must examine himself constantly that he does not commercialize his prophetic position, his responsible and impressive office. He must guard against the infiltrating of sex worship from this world and the creeping in of religious sects. Anyone guilty of such things needs to repent, yes, repent without delay, for quickly Christ is coming to execute divine judgment. In his mouth he has the power of second death for any who let themselves be overcome, by this world. 11’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font0"> 15, 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The same principle applies today. When parents learn that their children have fallen victim to an immoral relationship with one of the opposite sex, sometimes they are reluctant to report this to the ones who have the obligation to keep the organization clean from such practices. Thus the parents become parties to a lawless course of action because the one involved is their own flesh and blood. This close relationship,. however, should have no bearing on justice. The deed should be reported to the responsible ones in the congregation, even if it is one so close as one’s own child. If one in the congregation is acquainted with such a situation and fails to report it, he becomes a direct party to it, and then he too is sharing in a course of rebellion. Wrongdoing has no place in Jehovah's clean organization, and a faithful servant will not condone it by remaining silent and failing to report it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> 34</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Being afraid of public opinion is a manifestation of unstableness and indicates a lack of balance. This is commonly seen among children who are painfully concerned over what their classmates or age group think and say about them. They dress, cut their hair, talk and act as others do. Their fear to be different makes them slaves to conformity. What difference does it make what others say or think? What if we do stand out from the crowd because we. do not go along with them in everything they think and do? What does it matter if others think us peculiar for holding to Christian principles? Their opinion means nothing, but God’s opinion means everything, for he can give us life; they cannot. The stable Christian will not permit the fear of what others think or say make him conform to the crowd. He will stand firm for Christian principles and keep his balance regardless of adverse popular opinion.

<p><span class="font0">Today, as never before, we have need to be alert, watchful and vigilant, for our three enemies, the Devil, the world and the flesh, are placing ever more obstacles in our way. We dare not become overconfident because of the great expansion of pure worship. On the contrary, since “the complete end of all things has drawn close,&quot; wc have increased need to take to heart all the warning examples and explicit commands in the Scriptures regarding vigilance. How can we keep vigilant and watchful, avoiding the snare of overconfidence? How? By being ever conscious of our spiritual need. And why does being conscious of our spiritual need keep us vigilant and protect us from the snare of overconfidence? Because, among other things, it makes us diligent to study God’s Word together with the aids he has provided for understanding it, knowing that we live, “not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” That Word contains much warning admonition, helping us to keep vigilant.

<p><span class="font0">A great aid to keeping awake is filling our minds with new things that we will want to serve out to others, to all those with whom we come in contact, by reason of enjoying them so much ourselves. Another powerful stimulant to wakefulness and to keeping active in the ministry and alert to what is going on and to what it means is our regularly meeting together with progress-minded fellow Christians who are worshiping at the same spiritual temple of Jehovah. The fact is, our attending meetings with fellow worshipers is commanded by Jehovah upon his worshipers. The day of the final inspection by the High Priest of Jehovah and the execution of judgment at the universal war of Armageddon is drawing closer and closer.

<p><span class="font0">To safeguard against losing our privileged place in the New World society, we should observe and avoid the pitfalls into which others have fallen. Do not let rebellion against Jehovah take root in your heart as did Satan. Do not challenge God’s channel of communication as Korah, Da-than and Abiram did, lest you lose your place among those who will live in the new world. Do not risk disfellowshiping by secretly coveting forbidden things as did Achan. Do not lie to Jehovah or his appointed servants as .Ananias and Sapphire did, lest you drop out of place as quickly as they dropped dead. Do not betray God's organization to agencies of the Devil’s organization as' Judas did. That too is suicide. All these foolish persons lost their places in God's theocratic organization. And do not so much as even look back, the way Lot’s wife did, to lose both her place and her life. Be on guard, therefore, and walk circumspectly, in order that you do not stumble over some unforeseen obstacle and fall out of God’s favor.

Hence it is the generation that will see the end of this old world, just as it was in the days of Noah. As Noah and his arkload of family members and animals survived the end of that preflood world, so in fulfillment of that prophetic drama some witnesses of Jehovah like Noah and his family must survive the destruction of the old world of today and enter God's new world of new heavens and a new earth.

In Poland and other Iron Curtain countries the rulers say the truth may not be proclaimed because it interferes with communism. However, this does not stop us. We go underground if necessary and continue our preaching and teaching work. Yes, as true Christians we follow the Word of God and do not let ourselves be silenced but prove qualified to teach. We will continue to go to the meetings among the congregated throngs of God and there learn and study diligently so that we will be better qualified to present the truth with confidence to other people.

<p><span class="font0">That dedication and baptism are divine requirements is clearly set out in the Bible. Christian dedication is the act of a person unconditionally setting himself apart by solemn agreement to do God’s will through Christ as that will is set forth in the Bible. To demonstrate its correctness one need merely ask himself, ‘Is it proper for a person to serve God, giving him exclusive devotion, and should expression of this desire be made to God in prayer?’ The answer is obviously Yes! Jesus made known his heart desire to render service exclusively to his Father. As a symbol of that dedication vow, he was baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptizer. He himself explained to the somewhat hesitant John that this was necessary in order to carry out God's righteous requirements, and Jehovah himself joined in bearing witness to that fact. Jesus pointed out that those who become his disciples must likewise be baptized.—Matt. 28: 19, 20. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jesus protected his sheep from the false leaders in his day. One such occasion was in Gethsemane on his last evening with his little flock, when his own disciple Judas betrayed him there in the garden. Here we witness the Right Shepherd in action protecting the sheep. Even at this time he was thinking more of them than of himself when he said the words quoted above. He came to surrender his life for the sheep, and he did. Not one of them was lost. Jesus had a perfect record. While we cannot attain perfection we can certainly go a long way toward it if we follow his example. His constant concern was with doing one thing, namely, “the will of him that sent me.” He lived in the fear of God, recognizing his responsibility toward the sheep. Think! Are we as much affected, anxious to render a good account of our work as a shepherd caring for the sheep of God? Do we desire, above all things, God’s approval? Are we putting the care of God’s flock above every other consideration today? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 12, 13,15, 16</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Yes, a prime purpose in studying the Bible is to become acquainted with the Father, its Author. Christians are admonished to draw close to God, to seek him and call upon him in faith, so that he will respond. This can be done by becoming closely acquainted with his great textbook, the Bible. Happy are those who learn its lessons well! It is an inexhaustible storehouse of knowledge. Its Author invites us to keep on asking for knowledge. which will be generously supplied. But mere asking is insufficient. To serve Jehovah expertly to his praise we must meditate on his words; we must dwell upon them in thought; we must make them an object of study with a view to acting thereon. A shallow reading of God’s letters to us will be valueless. “With exultation you people will be certain to draw water out of the springs of salvation.” Drink deeply therefrom !—Isa. 12: 3. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font0"> 18, 19</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">How opposite are humility and pride! Pride leads to a crash, humility to glory. To win the glorious prize we need humility; we need it to run well. Humility, then, is the garment for us to wear. What is this humility that precedes glory and exaltation? It is not a burdensome asceticism, as some of the Colossians thought, for that is but a “mock humility.” (Col. 2: 18-23) The word &quot;humility” comes from the Latin </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">humus,</span><span class="font0"> meaning “earth.” Humility, literally, is lowliness of mind; it is being down to earth. It is this quality that Christians must wear as a garment: “Clothe yourselves with the tender affections of compassion, kindness, lowliness of mind,” or, as the footnote shows, “humility.” (Col. 3: 12) Humility is the opposite of high-mindedness. Yet “lowliness of mind” has nothing to do with servility, groveling, cowardice or lack of energy. The false idea that humility is weakness deprives one of the rich blessings of true humility. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 17-20a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God.—Luke 12:20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jesus told of a certain rich man whose land produced well. So he decided to build larger barns and then take life easy. He felt that material riches were sufficient for his need. However, in all of this he failed to give glory to God and relied completely on his material wealth, giving little or no thought to spiritual prosperity, even as Jesus indicates in the words cited above. His treasures failed to save him. Actually Jesus gave the right perspective in his model prayer when he stated: “Give us today our bread for this day.” (Matt. 6: 11) Notice, we arc not to be consumed with long-range material planning but only one day at a time. If anything, we should plan ahead for spiritual advancement, and even then it is only as “Jehovah wills.” (Jas. 4: 13-15) This, then, is the proper balance. How foolish it is to plan ahead to gain material riches when we do not know what one day will bring! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 10, 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">If material needs are not met suffering sets in, bitterness may be sown, and the fruit produced is a blaming of Jehovah for troubles, a cursing of him for woes, and a turning to thievery to meet wants. Material shortages can lead to spiritual poverty. But an abundance can crowd out spirituality, can even push Jehovah out of heart and bring in a false god. Then the flesh becomes one’s god and materialism one’s creed. So we can have too much materially and begin to feel independent even of Jehovah, thinking we do not need him. We might fail to recognize him as our Provider and ask in the spirit of Pharaoh of old, &quot;Who is Jehovah?” If that happened, what a shame to us our glorying in material things would become 1 <span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 11, 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Isaiah’s children as well as he himself were signs and wonders in ancient Israel. The first one was named Shear-jashub. which name itself was prophetic and meant “A mere remnant will return.” He was a sign and his name was a wonder or portent; just as certain as that sou was born to Isaiah and was called Shear-jashub. just that certain was the event that his name foretold to happen. His name meant, therefore, that Judah would be overthrown; Jerusalem and its temple would be destroyed; the surviving Jews would be taken to Babylon, and after a long period of time a mere remnant would return and rebuild their capital eity and its temple to Jehovah. So serious was the situation to become about the survival of Israel that Isaiah prophesied that it would suffer a destruction as complete as that of Sodom and Gomorrah if it were not that God spared that remnant. (Isa. 1:9) Even as Isaiah’s sons were for signs, so God’s spiritual remnant are for signs at the present time. <span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 9, 11</span></p>

To counteract the effect that this miracle would have on all other observers, the enemies of Jesus maliciously said it was the spirit of the Devil that had worked through Jesus to perform this cure. Jesus forcibly argued that it was God’s spirit that had worked through him to expel the demon from the blind and dumb man. To his giving credit to God’s spirit Jesus then added the words stated above. Yes, in view of all that is bound up with the matter of appointment, no appointee should treat his office of overseer lightly. <span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15 </span><span class="font0">24</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The first ingrate was none other than Satan, who influenced the first human pair to misappraise the value of God’s Word. Jesus revealed the fatal flaw in Satan’s appreciation. It was failure to value truth highly. Jehovah had not created Satan so, for, if he had, then God would in fact be the Father of the lie and the liar, but it is impossible for God to lie. The fault lay with Satan. Among God’s spirit sons he was highly favored. He could have followed the wise course of God’s only-begotten Son, the Word, but the self-made ingrate felt no warmth of satisfaction and approval in God’s loving counsel. Nor did Satan highly esteem the association of loyal spirit sons of God. The path of ingratitude led to treason in heaven and earth. Soon the controversy over Jehovah’s universal sovereignty will be settled to the honor of Jehovah and the blessing of all appreciative ones.

If he does not rein in his tongue and say, preach and pray right things about the real God and his purpose, his form of worship will result in no blessing and salvation in spite of sincerity of worship.

We get the full benefit of the personal study we have done. How does this come about? For example: before we can preach we must be prepared. In our service meetings and at home we outline Bible sermons to be given at the doors and on our back-call visits. Then we go to the homes of the people and deliver the sermons. People ask questions of us and we find the answers for them in the Bible, thus enlarging our knowledge.

It is most fitting that in our prayers we praise him for who he is and that we include expressions of thanksgiving for all he keeps doing for us. By cultivating the mental attitude of praise and thanksgiving we shall be rewarded with contentment, which, along with godly devotion, is a means of great gain. A fine example is the prayer David offered at the time contributions for the building of Jehovah’s temple were made. With fitting eloquence he praises Jehovah for his qualities and then thanks Him because all their gifts came from him in the first place. Then David petitions that his people may ever be so generously inclined and that Solomon may have a complete heart toward Jehovah.

Those who can leave the skepticism of the old world behind and who remember that it is not the position of men to call into question the ways of God will receive the instruction they seek. Doubters, scoffers and skeptics will not receive anything from Jehovah, neither wisdom nor life in his new world. The psalmist David well stated the attitude of those who learn from the Great Instructor: “He will teach the meek ones his way.” And, ‘He will instruct the man fearful of Jehovah.’ (Ps. 25: 9,12) Their desire is expressed in Psalm 143: 10 above. They are meek and teachable; they have faith; they acknowledge him as God; they are confident that his way is upright. With such a proper viewpoint, they are in line to learn from him. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/1</span><span class="font0"> 4, 5</span></p>

Thousands of Jehovah’s servants have gone through such a refining, a real refining by scorching heat.

Look at our brothers in the Catholic-ruled Dominican Republic who have been beaten and tortured and thrown into prison because of preaching God’s kingdom and taking their stand as Jehovah’s witnesses, even as were our brothers in Nazi and Fascist lands.

<p><span class="font0">Jesus Christ followed the perfect course, being entirely free from any rebellious traits, being, therefore, the perfect model. He made no decisions for himself. He gave a beautiful example of exclusive devotion to the Father—one completely free from rebellious tendencies. Truly this is an incomparable demonstration of complete servitude. As noted in the above-stated words, Jesus invited others to follow him. Those to whom he addressed those words had, of course, already come out of the world and aligned themselves with the Master. From his own words, then, it is clear that complete harmony with him and his Father is mandatory in order to be recognized as God’s children. Digression is therefore displeasing, constituting a rebellion against what is right. Therefore, decisions governing actions and deeds and motives must be well guarded to avoid rebellion.

Just let us remember that their prosperity will not last. They will soon be gone like the grass that withers and dies. They will never receive the gift of eternal life. Since we must live in this world with its atmosphere of wickedness, we must constantly fight to keep our clean Christian identity.

<p><span class="font0">For the sake of keeping our eyes on the prize we should be willing to determine which distractions may rightfully and profitably be discarded. By shedding these we buy out the opportune time for ourselves. (Eph. 5: 15, 16) We ought to go about this matter of buying out time in earnestness, ever alert to keep distractions at a minimum. Even piled away in a closet, possessions not really needed are a distraction: not only do they require space but they take time—dusting, rearranging, etc. By shedding distractions, by keeping possessions to those that are needful, we feel happier and, above all, are better able to keep our eyes on the prize. In keeping distractions at a minimum selectivity is an important aid. The world's commercialists want us to pile up acquisitions whether we need them or not.

Likewise today, Jehovah will not turn back from his destroying Christendom in Armageddon.

We rejoice in our Great Shepherd of spiritual Israel and in his Right Shepherd, and know that no harm will befall us, but evermore He will lead us in grassy pastures and by well-watered resting places for his name’s sake.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in the present system of things nor in that to come.—Matt. 12:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even in heaven the exalted Jesus acts by God’s spirit, this too in the matter of appointment of overseers. Seeing that the overseer is appointed by this spirit, the appointee will be anxious not to abuse his overseership for selfish reasons. To do so would mean to act like Judas, like Balaam, like the “false apostles.” It is a betrayal of the sheep of the Right Shepherd, such as that committed by the greedy shepherds mentioned in Ezekiel 34: 1-10, 17-22. That would be a sinning against the spirit that made one an overseer. It would be a perversion of the purpose of the spirit in appointing him. This would be sin, a serious sin. If persisted in and committed to the point of hardening the overseer in that condition of heart and course of conduct, it would become a sin against the holy spirit by one whose maturity makes him more blamable and accountable. Hence it becomes a kind of sin that is neither forgivable in this world nor forgivable in the world to come. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You must not take up the name of Jehovah your God in a worthless way.—Ex. 20:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is vital that we live up to the name we bear as Christian witnesses of Jehovah so that we will be found in favor with Jehovah and his Son. As Christian ministers of God we have a purpose in life, and that is to give exclusive devotion to our God Jehovah. Never should we lose sight of it, but always mold our lives to conform to it. Having started in the way of righteousness, let us never turn back. Let our dedication to serve God guide all our decisions. Instead of taking on further obligations that will detract from our ministry, rather let us be always on the alert to avail ourselves of opportunities to expand our knowledge of the truth and to accept further privileges of service. It may be we can arrange our affairs to spend more time in the ministry as a congregation publisher ; if possible, even moving with our family into territory where the need is great. If so, we will want to do that so we will be found fully living up to our name as Jehovah’s witnesses. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 20, 21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A large door that leads to activity has been opened to me, but there are many opposers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 16:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The same is true of the opportunity of full-time service offered today to those free to accept it. It is not easy to pioneer. Cancellations of personal programs may be necessary. Many obstacles and much opposition must be overcome. Paul had to surmount similar obstacles in order to cross the threshold and enter the enlarged field of activity as a pioneer. But his peace of mind and contentment and his joy in life certainly did not suffer because of the privations he experienced. His personal loss of many of the comforts of life did not dampen his zeal. His writings bubble with enthusiasm and optimism as he urges others to follow him in this Christlike way of life. He never complained when it was necessary to work part time at his secular trade in order to keep in the apostolic ministry. You too can partake of similar blessings as Paul and others enjoyed, provided you also enter into the same privileges of service as they did. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15 </span><span class="font0">17, 18</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">As </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for my loving-kindness, it will not depart from him the way I removed it from Saul, . . . And your house and your kingdom will certainly be stead</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fast forever.—2 Sam. 7:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What a grand covenant that was, a covenant for a government, a kingdom, that would be stable for all time, the throne of which would never be overturned! What an unspeakable privilege it was for a faithful man and his household to be tied in with that kingdom covenant! That covenant was to be carried out with God’s loving-kindness as something very necessary to its reaching a grand climax in an everlastingly steadfast kingdom. In fact, it was loving-kindness that prompted the covenant on God’s part. From this viewpoint we can understand why God, through his prophet Isaiah, speaks of it as an “indefinitely lasting covenant respecting the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.” (Isa. 55:3) Much is therefore dependent upon Jehovah’s loving-kindness. This is one of his remarkable traits, and it has come into play outstandingly toward us human creatures, for which we can be truly grateful. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 8, 9</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jesus’ baptism marked a complete dedication. Consequently, after a learner dedicates himself to do God’s will henceforth, he is ready for baptism. Since it must be a wholehearted decision without any reservations, baptism is a very serious occasion, but truly not a sad one. Weighty consideration should be given the matter. A person realizing the importance of fulfilling a vow to God might say: ‘Maybe I should hold off at this time. Perhaps this is not going to work out the way I think it is, and a failure on my part to carry out this dedication would mean death.’ True, vow-breakers are deserving of death. However, one should never lose sight of the fact that a failure to make a dedication would also mean death to the person when he has an opportunity to know the truth and what it means to dedicate his life to Jehovah and then fails to do so. When a person has reached this point he has knowledge and he is accountable to the extent of his understanding. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 13, 14a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Solomon began to sit upon Jehovah’s throne as king in place of David his father and to make a success of it, and all the Israelites were obedient to him.—1 Chron. 29:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How can we witnesses of Jehovah, like the Israelites of old and like Jesus and the apostles, prove our loyalty to the kingdom covenant today? We can do so by being loyal to the reigning kingdom of the everlasting Heir of the kingdom covenant, foreshadowed by Solomon. Jehovah God has never once forgotten his covenant since the last king of David’s house sat on the throne in Jerusalem. Has the sun ever ceased to rise and usher in the day? Or has the moon ever ceased to shine by night? Not once till this day. Even so Jehovah has not forgotten or neglected this most important covenant for the Kingdom that will vindicate him as rightful Sovereign of the universe. Our duty therefore is clear. We owe it to God to be loyal to his enthroned King. In reward for our loyal love we eat the milk of fatness of God’s spiritual table and drink the wine of the joys of the Kingdom ministry as Kingdom ambassadors.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!—Rom. 10:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God’s kingdom is established in the heavens in the hands of Immanuel. That is why God has returned to us with favor. At the abundant evidence of his returning favor it is as if the watchman saw him face to face in his coming back to Zion, his organization upon which he has placed his name. Now, somebody equipped that messenger with the good news that made him appear so beautiful and sent him to make peace to be heard and to bring good news of something better and to make salvation to be heard by men who love God and who want him to be king. (Isa. 52:7, 8 The Sender is Jehovah himself, who bares his holy arm before all the nations and who wants all the ends of the earth to see the salvation that he performs. The messenger that he sends is a company of people who are willing to go on foot to bring the good news. By inspiration Paul declared that they are the saintly dedicated Christians. Today their good-will companions join them in declaring this good news. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 2, 3a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The anxieties of this system of things and the deceptive power of wealth . . . make inroads and choke the word, and it be</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">With the help of Jehovah’s spirit we can win out over the fallen flesh. But it means we must make room for the things of the spirit. To seek material things that in themselves are not bad may lead to our ruin by consuming all our time. A television set will cost us more than the purchase price if we cannot turn its knob when it should be shut off. It costs us time to watch it. It may cost us meeting attendance or back-calls or Bible studies. For our expensive car or fine home we may pay over the privilege of teaching someone the truth or of training him to serve Jehovah. Count the total cost of materialism. Count the cost of spirituality also. There was nothing wrong with looking over a purchase of oxen, or being with a new wife, or seeing :i piece of property just bought; but if harmless things keep us from serving Jehovah they become harmful. We may not let them become thorns that choke out good. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Let a man so appraise us as . . . stewards of sacred secrets of God. Besides, . . . what is looted for in stewards is for a man to be found faithful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Cor. 4:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All of us, like the apostle Paul, have committed to us certain Kingdom interests and we must prove faithful to these if we would gain life. If we are undependable, however, how can we expect to stay on the narrow road of life? How can we expect to reach its end if we lack proper balance? Like an unskilled tightwire walker, our chances of slipping are very great. When a Christian makes an agreement he should keep it. If he does not keep it he makes himself a liar. The balanced Christian is a person of his w’ord. He keeps his promises and honors his agreements. Since he proves faithful in small things he is given bigger and more responsible things to do. Christ pointed this out in his illustration about the talents. The slave that made good use of the five talents proved to be dependable. He was blessed with greater privileges of service. So will we be if we are found faithful as stewards. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15 </span><span class="font0">25, 24</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">13: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is no better way of doing this than by offering your comment at the meetings. Do not say, ‘I’ll keep quiet; someone else can express it better.’ Someone else can only express his own understanding. Yourparticular expression may incite someone to good works. All are in a school for life. All hope to receive life in the new world. So study as though your life depended on it, because it does! Then declare your faith and test it by expressing yourself among your brothers. If your answer is right, fine; you are inciting others to love and right works ; if not, correction will aid you to get straightened out and you will not continue to err when you are distributing lifegiving knowledge to others. Remember that private thinking might be embarrassing. So do not always be just on the receiving line, but call to “mind the words of the Lord Jesus, when he himself said, ‘There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.’ ” —Acts 20: 35.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For your loving-kindness is in front of my eyes, and I hate walked in your truth.—Ps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">26: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Long ago David invited God to examine him, to test him, to refine him. Today is our confidence in our own uprightness, onr own integrity, that firm? It should be if we see matters as David did and are walking in the footsteps of Christ. When we get to appreciate the works of Jehovah, the purposes he has in mind, what he has done, is doing and will do for the blessing of all those who love him, then we can truly appreciate His loving-kindness. Look how loving he has been in sending his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ, from heaven to earth to redeem mankind. But Jesus did more. He vindicated Jehovah’s name by maintaining his integrity and he was made King of the new world of righteousness. To live in this new world we must get acquainted with the Bible, reading its truths carefully and living by them. We must also keep the Kingdom, for which Jesus taught us to pray, in front of our eyes and walk in the truth if we would enjoy life in God’s new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Luke 18:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prayer is indeed an amazing miracle, a precious, loving provision. We cannot keep integrity toward God without its help. Wicked men may take away our Bibles, our opportunities of associating with our brothers and of engaging in the field service, but they can never take away from us the precious loving provision of prayer. And we know what to pray for, first of all for the triumph of righteousness in the universe and then whatever is in line with God’s will for us, his spirit, wisdom, forgiveness of sins, his blessing upon our efforts, and our daily necessities. And that God answers prayer today we can see by the expansion of pure worship, by the happiness of his people, as well as by his servants keeping integrity in spite of bitterest opposition and persecution. And because we are living in critical times hard to deal with we have more need than ever to heed Jesus’ admonition “always to pray and not to give up.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15 27,</span><span class="font0"> 28a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Jer. 17: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Materialism is subtle and can appear as a benefactor. Hence we must examine ourselves. Self-examination is very necessary. While we favor ourselves by nature, nonetheless Jehovah provided a splendid means of self-scrutiny. First of all, we must ask ourselves, “Where isourheart?” Jeremiah understood how wicked the heart could be, as seen by the words cited above. Where is our heart? Is our first love still the priceless possession of the truth, or have we a new love, materialism? We may say we do not have a new love, but what do our actions show? Do we still get that incomparable joy from field service? Or have we begun to crowd out that joy by spending more hours at leisure, being entertained and satisfied by materialistic pleasures and possessions and spending less time in field service? Remember, a covetous heart seeks materialism, but a loyal heart shuns it. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 1, 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Falling asleep at one’s post as a minister of Jehovah puts the sleeper in danger of being caught by the Chief Temple Inspector, Christ, who comes as a thief at Armageddon and makes his final inspection of all the religious realm that professes to be Christian, and then executes finally the judgment. It exposes the sleeper to being stripped naked and having his symbolic garments burned. Any worshiper who loves God with exclusive devotion and who loves his Chief Inspector and longs for his coming to the final judgment will resolutely strive to stay awake. He will watch after the pure worship of Jehovah and the precious interests of his kingdom by Christ. How will the worshiper stay awake spiritually? Basically, to stay-awake a person needs to get his proper rest first, and also to avoid overindulgenee in eating and drinking, even as Jesus counseled in the word-stated above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 9, 10a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Because of the heightened responsibilities and multiplicity of duties laid upon overseers today a man may because of age or sickness or other circumstances become unequal to the requirements of overscership. He may therefore be replaced through no willful sin of his own. Or a more capable person may present himself. In such cases there is no sinning against holy spirit involved, and there is no disgrace or reproach. But woe to the one who greedily, ambitiously, filthily and designedly sins because of the advantage he has as overseer! He is put-ing himself in a serious way toward the spirit that had to do with his appointment to overseership. Unless he strenuously recovers himself, he will not only lose his privilege of office but be on the way to eternal death. His sin will become of an unforgivable type, over which he cannot repent. His disgrace will become great. W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1/15</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 26</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The book of Judges tells of men and women who zealously appreciated Jehovah’s call to action in defense of his chosen people, who had often got into dire straits through lack of appreciation for their God. Jehovah’s witnesses, such as Samson, Gideon, Jehu, Barak, Deborah and others, considered it a great privilege to fight for Jehovah’s name, his true worship and his people. So confident they were of the correct-ness_ of their appraisal of this privilege that they risked their lives to exercise it. Jehovah’s prophets were not less appreciative of their privileges toward God. Kings and empires often raged against such men as Moses, Samuel, Daniel, Jeremiah and others. To these appreciative men the privilege of being spokesmen for Jehovah was a treasure without equal. Do we have the same appreciation of our privileges of being witnesses for Jehovah?

<p><span class="font0">Jesus knew that some people are very concerned about the things of this life; in fact, to such an extent that they would allow these material things and love for them to interfere with their taking up the Kingdom ministry. When our thinking is directed and fixed upon fleshly desires, it means reliance upon self and upon personal judgment. God is cognizant of the materia] needs of his people and sees that these are provided. By our course of action we prove whether we actually believe this or not. Our wants may far exceed our needs, and may cause us to be overreached or to become overanxious about our wants. Jesus also expressed caution against this at Matthew 6: 31. The people of this old world have these anxieties because of their unsatisfied desires for things that really are not necessary to carry on the ministry successfully. The reliable counsel as set forth in God’s Word is: “Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness.”—Matt. 6: 33. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">4/1</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Ps. 96:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since 1914 God has supplied the theme of a new song. For in that year he brought his glorious kingdom to birth by enthroning and crowning the Seed of his woman, the Heir of the covenant made with David for the everlasting kingdom. That was something new indeed. Its birth brought into operation a new ruling organization for all the universe, for angels and for men. It brought into existence the capital part of Jehovah’s universal organization, and all holy angels and all men of good will must bow to it according to God’s command. There had never been anything like it before in the universe. For the whole universe this was good news. So in 1914 the message about God’s kingdom to come had grown old. The message for anointed Christians to preach must henceforth be of God’s kingdom </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">come.</span><span class="font0"> It must be of God’s kingdom born, set up in the heavens and in operation amidst all its enemies in heaven and on earth.

<p><span class="font0">When God made the kingdom covenant with David three thousand years ago, he had in mind finally an everlasting </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">heavenly</span><span class="font0"> kingdom for David’s permanent Heir. No Levite high priest could anoint Jesus to such a celestial government. Jehovah anointed him after his baptism in water, pouring down holy spirit upon Jesus and sanctifying him as the Christ. Jesus 'was there begotten by God’s spirit to become a spiritual Son of God, due for a future life in heaven. Most fittingly Jesus preached God’s “kingdom of the heavens.” He called disciples to follow him and seek first the Kingdom. When calling them, he was really extending to them God’s invitation, as noted at Isaiah 55: 3. This meant that Jehovah God had purposed to give Jesus Christ some joint heirs in the heavenly kingdom. In loyalty to the kingdom covenant Jesus welcomed such joint heirs of God’s kingdom in the words stated above.

<p><span class="font0">To help us to avoid stumbling, Jehovah has caused to appear repeatedly in his book the injunction to put off pride. Pride is thinking too highly of oneself. It is running a course opposite to that marked out by the apostle in the words quoted above. It is a heady draught of self-importance that induces a kind of intoxication. The proud person is drunk with self-flattery and self-esteem. For such a person, running the Christian race according to the rules is as difficult as it is for a drunk man to run without stumbling. Pride is before a crash because Jehovah hates the proud person. Among the seven things listed as detestable to his soul are lofty eyes. Jesus, the one who is wisdom personified, also hates pride. He stated: “Whoever exalts himself will be humbled.” The result of pride, then, is opposition from Jehovah and Christ and eventual humiliation for the selfexalting ones. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 1, 3, 4a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The only way that one can train himself with godly devotion as his aim is by studying God’s Word. When one reads the Bible and carefully studies it with someone who is trained in the study of it he will find that what he has read is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance. We must exert ourselves to the end that we may keep the hope and also establish this hope and faith in the lives of others. Studying in the homes with people, we will stick to the commandments of God and teach these, even though Bible truth conflicts with men’s personal ideas. Sometimes the righteous laws of God are disturbing to individual students and they throw the study overboard.

<p><span class="font0">Those given as shepherds must remember how Jehovah himself handles his own sheep, feeding, leading, protecting, patiently bearing with them at all times. They must also keep ever before them how Jesus cared for his Father’s sheep, losing none of them and serving continually in the fear of God, though serving in love and for love. The sheep must be handled by the undershepherds in the same way as the Chief Shepherd handled them. This must be done by leading them to pastures to be fed spiritually and so grow strong and in time be able to help weaker ones. They must be encouraged to attend the weekly congregational meetings, as well as the assemblies, and be helped to preach the truth with effective sermons. They must be kept inside the theocratic arrangement of the New World society. They must be handled gently and with love, for sheep quickly scare and run; and with tenderness, for they bruise by harsh or rough treatment. They have no means of defense and so have to depend upon their shepherd for protection.

<p><span class="font0">We know that God deals with his people as an organization and his spirit operates in conjunction with that organization. A major consideration in the growth of a congregation, therefore, is its response to the instructions regularly provided by the faithful and discreet slave. Since that spirit of God operates in conjunction with the organization, to the extent that the servants and the individual ministers respond to the counsel provided them through the theocratic organization, to that extent the way is open for the free flow of God’s holy spirit. Any who feel that they are not seeing results to the extent they might would do well to consider these factors, dispel any negative attitude and hopefully put into operations the suggestions made by the theocratic organization. If we diligently plant and water, following the lead God gives us through his Word and his channel of communication, he will bless our efforts with growth until all his sheep are safely gathered into his New World society. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 19a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Since A.D. 1914 Jehovah has mercifully cut short the troubles against Satan and allowed a time when spiritual food could be distributed in abundance. But then will come the time of difficulty when the way will be closed. How important, therefore, it is now for all to be taking in more accurate knowledge. It is a time to work at taking in knowledge, like the ants that gather food in the summertime of plenty. The fools who do not gather in accurate knowledge now are like the proverbial grasshopper who took the easy course in times of plenty and did not look to the future. Suddenly comes the winter and calamity for the unprepared. But even though a person may have some knowledge of the Bible and may be serving in the ministry, he is wise only if he continues to give ear to the words of Jehovah and thus goes on increasing in the knowledge he has. For this purpose the Scriptures have been given, even as noted above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 1, 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The good news that we preach about God’s kingdom is sensational indeed. But it is not overdrawn. It is no joke. For forty years now we have preached it, but it is no news that grows stale and that loses its appeal and tastiness and that needs to be dropped. It is ever new, ever fresh, growing ever grander. God has not dropped it. We will not drop it. Our God-ordained Kingdom preaching must go on. It will increase till the millennial reign of Jesus Christ wins the glorious peace that follows Armageddon. So to the Kingdom covenant made with the Greater David may we always be true and loyal. To all men who respect that covenant and who uphold the Kingdom promised by it may we show loving-kindness and trueness. (Prov. 3: 3, 4) For doing so, we shall find Jehovah himself exercising these same precious qualities toward us through his King Jesus Christ, and our souls will keep alive, forever. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0"> 26, 27a</span></p>

Then we shall also be mindful to pray before and while engaging in the ministry and especially if we have the privilegeof preaching the Word from the public platform. Then we shall also listen carefully to and enter into the spirit of the prayers that others offer in our hearing, as at the congregational meetings, instead of letting our minds wander. And should it be our privilege to offer public prayer it will prompt us to speak clearly, coherently and earnestly, so that all who hear can from the heart say “Amen!” W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">8/15</span><span class="font0"> 25a</span></p>

What good things do you have that you did not receive from Jehovah in the first place? These are willingly given in dedication to Jehovah through Jesus Christ for the unspeakable privileges and blessings that are continually bestowed upon God’s dedicated servants. However, bear in mind that this gives us the authority to be called by and to speak in Jehovah’s name as His witnesses. In this doomed and dying old world we dedicated servants of Jehovah are the happiest people living. In fact, we expect to survive Armageddon and to live forever in an earthwide paradise. Much, then, depends upon one’s making a dedication, and then everything depends upon one’s faithfulness to that dedication. Maintaining integrity and faithfully living up to one’s dedication will bring us supreme happiness even now. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 20</span></p>

The thieflike coming of the royal Inspector at Armageddon must not take us by surprise and find us idle, unoccupied, inactive in the Kingdom service. For the complete period of our test we will carry out our dedication to God in love. We will stay awake at our duties and keep within the bounds of our holy commission or assignment of service, just as the priests did who were being ordained for the temple and who were commanded, as above. So, as faithful wideawake watchers, we shall receive God’s approval through his Inspector Jesus Christ. O then, what a happiness!

<p><span class="font0">Christ tells us to do as he did, not to be afraid of the sufferings that we are bound to suffer in this world’s time of the end. We are facing the total attack of Gog of Magog upon God’s people shortly. The above-quoted words of Jesus to the Smyrna congregation are therefore timely and good: not to be afraid of that furious attack, nor of the things we have to suffer before , then— imprisonment, tribulation ten days or violent death. He himself once died but came to life again by God’s almighty power and can die no more, being beyond harm by the second death. He now has all power in heaven and in earth and can hold out the crown of life to his faithful followers. Like him, the only Potentate “having immortality,” his followers who conquer this doomed world will in the resurrection be put beyond harm by the second death. A “star” or congregation overseer should be a world conqueror as a right example. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 11a</span></p>

God gave mankind the Greater Moses, Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of all mankind, if they accept him as God’s gift for their redemption. The miracles that Christ performed on earth make us think of the life men will enjoy under the Kingdom. If on earth he healed the sick, opened blind eyes, even raised the dead, surely with all power in heaven and earth he can build a perfect new world of righteousness according to his Father’s will.

There is a great need for full-time ministers in every country in Christendom. There are many isolated territories among people speaking your own language where there is a crying need for more pioneers.

The thieflikeness of the coming of the Chief Inspector to the execution of divine judgments at Armageddon should bestir us to make every effort and arrangement to stay awake. Danger lies in making ourselves comfortable materially and taking our ease, with the idea that the uncertainty of the time of the Inspector’s coming means that he will be a long time yet in coming, during which long time we can take things comfortably, intending to move into action when we get more sensational evidence of the close nearness of his coming. The Inspector will not let us know Armageddon’s day and hour in advance so that we can set some sort of alarm clock and wake up the shortest amount of time before he arrives and then put on an appearance of having been alert, awake and busy at one’s assigned post all the time. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 23, 24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Humble yourselves in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will exalt you.—Jas. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Humility begins with the knowledge, the love and the fear of God. Humility is born of the realization of how small we are and how great God is. Humility takes root when the creature man realizes that he is merely the flickering glow of a candle but that God is brighter in glory than the blaze of the sun at noonday. Yes, this is the foundation of humility: the realization of God’s infinite majesty and of our own littleness. Such a realization comes from knowledge, the kind of knowledge Jehovah imparted to Job, as recorded in the book of Job, chapters thirty-eight through forty-one; that knowledge aided Job to humble himself under the mighty hand of God. We need this kind of knowledge. It enables us to place ourselves in the right relationship with God and to obey the words of James cited above. Further, by humbling ourselves in God’s eyes we also lay a foundation for humbleness of mind toward our fellow man, for true humility toward man rests ultimately upon true humility before God.

<p><span class="font0">The root cause of all the world’s crime, strife and mad confusion is false religion. The men most responsible for the world condition are the religious leaders. Is it wrong for us to feel just as Jeremiah felt about a similar situation in his own day, and then to express ourselves in harmony with our feelings? We believe not. Not many years before Jerusalem and its temple were destroyed, Jeremiah in heartbroken words reported the conditions. To them Jehovah added the comment stated above. Christendom today stands in a relationship toward God like that of Israel in Jeremiah’s day, and faces a destruction more frightful and devastating than that which Jeremiah saw happen to Jerusalem and its temple. Since we are called by God’s name and are Jehovah’s witnesses, as Jeremiah himself was, we are under obligation to speak the truth fearlessly, even as Jeremiah did.

<p><span class="font0">Many persons outside Jehovah’s organization adopt a philosophy that allows them to satisfy their every whim. Without Jehovah’s pure Word and organization to guide us w’e could fall into the same trap. Buthaving Jehovah’s Word, we know that adulterers and fornicators cannot attain the Kingdom. We are also well aware of the powerful forces within the human body, which, not properly controlled, can lead to a course of degradation and disapproval by Jehovah. We must therefore be alert to keep ourselves clean and above immoral conduct, lest we become depraved by our own selfish appetites. Not to have our emotions under control would be exercising our own will, or the will of the flesh, rather than the will of Jehovah, and would be direct rebellion against Jehovah’s wise counsel. Jehovah does not permit the inclusion of such practices in his organization just because surrounding Christendom condones them. The apostle Paul set a good example in this for us.

<p><span class="font0">As should be expected under Jehovah's blessing, the increase that he brings is not merely in numbers. There is also an increase in activity, together with improved effectiveness. But that is not all. Of equal importance is the element of increase of maturity. All these increases are essential for each one of us, that is, increase in numbers, in activity and in maturity, regarding which maturity Peter wrote the words quoted above. These enjoin upon us individual progress in spiritual maturity through the study of God’s Word, obedience to it, and application in the individual’s life of the principles contained in the Bible. That makes for a real Christian. This should be expected, since God would not bring the persons of good will and honest heart into a corrupt and unclean worldly religion, belief, practice or organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> 16, 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">A positive mental attitude is very important to cultivating spiritual steadiness. If we take a negative attitude toward the responsibilities, difficulties and hardships that come with following the way of Christian integrity, we will lose our balance and fall. Paul had the right mental attitude. He was determined to stay in the narrow road to life. He would not let anything stumble him and cause him to fall, neither influences outside his body nor those inside it, even as he notes in the words quoted above. He set a good example for all of us to follow. Gaining this right mental attitude, however, does not come without effort. It requires diligent study to gain an accurate knowledge of God’s Word. It requires a genuine heart desire to walk in harmony with God’s righteous principles. What we learn we must take into our hearts and make it a part of us. We must meditate on our relationship to God and to the theocratic organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 31-33</span></p>

Hence Solomon’s son Rchoboam sat on the throne of Jehovah in Jerusalem, but only over the two faithful tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Rehoboam died a bad king. Yet his son Abijah came to the throne. Why? The inspired account cited above answers. When Abijah went to war against the revolted ten tribes he first appealed to them from a mountaintop on the basis of God's kingdom covenant with David. (2 Chron. 13:3-12) However, the kingdom covenant and loyal adherence to its God Jehovah had no appeal for those revolted Israelites. They went ahead with the battle.

Long ago Peter warned as above. It is a serious matter for a guard to fall asleep and thus leave exposed to loss or defilement the things committed to his oversight. In worldly armies, sentries found asleep at their guardpost during times of war used to be shot to death. Why?

<p><span class="font0">Jesus knew that love and humility are essential for one to gain life in the new world. To acquire them requires education of the heart. Disciples could best learn by seeing them demonstrated ; so he drew their attention to the countless expressions of love that Jehovah had showered upon them. They could also observe love and humility in Jesus’ attitude and his ministry, in the tender affection he felt for those he taught, in his prayers to his Father in heaven, when he washed their feet, and when he willingly laid down his life for mankind. As they would reflect upon the things they had seen and heard, that instruction would begin to penetrate to their heart, to soften it and to cause it to respond. When Jesus sent out his disciples he gave them careful instructions on how to perform their work. He told them what to say and do. He prepared them for the opposition they would meet and impressed on their minds the grand privilege that was theirs.

<p><span class="font0">Do you think you can take a temporary holiday and get some more of this world’s goods while the secular opportunities are ripe? If so, then consider what materialism leads to. Is it worth it? From Paul’s words quoted above we see that it is not the riches or what such represent that is wrong, but it is the determination to have material wealth and possessions. With such a determination a Christian places more value on the material than on the spiritual,, and this is where the danger lies. Then study, meditation and field service are exchanged for longer hours and overtime secular work. Both husband and wife engage in secular work. Those who pursue this course long enough will eventually land outside the New World society. Outside there is no contentment, only unhappiness, grumbling and despair.

It leads us to seek to be righteous in God’s sight, with all worldliness and sinful nakedness put away. Overseers must also help the Laodiceans to apply the spiritual eyesalve ; that is, to take Jesus’ teaching on matters, his advice, his example and his mental attitude, and to act in harmony with such. This is a healing remedy against “the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the showy display of one’s means of life.” (1 Jolin 2: 15-17) Recovering spiritual sight, they can become eyes to others, and not be blind leaders of the blind.

A hireling shepherd will run when danger comes ; a true shepherd will stay with us and will be thinking only of how he can help us to be at peace and to live for the service of Jehovah God. For our eternal welfare we must remember such shepherds and, noting God’s blessing upon them, imitate their faith.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If some of the branches were broken off but you, although being a wild olive, were grafted in among them ... do not be exalting over the branches. . . .

<p><span class="font0">Because of their faith, nonJews were adopted as sons of the Greater Abraham. They became heirs to the promise. They received what the fleshly descendants of Abraham lost through unbelief. Such unbelief was to the gain of the Gentiles. This means they were grafted into the symbolic olive tree like branches from a wild olive. The grafted-in Gentiles, however, are required to maintain faithfulness in order to remain in the symbolic olive tree. Otherwise they will be cut off just as natural Israel had been. That is why the apostle says they have no reason to boast over the natural branches that were cut off. They too could be severed from the trunk. Hence they must always appreciate the undeserved kindness God has shown them. The same principle applies to the other sheep. For them to remain in the New World society they must keep on appreciating God’s undeserved kindness.

<p><span class="font0">Our minds become more keen in perception as we study the Bible each day and conduct Bible studies in the homes of the people. So by bearing fruit in the ministry, by use of the knowledge we have gained, we are constantly increasing in accurate knowledge. We are alive spiritually. In contrast, the inactive ones do not go on increasing in accurate knowledge. Even if one sits at home and reads for hours and hours, he is not gaining in perceptive powers through </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">use</span><span class="font0"> of the knowledge. He does not produce fruit in God’s service. Jesus said those who do not produce fruit are put aside. Individuals who do not put their knowledge to use demonstrate that they do not have discernment, nor its key, God’s spirit. As Jesus showed in the words quoted above, if one does not use what has been given, it will be taken away from him. The only way to go on increasing in accurate knowledge, to have spiritual discernment and wisdom, is to be bearing fruit consistently in God’s service. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 24, 25</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">If one does not keep his outer garments, it will mean great unhappiness for him, because Christ removes them from him as unworthy of wearing them and then burns them beyond recovery. That would mean that he becomes as naked as any worldly person who is a sinner, only more shamefully naked because once he was clothed with the honorable Christian ministry and should have known better and lived up to his responsibility. His punishment would become like that of the evil slave, as described above. He will die with the unfaithful and the hypocrites during the execution of God’s judgments at Armageddon by Christ, the royal Inspector. He will die with the “naked” clergy who hypocritically minister in their religious vestments at Christendom’s so-called temple of God. That means a hopeless death, second death.

<p><span class="font0">Neglecting study, failing to keep up with the truth, forsaking the. assembling with others of like precious faith, cause some to drift away. These things cause them to lose appreciation for their rare privilege as Jehovah’s slaves. Such take themselves out from under the shadow of God’s wings. Life in the new world of righteousness is too precious to sacrifice on the altar of lack of appreciation or disobedience. Study of God’s Word is important. But it is a means to an end: the obedient activity in telling the good news of salvation by Jehovah. There is no place in God’s organization for a lazy man. Jesus set the example when just a lad by being active at his Father's house. (Luke 2: 49) So should we be about our Father’s business. Now is the time to find our place in the New World society and to maintain that place. Love of God and of neighbor will impel us to study with the purpose in view of engaging in that great lifesaving work. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/1</span><span class="font0"> 11,12,14a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">For our prayers to reach God they must be uttered in all sincerity. Those who pray merely to be seen of men pray in vain, for God hates hypocrites. Likewise, we must come to God in humility. In view of his greatness and our insignificance, pride is most unseemly. Besides, in coming to God with petitions we come as beggars, not as customers. We cannot bargain with God. for we have nothing to offer. Most fitting, therefore, is God’s opposition to haughty ones and his granting undeserved kindness to humble ones. Is there any Scriptural support for the practice of folding one’s hands and assuming a sanctimonious pose in prayer? No, our physical position is not important. However, kneeling when offering private prayer is to be recommended as an aid to our having the right mental attitude of humility before our Maker. Also, kneeling aids concentration. It is so easy to let our minds wander off or to doze if we pray while lying in bed. No doubt that is why Paul counseled us as above.

<p><span class="font0">Jesus Christ showed that one of the things that makes our service well pleasing to God is bearing much fruit, thereby proving ourselves his disciples. (John 15: 8) Merely sowing seed is not the same as bearing fruit. That seed of truth must be watered and cultivated and must grow into a productive plant in order to bear fruit. If as a result of our ministry the seed of truth takes root and is cared for until it too grows into a fruit-producing plant, then our ministry glorifies Jehovah because it produces more praisers. Each congregation and each individual who shares in Jehovah’s service would do well to pause and ask, ‘Can I point to a fruitage of praise-producing dedicated praisers to Jehovah?’ Paul could and did—in the words quoted above. If we have no such letters of recommendation we would do well to analyze ourselves and our service to see where improvement could be made. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 11a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By paying constant attention to ourselves we watch our mental attitude, making sure that it is not becoming negative or sour. If it is we will not stay for long by the Scriptural things we have learned. We will soon fall from the narrow way to life. We will be greatly helped in cultivating the right mental attitude if we keep our minds on what is good and upbuilding. (Phil. 4:8) This again is a matter of thinking positively and not negatively. And as we grow in knowledge and maturity, so does our effectiveness as a minister. Since this brings better results and greater joys, we will want to increase our preaching activity. We will not be satisfied with a meager service but will want to do as much as we can. The incentive for greater activity will come from our own hearts. None of the many features of the ministry will then be neglected by us, but we will seek to be balanced in all of them. Thus we will become efficient ministers, doing much good with Scriptural truths.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and . . . there was a voice from the heavens that said: ‘‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Matt. 3:16, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To consummate one’s dedication to God one must publicly confess it to others by being baptized in water. Jesus set the pattern for this right practice, as noted above. The word “baptism” is taken from the Greek </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">baptisma,</span><span class="font0"> which means “dipping. ’ Thus in no manner does it have reference to sprinkling. Notice, too, the voluntary action on the part of Jesus when he submitted himself to John for immersion. He placed himself completely at John’s disposal to be immersed backwards in the water. The manner in which Jesus was completely submerged or hidden in Jordan’s water well illustrated how Jesus became buried as dead to his former course of earthly life. His then being raised up out of the water shows how he was being made alive for the doing of God’s will from that time forward. How suitable, then, is water baptism as a proper public symbol and sign of one’s personal dedication! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1 </span><span class="font0">1, 2a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Matt. 11:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We must have faith not only that God exists but also that he will reward those earnestly seeking him, that he will answer our prayers. (Heb. 11: 6) And do we not have sound basis for such faith? Is not God able to “do more than superabundantly beyond all the things we ask or conceive”? And since he loves us, we may rest assured that he is as willing as he is able—so different from imperfect man, who so often is either willing but unable or able but unwilling. Did not God answer Elijah’s prayer when he faced the 450 prophets of Baal? Hezekiah’s prayer when Sennacherib’s army threatened Jerusalem? The prayers on behalf of imprisoned Peter? Our very spiritual prosperity is proof that God is as able and willing to answer prayer today as he ever was in times past. True, we may not always understand by what particular means he answers prayer today, but we do know that he uses his organization, visible and invisible, his Word and his holy spirit.

<p><span class="font0">Our retaining our official garments means that we are favored with God’s continued recognition as his ministers and are retained in his holy service. Our garments of official service, at his temple are not taken away and burned, obligating us to walk naked and be disgraced before the universe, exposed as being a part of this world that is to be destroyed at Armageddon. (Rev. 16: 15) At Armageddon the Inspector and Executioner spares our lives. Our life prospects for the new world of righteousness are preserved for us. In this way we can stay awake forever and can enjoy living in God’s everlasting new world. How glorious and honorable it is to serve Jehovah at his spiritual temple now! What inexpressible happiness there is even now amid this dark, evil world in serving God by proclaiming the good news of his Messianic kingdom I What a privilege it is to wear our God-given outer garments worthily as his ministers!

<p><span class="font0">It is a joyful privilege for anyone to be a sign of something that is lastingly good. To people who have a right set of values, a person who serves as such a sign is something handsome, someone welcome and worthy of a hearty reception. So, then, a messenger who brings good news about the true worship of God and about the re-establishment of his theocratic organization in the earth -would be a handsome sign. Jehovah described such a messenger as due to appear shortly after World War I ended, while his witnesses were yet lying in captivity to the war-inad nations of this world. Those who were on the watch saw the messenger as he came upon the heights. They rejoiced to hear him call out to God's organization, Zion : “Your God has become king!” Truly they have reason now to cry out for all men to hear, and blessed are those who hear and join in the cry.

<p><span class="font0">Running the race according to the rules is no burden when one has true humility. The truly humble ones are teachable ; they benefit from reproof. They realize that they are not competing in the race and that all must run unitedly for God’s loving reward; so they help one another, encourage one another. Humility enables one to preach the Word to all men, under all circumstances. It enables one to train for the ministry and to benefit from counsel received. Humility enables those “bearing rule” to be like Jesus—humble and always approachable. If any man is reaching out for the office of overseer, let him remember that pride is a barrier to usefulness and greater service privileges in God’s organization, because God detests the proud and opposes them. So off with pride that causes stumbling.

(Rev. 16:15) The ministerial watchmen found awake then and actively on duty will see Jehovah’s eternal victory over these foes of his true religion and of his only rightful government of all the universe. Thus in place of nakedness and shame they will survive and enter into beauty and honor as worthy ministers of the Most High God of the universe in his wonderful new world.

We feel the responsibility that David felt, that of maintaining integrity and taking a definite stand for righteousness as against evil and having no association with this old degrading system of things. Having the Bible in hand and being well acquainted with it, we feel ourselves equipped to teach and therefore we go into people’s homes and try to teach them Bible knowledge. At the same time we ourselves keep studying in congregational meetings to be better qualified to teach. We remember that our leader, Christ, was the greatest teacher that ever lived upon the earth. He was able to inculcate in the minds of his followers the conviction that what he taught was the truth because what he said was backed up by Scripture. They became his disciples.

<p><span class="font0">We, as did Christ, have made our decision for God’s kingdom. As long as we hold fast to our decision by preaching the Kingdom good news, we too will be kept from falling during this test. We shall never be attracted into Devil worship by choosing and serving the kingdoms of this world. Let Christendom go down under the test of this hour. We are kept standing! The seven stars, as well as the “other sheep” associated with them in overseership, must help all of Christ’s sheep through this hour of temptation by setting a proper example themselves and by giving them all aid. The time for assigning crowns permanently comes on quickly; so we must hold fast what we have from him by striving to increase those Kingdom interests, by using our all as a precious instrument in Kingdom service. For the anointed ones to lose the Kingdom interests now before Armageddon means to lose the heavenly crown. For the other sheep to lose what they have means to lose New World life under the Kingdom.

<p><span class="font0">The God-fearing prophets were experts in appraising privileges. They set the highest value on the call to declare Jehovah’s prophecies, truths and judgments, whether delivered to friend or foe. A typical example is that of Moses, as noted in Paul’s words quoted above. In Moses’ mind and heart a decision was reached, an appraisal made, that set the highest value on Jehovah’s promised blessings, which hope easily offset anything the Egyptian world might offer by way of materialistic attraction. During his lifetime his appraisal brought many blessings and privileges as mediator between Jehovah and Israel, prefiguring the role of Christ himself. What is more, Moses is included among the list of faithful, appreciative witnesses of Jehovah who will have an early resurrection. Had Moses appraised his privileges unwisely he might have led a life of temporary enjoyment and then died without hope.

In 1914 the end of the Gentile times meant just the reverse. It meant Down with the Gentile treaders and up with the kingdom of God I It meant the birth of God’s kingdom, not at Old Jerusalem on earth, but up in heaven, where Jesus had sat waiting at God’s right hand until the Gentile times ran out. Then God gave Christ the active power of the Kingdom.

There is no place in this organization for any who grudgingly hold back, or for those who stubbornly want to go their own way.

<p><span class="font0">It is not the possession of money that is evil, but it is the love of it or the placing of one’s salvation in it that brings evil results. As regards those who do not possess wealth but long for it, it is their constant longing for and seeking after it that brings the evil results, because of using time and energy dedicated to God’s service to attain it. Sueh a course can bring only disappointment, for its sustaining power is shortlived. So how utterly foolish it is to forsake the riches of Jehovah’s service for this fleeting bit of security I It is uncanny how the love of money invades a man’s mind and becomes like a malignant growth. It readily replaces the love for God and becomes an insatiable desire. Yet it brings no lasting pleasure even to the one attaining it.

<p><span class="font0">You do not want to lose any of the sheep in your care, do you? Their safety lies in keeping in the fold and depending upon the Great Shepherd to watch over them, even as we are assured in the words quoted above. Therefore you must watch that the sheep do not stray from the fold. Your work is to keep out marauders. Look after the sheep. Be careful of wolves in sheep’s clothing. Today multitudes are flocking into the New World society and all kinds of men are coming. We want to help these to clean up and dedicate their lives to God. Those who refuse to do so you are to keep your eye on, for the protection of the sheep. You also must lead the sheep out to pasture or else they will weaken and die. Show the sheep where they can browse upon the Word of Jehovah. Teach them how to study. Break up the food for them while they are young. Go into necessary explanations so they will understand. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 7, 8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous so as to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.—1 John 1:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Knowledge plus selfishness, knowledge plus disobedience, that is, sin against accurate knowledge, results in disaster. (Heb. 10: 26, 27) Jehovah expects us to use the accurate knowledge that is available to us, to make it a defense so that we will not slip back into the ways of the old world. This is not to say that mistakes can-notbemade. But these mistakes are not willful mistakes made against accurate knowledge. These are sins due to our inherited imperfections and perhaps lack of knowledge. When anyone falls under this imperfection he should quickly put forth effort to make things right with the Father in heaven. Jehovah extends mercy to us. We should go to him and ask forgiveness, taking comfort from the words of John stated above. This accurate knowledge that Jehovah is merciful gives us a fortification against feeling depressed and helps us to keep a happy spirit as we continue to serve him.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Are we attending and participating in the meetings? Not only is it important to attend but it is very important to say something constructive while there. This enables us to become more qualified to teach. At the meetings spiritual matters are discussed and one acquires wisdom and understanding. We become fortified with the sayings from God’s mouth; and since he is unalterably opposed to materialism, an application of the principles in his Word will aid us to fight this menace. Hence the value of attending and participating in the meetings. And is it not good and encouraging to hear the expressions of the newer brothers? Nothing is so heartwarming as to hear the comments of those new in the truth and to watch them grow to maturity, transforming their mind and heart from this old system to the new. This is indeed good insurance against materialism. Keep your love where their love is and you will please Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/1</span><span class="font0"> 6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Joseph of Nazareth was hesitating about taking his fiancee Mary as a wife, for in some unexplained way she had become pregnant. In a dream God’s angel appeared to Joseph and told him not to be afraid to take Mary, for “that which has been begotten in her is by holy spirit.” On waking up, Joseph proceeded to do as told. In due time Mary bore a son and his name was called Jesus. At the age of thirty years Jesus began to preach the kingdom of God. For his loyalty to God’s kingdom he was put to death. On the third day God raised him from the dead. Forty days later he asceuded to heaven. From there, by use of his human sacrifice and by use of his great power in heaven and in earth, he went ahead saving his people, his followers on earth, from their sins, that they might gain everlasting life in God’s new world. Thus he has proved that “with us is God,” and thus the name Immanuel properly belongs to him.—Matt. 1: 18-25.17 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">11/15 </span><span class="font0">15, 16</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday, October 8 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sing to Jehovah a new song, for wonderful are the things that he has done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Ps. 98:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Have we reason to be unbelieving toward all the grand things contained in this new song to Jehovah? No, but on the foundation of his Word and the fulfillment of its prophecies we have every inducement to exercise faith in the new song. Concerning God we are told: “The one seated on the throne said: ‘Look! I am making all things new.’ Also he says: ‘Write, because these words are trustworthy and true.’” (Rev. 21:5) It will please him and he will approve of us if we believe the new song he has composed. It will please him still more, if we prove our faith by learning all the grand things of that new song and then singing it ourselves for all to hear, yes, for Him, too, to hear. “Sing to Jehovah a new song” is the divine command to us today. Happy are we if we obey and sing it out lovingly and fearlessly. It will mean our own salvation and the salvation of men of good will who hear us and join us in singing to the honor of Jehovah God and of his promised Seed, the King of the new world. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/15 27,</span><span class="font0"> 28a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No one can be a slave to two masters . . . You cannot be slaves to God and to Riches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Matt. 6: 24-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Root out materialism to make room for the spirit. “Do not put out the fire of the spirit” by an overloading of material cares and possessions. With limited time and energy we cannot be slaves to two masters. Which will we choose ? Is it difficult to decide to give up materialism? Then consider this. We have started Bible studies with persons and then had them quit when they saw the obligations of service. We knew they were Wrong, that they should not have worried about such things, for in time as they learned more they would have grown strong and wanted to preach. They could see what they must give up, but were too new to appreciate what they would gain. Let us not be like that concerning materialism; seeing only what we are asked to give up but not appreciating what we will gain spiritually. Rather, like Paul let us look beyond the material loss to see the spiritual gain that makes the loss as nothing.—Phil. 3: 8. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/1</span><span class="font0"> 20</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Happy is the man that is listening to me by keeping awake at my doors day by day, by watching at the posts of my entrances.—Prov. 8:34</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When any worshiper of Jehovah studies God’s Word purposefully and intelligently, seeking certain information to equip himself for carrying on his ministry and for meeting a foreseen occasion, it serves as a spiritual stimulant to him. This needs to be done regularly, prayerfully to God, for he gives wisdom generously. Such makes for happiness, as noted above, and happiness stimulates. However, we need to be awake when studying. We need to make progress in study, really adding to our knowledge and understanding because of study. Moreover, we must keep up with the advance of knowledge and understanding of God’s Word. To do this, we must study what progresses farther ahead of what we already know and understand. What we study should be progressive in its information, not dwelling continually on the primary things. What we study should be upbuilding to our proper desires and impulses. Then our study becomes very refreshing and stimulating to mental alertness. By such study we grow to Christian matureness.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Because of my integrity you have upheld me, and you will set me before your face to time indefinite.—Ps. 41:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Communist governments have come out boldly declaring that Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the kingdom of God and this they must stop because it is different from their government. The only way that we will be stopped in our Godgiven work is for these brutal governments to take our lives, and they have taken many. That is what the Roman government tried to do. Look what happened to it! It never succeeded! The brutality of nations has never been able to wipe out Christianity, and it never will. Every true Christian who has ever lived, whether under very distressing times, such as now exist behind the Iron Curtain, or under other unfavorable circumstances, will not be stopped in his preaching Jehovah’s kingdom but will continue to walk in his own integrity. Enduring temptations, trials and testings goes to prove our integrity. A Christian must be able to say as he goes along in life: “As for me, in my integrity I shall walk.”—Ps. 26: 11. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 7b</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Love is long-suffering and obliging.—1 Cor. 13: 4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Love will keep us from shying away from territory or homes where we may not have been received hospitably in the past, and from favoring certain types of territory over others. It keeps us optimistic when the message we bear is repeatedly rejected. Having done our best to prepare and present it, we know that the sheep know the Master’s voice and respond, and we rejoice as we see before us the clear evidence of the dividing work that is now being performed under the direction of the King Jesus Christ through the preaching being carried on by his anointed brothers and their other sheep companions. When one accepts the truth, how glad we are to have associated with us another one of the Lord’s sheep! And when we have done our part in preparing and, where possible, presenting the message, instead of being discouraged we have our faith made more firm when we behold the prophecy-fulfilling scoffers who reject the good news. —2 Pet. 3:3, 4.

<p><span class="font0">In view of the prominence in Pergamum of all manner of Devil worship, including the worship of the emperor, it was not without good reason that the above was said regarding the congregation there. Today with nationalism being so rampant, with the images and symbols of nationalism being treated as sacred and idolized, with the image of the United Nations being adored by over eighty nations, and with the expelled Satan now come down to earth's residents and having great anger, we are like Pergamum in dwelling where Satan’s throne is. Can Christ praise us too through the angel of the congregation for our holding fast his name and not denying our faith in him as Savior and King, even though thousands of our brothers have been martyred, like Antipas, whom Christ calls “my witness, the faithful one, who was killed by your side, where Satan is dwelling”? If he can do so, then we are like the congregation in Pergamum in this respect.

<p><span class="font0">A balanced Christian will think carefully lest he do anything that will bring reproach upon Jehovah’s name. He will not profane God's name by improper actions. He will remember that little forethought is much better than a great deal of remorse. He would also do well to think how his actions will affect others in the congregation. How will it affect new members and people who are just manifesting interest in the truth? If an overseer should become careless and lose his Christian balance, will he not cause those who are weak in the faith to stumble? Will he not cause some good-will persons to become cold toward God’s organization? Will they not misjudge it by his wrong action and speak evil of it? Great damage can be done by the Christian who loses his balance. This should never be forgotten or ignored. But if we permit reason, not passion, and logic, not emotion, to move us, we will find it much easier to maintain our equilibrium, our balance, our conduct right among the nations. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 19-21</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Because you kept the message about my endurance, I will also keep you from the hour of test.—Rev. 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God’s kingdom message tells us that endurance in his worship and service is vital. Preaching that message calls for endurance, the kind that Christ displayed. In our endurance we must be Christlike. He did not quit, he did not give into the enemy, he did not give up the service and the spiritual war. He kept on doing his Father’s will. He held out to the bitter end. So he was resurrected to an eternity of triumph. There is benefit in conforming ourselves to the message about his endurance. We are kept from the hour of test now on the whole earth. How? Just as Jesus was. When faced with a choice of all the kingdoms of this world, he rejected the kingdom of Satan. He chose the kingdom of God by choosing to worship Jehovah and not Satan to whom all man-made kingdoms belonged. By holding to that initial decision Jesus was upheld all through the test of his integrity. Likewise we, by holding fast to our decision to serve Jehovah, will be able to stand.

<p><span class="font0">Each issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> should be eagerly awaited and its contents consumed with relish. And we should study it with the thought in mind of “bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.” (Col. 1:10) That is the commendable attitude. We should put our spiritual discernment to good use by aiding others. This can be done at the weekly congregational meetings, where there are many new ones who find it hard to understand the truths presented. Here is where our comment will open up to the minds of the newer ones an understanding of a point not clear to them. So in our advance personal study of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font0"> we should not overlook this privilege. Prepare to that end by possibly underlining or noting such outstanding points. Then at the suitable moment during the meeting let us be quick to contribute our share to the study for the edifying of others. We can thus also be inciting others to love and right works in making this public declaration. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0"> 25-27</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Our Father . . . , do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Matt. 6:9, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, praying for Jehovah’s blessing upon our efforts implies that we ourselves are doing all we can, putting forth our best efforts. For us to pray without acting in line with our prayers would be hypocrisy. God does not do for us what we can do for ourselves. We can hope to reap only if we do not give out in doing what is right. While it is God who makes it grow, let us not forget that there would be nothing for God to make grow had Paul not first planted and Apollos watered. Nor may we expect God to answer our prayers if we act the opposite from the way we pray. How can God answer our prayer, “Do not bring us into temptation,” if we get careless about making straight paths for our feet or, worse yet, walk deliberately into temptation ? Whatever may be the exact import of those words of Jesus, one thing is certain: they commit us to a course of avoiding temptations. So ask for what we will, by our very asking we obligate ourselves to do our part. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Think of the delightful life that will be ours in helping to restore the earth to paradisaic rest; of being on hand to greet the appreciative men and women receiving their promised resurrection, and who will enjoy God’s new world with the Armageddon survivors. If we consider the joys set before us, we will, like Jesus, sell all we have to gain that new world. Each privilege granted us is like a signpost assuring us that we are on the right road, heading in the right direction. This is not the broad, spacious road of ingratitude that leads off to certain destruction. The road leading off to life is the road of appreciation. (Matt. 7: 13, 14) Let us be among the few who find it We can, by appreciating our privileges at the world’s end. May we appraise highly whatever gifts and privileges God extends to us, faithfully using them to his honor. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 18-20a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">This shows that we must be led by Jehovah’s spirit and must constantly respond and go forward under the leading of that spirit. It shows too that, as an organization and as individuals therein, we must walk in God’s statutes, keep his ordinances, doing the things that he outlines for us to do. These requirements we cannot meet by conforming to the old world and by relinquishing our privileges of ministering. Now is not the time to take on old worldliness. _ Now is the time to progress in new worldliness. These requirements that God has laid down in his Word are necessary for increase. It is the keeping of these requirements that has brought Jehovah’s blessing and increase until now. It is the keeping of these requirements in the days ahead that will continue his blessing and prosperity. Foremost is the principle that it is Jehovah that gives the increase, and we as his servants merely serve obediently in love.—1 Cor. 3: G-9. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/1</span><span class="font0"> 4-6a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The true slave will subject himself completely and irrevocably to the service of his Master. Blessed and happy will be the lot of those slaves of Christ, because the Father’s blessing will include inheriting the kingdom that was provided for such faithful slaves. Slavery with this righteous Master can be a happy and desirable position even for his other sheep. That is why we are so happy at this time. We recognize that we are in covenant relationship with Jehovah and have vowed to be in servitude to his every command. Rather than seeing how the limiting bonds given us as slaves may be stretched to suit our own desires, let us say: ‘How can I conform my course of action to be absolutely certain that I am within the restrictions set by the Master?’ The righteous course, free from rebellious tendencies, means life forever to the faithful, willing slaves. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 4/1</span><span class="font0"> 5-7a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It is important, too, that Jesus went to a dedicated servant of Almighty God to have the baptism performed. Just as Jesus went to a dedicated servant for baptism, he told his eleven faithful apostles to “make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them . . . , teaching them.” (Matt. 28: 19, 20) These words Jesus addressed not to the priests, Sadducees, or Pharisees, but only to those apostles who were loyal ambassadors of his. Furthermore, we notice that they were told to make disciples of people. That meant to give to others instruction and information first, and then it was upon this condition that later they were baptized, and by the same dedicated servants of God. At that time they heard and received the truth only through Jehovah’s witnesses. Today a similar situation exists. People hear and receive instruction of the truth only from those that are true witnesses and dedicated servants of God, and the baptizing should be performed by persons that have previously been baptized. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 3a</span></p>

Even Jonathan the son of the rejected king Saul displayed unbreakable loving-kindness to David because he was Jehovah’s chosen one. Today we find faithful imitators of those ancient backers and upholders of David. The great crowd who come to a knowledge of God’s kingdom covenant with Christ and his joint heirs now loyally give their support to the Permanent Heir of the everlasting covenant. What if they are of so many diversified nations, tribes, peoples and languages? This does not influence them against giving their allegiance to God’s government in the heavens. They address themselves to Him on his throne and to his Lamblike Son Jesus Christ and hail them. With a loud voice they unitedly cry out in public confession in the words stated above.

<p><span class="font0">What is it that gives such force to the words of Jesus? Why is his speech so persuasive? First of all, because he taught the truth and he had Jehovah’s spirit. Also, it was because he presented it in terms that his hearers could easily grasp. Fishermen would easily grasp the idea when he illustrated his points with fish and nets. Who that knew anything about farming would not appreciate his comments on the harvest, men working in a vineyard, a hen with her chicks, an animal caught in a pit, and the weather? To others, references to wages and to Gehenna, Jerusalem’s city dump, would vividly convey thoughts. Jesus was flexible, adaptable in his presentation of the truth. The message itself did not change in the least, but he understood the people he was teaching because he was interested in them, and he approached the subject from their viewpoint. He watched for the reaction of his hearers and then took it into consideration in his further comments. He associated points difficult to accept with things well known.

<p><span class="font0">When Jesus walked the earth he began to teach, not a new doctrine, but a summary of the Law, namely, Love God -—love your neighbor. Today, as his followers we must be his sincere pupils, anxious to know what he has to say. A pupil must be interested in and love his instructor in order to grasp the ideas of his teacher. If the instructor has the opportunity of being with a devoted pupil long enough, his student will soon be like his instructor and will walk and live like him. That is exactly what happened with the disciples of Jesus. When he said to them the words quoted above he meant that he would take the time to explain to them all the difficulties and problems of life and he would help them overcome the world, even as he had overcome it. After having been taught by Jesus we are obligated to tell others about the refreshing things he taught us, W </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1/1</span><span class="font0"> 10, 8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It is not needful for us to enter into fornication to get to know what it is like by experience and thus “know the ‘deep things of Satan.’ ” The Judge who knows by principle what it is warns against it. His warning is sufficient. Then Christ will not put upon us a burden of responsibility and we will keep free from congregational responsibility for bad conditions inside it Therefore let women see their proper position in the congregation. On proper occasions let them wear a head covering as a sign of submission, as a sign of not trying to usurp the position of the man, whether as a star overseer or as a ministerial servant. Let them not induce any brother to fornication, spiritually or bodily. Let all the congregation jealously guard what it has, the Christian purity of doctrine and of conduct and the treasure of Kingdom witnessing. Then Christ’s coming as Executioner of judgment will be, not with mortal punishment, but with New World rewards. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 19, 21a</span></p>

A cutting, sharp tongue seldom is a good teacher. Our hearts go out to the people who have been “skinned and knocked about like sheep without a shepherd.” Although they may coldly reject the message when we call, we do not hold it against them. We know it means life for them if they embrace the truth. Because of this loving attitude on our part thousands have learned the truth. Being wise, our heart, or seat of motive, is stirred by love. That helps us to keep in focus the real situation of the people we serve and to show insight in dealing with them.

In his highly organized New World society he has a properly assigned place for each: for appointed servants and for congregation publishers, for those old and those young in years, for part-time and for full-time ministers. It is therefore most important for every one of us to find our proper place quickly in this association. And having found our place in the constellation of the New World society, we must remain faithfully in it Only thus may we hope to survive Armageddon and live forever in eternal peace and happiness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 19, 20</span></p>

We deplore the fact that the inspired Word of the Universal Sovereign is ignored due to the delinquency of the religious leaders of Christendom, who have made the people forget the holy name of the Sovereign God by various religious means, whereas we, His witnesses, take the greatest pleasure in honoring and vindicating that holy name and in confessing before all men that the name by which He alone is distinguished is Jehovah—Ps. 83: 18. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 6-8a</span></p>

Such Babylonish self-indulgence and unspiritual worldliness would, be certain to induce drowsiness and case-taking and to throw us off guard, and to stifle prayer to God.

<p><span class="font0">That the great Sovereign of the universe should provide for weak, imperfect and sinful creatures of dust to come into his presence whenever they wish and with whatever is on their hearts and minds surely is another proof that “God is love.” And, conversely, is not prayer an expression of love on our part, love for God and for our brothers? In making a dedication we did not dedicate ourselves to an impersonal cause, but to a person, our loving heavenly Father. We may liken our prayers to longdistance telephone calls that a child, while away from home, makes to his father. Our heavenly Father has made all the provisions, he has taken care of all the expenses—and do not think that it did not cost him something. It did, the life of his only-begotten Son—and it makes his heart glad for us to call on him in prayer, for he truly loves us. We like to visit with those we love, do we not? If we love our heavenly Father we will visit with him often. Do we as much as we might, or are we lacking in appreciation of his affection for us? </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 20, 21a</span></p>

Has there been failure to feed them, not following up on back-calls, not conducting Bible studies with them, not helping them at the meetings? When they have been weak, have we quickly gone to their aid, or have we shown indifference? If they have been spiritually sick, have we cared for them?

We know that only those who willingly receive the mark in the seat of their intelligence will survive Armageddon. It is because we love our neighbors that we urge them to become reconciled to God, “whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.” (Ezek. 2: 7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AS) </span><span class="font0">Those who will respond to the message and receive the mark are described as “a great crowd, which no man was able to number.” Well aware of that fact, none of us may take it upon ourselves to say that because a certain territory has been covered many times the work in it is done and no more sheep are to be found in it.

<p><span class="font0">It is the responsibility of the overseer “star” to light the way back for those against whom Christ holds loss of their first love. They should take steps to stir up in these losers their original love. Their love of Christ’s sheep will move overseers to go out and try to bring back those staying away from meetings or becoming careless. They will try to counteract the danger of love growing cold, for no loser of one’s first love can be a final member of God's congregation. (Matt. 24:12) It is time, therefore, to remember what one has fallen from, and then sorrowfully change one’s mind and get back to doing former deeds. Otherwise one will not be acting as part of a lampstand, namely, letting one’s light shine. If an overseer should let all his sheep grow loveless and fall away and cease to shine, Christ would, in effect, remove his lampstand. So he must see to it that the lampstand or congregation lights up its part of the “field.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5a</span></p>

The goal at the end of the road is worth all the effort and endurance necessary to maintain good balance. Our future is a bright one, an endless one, if we keep our eyes on the goal ahead and our feet firmly planted on the road of Christian integrity underneath. With good spiritual balance we can walk that narrow way as sure-footedly as a skilled tightwire walker walks his thin wire. It is only by maintaining our balance in all things that we will reach our goal. And in the process of getting there we will be dependable and useful instruments in the hands of Jehovah God and his theocratic organization. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 31, 32a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The great Source of the good news of good things, Jehovah God, is the One that sends his messengers on foot to declare his message. (Isa. 52:7) Isaiah himself exemplified that fact. This was at the time that he had a miraculous vision of Jehovah of armies enthroned in his temple. When Isaiah heard the seraphs declaring the holiness of Jehovah he felt so unholy and unclean that he feared for his life. At his outcry one of the seraphs cleansed him. After Isaiah was in this cleansed condition he heard God asking for someone to be sent and to go on a mission. Isaiah looked upon it as a high honor to be sent by God and to go for him on a mission. The offer was open to a clean person that would willingly offer himself. Isaiah leaped at the rare privilege. His offer of himself was accepted. Today it is likewise the privilege of both the remnant and the great crowd of other sheep to respond eager! v to '•alls for service.

Covetousness is really the power of wrong desire at work, and in time one’s thoughts will give way to action, for, where the treasure is, there the heart will be also. How profitable it is, then, not to allow our thinking to dwell on materialistic improper desires!

<p><span class="font0">Job had everything, lost it all, and still loved Jehovah and did not sin against him. Jesus Christ gave up his heavenly glory and took the form of a man. Why? Because he loved his Father. And so with Christians today. It is right to give Jehovah true worship. It is right to follow his commandments. It is right to endure the sufferings that come from the Devil’s organization and his worldly government for speaking the truth. Because one walks in his integrity and lives by right principles he is happy. Many times one endures physical torture, isolation in concentration camps, withdrawal of his freedom of speech, but yet he holds to right principles to preach the good news of God’s kingdom when and wherever he can do so, and he is pronounced happy. He is happy! The lives of Jehovah’s witnesses over the past six thousand years prove this to be true. The experiences of Jehovah’s witnesses in communistic countries prove this to be true.

Instead of acting upon our own impulses, why not consider the unselfish suggestion recommended by Jesus in the words quoted above? These commandments, rather than giving freedom of choice, extremely limit the course of action that could be pleasing to Jehovah. They remove self-choice entirely. In fact, these words crowd out of one’s life any desire other than that of complete obedience to Jehovah. This was the blueprint of life for Jesus and will be for his followers. When we dedicate our life to Jehovah God, we vow that we will follow the footsteps established by the Master Servant. This means that we must be a slave to our Master.

In rubbing elbows with our fellow Christian we may at times have our feelings hurt and because thereof cherish a little resentment. But when we hear him humbly, earnestly and in childlike simplicity represent us in prayer to God, all resentment melts away.

Slaps may sting but be lifesaving for us. “The wounds inflicted by a lover are faithful.” (Prov. 27:6) Testifying to the same are the above-quoted words of David, who did not despise reproof.

From the case of Satan and from Paul’s warning about a newly converted man’s serving as an overseer, it becomes apparent that the possession of authority and responsibility makes one susceptible to pride. There was proud and powerful Haman, whose pride led to his downfall. There was proud Nebuchadnezzar, who lost his sanity after glowing with pride over his achievements. There was King Belshazzar, who refused to humble himself and so lost a kingdom and his life. There was the pride of Herod, who arrogated glory to himself instead of giving it to God and so was eaten up with worms.

So let all of us be warned by the reproof given to the Laodiceans. We must overcome the materialism of this world in this time of the end. To each conquering one Christ promises a heavenly throne. To the conquering other sheep he promises a position before his throne, a position of loving favor in the new earth of God’s new world of righteousness. Shine on, then, you overseers, as stars in Christ’s right hand, acting as his angels to the congregations. Shine on, you congregations, as lampstands that he retains in their place. May he give you his careful attention and protection, that you may even shed forth light to enlighten all who will be saved forever. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/15</span><span class="font0"> 36, 38, 39a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Heb. 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Looking intently at Jesus’ fine appreciation for what is worth while, we correctly learn to evaluate things. We can also despise reproach from all who oppose our Christian course. The joy of serving Jehovah forever will be the thing of value in our lives. We will copy Jesus’ example and gladly sell our interest in anything that would prevent our gaining the Kingdom. Valuable lessons in appreciation Jesus gave us in his illustrations of the treasure hidden in a field and of the pearl of high value. (Matt. 13:44-46) Jesus had appreciation, he recognized the true value of serving God. He sold all and even gave up his earthly life to gain the Kingdom. Satan tested Jesus’ appreciation by offers of selfish gain, but nothing in Satan's system of things could attract Jesus and influence him to lessen the high value he set on the Kingdom. Nor did his treasure of Kingdom service depreciate with time; it grew in appreciation and undoubtedly still does. That is the example Paul wants us to copy.

<p><span class="font0">The deplorable conditions that exist world-wide are known to all. Nineteen centuries ago our Christian brother, the apostle Paul, wrote an advance description of what we have observed to be the condition. (2 Tim. 3:1-5, 12, 13) In view thereof, our getting together from the four quarters of the globe for the Divine Will International Assembly stands for no small achievement. It was, however, nothing over which to boast on our own part. Almighty God is the One who brought it all about. He himself spread for us the most appetizing spiritual feast that we enjoyed there, and he issued to us the loving invitation through his visible organization on earth. He also provided the means for so many, many thousands of us to get there. He protected and preserved us on the way there, and his protection was over us in that assembly. He brought us to that occasion that hail no equal. To him we tender all the credit. With the abovequoted words of Zechariah we heartily agree! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/1</span><span class="font0"> 11,8</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Our money may be taken away from us but not our accurate knowledge—if we have made it sure. It keeps us filled with joy under all circumstances. With this accurate knowledge and our faith we face up to our enemies, especially the spiritual forces in our spiritual warfare. Calmly and with confidence in Jehovah we stand forth as his witnesses. bearing fruit even in adversity, and offering accurate knowledge to others. We can do this because we know we are never alone. This knowledge makes us a strong defense. Doubtless many more of us will suffer persecution in many lands, even as many still suffer in totalitarian lands, while Satan makes his last stand against Jehovah. To survive in the warfare we must be strong of mind. Therefore, while we have the opportunity of taking in so much accurate knowledge of Jehovah from his Word, let us become filled with accurate knowledge as a defense in these evil days. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 20, 22a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">One fact we should not overlook. Jesus and his apostles and disciples were, one and all, sent by none other than Jehovah of armies. They were signs and wonders from Him I That is the One by whom all who come to do God’s will today want to be sent. Of what power and authority is it for us to be sent by any one of the religious sects or national or world religious groups if we are not sent by Jehovah of armies as Isaiah and Jesus and his twelve apostles were? It is to Jehovah of armies through his Sign, Immanuel, the Lord Jesus Christ, that we have come, to do Jehovah's will, just as Immanuel himself came to do it when he was baptized. Come we must, and offer ourselves we must, willing to be sent and to go anywhere we are sent, if we want to be accepted and be sent by Jehovah of armies. In this course we want to imitate Isaiah and Jesus Christ. Otherwise we should be doing the will of religious organizations of Christendom. In this time of the end we want to do the divine will, the will of Jehovah of armies. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">For our sakes our undershepherd brothers have gladly given all they had to serve us so that we may live in the peace and favor of God. They have assisted us so as to know how to preach the good news of the Kingdom, how to make known the marvelous purposes of our heavenly Father. We have been trained to do these things ourselves and have been taught how to train still others to do them. We have been united, and the lost sheep have been brought into the fold. How wonderfully favored we are to be God’s sheep and cared for by faithful shepherds ! Yes, now the time has come to increase the flock. And let us not forget that the prosperity of the flock is best promoted when shepherds are mindful of their great responsibility to God and Christ. The members of the organization, the Lord’s sheep, can facilitate the fulfillment of the duties of these shepherds by obedience and submissiveness. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15 </span><span class="font0">28, 29a</span></p>

I have chosen to stand at the threshold in the house of my God rather than to move around in the tents of wickedness.—Ps. 84:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The perspective we take is important to our maintaining spiritual stability. A good perspective helps create the proper evaluation of our ministry. We cannot divorce ourselves from God’s organization and consider it of no value to us. We need it for spiritual food, for its association, for its encouragement, and we need it for direction and instruction in the ministry. We cannot get along without it. Having the right perspective of God’s purposes will give us a clear view of the important place the theocratic organization holds in those purposes. We will see how it is doing the great work Jesus foretold at Matthew 24: 14 and how God is blessing it and causing it to prosper. We will always cherish it and stay close to it. We need the help it can give that we may maintain our balance ou the narrow way to life. We wall therefore voice the appreciation of the psalmist, as noted above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 12,13a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—1 Pet. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are not many people in the world today that will stand for right principles and even suffer for them. Jehovah loves those who will. He is very much interested in men and women who will walk in their integrity and who will endure even to death for righteousness. Peter appreciated this fact and so wrote as above. That is something to think about, for no individual has ever endured as much pain, ignominy and shame as the perfect Jesus went through for the vindication of Jehovah’s name. This was a thing agreeable with God. Then there was Job in his sufferings. (Jas. 5: 11) Why is this suffering allowed, and for what reason do we endure? The answer is integrity. Will we worship Jehovah because we love him, or because we must? Because we get happiness, or because it brings us a reward? Jesus kept his integrity because he loved his Father and was happy in his service. If we love our Father and are happy in his service we too will endure.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You have purified your souls by your obedience to the truth with unhypocritical brotherly love.—1 Pet. 1:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The response to the truth of God’s Word by persons results in their becoming worshipers of God, and thus it is that the truth is the instrumentality of gathering and of increase. This really means that the increase is on the terms that God has set out in his Word. That is to say, in order for a person to become a Christian and be in line for New World blessings, it is necessary that he meet God’s terms, obey his commandments. God does not change his requirements or modify, weaken or lessen them to induce people to love and serve him. In view of the fact that it is our response to the truth or our conformity to the Bible that enables us to be Jehovah’s witnesses, or to be in the New World society in the first place, it follows unquestionably that to continue and progress in this joyful, happy, blessed relationship to God we must continue to obey his Word. This we must do respecting all the issues of life. We continue to serve Jehovah on his terms, not on ours. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W</span><span class="font0"> 2/1 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—2 Cor. 12:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our service as shepherds should be unstinting. The apostle Paul did not think of his personal comforts. He was beaten with rods, was stoned, was in dangers at sea, in the cities, spent sleepless nights— why? So he might give a good account to God who, through Christ, had charged him: “I am sending you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God.” (Acts 26: 17, 18) Are you like Paul, or do you shrink back from giving your strength, your time, or from suffering, or from giving up your own comforts for the sheep? Are you spending and being spent for the sheep? All the apostles spent and were spent. And if you have problems, do not burden your sheep with them. Rather, discuss them with other shepherds, and if they cannot help you, take them to the Chief Shepherd, Jehovah God. “Cast all your anxiety upon him, because he cares for you.” (1 Pet. 5:7) He will take your burden and answer your prayers. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 10, 8a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Phil. 3:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We must do as did the apostle Paul, whether our goal be life in the heavens or life upon a paradisaic earth. Perhaps, as did he, we can organize our life to take hold of the glorious treasure of full-time Bethel, missionary or pioneer service. And having taken such a forward step, let us make it our determination to hold on to our privileges of service. It is easy to step aside and let someone else take over, but the pattern set out for us in the Bible is that of faithful servants who stuck to their work. Certainly Jesus gave us the foremost example. Then there is Abraham who accepted a foreign service assignment when he was seventy-five years old, and he stayed in it for a hundred years, until the time of his death. May it be the determination of every one of us to copy these patterns of faithfulness. Having begun the course, let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.—Heb. 12:1, 2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">What has made us one Christian people despite the fact that we come from so many diversified peoples is that we have separated ourselves from this world and its hateful conflicts and have dedicated ourselves through Jesus Christ to our one God and heavenly Father, _ and we sincerely pray to him in unity: “Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth” ; not the will of the worldly nations under their god Satan. We are thankful to Jehovah that our earthly organization is theocratic because it is ruled by God the Most High as head over all, and our Leader under Him is no political dictator but is Jesus Christ our Right Shepherd, and God’s holy spirit is the active force that moves us and accomplishes God’s will through us, even as Paul recognizes in the text cited above. Also, the inspired Holy Scriptures are our book of law and instruction and highest education.

<p><span class="font0">When we find one who responds to the voice of the Right Shepherd, is our job done? No, we must call back to study the Bible with him so he learns what he must do. We should take great care to be sure that he is really learning, that he understands the points, and is making progress toward maturity. Not all will progress at the same pace, but by careful organization the spiritual development of each one will receive proper attention. Encourage the new one to express himself, even as noted above. And if when the comment is given, it appears not to have been given with understanding, show yourself a good teacher by discussing the point further and drawing out more comments from the student. Teach the student to reason things out, to see their relation to things previously learned, to include in his answers the scriptures that prove them to be right. Repeat important points so they will not be forgotten. IV </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">9/1</span><span class="font0"> 18a</span></p>

They grossly deceived all mankind by advocating an abominable counterfeit for God’s true kingdom, and they brought great reproach upon the Most High God. Thank God, however, that the kingdom of God did not fail with the League of Nations. Though the League died an eternal death, God’s kingdom has continued to rule. From 1920 onward Jehovah’s witnesses have exposed it as being the “abomination of desolation&quot;’ mentioned by Jesus in his prophecy on the end of this world. Jehovah’s witnesses dissociated the League of Nations from God’s kingdom and declared that the League would fail. They have devoted themselves to carrying out Jesus’ prophetic command at Matthew 24:14. at the same time warning all men of good will to heed the above-quoted words. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 10/15</span><span class="font0"> 20,21</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">To prove by the Bible that he was sent by Jehovah and therefore was ordained by him, Jesus on a Saturday went into the synagogue of Nazareth, where he had been known only as a carpenter. Mounting the speaker’s stand he called for the book scroll of Isaiah to be given to him. Unrolling it he found the words of Isaiah 61: 1. 2, and read them as recorded above. When Jesus had rolled up the scroll and sat down to preach he said: “Today this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.” In this way he became a living, speaking sign to them that the Messiah, the Christ, Jehovah’s Sent and Anointed One, was present. He became a wonderful portent indicating that deliverance was at hand, for Jehovah’s acceptable year had come, and that in him, the King, God’s kingdom was in the midst of the Jews.

<p><span class="font0">As lovers of Jehovah let us thoughtfully appraise our situation, Let us realize that keeping pace with the New World society and growing in spiritual stature are vital in fighting materialism. On this issue of life and death let us take counsel from the organization and apply it to our everlasting good. Remember that godly devotion is to be pursued, not materialism, and that it is not safe to venture beyond the bounds of the New World society. No, not even though we may feel strong enough to resist the enticing lure of materialism out there. Let us never forget for one moment that others have succumbed. Materialism is deadly. It is a sowing to the flesh. Recognize its ever-present dangers. It is no respecter of persons. Therefore, in company with your faithful brothers all over the world, fight materialism for your life.

They will work to increase the attendance of members at meetings. They will bring the message up to date by incorporating fresh, live doctrines as these are revealed. They will strive to enlarge the activity of the congregation in all the needed forms of service. They will widen out the witness and drive it home more.

<p><span class="font0">Lack of appreciation stems from failure to recognize one’s spiritual need, for one cannot love and appreciate God until one comes to know who He is, what he stands for, how he thinks and what his loving purpose is toward his creatures. We must therefore fight the plague of ingratitude by diligently studying God’s Word. More than at any other time, we have so much for which to be grateful. The long-awaited Kingdom government has been installed in heavenly office and has already begun ruling in the midst of its enemies. It is here to stay. We can stay too if we appreciate the need to support it with full allegiance and devotion, seeking first the Kingdom in our lives. The King’s invisible presence makes this a day of judgment. The most searching loyalty test in history is now in progress.

When they were exposed, they did reap thorns. Fruitfulness could not possibly come from their rebellion—only thorns. (Jer. 12:13) There is no fruitful yield from loathsome works. Today, too, persons of that mind become grieved when God’s anger is exercised against them through his organization, and they are cast outside: or even if their secret deeds of evil are not known by God’s visible organization so that proper disciplinary action can be taken, Jehovah is still aware of this and such ones soon become very sick spiritually, because they do not have his favor, his blessings or his spirit any longer. Jehovah does not tolerate the lawless ones. Rebels are cast outside of Jehovah’s favor for not adhering to his strict and righteous principles.

Everyone in attendance has the privilege of answering. It is a spirited meeting, enjoyed by all. It is not a place to come and sleep. Each one there should be present not only physically but also “in spirit.” Accurate knowledge cannot be assimilated by one asleep. In Gethsemane Jesus asked his disciples, whom he had requested to watch while he prayed, “How can you sleep?” Yes, how can we sleep when the words of life are being discussed? Jesus promised that where there are two or three met together in his name, he will be in their midst. Certainly no one wants to sleep with such an important guest present ! Nor should we let our minds wander from the important spiritual matters under discussion onto mundane things. Forget them and concentrate on taking in accurate knowledge.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Luke 18:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With true humility one gains the ability to see himself as he really is; likewise he is able to see others as they are. Being free from any need to belittle their qualities and successes, he can heartily appreciate what they are and do. By reason of humility, then, one thinks of himself no more highly than he ought to think. True humility will keep even persons with superior education from puffing up and stumbling by reason of pride. How distorted the world’s view of humility, that it is weakness or a cloak to conceal weakness I Actually pride is weakness; humility is strength. Christ Jesus was the humblest man that ever walked the earth. Yet he was the strongest of the strong, the most courageous of the courageous, the wisest of the wise. What great works he did, yet he disclaimed all personal credit ! Far from being a cloak for a lack of intelligence or energy, humility is true strength and health. It is the steppingstone to glory, as Jesus shows in the words quoted above. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 9/15</span><span class="font0"> 22-24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Heb. 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While millions of the people today ought to be taught the truth in God’s Word, there are not enough qualified ministers to teach them. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses are themselves new in the truth and as yet have not taken upon themselves the responsibility of teaching others. They are preaching from house to house, but they have not assumed the duties of a teacher. How long must one wait to be a teacher? That is not hard to decide. Paul indicates that as soon as one knows the fundamental teachings of God’s Word, then he should begin teaching at least these truths to others. As he matures he can help others in advanced study, but before that he could be a teacher. If the other person he meets in the field while witnessing knows nothing or only a little of God’s Word, the new Kingdom publisher could at least teach his pupil as much as he knows by using the Bible as his textbook. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 1/1</span><span class="font0">17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It is one thing to find a pearl of groat value. It is quite another thing to keep from losing it. It was one thing for Adam and Eve to find themselves in the Edenic garden of perfection ; it was quite another matter whether they proved worthy of remaining in it forever. It is truly important for us to find and take our proper places in the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses without delay. But once we are in it, it is even more imperative for us to keep that precious place faithfully. It is not so much who comes into the truth as it is who remains in the truth, for there is no such thing as “once saved always saved.” It may seem almost unthinkable that a person like the apostle Paul would ever lose his place, yet he saw the ever-present danger of doing that very thing. To prevent such a calamitous thing from happening to him he said that he browbeat his body and led it as a slave. (1 Cor. 9:27) We must do the same if we would endure to the finish and he saved. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> la</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—John 10:4, 5,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Natural sheep are harmless, inoffensive, docile creatures and completely lacking in guile. They respond to kindness and are obedient to the call of their shepherd. All the shepherd has to do is to call the name of the sheep, and the sheep goes running to him. Sheep are quite defenseless on their own, yet they are exposed to many dangers, such as wild animals and robbers. Where, then, does their defense lie? First, in keeping together with the other sheep in the fold, and, secondly, in trusting a faithful shepherd who keeps watch over them. So it is with the Lord’s sheep at the present time. We really have no means of defending ourselves against attack of ferocious men and organizations of this world. Our defense is in keeping with the flock of God within the fold and in trusting with all our heart the Great Shepherd, Jehovah, and the Right Shepherd. Jesus Christ, and our faithful brothers who are appointed to be shepherds of the flock. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 3/15</span><span class="font0"> 21a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">When we err self-examination is good, but not self-condemnation, for it may lead to spiritual sickness. For such the above-quoted words of James are the remedy. Be willing to get counsel from brothers and follow the good advice they give from the Scriptures. Jehovah has made this provision for his servants so that they can grow strong again, to be useful to him in his service. Sometimes one who is spiritually sick or has done wrong is afraid he may receive correction or chastening or embarrassment ; but this correction is good for him and should be accepted in the knowledge that Jehovah chastens those he loves. It is not to break the spirit of the offender. Afterward he will be much stronger for it. It is by getting accurate knowledge of how to proceed and by following it that we can regain happiness and be protected from falling again in the same way. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/15</span><span class="font0"> 17a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Ps. 121:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In relation to God's spiritual temple and his pure worship, the purpose of staying awake and keeping on the watch is to keep his pure worship undefiled from the intrusion of any unclean persons and of any uncleanness from this Babylonish old world. It is to see to it that the pure and acceptable worship is maintained, promoted and brought to others in order that the lifesaving benefits may flow from it to others and that God may thus be honored and exalted. All true Christians, who are the ones favored with having the one and only God-given religion, are responsible to keep on the watch, as long as they are in this Babylonish world. They must keep watch with God's help, trusting in the assistance of his holy angels and in the activity of his holy spirit, even as indicated above. Our watching and guarding may be imperfect and incomplete, but God’s watching is perfect and is over everything concerned and is able to see through any emergency. We need to have him watch with us. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 17</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Counsel in the heart of a man is as deep waters, hut the man of discernment is one that will draw it up.—Prov. 20: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a person holding a responsible position has many important decisions to make, he may lose sight of the fact that he is merely a servant of Jehovah. He should remember what happened to Moses and Aaron, and humble himself before God. Humility must not be lost sight of no matter what position we may hold in God’s organization. (Jas. 4:10) Humility is essential to our having the right mental attitude. The person who has it is willing to accept counsel from others. No matter what position he may hold he knows that he is imperfect and can profit from counsel. He will encourage others to speak the counsel that is in their hearts. He will not let his position create a barrier that will cause that counsel to stay in their hearts. He knows that he needs it more than anyone else because of the load of responsibility that rests upon his shoulders. The humble overseer who draws that counsel out is insuring the maintenance of a good mental attitude.

I tell you, He will cause justice to be done to them speedily.—Luke 18:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do we love our brothers? One way in which we can show this is by praying for them. In addition to the fine examples given by Jesus, such as that recorded at John chapter 17, we have those of Paul. When unable to be personally present with his brothers he not only wrote loving letters of instruction and encouragement, but also kept praying for them. To mention but two examples : “I continue mentioning you in my prayers.” “I continue praying, that your love may abound yet more and more.” In this respect also let us imitate Paul as he imitated Christ. Especially should we remember our brothers who have the greater responsibilities, and those who may be suffering persecution. If our hearts go out to these brothers, we will “keep on asking” in behalf of them, even as Jesus urged upon us in his illustration of the importunate widow. —Luke 18:1-8. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/15</span><span class="font0"> 23, 24a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Phil. 1:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Appreciation is a matter of the heart, and the heart involves the question of what we really love; it takes perfect love to cast out fear. (1 John 4:17, 18) It is fear that is restraining the love of some for God and his kingdom and for their neighbors, whom they ought to be busily telling about the Kingdom. Our brothers in Russian slave camps or behind prison bars in the Dominican Republic are not <sub>#</sub> afraid of persecution that is already happening to them. They have love and appreciation and with it Jehovah’s spirit and blessing. Jehovah inspired Paul to put down such appreciation-building counsel, as in the abovequoted verse together with its context. (See also 2 Timothy 2:3.) Our brothers in prisons and slave camps appreciate Paul’s words. They know that their endurance is an indication from Jehovah God that he is with them and that salvation will be their reward. They agree with Paul: It is a privilege to suffer in Jesus’ behalf. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 8, 9a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Materialism warped the appreciation of Gehazi, Elisha’s co-worker. Because he misappraised the value of material things he was smitten with leprosy. (2 Ki. 5:20-27) Certainly this leper no longer could enjoy the privilege of serving Jehovah with Elisha. So we must beware that materialism now at the world’s end does not lead us into an unfit condition where we can no longer acceptably serve God. This is the especially acceptable season to seek God’s kingdom and righteousness. Doing so, his King will seek us and our welfare at Armageddon. This world’s religion, politics, business and diversions are purported to be valuable. God’s Word correctly appraises them as worthless as far as aiding us to gain everlasting life. If any part of this world were truly valuable, worth the warmth of satisfaction that so many seem to find in it, would Jehovah be about to destroy it? That he is, John assures us in the above-quoted words. So let us not be deceived by what it has to offer. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 2/15</span><span class="font0"> 15, 16a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">It is not we but God who keeps making his organization grow. So when we consider how to improve our ministry we do not propose the injection of ideas and schemes of men for gathering together people and building up a huge organization. The organization is God’s, and only those who are drawn to it by him because of being sheeplike persons who love him, his Son and his kingdom and who have listened to his Word in belief have a place in it. Since it is by means of his spirit that Jehovah performs this work, his people are anxious for there to be evidence of the operation of that spirit in their ministry by bringing forth fruit. If such is lacking, they study again the ways and means used by Jesus Christ and endeavor to copy him more closely. By thus responding to the guidance of the Bible, which was recorded under inspiration of holy spirit, they open the way for God's spirit to operate more freely in their lives, bringing forth the fruitage in their ministry that honors God. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 5/1</span><span class="font0"> 18a</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away, and every one bearing fruit he cleans, that it may bear more fruit.—John 15:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the above-quoted words Jesus gives a very fitting illustration of how those grafted into the fruit-bearing New World society should keep their respective places. These words also show the terrible consequences befalling him who has his own way of doing things and who is not at oneness with the Head and others in the organization. If we become lax in our bearing fruit we are cleaned or trimmed in order that we may become more productive. So when corrected, instead of becoming offended and bucking against the organization, it is much wiser to keep one’s place and bear even more fruitage, for disgruntled ones are pitched outside. Yes, if we would keep our place in Jehovah’s New World society we must be obedient to the Superior Authorities, Jehovah and Christ, showing respect toward the central governing body, the traveling representatives of that body, as well as the overseers in the local congregations. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 7/15</span><span class="font0"> 8, 9, 5a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">We have a</sub> fearful responsibility resting upon us. We have accepted God’s name and he has favored us with the lifesaving message for all people. Great though the witness given has been thus far, we must strive to push out into new fields. Christendom stands doomed to suffer destruction with the world, in comparison with which the horrors of Jerusalem’s destruction in Jeremiah’s day will seem pale. The lives of countless sheeplike persons in all quarters of the earth are imperiled as the great day of destruction draws near. Our work is not done. Our obligation is to drive ahead with this witness work till the destruction overtakes a heedless, goatish world. We are dedicated to do the divine will. So this is our work according to God’s will for now. This is the work for which we have been brought to this hour.

<p><span class="font0">The stripping of a sleeping guard of his outer garments and the burning of these left the undependable guard naked. To his embarrassment his private parts thus became exposed. Not that God made any part of the human body shameful ; but that because of sin and immoral passion in the fallen flesh, self-respecting persons feel a measure of shame at having their private parts exposed to public gaze, bringing on scorn, ridicule and humiliation. So the rendering of the unfaithful ministerial guard naked is a punishment for his failure. To sheeplike men and to angels it shows that he has not been active in God’s seriice and has not been fulfilling his commission and his obligations under that commission. He has not been fulfilling the purpose of being a Christian, that of being one of Jehovah’s witnesses and ministers. Only in name has he been a Christian, having a mere form of godly devotion but really proving false to its power. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 28a</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The critical warning, “Look I I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments,” was given by the glorified Christ against a prophetic background now being dramatically staged on a world-wide scale. Kings, the rulers of the entire earth and the Rulers of heaven, are on the march I Throughout heaven and earth is heard the rumble of military hosts that are now being deployed for the battle of battles, the universal war of the Mountain of Megiddo. There is no neutrality in this war. Everybody alive is being forced to a decision, the consequence of which will be either life or death, survival or destruction. There is a pressing need to be aware of the issue and prove faithful and dependable on the right side of the issue. Note how the timely advice to do this, at verse 15, is interjected in the prophetic signs given long ago to foreshadow things now taking place, as recorded in verses 10 to 16 of Revelation chapter 16. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> la</span></p>

So both a dedication and water baptism acceptable to the true God will fully harmonize with the terms of the requirements written in God’s Word; and every willing learner will eagerly conform to such righteous requirements. In line with Jesus’ instructions above, the position of the Father must necessarily be known to the taught one. The name “Father” shows parenthood, priority. It refers to the superiority and rightful sovereignty of the true God, Jehovah, and also is a sign of the supreme authority of Jehovah. An appreciation of this unique position and power must be known by the learner or disciple. Also, he properly should be familiar with and recognize that there is a great issue of domination confronting the universe at this time and that a proper settlement of that issue will be successfully accomplished by Jehovah. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 8/1</span><span class="font0"> 7,8a</span></p>

It is one of the ways we can express our heartfelt gratitude for all God’s goodness. It is the way we can talk with God, unloading our troubles and worries upon him. Sincere prayer brings us near to God. But to pray with our minds on something else is not praying in sincerity. Such prayer is mechanical and meaningless. Whether we are praying privately or in a congregation our minds should be on what is said. Prayer is communication with the Creator and is certainly worthy of our closest attention. We must keep our minds stayed on Jehovah to maintain spiritual balance. Heartfelt prayers engender greater trust and dependence upon Jehovah.

Carrying out a peaceful or a violent revolution would mean we would merely substitute the government by other men with a government by ourselves. The end result would be no different. However, if we turn away from government of the earth by man, even by ourselves, to whom, then, can we turn? There is only one to whom to turn for successful rulership, and that is to God. Turn to him for earth’s government? Is that practical? Most certainly; just as much so as our turning to man for government of the earth has proved impractical by the results man has reaped today.

All day long and every day we must be worshipers of God, whether we are in meetings or away from our Kingdom Halls. After becoming a Christian one must be clean, as he has already been washed clean by the blood of Christ. Christ is not dying a second time to give one a second washing. Many who became Christians had walked with the wicked in fornication, idolatry, greed and drunkenness, but then they were washed clean. (1 Cor. 6:11) Like David, we must wash our hands in innocency, show everyone that we are clean and separate from the Devil’s organization and devoted to true worship. We are in the world but are no part of it, and we cannot have upon us the stain of its guilt. Pilate. not wanting the responsibility of the death of Jesus upon him, washed his hands literally.

<p><span class="font0">A valuable stimulant to awakeness is our privilege of prayer to God. More than need the brothers we need God; and the loving God has set up a communication system between himself and us. This provision was made because of our need for it. In his last visit with his disciples in the garden of Gethsemane Christ found prayer to his heavenly Father a great preventive of spiritual sleepiness. He must have prayed a considerable time, to come and find his trusted disciples sleeping on his return, causing him to say, among other things, the above-quoted words. Because of not praying they slept and entered into temptation. Jesus prayed and stayed awake and resisted the greatest temptation. In our warfare against the demons, including demon-inspired propaganda, we need more than the complete suit of armor from God ; we need prayer too. We need to be watchful for occasions to pray, realizing clearly what to pray for, as well as be kept awake by indulging in prayer.—1 Pet. 4: 7.

To lend no support to the fact that Jehovah would have witnesses on earth at this most critical time the same as he has had since the days of Abel, they willfully arrange to keep God's own name Jehovah out of their modern Bible translations. By their own example and course of action they deny that a true Christian must be, as Jesus Christ himself also was, a witness of Jehovah God. They pray the Lord’s Prayer, and yet they work against the very opening part of that Prayer, which says: “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.” (Matt. 6:9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">AV)</span><span class="font0"> For these vital reasons Jehovah says that he is against these prophet-preachers.

<p><span class="font0">From the very time that Jehovah established the covenant with David for the everlasting kingdom, that kingdom covenant became something demanding the loyal support and adherence of both God and man. The covenant was inseparably linked with King David and his line of royal successors. It was personified in David’s royal house, so that loyalty to the covenant meant loyalty to that house. Thus even though some considerable time after he had been so highly favored with this covenant David was overtaken in a set of shocking sins, Jehovah did not cancel the kingdom covenant with David but remained loyal to it, exercising loving-kindness. Our loyalty also must be directed to that covenant. Down to this year 1959, that is a principle from which we may never swerve if we are determined to please the great Proposer of the covenant, Jehovah God. We have Jehovah himself as our perfect Example of loyalty. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/1</span><span class="font0">14,15,17,18</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">If we would cultivate a right mental attitude we must be able to overlook imperfections in the organization and faults in fellow Christians. Although God’s spirit operates on the organization, it does not govern every decision and every movement of the human overseers. These men are free moral agents who are left to make decisions they feel best for the New World society. They are mature Christians who are capable of letting God’s Word and its principles guide them in making wise decisions. But should one mistakenly make an unwise decision, that should be no reason for a person’s becoming disgruntled and sour. It is no reason to become cynical. A well-balanced Christian will overlook mistakes and imperfections. He will remember that he is serving God, not men. And he will remember that except for Christ, God has always used imperfect men to care for his interests in the earth. If we have intense love for one another, then we will delight to cover over shortcomings. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 35</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Let him that thinks he has a firm position beware that he does not fall.—1 Cor. 10:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Only few have found the narrow way of integrity. Of those who have, some failed to maintain spiritual balance and fell. A few of these fallen ones recovered and made the difficult climb back. It was only by their sincere, heartfelt repentance and God's undeserved kindness that they were able to return to the road. How long they stay on it depends upon them. If they now act as wise persons by watching how they walk and by developing and maintaining good spiritual balance, they will be able to stay on the road until their goal of eternal life is reached. What happened to these as well as what happened to those who fell and did not recover should be a warning to all of us. We cannot be indifferent to the forces trying to make us fall. We cannot ignore Scriptural warnings of stumbling stones. We cannot close our eyes to symptoms of poor spiritual balance. Too much is at stake. So “brace up your minds for activity, keep completely balanced.”—1 Pet. 1:13. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 6/15</span><span class="font0"> 29,30a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday, December 30 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You are the light of the world. A city cannot be hid when situated upon a mountain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Matt. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a minister Jesus was not out of sight and inconspicuous as when he was a carpenter in Nazareth. As the great Sign from Jehovah he was seen in all parts of his territory, going from city to city and from village to village, preaching publicly and also in the homes of the people. Copying him, we also can be prominent, not to show off, but to call attention to Jehovah’s signs and wonders. Most effectively we can do this by preaching publicly and from house to house. In this way Jesus’ prophetic words at Matthew 24 :14 must be fulfilled. This preaching of the good news anywhere by the remnant and their sheeplike associates is in itself a most eloquent sign, a wonder that excites the attention of all the world. It is indubitable evidence that God’s kingdom in the hands of his heavenly Immanuel has been set up as the capital of the universe. It is a sign that portends that the nations of this world now face their end and will meet it just as soon as our preaching is finished according to the divine will. Let them read the sign! </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 11/15</span><span class="font0"> 18, 19a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday, December 31 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—Rev. 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a reward for staying awake, ever on the watch at the temple against what is unclean and harmful, we have a joyful share in maintaining on earth the true religion, “the form of worship that is clean and undefiled.” We thus share in loyally vindicating the worship of the only true and enduring God, Jehovah, thus clearing his holy name of reproach. His is the only worship that will continue in practice under divine approval clear through the “war of the great day of God the Almighty” and be practiced in the new order of things under God’s kingdom by Jesus Christ. In harmony with this, the approved watchful ministers will have the reward of forever worshiping and adoring the victorious King of eternity, and joining with the living creatures throughout the universe in ceaselessly saying the above-quoted words. The approved watchful ministers will thus fulfill the highest purpose of their living, which is to glorify and magnify God the Creator forever. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">W 12/15</span><span class="font0"> 32a</span></p>
