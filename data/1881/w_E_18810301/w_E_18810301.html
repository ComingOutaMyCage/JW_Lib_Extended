<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SPIRITUALISM.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Wherever we find a counterfeit we may rest assured there exists a genuine. If there were no genuine gold dollars, there could be no base imitations, or counterfeits.  Then too, the base or spurious article must appear </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">very much like the genuine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or it would not be a counterfeit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is what we claim relative to what is at the present time called &quot;Spiritualism&quot;: That it is a counterfeit of the true, as taught in the Bible.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Whoever has carefully searched the scriptures cannot have failed to see that while God throughout all past ages has condemned evil and sin in their various forms, and warned his children both &quot;Israel after the flesh&quot; and also the spiritual children (the Gospel Age Church) of the danger and bad results of evil, yet He has nevertheless permitted evil and good to stand side by side before the people, for their choice.  If we take heed to his Word we may discern which is evil and by obedience to that Word, shun the evil and choose the good.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God is the head and fountain of goodness and truth and the Scriptures teach that Satan is the head and fountain of all evil and error--&quot;The father of lies&quot; (deceptions).  Both of these are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beings.  &quot;God is a spirit,&quot; and Satan, as we have heretofore shown, was once an angel of God-- The chief or Prince of &quot;Those angels which kept not their first (sinless) estate.&quot;  These though cast out from God's presence, are not yet destroyed --they still preserve their nature as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;angels,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> though through sin they have become evil angels; consequently they still are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual beings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (not human) and have the same powers as they ever had, and as good angels have, except that God has put them under certain limitations and restraints which we shall more fully discuss farther along.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If we trace them through the Scriptures we shall find that these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fallen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual beings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have continually made use of their spiritual--super-natural powers, to lead mankind astray into disobedience of God and injury to themselves.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Spiritual beings, as we have heretofore shown, possess powers greater and higher than humanity.  We have seen from the statements relative to good angels that they can be present in our midst without our being conscious of their presence.  (The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him. `Psa. 34:7`.) (Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister to those who shall be heirs of salvation? `Heb. 1:14`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These we have seen, have power to appear </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as a flame of fire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (The Angel of the Lord so appeared to Moses in the bush. `Gen. 3:2`) or they can and have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">appeared as men.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Of this power there are numbers of instances in the Bible.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some other powers of angels can be discovered by examining the record, for instance, the angels who delivered Lot and his family from Sodom, had power to smite the rioters of Sodom with blindness. (`Gen. 19:11`.) An angel &quot;did wondrously before Manoah;&quot; another performed a miracle before Gideon. (`Judges 6:21 and 13-19`.) The Angel of the Lord delivered the Apostles from prison, and yet left the prison doors unmolested; again, an angel delivered Peter from prison, the doors opening of their own accord. `Acts 5:19-23` and `12:8`. On many occasions they made known to men things which were about to come to pass, etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, the evil angels, &quot;the devil and his angels,&quot; have by nature the very same powers, but are restrained. So much of evil as can be overruled for good, and tend to the development of experience and the education and discipline of the &quot;heirs of God, joint heirs with Jesus Christ,&quot;--is permitted and the remainder </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restrained.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> As God through his Spirit and influence works in and through men who give themselves up to His control, so does Satan operate in and through those who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;yield themselves</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin.&quot;  &quot;His servants ye are to whom you render </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">service.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  As Jesus said to some, &quot;Ye are of your father the devil </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for his works ye do.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As &quot;God in times past spake unto the fathers through the prophets,&quot; who were His mouthpieces, so Satan spake through his agents and agencies. His first agent was the serpent which became his agent in beguiling Eve into disobedience.  He manifested his powers through the magicians and soothsayers of Babylon and remarkably in those of Egypt, where God's powers were manifested through Moses and Aaron before Pharaoh, while Satan's powers, of a similar kind, were used to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">oppose</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the truth for a time.  Here these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two spiritual powers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were strikingly manifested; both did miracles --things which men alone could not do--but which men </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possessed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of evil and good powers, did do. (`Exod. 7:11-22` and `8:7-18`.)  &quot;There were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">false</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> prophets also among the people,&quot; who evidently spoke by an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inspiration,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or power in them almost like the real prophets of God; these were the counterfeits. (See `2 Pet. 2:1` `Jer. 23:21`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are aware that to the worldly mind it seems superstitious to believe that men and women may be so given up of themselves to Satan, and so controlled by him as to be wizards and witches; but they are recognized as such in the Scriptures, and we believe it.  Israel was commanded to put such to death. (`Exod. 22:18`; `Lev. 20:27`, etc.)  Manasseh, King of Judah made Judah to err, &amp;c.; he &quot;used enchantments and used </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">witchcraft</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and dealt with a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">familiar spirit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and with wizards.&quot; (`2 Chron. 33:6`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Take a concordance and see how much God says against wizards, witches, and &quot;they that have familiar spirits&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mediums</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the devil for communicating with mankind.  It was the claim of these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mediums</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of &quot;familiar spirits&quot; that they held communication with the dead and received their information from them. In this claim they contradicted the plain statements of God's word, which assure us that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead could not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> furnish any information. (See `Job 14:10-21`; `Eccl. 9:10`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But this was merely another way in which Satan sought to continue the lie imposed upon Eve in Eden. [&quot;He is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">liar</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the beginning&quot; said Jesus.]  God had said that if disobedient they should </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Satan contradicted this statement; claimed that man had naturally, immortality and could not die, and that God was a liar.  Ever since, he seeks to uphold the statement, &quot;Ye shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> surely die.&quot;  Full well does he know that if people realized that it was the &quot;spirits of demons&quot; who spoke to them through the mediums they would shun them; hence, the claim that it is dead people (not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but more </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than ever) who communicate the information.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">An illustration of this sort, is given in `1 Sam. 28`.  Saul, King of Israel, had become wicked, and God would no longer communicate with him through the Prophets.  He was engaged in a war with the Philistines, and a great battle was about to be fought.  He wanted council and desired to know what would be the outcome. Since the Lord would not answer him, he sought out one of the condemned and forbidden class, a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">medium,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a woman who had a familiar spirit--the witch at Endor.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All are familiar with the story: (`1 Sam. 28:3-20`) how that the medium pretends ignorance as to her visitor, knows what Saul desires, gives a description of Samuel, etc. Then follows an account of the coming defeat of Saul's army and the death of himself and his sons.  The fact that these things occurred just as foretold by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">medium,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has been thought by some, to be a proof that Samuel really furnished the information. But, Satan could foretell those things as well as Samuel could were he alive.  Not that Satan is a prophet, nor that God reveals coming things to him, but he is a student of God's word and a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of it.  &quot;Devils also believe and tremble.&quot; (`Jas. 2:19`.) The defeat of Saul and accession of David to the throne had been foretold by the Prophet and both Saul and Satan knew it, and Satan had learned that every word of God's is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sure.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides we should not forget the words of the apostle that &quot;He that hath the power of death is the devil.&quot; (`Heb. 2:14`.)  Since he is the executor of the death penalty, and must have the permission to execute from God, (`Job 1:12`) is it strange that he knew that he was to have power over the lives of Saul, his sons and many others on the next day?  No, it is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reasonable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> inference.  Certainly we should not for a moment suppose that God (or Samuel if he could) would recognize, or use any means of communication which He had prohibited on pain of death and condemned as wicked.  Read `1 Chron. 10:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Coming further down the stream of time, we learn that the same wicked spirits continued to operate in the same manner.  The Lord, while still permitting them, warns the people against such, saying: &quot;They shall say unto you, 'Seek unto them that have familiar spirits (spirit </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mediums</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">) and unto wizards that peep and mutter.' (But) should not a people seek unto their God?  For [why should] the living [go] to the dead?  To the law and to the testimony, [the Bible], if they speak not according to this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Word</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it is because there is no light in them.&quot; (`Isa. 8:19`.)  God warns people not to believe any one whose</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R196 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">teachings are contrary to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Word,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no matter what powers they may exercise.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Coming down to the days of Jesus and the apostles we find that Satan still operated in much the same manner, as well as a variety of other ways. Among the more notable instances [not to mention the numerous cases of casting out of devils, etc., by both Jesus and the disciples] we might remind you of the experience of Philip and Peter with Simon the sorcerer (`Acts 8:7-9-24`.)  &quot;Unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possessed;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">...but there was a certain man named Simon which...used sorcery and bewitched the people...to whom they all gave heed...saying, This man is the great power </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(medium)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God.&quot;  Thus did Satan use </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to delude the people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul and Barnabas had an experience with another of these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mediums</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the devil named Elymas, who withstood them.  Paul addressing him said: &quot;O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pervert</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the right ways of the Lord?&quot; (`Acts 13:10`.) And he was blinded immediately. Again Paul and Silas met a female </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">medium</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at Phillippi.  &quot;A certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination...which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.&quot;  But Paul &quot;turned and said to the spirit [Satan] I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.&quot; `Acts 16:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And so ever since, Satan has kept up his practices with various changes of method to suit the circumstances; sometimes with characteristic devilishness, at other times in the garb of religion, &quot;For Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light, therefore it is no great thing if his ministers </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[mediums]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> also be transformed as ministers of righteousness&quot;... (`2 Cor. 11:14`.)  In our day when knowledge is so great, and morality (called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christianity)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so popular, Satan </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">must</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if he would continue to oppose truth, take the religious cloak; and so he does.  To-day Spiritualism ranks itself among the religious sects.  [&quot;The synagogue [church] of Satan,&quot; truly.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Spiritualism though refined and modernized is yet the same that it ever was, in ages past.  Its object is not the inculcation of truth, nor of love for God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.  They claim that Jesus was a fine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">medium</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and taught and used spiritualism in His day as well as He understood it.  They do not outwardly profess to oppose the Bible and its teachings, but they do so really, both teaching and practicing the very things therein condemned and still seeking to prove by their enchantments that men are not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thus endeavoring to uphold Satan's first falsehood. `Gen. 3:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">They still possess supernatural powers, too, just as in the days of Saul and Paul and Moses, etc.  While we do not question that some of the things claimed to be done by them are mere deceptions, yet we know of many things done by them where no deception was possible.  Among those who believe </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;in this way&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we know of several who once were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mediums</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the devil and did &quot;those things whereof they are now ashamed.&quot; These, when coming to a knowledge of the truth, are thankful for their escape from that &quot;snare of the devil.&quot; Spiritualism hates the light and their wonders are done under cover of their favorite principle--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">darkness.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Their work of proselyting, too, is dark, covered --secret.  Jesus gives us a word of wisdom on this subject.  &quot;Every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved.&quot; `Jno. 3:20`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Though working stealthily, their numbers are large and embrace many of the influential of earth--Judges, Senators, etc.  The queen of what is known as the greatest </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">christian</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> kingdom of earth, on whose possessions the light of day is said never to set, called the &quot;Christian Queen,&quot; is known by many to be a &quot;Spiritualist.&quot; It is coming before people in a way that commands attention, and those who do not realize it to be the work of Satan are almost sure to regard it as a power of God.  The Rev. Joseph Cook, justly celebrated for his able defense of the Bible and its author, God, against the attacks of Atheists and Infidels, such as Huxley, Darwin, Arnold, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">et. al.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has lately had his attention aroused to the recognition of the growing influence of &quot;Spiritualism,&quot; and having investigated the subject to some extent he recently delivered a lecture on the subject, in which he expressed his belief that many of their tricks and performances, are performed by no human power and are actually </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">super-natural.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> He does not pretend to say how, or by what power, but claims that not only himself but some of the profoundest scientific minds of Germany have reached the conclusion that Spiritualism cannot be condemned as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">false</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by any scientific tests yet applied to it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor is this power of Spiritualism difficult to account for if we take the Bible as our authority and recognize it as the work of Satan, whom Jesus designates &quot;The prince of this world.&quot; (`Jno. 14:30`.)  &quot;The prince of the power of the air (spiritual power) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the spirit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that now worketh in the children of disobedience.&quot; (`Eph. 2:2`.) And the same book is our authority for saying that &quot;Spiritualism&quot; has not yet reached the climax of its power; its powers are to increase wonderfully.  Paul says, (`1 Tim. 4:1`), &quot;Now the Spirit [of God] speaketh expressly that in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">latter times</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing [deceiving] spirits and doctrines of devils.&quot;  Jesus says, &quot;They are the spirits of devils working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">day of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Almighty.&quot; `Rev. 16:14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Peter (2:4`) and `Jude (6`) tell us, that when cast out of God's presence as evil angels, they were bound by &quot;chains of darkness&quot; &quot;unto the judgment of the great day.&quot;  Many scriptures have shown us that the closing part of the Gospel age is to be upon the living a time of trial and trouble preparing them for the coming Millennial reign of Christ, and is called &quot;the day of the Lord&quot;--&quot;the great day&quot;--&quot;the great day of His wrath,&quot; etc.  We understand, then, that Satan and his angels have been limited: might not appear except through human beings who willingly gave themselves up to be &quot;possessed of devils&quot; or became his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;mediums.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He has thus been confined or chained.  But we claim that this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;day of the Lord&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--day of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Son of man&quot;-- has already commenced, that the Scriptures prove it to be so; and if the chains of darkness restrain Satan </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">until</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the great day,&quot; we should expect that very soon those chains will be loosed and no longer restrain. (Any who expect soon the loosing of those powers should, to be consistent, recognize both &quot;The day of the Lord&quot; and the trial as commenced.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The facts correspond to this exactly. &quot;Spiritualism&quot; claims that they are having more power to show their wonders daily, and they claim now (one case very recently) that the Spirits can </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">materialize in broad day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and they promise wonderful revelations and manifestations </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">very</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">soon.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Now, materialization of a spiritual being, just as they claim, has been possible all along to the angels of God, of which we have many records --angels on many occasions appearing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as men.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Jesus, as we have seen, when </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">born of the Spirit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at his resurrection, a spiritual body, (&quot;That which is born of the Spirit </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is spirit.&quot;)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was, as all other spiritual beings, (good and evil) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">invisible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to human sight, and in making known his resurrection to his disciples he appeared in various fleshly &quot;forms.&quot; (`Mark 16:12`.) These are the powers which Satan has desired, but could not heretofore use, because bound or limited, but which he will have when the judgment (trial) of &quot;the day of the Lord&quot; begins.  (Which we believe is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now.)</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The trial of this day is not only a day of trouble and distress among nations, but it includes a trouble or fire upon the living phase of the church.  This church trouble comes first, and we believe began in the spring of 1878, and is to result in the purifying of faith and bringing of those who will continue to bear the name of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christian</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the firm foundations of the teachings of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Word</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of God.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  For all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the errors</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of human traditions shall be consumed as dross, wood, hay, stubble, in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (trial) of this day.  The apostle says, &quot;Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> try you (the church) as though some strange [unforetold] thing happened unto you.&quot; (`1 Pet. 4:12`.)  For the fire of that day shall try every man's work of what sort it is: &quot;He that hath built [his faith] with gold, silver and precious stones [the truths of God's word] the same shall remain. (His faith will not be destroyed.)  But if any man build with wood, hay, stubble, (the teachings and creeds of man) the same shall suffer loss, &amp;c. (`1 Cor. 3:12-15`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This trial is &quot;the trial of your faith&quot; and in this &quot;day of the Lord&quot; not only does the light of truth shine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">strongly and beautifully,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> showing us the great prize of our high calling as we never saw it before; revealing to us the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present king,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who causes us to sup with Him and feeds us with His truth which is, &quot;meat in due season,&quot; giving strength needed in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> day; but it is also a day for the increase of the powers of evil, that the separation between the wheat and tares (the children of the kingdom and the children of the wicked one. `Matt. 13:38`) may be complete.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Because of this struggle between truth and error, the real and the false spiritualism, etc., Paul says, &quot;My brethren, be strong in the Lord and the power of His might.  Put on the whole armor of God that ye may be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">able</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to stand against the wiles of the devil.  For we wrestle not against the flesh and blood [not against human beings, but against evil </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beings] but against principalities, against powers, against the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rulers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of the darkness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of this world, (Satan --the prince of this world. `Jno. 12:31`) against </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wickedness in high (controlling) places.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Wherefore,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [on this account] take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand [the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wickedness--the devil's wiles] in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">evil day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [this day of the Lord's presence --day of trial.]...Stand, therefore, having your loins girt about with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and having on the breastplate of righteousness, etc. `Eph. 6:11`.</font><br />
<br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are portions of Scripture which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seem</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to teach that during this &quot;Day of the Lord&quot; there will be manifestations of the saints </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in fleshly bodies of those who have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to spiritual bodies like unto Christ's glorious body--and that they will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">appear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as He &quot;appeared&quot; after His resurrection, and do a work of teaching as He taught the Disciples, opening men's understandings that they might understand the Scriptures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have seen that the coming of Moses the first and second times to deliver Israel from Egypt, was a type of the two comings of the Lord.  The second time he came with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;Aaron, the saint,&quot; was his mouthpiece before Pharaoh, and during the signs, &amp;c.  So we expect that the living representatives of the church will sometime be used as the mouthpiece of their Lord before the world [Egypt in type].  As there in type Jannes and Jambres, and the other magicians under Satanic power, opposed and hindered for a time the effect of the wonderful powers wrought through Aaron, so we anticipate that in the antitype, when the living church is used as the Lord's mouthpiece, they will be withstood and their teachings controverted by the same </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> wickedness--&quot;Spiritualism&quot; --which will seek to do the same things and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be able.  Paul seems to refer directly to this in `2 Tim. 3:1-8`, when, after saying: &quot;In the last days [of the age] perilous times shall come,&quot; &amp;c., he adds: &quot;Now, as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth...but they shall proceed no further; for their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">folly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We suggest again, then, that every counterfeit is a proof of a genuine; second, that none but valuable things are counterfeited, and third, that a counterfeit must resemble the genuine very </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">closely,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or it would not deceive. Already, Spiritualists, are talking much as we do, of &quot;the good time coming,&quot; the &quot;glorious day,&quot; and even declare that Jesus is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &amp;c.  This is an old practice with our opponent.  At the first advent, the devils knew Jesus and crying out said: &quot;Thou art Christ the Son of God,&quot; and He rebuking them, suffered them not to speak, &quot;for they knew that he was Christ.&quot; (`Luke 4:41`.) (See also Paul's experience, `Acts 16:17`.) Yes, &quot;The devils also believe and tremble.&quot; (`James 2:19`.)  And</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">no doubt they would fain call some of us, Spiritualists, both for the purpose of bringing to their credit our knowledge of God's word and plan, and to seek to offset the value and effect of our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> teaching, by claiming us as one with themselves.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE UNPARDONABLE SIN.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of Man it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. (`Matt. 12:32`.) [The word here rendered world, as in many other places should be rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">age</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and is so rendered in all translations.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This text teaches first that there is such a thing as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forgiveness of sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> both in the present gospel age and in the coming--millennial--age.  The basis of all forgiveness of sins, is in the fact that &quot;Christ died for our sins.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Secondly it teaches that some sins are possible, which God will not reckon as a part of the Adamic sin which passed upon all men and which is to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forgiven</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all men.  If men looked at Jesus and ignorantly supposed him an imposter and blasphemed him, it would be excusable and forgivable as a result of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fallen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature. Even should they blaspheme the name of God, and say they believed in no such being, &amp;c., this too might be forgiven for the same reasons: But when God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the Holy Ghost) was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">manifested</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in doing them good as it was manifested through Jesus, there certainly was no excuse for even the most depraved of men ascribing those good works to an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">evil</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Satan.  And this is just what Jesus tells them, that such conduct cannot be classed as a part of the general human depravity and it therefore cannot be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forgiven.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The light was shining so clearly, that though their eyes were nearly blinded by sin, they could not help realizing some of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as Jesus manifested some of &quot;the powers of the world (age) to come.&quot;  As he said to them on another occasion their &quot;stripes&quot; (punishment) in the next age will be in proportion as they have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">able to comprehend and do</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> justly and have not so done.  They whose moral sight and hearing have been totally destroyed by Adam's sin and its results (if any such there be--the Lord knoweth) will have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no stripes</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the future, will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forgiven</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fully.  They who see a little and could obey a little and do not so do, shall be forgiven the things they did not see and could not do, but will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">beaten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (punished) with a few stripes for the few things they saw and could but did not do. They who saw more and whose ability to perform was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">less</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> impaired by the fallen nature, and who fail to do according to their ability, are to be beaten with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">many stripes.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now notice that all who receive </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;stripes&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> receive them for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unpardoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for if the sins were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pardoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they would not be punished for them.  In our earthly courts if a man had trespassed against the law in two ways, and the penalty of the first crime was imprisonment for five years, and for the second six months; if it could be shown that he was not really to blame for the first crime, but was forced into it by circumstances over which he had no control, but the second crime was measurably under his control, the decision of the court would be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;guilty&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on both charges: but he would be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pardoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the first charge and not on the second; the result would be that he would serve the six months punishment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here are two earthly crimes, one pardonable and one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unpardonable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">: So it is with God's law; all are sinners and condemned--guilty--on account of Adam's sin, but the full ransom from that sin has been paid and so though condemned before the court of heaven, it is announced that all of our imperfections traceable to that cause are freely and fully forgiven. But neither more nor less is pardonable. All sins against </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ability</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are unpardonable, cannot be forgiven at any time, and hence </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">must</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">be punished.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The world will have many such sins to be punished in the age to come, and they receive in some instances much punishment in the present life and age.  In a word all punishment indicates unpardoned sin, for if it were pardoned it would not be punished as well.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul tells us of extreme cases of this sort of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unpardonable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sin.  Men of the world who have a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">little</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> light we have seen can commit it, but when a man becomes a christian and has the eyes of his understanding opened --when he is brought from the condition of darkness and ignorance, into the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light of the knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lord, to then sin </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">willfully</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is terrible indeed. Due and full allowance is made for all our weaknesses and imperfections which come to us through our fallen nature, and which clog and hinder our doing as we should wish to do-- our Father's will but no more.  If we cease to desire to do God's will, we cut loose from our Lord and begin to walk according to our own will as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and no longer spiritual beings. This is the thing pictured by the proverb: &quot;The dog is returned to his vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.&quot; `2 Pet. 2:22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In `Heb. 6:4-6`, Paul assures us that any christian who has reached a full and mature development in the spiritual life, having &quot;been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enlightened,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;tasted of the heavenly gift,&quot; &quot;been made partaker of the Holy Ghost,&quot; &quot;tasted of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> word of God&quot;--if such shall fall away, it is impossible to renew them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">again</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto repentance.  Why?  Because this is an unpardonable sin.  But can they be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">punished</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for this sin and thus go free from it in time?  No, with the above description of the Apostle, we understand that these had enjoyed all the blessings due them on account of Christ's ransom: i.e. They were reckoned of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified from all sin,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> creatures had been brought to a condition of enlightenment and knowledge of the Lord's will, and then, had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">deliberately and willfully</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> acted contrary to it.  We do not refer to a child of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stumbling</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or being overcome of the old nature for a time, but as expressed in `Heb. 10:26`--If </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sin willfully after that we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">received</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the truth, there remaineth no more (a) sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(destroy)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the adversaries.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In a word we understand Paul to teach that the class here described have received all the benefits due them through Christ's ransom, and that their willful sinning against knowledge, &amp;c., places them in the same position as Adam occupied when he sinned; the penalty of all such willful sin is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In Adam's case it was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> death.  In the case of these it is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They had been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoned dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as christians and then </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoned of God alive</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as new creatures and now they die for their own willful sin--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the second death.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  There is neither forgiveness nor excuse for such sin; they must have the full penalty and die.  They have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lightly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> esteemed the ransom </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they knew of it and thus have &quot;trodden under foot the Son of God and counted the blood of the covenant </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wherewith they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">were sanctified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (set apart as new creatures) an unholy (ordinary--common) thing and done despite (disrespect) unto the spirit of (favor) grace.&quot;</font><br />
<br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE SHEEP AND GOATS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(`MATT. 25:31-46`.)</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The scene of this parable is laid after the time of trouble, and after the exaltation of the &quot;little flock&quot; to the throne, when the nations have been subdued, Satan bound and the authority of Christ's kingdom established. So we read: &quot;When the Son of Man shall come in his glory...then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations.&quot;  The Bride of Christ before this time, has been seated with him in his throne, and has taken part in executing the judgments of the great day of wrath.  Now, &quot;the Son of Man appears&quot; (is made manifest) to the world, &quot;in his glory&quot;--The glory of the husband is the wife (`1 Cor. 11:7`) and together Jesus and his Bride &quot;shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here is the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; as John saw it (`Rev. 21`)--&quot;that holy city...coming down from God out of heaven.&quot;  During all the time of trouble it was coming down, and now it has touched the earth.  This is the stone cut out of the mountains (kingdoms of earth) without hands, (but by the power of God) and it has become a great mountain (kingdom) and has filled the whole earth. (`Dan. 2:35`.) Its coming has broken to pieces (`Dan. 2:34-35`) the evil kingdoms of the Prince of darkness.  Here is that glorious city (government) prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, (`Rev. 21:2`) and the nations of them which are saved (restored --brought back from the Adamic death) are walking in the light of it. (`Vs. 24`.)  These may &quot;bring their glory and honor into it, but there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, etc.&quot; (`Vs. 27`.) Here from the midst of the throne, proceeds a pure river of water of life, (truth, unmixed with error) and the Spirit and the Bride say come and take it freely. (`Rev. 22:17`.)  Here begins the world's probation--the world's great judgment day--a thousand years.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But even in this glorious time of blessing and healing of the nations, when Satan is bound, evil restrained, mankind released from the grasp of death, and when the knowledge of the Lord fills the earth, two classes will be developed, which Jesus in this parable calls </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sheep</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">goats.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  These he tells us he will separate.  Gradually throughout the age he gathers his sheep (those who know and obey his voice) to his right hand (place of favor) but the goats (the disobedient) to the left.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the end of the Millennial age, at the final adjustment of human affairs, Jesus thus addresses his sheep: &quot;Come ye blessed...inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&quot;  What kingdom? Is not the kingdom under the whole heavens given to the people of the saints of the Most High God to possess it forever?  Yes, as we have already learned, a &quot;little flock,&quot; &quot;the saints,&quot; the &quot;sheep&quot; of the gospel age, having followed the Lamb (Jesus) whithersoever he went, through evil and through good report, even to the sacrificing of the human life, with him have been exalted to the divine nature and to the throne of the spiritual unseen kingdom, to possess it forever (for the age)--&quot;He (the Christ, head and body) must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:25`.) --The saints shall reign with Christ a thousand years. `Rev. 20:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus calls believers of the gospel age, who know and obey his voice, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his sheep.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But he says--&quot;Other sheep I have which are not of this fold (referring to those who should follow him in the millennial age) them also I must lead (into truth and righteousness during that age) and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.&quot;  Jesus and the &quot;little flock&quot;--the bride-- made one will be the good shepherd who will lead mankind into the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fold</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of safety--harmony with God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This work of separating sheep and goats is a gradual one, requiring all</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R195 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">of the millennial age for its accomplishment. During that age each individual as he comes to a knowledge of God and his will, takes his place at the right hand of favor, or the left hand of disfavor according as he improves or misimproves the opportunities of that golden age.  And by the end of that age, all the world of mankind (not the church of the gospel age) will have arranged themselves as shown in the parable, into two classes.  In nature sheep are far more numerous than goats, and we do not doubt that with the perfect knowledge then possessed, the sheep company will far outnumber the goats. With the end of that age (1,000 years) is the end of the world's trial, or judgement, and final disposition is made of the two classes.  The goats who have not developed the element of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- the law of God's being and kingdom --are not counted worthy of life and must be destroyed, while the sheep who have developed and by deeds exhibited Godlikeness (love) are to be installed as the rulers of earth for future ages.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The work of restitution will not be quite complete until the great mass of mankind, having been restored to the perfect condition, is again restored to the dominion of earth as given originally to Adam before sin entered. For God said: &quot;After our likeness, let man have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, over the cattle and over </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">...and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth&quot;-- a ruler over earth, like as God is ruler over all things.  And the Psalmist expresses the same idea saying: &quot;Thou hast made man a little lower than the Angels and hast crowned him with glory and honor; thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands.&quot;  Not over each other; when the law of love controls human hearts, there will be no necessity for dominion over one another, though by mutual consent, prompted by mutual love, regulations may be made among themselves for the common good and blessing of all.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This then, is the kingdom that has been preparing for mankind from the foundation of the world.  It was necessary that they should suffer 6,000 years under the dominion of evil, hatred and strife, to learn their certain results, misery and death, and in order by contrast to prove the justice, wisdom and goodness of God's law--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Then it requires the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seventh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thousand years under the reign of Christ to restore him from ruin and death to the perfect condition, thereby fitting him wisely to exercise dominion over earth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But why is man thus crowned with glory and honor, a king in all the earth?  The Lord makes them answer --because &quot;I was hungry and you fed me, thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in, naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, in prison and you came unto me.&quot;  But, they answer, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and ministered unto thee?  Hear the reply--Ye have done it to each other; ye are all my Father's children; I also am his Son, though on a higher plane, and all we are brethren: (Christ and the saints of the gospel age--children of God on the spiritual plane; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mankind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in general will be sons of God on the restored, or fleshly plane as Adam was before sin.)  The love you have shown to the least of my brethren, I count as shown to me.  No great deeds are assigned as the ground for this honor and favor--they have simply come into harmony with God's law, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and proved it by their works.  &quot;Love is the fulfilling of the law,&quot; (`Rom. 13:10`.) and &quot;God is love,&quot; so when man is restored again to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the image of God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;very good&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--man also will be love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then the message to those on the left--&quot;Depart from me ye cursed, (condemned as unfit vessels for the glory and honor of life, who would not yield to the moulding hand of the potter--the moulding and shaping influences of divine love).  When these</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R196 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">my brethren were hungry and thirsty, naked, sick and in prison, ye ministered not to their necessities, thus continually proving to be out of harmony with the law of the heavenly city (kingdom) and &quot;there shall in no case enter into it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anything</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that defileth.&quot; &quot;Depart from me into everlasting fire (symbol of destruction) prepared for the Devil and his Angels.&quot;  Satan is to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">destroyed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as we read--&quot;That old serpent which is the devil and Satan was cast into the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lake of fire;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> this is the second death.&quot;  Christ will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;destroy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">...him that has the power of death, that is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Devil.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;And these (the goats) go away into everlasting cutting-off (destruction) but the righteous into life eternal.&quot;  (Never ending.) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Diaglott.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of the &quot;sheep&quot; it is said: &quot;inherit the kingdom prepared for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">you</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the foundation of the world.&quot;  But because God gave it to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at first and designs restoring it to him again, when he has prepared and repaired him for the great trust, we are not to suppose that God intends man to rule it except as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">under,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or in harmony with His heavenly laws.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Thy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be done on earth as it is done in heaven&quot; will be the rule.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There could scarcely be a better illustration of Man's dominion under God, than that afforded in the government of this country.  Each state is permitted to have dominion over its own territory, but all must be subject to the general government of the United States.  And no one state may make a law which will conflict with any law of the United States.  When in the late rebellion some of the states attempted so to do, the general government was obliged to reduce to subjection the refractory states, and when they were restored to harmony, they were again permitted to occupy their former position.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So we learn that God's government is a general government over all his works; that he rules in justice equity and love; that His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him; that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will&quot;--but the kingdom of earth is sure to man after that he has learned that the heavens do rule. (`Dan. 4:17-26`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the perfect man to whom it was first given, through sin lost his ability and right to reign, the dominion was taken away and given to his adversary whose reign of terror and death lasted 6,000 years.  But a limit was set by the Almighty to his time and power to hurt mankind and while used for man's discipline and final good, the remainder of his wrath was restrained.  When the powers of darkness have accomplished their part in God's purpose, the Son of God is sent to restore all things and to bring order and harmony out of confusion.  When his work is finished he &quot;gives up the kingdom to the Father that God may be all and in all.&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:28`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Man henceforth rules his dominion in harmony with the law of heaven-- delighting continually to do his will, in whose favor is life, and at whose right hand (place of favor) there is fullness of joy and pleasure forevermore.  O who would not say &quot;Haste thee along ages of glory,&quot; and give glory and honor to him whose loving plans blossom out into such fullness of blessing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This parable as we now understand it, is in complete harmony with the ideas advanced in article headed &quot;The restored dominion.&quot;  See WATCH TOWER, Dec. 1880.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LOOKING UNTO JESUS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two principles involved in the word look, two mediums by which we are enabled to discern objects, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the eye.

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Explanation and illustration are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">other</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> means of knowing or understanding and are also called light: &quot;one part of scripture throws </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on another part.&quot;  Point of view--situation to be seen, is called light-- this is a use of the word taken from painting; &quot;let every thought be presented in the strongest </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Looking in the natural is to direct the eye--in the spiritual to direct the mind of the understanding; &quot;the eyes of your understanding being enlightened.&quot;</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, if on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">depraved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> plane of being he could not be said to have been &quot;made a little lower.&quot;  He as a perfect one was to mediate and bring about a reconciliation between God and his fallen </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">carnal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> creatures who by sin had become His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;enemies;&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hence Jesus was made a little lower than the angels, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the suffering of death,&quot; that he might raise </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> up to a point but a little lower than the angels, (as perfect beings--justified or reckoned perfect,) thus becoming our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mediator</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;for if when we were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enemies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life.&quot; `Rom. 5:10`.  But in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">what</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sense was he higher or superior to Adam?  In this, that Adam was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">created</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God, but Christ was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God; now do we see how he was made like unto his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brethren?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Not like unto fallen man, they are not begotten of the spirit Christ and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brethren are.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, (and Jesus) are children of promise.

Nevertheless what saith the scripture?  &quot;Cast out the bond woman and her son: for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.&quot;  So then, brethren, we (nor Christ) are not children of the bond woman, but of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Gal. 4:28-31`.

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">made rich?  Yes, he became poor for our sakes; when he died upon the cross he consummated his poverty, giving up </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> even life itself, and thus reconciled us to God; for, as by Adam's death in or because of sin all die, so by Christ's death in or because of righteousness all are made alive; but we who are reckoned in the Adamic nature by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R197 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">NUMBER THREE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PART I.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have found in the past that the number </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seven</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is a fruitful and interesting topic; and that on this sacred number many things in God's plan are based.  The investigation of the Tabernacle with its three apartments has suggested that number </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">three</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is also a sacred and important number.  We are convinced that three is fundamental in Heaven and Earth, as to God and man, in the structure of the universe, in the plan of the ages, and in the process of Christian development or of coming to God.  For these reasons and in harmony with the Spirit and method of prophecy, we think </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">glimpse of God's plan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was the basis of the pattern which the Lord showed Moses in the mount, from which pattern the tabernacle and all its arrangements were made.  No part can fail.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In seeing these underlying principles in the construction of the word, we have additional evidence that the Bible reveals a science, and is God's truth.  As men can be made to see these things, it will be like taking the vail of unbelief from their minds, which will let in a flood of God's light and love.  One motive in our writing is the desire to guard some against the overspreading wave of unbelief.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The number three is surprisingly prominent, as the subject opens before us.  We may not, in every case, see its significance--sometimes little, perhaps, but often much.  Others may enlarge on thoughts suggested.  Our hope is that all who read may love the word more and more, as the rich treasure house of its great Author.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We would first call attention to the Divine Three--Father, Son and Holy Spirit--often mentioned in the Bible. This is fundamental, as shown by the commission of Christ, (`Matt. 28:19`) and is related to our faith in the Creator, Redeemer and Regenerator, and suggests the three steps in bringing men into the Divine image.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Man, in his composition, is spoken of by Paul as having three elements --&quot;spirit and soul and body,&quot; which he prays may be sanctified wholly, and preserved blameless unto the coming (presence) of our Lord Jesus Christ. `1 Thess. 5:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Divine Spirit is the Sanctifier, and the word of truth is the instrument. `2 Thess. 2:13` and `Jno. 17:17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Man's spirit, in the above passage, which needs sanctifying, should not be confounded with the indwelling Spirit of God, by which we are sanctified. The distinction is observed by the apostle when he says: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The Spirit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">itself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beareth witness with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our spirit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that we are the children of God.&quot; `Rom. 8:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We would now call attention to</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE THREE WITNESSES.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit and the water and the blood: &quot;and these three agree in one.&quot; `1 John 5:8`.  The three witnesses agree in one testimony.  What is their testimony?  It is God's testimony concerning His Son.  It must be important. &quot;If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater.&quot; `vs. 9`.  As the Son is the great expression or revelation of the Father, we should expect this important testimony of the three witnesses to have reference to the revelation of God's love for the world.  &quot;God is Love,&quot; and He wants us to believe it.  Let Paul speak: &quot;Because the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love of God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is shed abroad [made known] in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us.&quot; `Rom. 5:5`.  Here is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the three witnesses telling us of God's love for us while we were yet sinners.  How are we to know that love?  What is the Spirit's testimony --the record that God gives concerning His Son?  Listen--&quot;For when we were yet without strength </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in due</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> CHRIST DIED FOR THE UNGODLY.&quot; `Verse 6`.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ must, then, be an important event in God's plan.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">By reference to `Daniel 9:26` the &quot;due time&quot;--the time appointed-- will be seen.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;After the threescore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and two weeks,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself&quot;--it was for sinners.  This shows that the death could not have been from His birth, nor all the period of His earthly life as some maintain.  The weeks mark the time of His baptism, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after which</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> He should pour out His soul (life) unto death.  He came to His death by the way of water and blood.  His baptism in water was a symbol of His baptism into death, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it was a symbol it became a pledge that He would die, in obedience to the Father's will.  It was His consecration to the cross.  For this reason if for no other, it could truly be said: &quot;This is He that came by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">water and blood</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--even the anointed Saviour; not by water </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but by water and blood.&quot; `1 Jno. 5:6`. The coming, or manifestation of the Messiah, taken as a whole, was to make known the love of God to the world, and the manifestation included the death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But is the death of Christ, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">weeks,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> an expression of God's love? Listen to Paul again: &quot;For scarcely for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">righteous</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man will one die: [that would be a great stretch of love] yet possibly for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man some would even dare to die.  But [wondrous beyond measure] God commendeth His love toward us in that, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">while we were</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yet sinners,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ died for us.&quot; `Rom. 5:7-8`. The death of Christ, according to `verse 10` and onward, secures reconciliation in the sense that it reverses the curse that came on all by the first Adam; and because of this removal of the encumbrance, it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">opens</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the way</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the impartation of the Spirit to the obedient, and so for the gift of eternal life.  Hence it is written that &quot;If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of His Son; much more being reconciled, we shall be saved [the higher and spiritual form of salvation] by His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Christ is thus shown to be both the Restorer of the old, and Giver of the higher life--the second Adam.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No one who can appreciate the Spirit's testimony can ignore or belittle the death of Christ.  He not only came to His death by the way of water and blood, as the Spirit hath borne witness, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">water and blood</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that flowed from His side when He was</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R198 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">pierced add their testimony to that of the Spirit that He was dead, and also that it was a voluntary death.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">He</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> poured out His soul unto death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The statement of John concerning the testimony of the three witnesses, finds its foundation in the gospel written by him: &quot;But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced His side, and forthwith there came out blood and water.  And he that saw it bear record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.&quot; `Jno. 19:34-35`.  The Spirit says, &quot;Christ died for our sins&quot; and that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;He gave</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his life a ransom.&quot;  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">separation of the watery portion of the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">blood,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> gave proof that He was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">already</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and had been dead for some time; for had He not been dead, the flow would have been red blood.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We offer this as evidence that His death was not the direct result of crucifixion. The record is that He lived only </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">six hours</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the cross, from the third hour until the ninth hour of their day, (`Mark 15:25-34`) while men who were crucified usually lived much longer, even for days.  The case of Jesus was so exceptional that when Joseph, the counsellor, asked Pilate for the body of Jesus, &quot;Pilate </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">marvelled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if he were already dead, and would not believe it until he had called the centurion and knew it from him. `Mark 15:43-45`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Jews had no thought of the possibility of His being dead so soon, when they &quot;besought Pilate that their legs might be broken.&quot;  The soldiers on account of finding Him dead, made an exception of His case, and so &quot;brake not his legs: But one of the soldiers pierced His side.&quot;  Thus a prophecy was fulfilled: &quot;A bone of him shall not be broken.&quot;  A type too was fulfilled, no bone of the passover lamb was to be broken. `Num. 9:12`.  And in the piercing of His side, the foundation was laid for the fulfillment of another scripture in reference to the nation of Israel, when at His second coming He appears for their deliverance, viz: &quot;They shall look on him whom they pierced.&quot; `Zech. 12:9-10`. It was therefore, for all these reasons, necessary that He should die </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sooner</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than crucifixion by men would secure.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are led to believe that Christ's death was a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">voluntary act in the Divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">administration.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  This is in harmony with the idea which was shown sometime since, in our paper, that Christ was both human and Divine, and thus became the antitype of both priest and sacrifice--Aaron and the beast.  Not the life of the Priest, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lower nature,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as represented by the beast, was required as a sacrifice. The Divine is the priest power both in Jesus and all His true followers. A body was prepared for Him and He offered it. `Heb. 10:5-10`.  We are to sacrifice our bodies. `Rom. 12:1`. The power by which we do this is the indwelling Divine Spirit. `Rom. 8:13`. Christ said He had received power or authority of His Father to lay down His life.&quot;  &quot;Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">No man taketh it from me</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [this could have no force if it referred to His pre-existent life.  No one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of taking that.  The force of the statement is sure in that while men might </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seem</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to take His life by crucifying Him, yet they were mistaken;] in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reality</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.&quot;  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to lay it down, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to take it again.  This commandment [authority or power] have I received of my Father.&quot; `Jno. 10:15-18`.  And when speaking of the temple of His body, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(which is equally true of His own person</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and of His body, the church,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for it is Christ that raises all the dead, i.e. God in Christ, or Christ as a Divine Person) He said: &quot;Destroy this temple and in three days </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will raise it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">up.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Jno. 2:19-22`.  &quot;I will raise them up at the last day;&quot; Which when applied to the church, is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seventh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thousand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the first Adam and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">third thousand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the second Adam.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we can see that the real crucifying power is also the saving power, and therefore that the only way of salvation is by following Christ.  As the Divine is the Priest power, so when the Humanity of Christ was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forsaken</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of that Divinity which held the human in His hands, it was (the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">writer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thinks) the antitype of Aaron killing the beast; so Jesus immediately bowed His head and died.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It seems certain that the sacrifice was a special preparation of God and in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">act</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of sacrifice was a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">voluntary</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> offering.  In this fact as well as in the ransom thus provided, we may well see the Father's love commended, &quot;in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us.&quot;  And as God has given us the combined testimony of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">three</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">witnesses</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the truth, let us believe in the truth, and thanking Him for it,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R198 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">may we be able to see also the value of Christ's example, and so follow the Lord in sacrifice.  If we are made conformable to His death we shall share in His glory.     J. H. P.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">NUMBER THREE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PART II.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are three baptisms spoken of as related to God's dealings with men, that of water, of Spirit, and of fire.  All are mentioned by John, &quot;I indeed, baptize you with water... but He shall baptize you with the Holy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spirit,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Matt. 3:11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This statement doubtless had reference, primarily, to the disposition made of the Jewish nation, at the end of their age, and is intimately related to the harvest work of Christ, mentioned in the `next verse`, which also has three elements, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">separation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of wheat and chaff, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">gathering</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of wheat, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">burning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of chaff.  This work covered a space of forty years, not being complete until the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.  Jesus was clearly the Lord of the harvest, and Himself the chief Reaper, though He had assistants under His control.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">John baptized and addressed a mixed multitude, of which, when passed over to Christ, some were baptized with the Spirit and some with fire.  It seems clear that the baptism of the Spirit agrees to the gathering of the wheat into the Gospel barn, and the baptism of fire to the burning of the chaff, or judgments on the rejected nation.  Those who bore the fruit Christ was seeking, were counted worthy, and were filled with the Spirit as the sons of God; and those not bearing good fruit, were cut down, and cast into, or baptized with fire. Read the context and see if the &quot;wrath to come,&quot; the baptism of fire, and the &quot;unquenchable fire&quot; are not identical.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It may be observed here, as has often been shown, that the harvest of the Gospel age, as mentioned by the Saviour, in the parable of tares and wheat, (`Matt. 13`) is parallel to the Jewish harvest, and also has its three elements, separation, gathering and burning.  Then, it was the Jewish nominal church, wheat and chaff, that was disposed of; now, it is the nominal Gospel church, wheat and tares, that is to be disposed of.  The harvest here, according to the prophetic periods, [see </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Day Dawn&quot;]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> also covers a period of forty years, reaching to and including the year 1914.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Saviour says: &quot;The harvest is the end of the age,&quot; (`verse 39`) and in the `next verse` includes the burning of the tares in the closing work of the age; so let us not overlook the fact that in some sense the age, and therefore the harvest reaches to 1914. The tares are not to be burned after the end of the age, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the end</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the age.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">According to the order of events, as the Saviour explains them, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shining forth as the sun</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not due until after the tares are burned.  We believe it must be &quot;Day Dawn&quot; until 1914.  Of course the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exaltation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to glory precedes the shining forth in that glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The extension or prolonging of the Jewish age after A.D. 33, and of the Gospel age after A.D. 1878, is an expression of the long suffering of God to His defiled people; He is not willing that any [of them] should perish, but that they should come to repentance.&quot; `2 Pet. 3:9`.  His encouragement to the lukewarm church, is, &quot;As many as I love I rebuke and chasten; be zealous, therefore, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">repent.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Rev. 3:19`.  And it seems from the Saviour's parable of the lost </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sheep,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that he will not be content until He finds and brings in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lost one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [of the sheep, not of the world.]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is nothing in what is said above, on the extension of the harvest, to militate against the idea of the exaltation of the king and priest company immediately, if the Lord so wills; in fact, it has often been shown that the little flock are to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">share</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the administration of the coming judgments, which will purify the defiled, or ripen the unripe wheat.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Returning from the seeming digression, we would say, that while the three baptisms had primary application to the Jewish nation, there seems to be a sense in which they are applicable to each Christian.  Water baptism is of course external, and has to do with external relationships; but it is important as an act of obedience, or expression of loyalty to the Saviour, and may appropriately be regarded, on account of the place given it by the Saviour in His commission, and by the apostles in their practices, as an incipient step in a life of loyalty. And we know that it is the obedient who can claim the promises attached. And as a symbol, we may safely say it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">represents</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all there is of Christianity, --its faith or foundation, in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ; its life, in dying to sin and rising to walk in newness of life; its hope, in the death and resurrection of the saint.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The baptism of the Spirit, we understand is necessary, to enable the christian to carry out what was symbolized in the water baptism; in other words to enable him to keep his covenant. That to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">baptized</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the Spirit, is to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">filled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the Spirit, seems clear by comparing the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">promise</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ, (`Acts 1:5`,) and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fulfillment.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Acts 2:4`.  He said, &quot;Ye</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R199 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">baptized</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the Holy Spirit not many days hence;&quot; and when the day of Pentecost was fully come, &quot;They were all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">filled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the Holy Spirit.&quot;  Speaking of the same thing Jesus said, &quot;After the Holy Spirit has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">come upon you.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Acts 1:8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While, as has been clearly shown by another, the company who received the Holy Spirit, on the day of Pentecost, represented the whole church; and it has remained with the church ever since; yet, there is of course, a time when each </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">individual,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> passing from death unto life by faith, receives that same Spirit.  So at the conversion of Cornelius and his family, &quot;The Holy Spirit fell on all them who heard the word.&quot; `Acts 10:44`. And all with Peter were &quot;astonished&quot; ...&quot;because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit,&quot; `ver. 45`.  Peter said they &quot;have received the Holy Spirit as well as we.&quot; `ver. 47`.  And he afterward said, &quot;And as I began to speak the Holy Spirit fell on them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">on us at the beginning &amp;c.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Acts 11:15-17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The gift of the Holy Spirit is to all that obey the gospel,&quot; even as many as the Lord our God shall call. `Acts 2:38-39`.  &quot;And the disciples were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">filled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with joy, and with the Holy Spirit.&quot; `Acts 13:52`.  Paul exhorts the church at Ephesus to &quot;be not drunk with wine...but [to] </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">be filled with the Spirit.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Eph. 5:18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand the baptism of fire, in the individual is equivalent to the trials, chastisements, afflictions, and tribulations, through which we must pass in order </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to overcome</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and so reign with Christ.  The baptism into death which the Saviour endured, and with which He said His disciples must also be baptized, is the very thing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pledged</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in water baptism, but it has often been shown that it can only be carried out by the power of the indwelling Spirit of Christ. `Rom. 8:13`.  The baptism of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seem to be identical, or rather different parts of the same thing, the former being the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">process</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the latter the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">completion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the work.  To be baptized into the Saviour's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> means </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">far</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">more</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than to be baptized into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">water,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> though the former is represented by the latter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is doubtless true that much of our chastisement and affliction comes by our own natural conditions, and the Apostle tells us that, &quot;Whom the Lord loveth He chastiseth... that we might be partakers of His holiness.&quot; `Heb. 12:6-10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As judgments and troubles are represented by fire in the Scriptures, so the Christian's trials are called &quot;fiery trials.&quot; `1 Pet. 4:12`.  Some of these trials come from the enemies without, but the Christian's greatest enemy is his old self, or carnal nature, against which the Spirit within, or new nature wars. `Rom. 7:15-25`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is one of the great mistakes of the nominal church that it is considered so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">easy</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be a christian; as if we might sail to Paradise by balmy breezes, and rest on flowery beds. The road the Master went, was a thorny road, and He said, &quot;Follow me.&quot;  The way of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cross</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the way to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">crown.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The cross is a symbol of death by crucifixion.  The word teaches that through much tribulation (fire) we must enter the kingdom of God. `Acts 14:22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lord is represented as a refiner of silver, watching His children in the fire, and thus He will purify the sons of Levi. `Mal. 3:3`.  These trials are often severe, but they have their attending joys.  Jesus said to His disciples, &quot;In the world ye shall have tribulation; but in me ye shall have peace.&quot; `John 16:23`.  Paul says, &quot;We glory in tribulations also,&quot; because of the good effects on character. `Rom. 5:3-6`. None of these things can separate us from the love of God in Christ. `Rom. 8:35-39`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It seems that the fiery baptism whether it be of a nation, church or an individual is permitted in mercy, as a purifying process, without which the final good is not attainable.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand the baptism of fire is for the destruction of the flesh-- the old nature; that as a means to that end we need the baptism of the Spirit; but the Spirit has the double work of killing, and of making alive with a new and immortal life; and we believe that both are represented by the baptism of water--which is a symbolic death and resurrection.      J. H. P.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REDEMPTION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These are the three steps by which we are to reach &quot;the prize of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">high calling&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--glory, honor and immortality. Not one of these steps can be omitted by those who win the great prize, nor can they be taken in any way but their order as directed in the Scriptures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Justification comes first as a necessity, because, all the human race being sinners, as such God could not either sanctify or glorify them; therefore, by some means, they must be &quot;made free from sin&quot; (brought to a condition of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin-less-ness)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in order that they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">might</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;have their fruit unto holiness&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(sanctification),</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and eventually receive &quot;the end thereof-- eternal life&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(redemption).</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> `Rom. 6:22`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As sinners, men &quot;are not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can they be.&quot; (`Rom. 8:7`).  We are &quot;made free from sin&quot; by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that is, we are told of God that a ransom has been given for our sin, and that if we by faith accept the ransom, he no longer regards or treats us as sinners, but as perfect and sinless beings. This cleansing from sin is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">complete</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> work.  You are justified--reckoned of God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and perfect, but it cannot be seen with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> eye.  You cannot realize that physically you are any more </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than before you believed yourself justified.  It is entirely by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eye of faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that you know yourself now as a being, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> freely from all things.  God's word declares it and you </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believe</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We need not fear that our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justification</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is incomplete, for Jehovah Himself is the justifier, as we read, God is &quot;just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus&quot; (`Rom. 3:26`), and again, &quot;Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?  It is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God that justifieth.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Upon what grounds does God reckon human sinners as justified or righteous persons?  Because the ransom for our sins has been paid by Jesus, who &quot;Himself bare </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in His own body on the tree.&quot; (`1 Pet. 2:24`). For &quot;Christ suffered, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unjust</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (sinners), that He might bring us to God&quot; (`1 Pet. 3:18`) as justified beings.  Jesus was treated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as a sinner</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on our behalf, and we are now treated as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> persons on His behalf.  As we read again, &quot;Ye are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the name of the Lord Jesus.&quot; (`1 Cor. 6:11`).  And again, &quot;Being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.&quot; (`Rom. 5:9`).  But</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ONLY BELIEVERS ARE JUSTIFIED</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">during this Gospel age.  They who do not believe that Christ </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">died for our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> according to the Scriptures, and that &quot;He rose again </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the third day,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for our justification (`1 Cor. 15:14`; `Rom. 4:25`), are not justified: &quot;Ye are yet in your sins.&quot;  So we read, God &quot;is the justifier of him which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believeth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in Jesus.&quot;  Again, &quot;All that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believe</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are justified from all things&quot; (`Acts 13:39`), and &quot;A man is justified by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Gal. 2:16` and `3:24`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When we believe the &quot;good news&quot; of our justification, it causes us joy and peace to realize that we may now come to God; and we no longer dread but now love God, because we see His goodness and love, for &quot;herein is the love of God manifested.&quot; (`1 Jno. 4:9`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are thus brought into fellowship with God as justified </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beings --&quot;Being justified by faith, we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">peace with God.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 5:1`). Few, very few, lay hold upon justification fully; few believe God that they &quot;are justified from all things&quot; and are in God's sight clothed in the spotlessness of Jesus, in whom was no sin; consequently very few have the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">joy and peace</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which spring from believing.  And it is no uncommon thing to hear, in church meetings of all denominations, men and women tell God that they know themselves to be &quot;miserable sinners.&quot;  Poor creatures, no wonder they agonize and daily ask the forgiveness of those sins which God's word declares </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> forgiven. `2 Pet. 1:9`.  They know not that they partake of the justification by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believing.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If they would only believe God, they would have the realization of forgiveness, and consequently joy and peace.  &quot;For without </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it is impossible to please God.&quot; Beyond this point of rejoicing in a consciousness of forgiveness of sins, and acceptableness in God's sight, few Christians go.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Did you ever think why God has</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R199 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">made known to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> our justification </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but keeps it hidden from the great mass of the race until the millennial age, though the ransom price is eventually to release all mankind from sin and its penalty, and bring them to the same condition of acceptance --sinlessness--perfection which we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now enjoy by faith?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It is because God has a plan which He is working out according to the counsel of His own will, and a part of that plan is that He will select from among mankind a number who will eventually be transferred from the earthly conditions and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to spiritual conditions and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--to be &quot;heirs of God, joint heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God's object in the development of this &quot;little flock&quot; is two-fold: first, He will make them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">everlasting monuments</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of His goodness, to be known and read of angels and men.  As Paul expresses it (`Eph. 2:7`), God's plan in the development of the Gospel church of overcomers, is, &quot;That </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the ages to come, He might show the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exceeding riches of His grace,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in His kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.&quot;  The second part of God's</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R200 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">plan, in which we are directly associated, is, that He purposes to use us during the next--millennial--age as kings (rulers) and priests (teachers), when we shall reign with Christ a thousand years. (`Rev. 5:10`, `20:6`). Thus shall the &quot;seed,&quot; of which Jesus is the head, bless all the families of the earth. (`Gal. 3:29`).</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">No sinners are called</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to have part in this &quot;high calling, which is of God in Christ Jesus.&quot;  True, Jesus called &quot;sinners to repentance&quot;--so does the word of God, and all his children seek to bring men to repentance and faith in Christ and consequent justification. But only the justified ones are called to be &quot;kings and priests unto God, and to reign on the earth.&quot; It is worse than useless to present the grand prize for which we run to the attention of sinners--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unjustified.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> For the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, neither can he know them, for they are spiritually discerned--they are foolishness unto him.  Therefore, &quot;cast not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your pearls</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This being true, that none are called to the high calling except the justified ones, the fact that you know of your justification may be the proof to you that you are one of those whom God has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;called&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to spiritual life and joint-heirship with Jesus. What a blessed privilege to be called with such a high </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">calling.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Now do you realize that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">you</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are called to be a member of the Bride of Christ? Then remember who called you-- God; and that &quot;Faithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.&quot; (`1 Thess. 5:24`). Our Father mocks none with a call which they cannot attain to.  His grace is sufficient for us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All who are called may take the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> step--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SANCTIFICATION</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To sanctify is to set apart or separate to a special thing or use.  God's will is that all justified ones should be sanctified or set apart to his service as we read: &quot;This is the will of God even your (believers) sanctification.&quot; (`1 Thes. 4:3`.) There are two parts to sanctification--first ours, secondly God's part.  As we have seen, God provides for our justification as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and then calls us to set apart--sanctify --or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consecrate</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to him, that justified </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">humanity.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  When we do, thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consecrate</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or give up our will, our time, talent, life and all we have and are to God, and ask him to take our little all and use it as seemeth to him good, and agree to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">let</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the will of God dwell in us richly--when we have done this we have done all that we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">can</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> do; and here God who accepts of every such </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> begins His part of the sanctification work.  He begins to use this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resigned to his care and &quot;to work in you both to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">do&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in harmony with his will.  From that moment it is no longer you (the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but &quot;Christ in you.&quot;  Even the earthly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(human)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body, under the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> controlling will (God's) is used in God's service and is thereby made holy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From this moment when we give consecrate--ourselves--we are reckoned </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">dead, as human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beings for the human will, should be buried from that moment forward; and when the will of God--the mind of Christ--the Holy Spirit takes possession of us so that it becomes our will and our mind, we are called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;new creatures&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--we are thus begotten to newness of life.  This </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new creature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is only an embryo being: It is not complete; but it grows and develops and &quot;we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord.&quot; (`2 Cor. 3:18`.)  Thus as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> spiritual creatures we grow in his likeness during the time we abide in this earthly condition.  As the spiritual nature grows stronger the human nature grows weaker and is the easier to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">keep dead,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for I must not only give up my will to God, but keep it in a surrendered condition, &quot;keep my body </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">under&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--under God's will.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> spiritual nature grows it longs for its perfection when it will no longer be trammeled and fettered by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> conditions, but be &quot;like unto Christ's glorious body.&quot;  This is promised us--we have been begotten, and by and by shall be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">born</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Spirit--spiritual bodies, for &quot;that which is born of the Spirit is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spirit,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> just as truly as &quot;that which was born of the flesh was flesh.&quot;  Our begetting we have and our spiritual life is begun. It is to be completed, perfected, when this corruptible, and mortal condition shall give place to the incorruptible, immortal conditions of the Spiritual body.  This will be at the moment of resurrection to those who sleep in Jesus--raised spiritual bodies; and it will be the moment of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the living (from the fleshly body to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their own spiritual bodies</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- theirs as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> creatures.)  Thus, &quot;we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment.&quot; `1 Cor. 15:52`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;If I in Thy likeness, O Lord, may awake,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And shine a pure image of Thee,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Then I shall be satisfied when I can break</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       The fetters of flesh and be free.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  When on Thine own image in me Thou hast</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">            smiled,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Within Thy blest mansion, and when</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  The arms of my Father encircle His child,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       In glory and beauty arrayed.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of residence or condition, from the earthly body to the spiritual body is the third step of our development, viz:</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REDEMPTION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This redemption from the present earthly conditions, finishes and completes </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our salvation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the glory of power will follow.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Toward this the end of the race we are looking with longing eyes, &quot;Ourselves, that have the first fruits (begetting) of the Spirit, even we groan within ourselves waiting for sonship, --the redemption of our body&quot; (the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which Jesus is the head and all overcomers are members.) `Rom. 8:23`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE POWER WHICH SANCTIFIES.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is not a power of physical force that is used by the Spirit of God in our development, but a mental power which appeals to our minds and wills.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Spirit appeals to our reason, and uses the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">word of God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as its agent.  In the Word, the Spirit has in former ages stored up, both by prophetic utterances and Law shadows and types, those truths which God designed should during this Gospel age be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">food to sanctify the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body of Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and build it up in the most holy faith.  And we act wisely if we make use of this spiritual food. (&quot;Thy words were found and I did </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eat</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them.&quot; `Jer. 15:16`).  It is furnished us for the purpose of sanctifying us.  If we go to our Father and say, Father, I give myself all to thee; I pray thee, set me apart as holy to thy service, both now and hereafter.  Give me needed strength to do thy will.  He answers, yes, my child, I have already provided a rich store-house of truth, from which, if you eat, you shall have the strength you ask.  &quot;Knock, and it shall be opened unto you&quot;--seek, and you shall find.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The seeker returns, saying, Father, I found the store-house, but saw little but plain food exposed to view; most of the choice viands must have been locked up in the great closets which the keys did not seem to fit.  Father, give me strength in some other way. Not so, my child.  Part of your lesson is to learn that my way is best; that my way of giving is your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">best</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> way of receiving strength.  Go; your strength, joy, zeal and love for me will increase as one after another these closets open before you, revealing their rich treasures.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, the word of God is the treasure-house of our Father, in which He has stored </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to sanctify the church in every age, wherein is &quot;given us exceeding great and precious promises, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by these we might become</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">partakers of the Divine nature&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`2 Pet. 1:2,4`). In it is revealed &quot;the love of Christ (which) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">constraineth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> us.&quot; (`2 Cor. 5:14`), and by means of it our Master prayed that we should be sanctified: &quot;Father sanctify them through Thy truth.  Thy word is truth.&quot; (`John 17:17`.)  What Christian, then, who desires sanctification can afford to ignore the Scriptures? Which one will say he has no time to examine and seek in it for truth?  As well say he has no time for sanctification. </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It is the power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God unto salvation.&quot; (`Rom. 1:16`.)  Let us, then, who seek this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">great salvation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- high calling--say to ourselves as Paul said to Timothy (`2 Tim. 3:15-17`), &quot;From a child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">able to</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">make thee wise unto salvation.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;All Scripture given by inspiration of God is profitable, for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now call to mind the steps: First, justification of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human nature;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> second, a consecration or sacrifice of that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to God, its consequent death and the beginning of your existence as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual new creature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the human body during the present life; third, the completion of your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new, divine</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature, by the power of God, when you will be like unto Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">glorious body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--who is the express image of the Father's person. Glorious, high calling!  You are called: &quot;Many are called, few are chosen,&quot; &quot;Make your calling and election </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sure.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do you ask how you can make it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sure?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  I answer, by doing according to your covenant; give up your all to Father and let Him use you as he sees best--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;All for Jesus! all for Jesus!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       All your being's ransomed power:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  All your thoughts and words and doings,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       All your days and all your hours.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;If you do these things (which you covenanted) ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&quot; (`2 Pet. 1:10-11`.&quot;)  God will surely keep His part of the agreement [Faithful is He that called you.] &quot;If we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.&quot; (`2 Tim. 2:12`.)</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">AN OPEN LETTER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear Brother Russell, I write to ask your prayers for Mr. C., his wife, son and daughter.  They are steeped in sin.  Pray that they may be saved and become members of the Bride of Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">My dear brother, your request would be considered a very reasonable and proper one by most of christian people; but from our standpoint it would be the height of presumption. I can and do thank God that they and all others of our race ARE SAVED, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are redeemed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that in God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;due time&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they will be entirely released from the bondage of sin and death, and during the next (Millennial) age will come to a full knowledge of their Redeemer, and have abundant opportunity to come to the condition of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect men and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">women</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for &quot;Jesus Christ, by the grace of God tasted death for every man,&quot; &quot;Gave himself a ransom for all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> TESTIFIED IN DUE TIME.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To ask God to convert by any other means than </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the word</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;which is able to make them wise (now) unto salvation,&quot; would be to ask Him to perform a miracle.  If this be HIS WILL He can do so (as in Paul's case) without my asking Him; and would do so whether I ask or not.  If not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God's will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to make an exception of Mr. C. and family, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">who am I</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that I should ask Him to change His plans to suit mine?  Oh, no! rather reverse the order and change </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">my will</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to suit His plans.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His plan is to give &quot;Restitution&quot; to the billions in the next age, but to select </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> during the Gospel age &quot;a little flock&quot; (from among the billions who are redeemed from death)--to take out a people for His name--to be &quot;the Bride, the Lamb's wife&quot; and bear </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">His name.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It is not our business to help the Lord decide who shall be of that selected company.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The key to many unanswered prayers is &quot;ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss.&quot;  To be sure of an answer we must ask in harmony with God's plan and word.  Suppose now that I should ask the Lord that Mr. C. and family may be a part of Christ's bride, and suppose Mr. C. should not be the Lord's choice for that exalted position, one of two things would surely follow: either the Lord would take some one contrary to His will, or my prayer would go unanswered.  And undoubtedly it would be the latter--an unanswered prayer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Unacceptable prayers come from one of two causes: Either they are the desire of our old (human) nature or of the new spiritual nature uninstructed as to how to ask and what to ask for.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now brother, your request was undoubtedly made by your spiritual nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R202 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So far it was good; but our new nature or new mind can at present operate only through the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body and may consequently make mistakes (therefore, &quot;in this tabernacle we groan&quot;--longing for our spiritual body, which will be fully in harmony with our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--our birth).  It is because we are thus hampered by the imperfections of earthly conditions that &quot;the Spirit helpeth our infirmities;&quot; for we know not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">what things</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we should ask for as we ought, but &quot;the Spirit maketh intercession for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">saints</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> according to the will of God.&quot; (`Rom. 8:26`.) Therefore, sometimes God answers very improper prayers in a very gracious manner, though not according to the asking.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If we would ask and receive, we should study to ask aright.  &quot;Let the words of our mouth and the meditations of our heart be acceptable before Thee, O Lord, our strength and our Redeemer.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is only one source from which we can learn </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;what things</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we should ask for,&quot; and that is the Spirit's text-book--the Bible.  How important, then, it is for us to use our text-book and be well acquainted with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">God's plan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that we may ask in harmony with it and receive.  How fully this point was covered by our Lord Jesus, when he said: &quot;If ye abide in me (first condition) and my words abide in you (second condition), ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Truly, your brother in Christ.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R201 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">QUESTIONS OF CORRESPONDENTS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUESTION.--Bro. R., how could Moses appear on the Mount of transfiguration if not translated?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANSWER.--Moses was not translated; he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">died.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  (See `Deut. 34:5`.) He </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have been resurrected by God's power, but not as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body since Jesus was &quot;the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-born from the dead&quot; to a spiritual body; &quot;put to death in the flesh but quickened by the Spirit.&quot;  Moses may have been on the Mount as a fleshly being but nothing in the narrative demands it.  Jesus doubtless knew all about it and He charged them straightly, saying, &quot;See that ye tell no man the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">vision</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> until,&quot; etc. (`Matt. 17:9`.) If He thus calls it a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">vision</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who am I that I should call it a reality.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES.--Bro. R., why do you advise us to read the tracts carefully before handing to others?  I read them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">many</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> times and have been much instructed by so doing.  I don't know why I should doubt the truths they teach.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS.--The habit of giving tracts, etc., of whose contents the distributors are ignorant, often does harm.  We should be as careful about not distributing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">moral poison</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as any other--more so. If all our readers learn to examine the tracts it will aid them in the use of the same care with other writings, to see whether it be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">food</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">poison.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If by reading they are convinced that the tracts are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">food,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> such as many are starving for, it will fire their zeal in distributing them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then, too, we should like to think of all readers of the WATCH TOWER as preachers of God's plan and truth: &quot;living epistles known and read of all men&quot; &quot;ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">meekness.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Peter 3:15`.)  The reading of the tracts might be God's way of making ready your answer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES.--Dear Bro., do you not see that we, the people of these U.S. are the seed of Abraham, the lost tribe of Israel?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS.--Abraham was the father of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two seeds,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the children of the flesh [twelve tribes of Israel] and the children of promise, [faith], of which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seeds Ishmael and Isaac were types. (`Rom. 9:8`. and `Gal. 3:23,28,31`.) &quot;There are spiritual promises for the spiritual </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is Christ,&quot; &quot;and if ye be Christ's (members) then are ye Abraham's (spiritual) seed.&quot; (`Gal. 3:16,29`.)  None of the spiritual promises belong to the natural </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fleshly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seed, though any of them may give up their earthly promises and with the &quot;Gentiles become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fellow-heirs</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and of the same body [of Christ] and partakers of His promise, in Christ.&quot; `Eph. 3:6`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Almost all of the fleshly seed are so blinded by the fleshly promises, that they do not see the greater spiritual prize. (See `Rom. 9:30-32`.) &quot;What, then, Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for (the chief blessing through Abraham) but the election (the remnant, the few, in connection with the Gentiles) hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.&quot; But, &quot;they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in again&quot;--into the spiritual promises. [That is, as a nation they lost those spiritual promises and were cut off from them; but believing Israelites, as well as Gentiles, may be grafted into the spiritual vine by faith.]  But, I would not, (spiritual) brethren, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ye</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should be ignorant of this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mystery</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">...that blindness in part (to the larger part) hath happened unto Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in (to the spiritual blessings) &quot;And (thus) all Israel shall be saved,&quot; (receive the things promised them as the natural seed,) viz: &quot;There shall come out of Zion the deliverer (the spiritual seed) who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob, (fleshly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed.)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  For this is my covenant unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 11:7-23-25 and 26`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seeds of Abraham are referred to in `Rom. 4:16`: That &quot;the promise might be sure to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the seed (natural and spiritual) not to that only which is of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">law</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the natural) but to that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">also</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith.&quot;</font></b><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">We know not whether the people of these United States and of England are the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural, fleshly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> descendants of Israel or not.  It could make no difference as regards the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;prize of our high calling in Christ Jesus.&quot;  If they are, and were made to know it, the effect of those </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> promises would probably be to blind them to the spiritual prize as it did the others, 1800 years ago.  If they are of the natural seed, they will receive grand blessings in the coming age, after the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has been exalted to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">glory and power;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as it is written.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;They</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall obtain mercy (God's promised blessings) through </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mercy&quot; (through the spiritual seed.) `Rom. 11:31`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Bro. A. Hipsher, for answer to your question: see &quot;Unpardonable Sin,&quot; page 3.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES.--Dear Bro. what kind of bodies will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">little children</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have in the resurrection?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS.--Paul gives us an answer to this question in `1 Cor. 15:38`: &quot;God giveth...to every </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> His own body.&quot;  &quot;There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body&quot;--`vs. 44`. Adam, the perfect man will serve as an illustration of a perfect natural </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(human)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> body, what the earthly ones shall all be when the work of resurrection and restitution, is complete. Christ's body after his resurrection will serve as an illustration of a spiritual body.  Like Him, we who have been begotten of the Spirit shall be, when we get our birth, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have borne the image of the earthly, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we shall</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> also bear the image of the heavenly.-- `Vs. 48,49`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, let us use this rule: Were these children begotten and born of the flesh--fleshly bodies?  Yes. Were they afterward </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;begotten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Spirit by the word of truth?&quot;  No. Then they remained natural, or human, and as such belong to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while we who have been begotten of the spirit and are therefore of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual seed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and in the resurrection, God will give to every seed his own body; consequently they as part of the natural seed will have a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while we who have been begotten of the spirit and are therefore of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual seed,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will have our own bodies, viz: Spiritual bodies, &quot;like unto Christ's glorious body.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While they are designed ultimately to reach the same grand perfection of powers, and being enjoyed by the head of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> family, (Adam), yet we do not suppose that they will come out of their graves thus perfect. We </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presume</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (merely) that they will arise children and develop.  The government, etc., of children will be much easier when the curse begins to roll away; besides, in past ages the proportion of deaths in childhood, was much less than now.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Bro. J. Baldwin: It would require the entire space of Z.W.T. for a year or more to answer all your questions in full.  We commend to you the reading of all the tracts 3 or 4 times; then read &quot;DAY DAWN.&quot;  You need not expect to obtain all the truth on so great and grand a subject at one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">swallow,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it is a continuous eating.  You must seek.  &quot;He that seeketh findeth.&quot;  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall we know if we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">follow on</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to know the Lord.&quot; (`Hos. 6:3`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES.--Dear Bro. R., may we be sure we belong to the &quot;little flock,&quot; or must we be in doubt?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS.--&quot;I know in whom I have believed, and am persuaded that He is able to keep (preserve) that (life) which I have committed unto Him against that day.&quot;  Paul thus expresses his and our confidence in God that He is both able and willing to do for us, all of his part of the covenant.  The question, then, of our membership in the little flock depends entirely upon our keeping our part of the covenant.  We are His spiritual sheep, ever since we entered our covenant relationship,--we are His workmanship.  If we are entirely given up to Him, so that His will is accomplished in us [the human nature crucified] He will give us the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prize.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If we hinder the work by opposition of our wills, we lose the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prize</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and are obliged to come through the fire of tribulation in order to obtain the spiritual body.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We may not be able to say: the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">prize</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will surely be mine; but we can say if </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> entirely given up,--The prize is mine to-day unless I lose it to-morrow; and by God's grace I will &quot;keep my </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (humanity) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">under</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> lest after having preached to others (of the grand prize) I myself should be a castaway&quot; (from it.)</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">TIME SERVERS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The trimming, hesitating policy of many reminds us of Luther's words to Erasmus: &quot;You desire to walk upon eggs without crushing them, and among glasses without breaking them!&quot;  This is a difficult game to play at, and one which is more suitable for a clown at a theatre than a servant of Christ.  When you are attempting to compromise, you have to look around you and move cautiously as a tight-rope dancer, for fear of offending on one side or the other. A little too much this way or that and over you go.  A cat on hot cinders is in an enviable position.  No true-hearted man will ever bear such wretched constraint for any length of time, or indeed at all.  Think of being able to go no further than the aforementioned timorous, time-serving Erasmus, who said, &quot;I will not be unfaithful to the cause of Christ; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">at least so far as the age will permit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">me.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Out upon such cowardice: life is too dear when bought at such a price.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spurgeon.</font></b><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">When a cloud comes between us and the sun, it robs us for the time of the enjoyment of its beams.  It does not prevent him from shining, it merely hinders our enjoyment of him. Exactly so it is when we allow trials and sorrows, difficulties and perplexities, to hide from our souls the bright beams of our Father's countenance, which ever shine with changeless lustre in the face of Jesus Christ. There is no difficulty too great for our God; yea, the greater the difficulty the more room there is for Him to act in His proper character, as the God of all power and grace.  It is the privilege of faith to find God behind the cloud in all His faithfulness, love and power.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sel.</font></b><br />
