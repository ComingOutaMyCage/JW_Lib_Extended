<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LAY UP FOR YOURSELVES TREASURES.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Every person you know and every person you don't know, is a treasure seeker.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is seeking wealth; he rises early, labors hard and retires late, plans, studies, contrives, bends every energy of his being to get his prize.  He would tell you that he does not care for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">money</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--does not worship it-- yet poor man he is evidently deceiving himself; his actions speak louder than words.  He would labor </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">so</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for no person or thing he does not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">B</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is seeking honor and respect; he bends his energy to that end; money nor ease nor any other thing would purchase his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">honor.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He says &quot;A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.  I will leave to my family a legacy of honor.&quot;  He loves </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">honor</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and shows it by his actions.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">C</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is seeking pleasure: give him pleasure, jollity and mirth and he will give you his purse, his time, and sometimes his honor; this is a pleasure seeker.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">D</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seeks for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fame,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and art or war, or science, or the pulpit, or stage are merely stepping-stones to the attainment of the treasure which he seeks; the applause of men--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fame.</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">E</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> loves office and power; he becomes a politician and seeks it as his prize.  He drops business, family, pleasure, friends, ease; all go; all are sacrificed if need be to gain the prize of his ambition--this treasure he loves and seeks.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">F</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has no ambition beyond the comfort of family and friends, and the social pleasures of home.  Thought and muscle are taxed to this end.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">G</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seeks approbation of others, and dress of person, or of children, and by act, word and look she studies to obtain this aim of her life.  No labor is too great, no method too low, no time too valuable if she can excite admiration.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">H</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> loves self and seeks personal </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ease.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He likes money because it will give him ease.  He likes civilization and improvements because they will be of use to him; thinks favorably of wife, children, friends and servants, because they are useful, convenient and can assist him.  He worships ease and loves it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dear brother and sister, here we have the pictures of the treasures of all our neighbors and friends.  Are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> treasures among them?  Say not that your aim is a blending of these with others.  The experience of the wisest men is, that success in life is attainable only by the concentration of aim and powers upon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> attainment; that man's life is too short and his powers too feeble to reach several goals or prizes; to obtain more than one </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">treasure.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do I hear you say that the prize for which you are running is a heavenly one and that you are laying up your treasure in heaven?  I am glad that when you hold these treasures up before your mind you recognize them all as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which the moth and rust of time will soon destroy. I am glad if your hearts have not become so fond of these things, that you worship them and think them beautiful.  But let me put it plainly: Would your neighbor judging from your daily acts not suppose that you are bending all of your energies for some of these prizes?  Is he deceived, or are you, with reference to your real aim?  Do not your actions, as well as his, speak louder than words--What is your real treasure-- the thing which you really love?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The prize set before us in the gospel is far greater, far grander, far more pleasurable, far more honorable and far more rich than all of earth's prizes combined: and in addition it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fadeth not away.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If we obtain our prize we will have &quot;a far more exceeding and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eternal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> weight of glory.&quot; If we reach the goal of our race, we shall be the bride of the Lamb--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heirs</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God, joint heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord.  &quot;They (the world) seek a corruptible crown, but we an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruptible&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one--&quot;a crown of life [immortality] which fadeth not away.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do you say that you expect to gain both this heavenly prize and also some earthly ones?  Not so, not only does human experience teach that life is too brief, but God's word assures us that we &quot;cannot </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">serve</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God and mammon,&quot; (the world).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If these earthly prizes are obtained by so much effort, self-denial and perseverance, how about our great prize, should it not have yet more demand for our sacrifice of comfort, etc., in its acquirement?  Yet, now look at it-- your life labor; what is it for?  You are a farmer, let me ask you, for what is your labor spent?  I plow, sow, reap, raise stock, provide for myself and family, give to the support of religion, and lay up some each year by which I add farm to farm.  What treasure did you lay up in heaven?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You are a merchant; let me ask you, for what is your life and labor spent? I attend to my business diligently early and late: I allow nothing to hinder it.  By careful management and by giving it all of my time and ability, I am able not only to provide the comforts, but some of the luxuries of life for my family.  I give a tenth of all my profits to the Lord in benevolent and religious ways, and besides I have accumulated considerable property.  What treasure have you accumulated in heaven?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You are a tradesman or mechanic; how are you spending your life and labor?  I give my time, labor and talent to my trade.  I get as many of the comforts and luxuries of life as possible, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">if I could</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would lay up some earthly treasure.  I give my time and energy as fully or more so, than some who have better success. What time and talent have you expended seeking the heavenly treasures?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You are a housewife; how are you spending the life and labor consecrated to God's service?  I spend it all in my household duties, and when I make home very comfortable, and do all the little things I can to make it elegant and tasteful, and to keep my children looking the picture of neatness, and receive and make some calls among my worldly friends, that together with my own personal adornment takes up all of my time.  What treasure, what little things have you made ready for your heavenly mansion?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You are a widow--what are you doing with your life and talent consecrated to God's service?  My life is an humble one, and my opportunity for doing good is on a small scale, but when I learned from God's word that I was redeemed from sin by my Lord and then heard of the high calling to be of the Bride of Christ, a joint-heir to an inheritance incorruptible ...that fadeth not away, I asked upon what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">conditions,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I might be one.  The word informed me that I was to make a complete consecration of myself, mind and body, talents, reputation, influence, to the Lord to be used thereafter as his and I was to be as one dead, so that with Paul I could say: &quot;I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&quot;  So then, the will and talents, and all, would be his, and used by him.  I had so little to give him; I have little talent, no money, and almost no influence, and almost feared I need not come, but the word assured me that what our Father wanted was my heart and my consecrated service, that he had plenty of money and reputation.  So then I came: I gave myself all to him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       &quot;All for Jesus!  All for Jesus!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  All my beings ransomed powers;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       All my thoughts and words and doings,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  All my days and all my hours.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When I had fully consecrated all, I realized that it must not be in word only, but also </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in deed.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  I therefore sought direction from the word and prayed for understanding of it.  I asked myself, does the Lord want me to go out into the streets and preach and expect food and clothing to come miraculously for myself and child?  I found that God's will was, that I should spend some time and labor earning a living--that he that provideth not for his own household is worse than an infidel.  I found too, that Paul labored, working with his hands, that he might not be chargeable to any.  So I went to work as usual, knowing that if I was acting as God's agent, he wanted me to eat, and dress to his glory.  Then came the query: shall I labor and save money, so that in a few years I can stop all kinds of labor, and give </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my time to God's service? And again the word answered: &quot;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth&quot;--and again: &quot;Having food and clothing therewith be content.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Next I inquired, how comfortably shall I live; how much time shall I spend in the support of the old </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;earthen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">vessel,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and how much could be devoted more directly to God's work. I ordered and regulated my time so that none of it might be wasted--eating, working and sleeping were all arranged with a view to the glory of God, and I found that I had three hours for my consecrated work.  As already stated, my ability is not great and I wondered how I could make use of so much time.  I said to myself it is of utmost importance that if I am God's representative and child, and going forth as his servant, that I should know as much as possible of Father's will.  I must therefore, spend some of my consecrated time in feeding my new nature and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">embroidering</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my wedding garment.  Father tells me to &quot;search the scriptures,&quot; so with my Bible and my &quot;WATCH TOWER,&quot; I daily spend one hour-- not in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reading,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but in earnest study. I searched and found daily spiritual</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R186 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">food and my &quot;daily bread&quot; sometimes took two instead of one hour.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">How should I use my other hours? I sought the WORD again.  It said we were to spend our lives &quot;doing good unto all men as we have opportunity, especially to the household of faith,&quot; and I looked at Paul, Peter and Jesus</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R186 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">who said, &quot;ye have us for examples,&quot; and &quot;He hath set us an example that we should walk in his footsteps.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes this made my way clear; my chief object should be to give spiritual help, or secondly, any temporal aid or comfort to those needing it.  If there were two needing, one a saint, the other a sinner and I could help only one, the preference was to be shown for the saint.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I first visited my next-door neighbor, who has sickness and trouble, helped her to straighten her home and spoke a word of comfort and cheer and pointed her to a shadow of a great rock in this weary land where she might find solace and protection from the fierce rays of affliction.  I felt grateful to Father for thus permitting me to comfort a cast down one.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I next called on a lady of whose deep piety and christian character I had heard much, which led me to suppose that she lived very close to God. I wondered if she knew anything of God's great loving plan--of the Bride, the second company and the restitution of mankind in general to their former perfection, as the result of Christ's ransom.  I found her zealous and earnest in the Lord's service but her zeal was not according to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knowledge,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for she loved mankind and seemed to fear that God did not; she was carrying burdens, etc., and I thought how much good it would do this dear sister of the household of faith, if she knew as we do, God's loving </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">plan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of salvation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The thought occurred to me, you asked God to use you in his service, may be he is about to use poor you as his mouthpiece to tell this other dear child of his plan.  The thought made me feel humble, for I realized my own littleness and I feared lest I should not so present the subject to her, as to avoid arousing her prejudices. Secretly I asked for wisdom. I introduced myself as a child of God and heir of glory come to spend a half hour in christian intercourse. We talked of personal experiences and of the love of God manifested toward each of us, and I found no opportunity then of introducing much of the plan to her attention, merely suggesting that it would be blessed when the millennial reign would subdue evil and the &quot;knowledge of the Lord fill the whole earth,&quot; and on leaving I gave her one of our new tracts--No. 1.--&quot;Why will there be a second advent?&quot;  She thanked me, promised to read it, and invited me to come again, which I did, taking other tracts and our paper.  That sister is now rejoicing with us in our grand hopes and says her Bible has become a new book to her.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus my time was spent from day to day, until the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">three</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hours were not enough and became four, and I doubt not if Father sees best he can so provide for our temporal wants that I can give </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my days and hours in this blessed work.  It sometimes brings reproaches and scoffs from those who misinterpret my motives, but &quot;In his service pain is pleasure,&quot; and I rejoice that I am counted worthy to suffer reproach for the cause of the Master.  It seems to bring me more close to him who set us the example, and I consider Him who endured such contradiction (opposition) of sinners lest I should be weary or faint in my journey in &quot;the narrow way.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These five pictures represent persons who have consecrated all to God, who have covenanted to become dead to earthly aims, and ambitions and prizes, and have entered the list of those who will strive for &quot;The prize of our high calling&quot; and &quot;seek for glory, honor and immortality&quot;--the honor, the glory and the life promised only to the Bride--the overcomers, who keep their covenant.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us not deceive ourselves, brethren, into thinking that the Scriptures mean the opposite of what they say, when the message of the Master reads--&quot;Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth&quot;--nor conclude that it has no meaning, when it says: &quot;Lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven.&quot;  Think not when you are spending all your energies for self and money making, that you are following the instructions of Jesus, denying self and walking in His footsteps. He spent his time and energy in teaching and doing good to others.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Why, brother Russell, what strange views you hold on this subject.  I fear you are erratic.  Do you forget that the Apostle enjoins that we be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not slothful in business,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fervent in spirit, serving the Lord?  Do you forget, too, that Jesus in the parable condemns the servant who hid his money in the earth, and commends those who traded with their talents and increased them?  Would you have us stop business?  Would you have us sell our property and give or throw it away?  Are we not to be God's bankers, subject to his check or order?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No, dear friends, but I am convinced that in this particular all Christians have been led from the scriptural rule and instruction by the customs of the world, ably supported by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">selfish</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> principles of the old, fallen, human nature.  When the Lord engaged with us and sent us into His vineyard, we said, I go, sir; and then supposed we were living up to our contract when we had done some labor one day in the week, spending six times as much of our time, and amazingly more energy, in the accumulation of our earthly treasure than in his service for heavenly treasure. And if this is so the sooner we look at the matter fully and honestly, the better.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I will answer your queries.  I am aware we are not to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">slothful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in business, but is there not quite a difference between doing with your might what your hand finds to do, both in the Lord's service and in the proper care of these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bodies,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> etc., on the one hand, and giving all your might and power.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;All your days and all your hours&quot; in laying up earthly treasure (or trying to do so) and giving the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no opportunity or time to do for the Lord. Should we not pay some heed to the portions of that text which require us to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;serve</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Lord and be fervent in spirit&quot;?  Should we so exaggerate the statement &quot;not slothful in business,&quot; as to cause it to sap all the forces of our being, prevent our serving the Lord as we have covenanted to do, and cool off and starve out the fervency of our spiritual nature which we have no time to cherish or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">feed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with God's word?  Is this your understanding of &quot;not slothful in business,&quot; my brother, my sister?  No, I am sure it is not.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To your second question I answer: Yes, I remember the parable of the Talents given to the servants, etc. These talents represent our abilities. When you came into covenant with God you gave him yourself.  If you were an orator, count that five talents; if you were wealthy, count that two; if you had some power to make plain to people in a private way, God's love, count that three; if you could do none of these things, but could speak a word of kindness and sympathy and pave the way for others to declare the riches of God's grace, count that one.  These talents were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yours</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and you presented them to God and He in turn handed them to you again, telling you to use them and increase them </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in his service.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Thus he departed saying to us, as his church, &quot;occupy till I come.&quot;  At his coming he reckons with the servants and rewards them as they had made use of their abilities in his service.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Paul's talents we will suppose to have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">oratory.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If Paul had gone to tent making as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">business,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to make and lay up earthly treasure, or if he had used his oratory for the applause of men, or worldly wealth, it would have been the hiding of his talents in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earth.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In a word the parable of the &quot;Talents&quot; shows that you and I are responsible for the best use in God's service of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all talents we may</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">possess.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Would I have you sell your goods and give or throw your money away? The money and goods you possess should be reckoned as the Lord's, and you should use it as his word directs --neither wastefully, nor carelessly, nor grudgingly; but &quot;whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.&quot;  But it is one of the mistakes we have made, to suppose that, &quot;we are God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bankers,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> possessing either little or much of his money.  He does not give it to us as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bankers,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stewards,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the difference is this: the banker keeps money and merely pays out when he receives an order from the owner.  The steward is entrusted with the money </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to spend</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the owner's service. So God makes all his children &quot;stewards of the manifold grace (numerous gifts) of God.&quot;  Some possess many, others few.  According as they possess these gifts, they have a stewardship to fulfill in disposing of them. If wealth be one of these, it is your duty as a faithful steward to find ways and means of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">using</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it to God's glory. He has given us many ways and opportunities of doing this.  It may be spent in spreading the truth, or in ministering to the necessities of the saints, or for the poor in general, or in any of a hundred ways that may be presented to your attention, and commend themselves to your judgment-- &quot;doing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto all men as you have opportunity, especially to the household of faith.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Money is useless except as it can do some good to somebody, therefore, if you have it, use it.  God is the great </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">giver</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of all good, and wants his children to partake of this feature of his divine nature--love--benevolence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Would I have you quit your business, quit your farm, quit your trade? That depends on circumstances: If you are devoting more time to your business than is needful for your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">necessities</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proper</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> support of those who are dependent upon you, and the various avenues you may have for money in the Lord's service, then I should say stop some of your business</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R187 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and use the talent which would go to laying up treasure on earth in some branch of the Lord's service.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Are you wealthy?  If so, I would suggest that you stop at once the work of money gathering and &quot;heaping treasure for the last days,&quot; and go into the Lord's service with the same talents used in the service of self, and see if you can spend it as freely and as rapidly as you could make it. Make it your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">business to serve the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and then be--&quot;not slothful in business.&quot;  If you had lived in harmony with the commands of the Lord, it is altogether probable you would not now have so much.  Make amends for past neglects--go into the vineyard and though it be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;eleventh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hour,&quot; you may yet receive the &quot;penny&quot; (immortality).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But I am well aware that few of our readers are rich in earthly treasure. &quot;Not many rich...hath God chosen, but the poor of this world, rich in faith, heirs of the kingdom.&quot; What would I say to those not rich? I would say that probably </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">you</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are not to blame for not being rich; perhaps you worked as hard, and planned as much, to get riches as some who did get them: perhaps you are not poor because you spent your time and talent and money in God's service, diligent in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his business:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> How is that-- ask yourself?  If that has been your failing, begin anew, put forth your principle energies in laying up treasures in heaven.  Let the principal work of life be, to render to God the things that are God's--the things which you covenanted to spend in his service-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your all.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If you thus &quot;seek first the kingdom of God and its righteousness, all these (earthly things) shall be added unto you.&quot;  Probably not many of the luxuries of life, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all necessities</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be sure.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To the mothers and housewives let me say: Do not forget all other duties and privileges while attending to one.  If we consecrate all to God and then in every act seek to know and do his will, I understand that every such act is accepted of him as done in his service.  He has placed you in a responsible position; your first duty is to see to the comfort and good of husband and children, and with such things God is well pleased.  But do not forget that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to be done as pleasing the Lord.  Therefore remember the words of Paul regarding the dress, the hair, etc., both of yourself and your children, and so order your time that you will have some of it for partaking of spiritual food and some for ministering to others.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If you have means and can employ servants and thereby have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">your own</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to spend in the work of the Lord, we would suggest that as a wise use of time and money to God's glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, to all we would say: We recommend to your careful study and imitation example No. 5--the widow --as being a practical illustration of the teachings and acts of Jesus and the apostles, and warn you to lay aside earthly treasure seeking, as calculated to weigh you down to earth and result in your losing the prize for which we are running and which we believe is so soon to be realized.  Use earthly things--money, talents, reputation, all, as means to help you to make your calling and election sure, just as a man seeking earthly wealth uses every ability for the accomplishment of his ends.  Let us lay aside every weight and run with patience the race set before us, looking unto Jesus.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Does some one object that so living and not laying up treasure on earth would lead to want when sickness comes?  I answer, it would bring you into a position where your trust in God's promises would have opportunity for exercise.  But living thus closely to God you could claim all of the promises.  &quot;No </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good thing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.&quot;  &quot;For we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all things</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall work together for good to them that love God (and show it by obedience to his word) to the called according to his purpose.&quot; Besides I suggest that sickness is spoken of in scripture as being largely the result of sin, and the work of &quot;Him that has the power of death; that is, the devil.&quot;  The whole world</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">through sin has come under his control, but when any become disciples of Christ they are transferred out of the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son.  These, it would appear, are no longer subject to Satan except as his power may be permitted of Jesus and overruled for our good.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While our Lord may sometimes permit Satan to afflict his sheep for their development and perfection, sometimes, as in Paul's case, permitting &quot;a thorn in the flesh as a messenger of Satan to buffet&quot; them, yet we believe that as a rule if we were using our powers entirely and conscientiously in God's service we would not be so subject to sickness.  &quot;If we would judge ourselves, (see that we live in obedience to God's will) then we should not be judged of the Lord, but when judged we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.&quot; (`1 Cor. 11:31-32`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">James intimates the same thing when he says: &quot;Are any sick among you...the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">if he have committed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins they shall be forgiven.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Jesus implied the same thing when, before healing, he usually said, &quot;Thy sins be forgiven thee.&quot;  It is for us, however to follow the voice of our Shepherd and to trust him while we follow him.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;CAST NOT AWAY THEREFORE YOUR</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CONFIDENCE.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To the words of Paul, `Heb. 10:35-38` (Diaglott) your attention is requested. The reading of `verse 37`--&quot;For yet a very little while indeed, the coming one will come (be present) and will not delay&quot;--indicates that these words of the apostle, although applicable in a certain sense previously, are mainly so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Son of Man.  And we understand the words here penned by Paul, to have been given by the Spirit especially to us, who are living in the days of Christ's presence--the harvest, or end of this age.  And you will remember that much of Paul's writing is especially to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who are living in the close of the Gospel Age--for instance: &quot;In the last days perilous times shall come &amp;c.;&quot; again: &quot;Take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in that evil day&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the day of the Lord;&quot; again: &quot;For the fire (trials) of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall try every man's work of what sort it is.&quot;  The same is true of many, if not all the writings of the old and new testaments; in fact the great burden of the Prophet's and Apostle's writings seems to be with reference to the end of the Jewish and also of the Gospel Age, especially the latter.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Since then, we see that these words of the Spirit, were given especially to us who are living &quot;In the days of the Son of Man&quot;--&quot;the evil day&quot;--we should give them the more earnest heed.  As in every other case in which we are instructed concerning the evil</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R188 : page 3::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">day, there is the intimation that it will be a time of special trial, and admonitions to hold fast, &amp;c., are given as in this `38th verse`.  During the last six or seven years, the Lord has been leading us, his people, in a very remarkable manner: As we look backward we can see that our pathway has been as &quot;a shining light...shining more and more.&quot;  It has been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">progressive,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> bringing us strength with &quot;meat in due season.&quot;  It has caused us to grow both in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grace and knowledge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and this growth, taken in connection with the fact that we are not obliged to look back and now call </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">darkness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> what was then called by some of the brethren, &quot;a great flood of light,&quot; is the very strongest grounds for confidence that the same Lord who then supplied us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the word, is still providing of the same kind.  We say then, &quot;cast not away your confidence&quot; in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our Leader,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the great shepherd of the sheep.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If we were following </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> undoubtedly it would be different with us; undoubtedly one human idea would contradict another and that which was light one or two or six years ago would be regarded as darkness now: But with God there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning, and so it is with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> any knowledge or light coming from God must be like its author.  A new view of truth never can contradict a former truth.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;New light&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> never extinguishes older </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;light,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but adds to it.  If you were lighting up a building containing seven gas jets you would not extinguish one every time you lighted another, but would add one light to another and they would be in harmony and thus give increase of light: So is it with the light of truth; the true increase is by adding to, not by substituting one for another.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Therefore, in mentioning grounds of our confidence that we are in the shining path under the leading of the Spirit, we mention first that the tendency of present truth is to produce the proper fruit of the spirit, of which love is the chief.  The tendency of our growth in knowledge is to growth in grace.  &quot;He that hath this hope in him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">purifieth himself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> even as he (Jesus) is pure.&quot;  Our pathway has been one of increase of light in harmony with former light.  Thus we have been led to increased confidence in our leader.  Let us take</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A GLANCE BACKWARD</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">at the steps of progress, and let all notice that the progress is not only forward but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">upward; i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the tendency is from the natural to the spiritual. We will look, not at any one person's experience, but at what serves to show the advance of the knowledge of truth for ten years past.  Looking back to 1871, we see that many of our company were what are known as Second Adventists, and the light they held briefly stated, was that there would be a second advent of Jesus-- that he would come to bless and immortalize the saints, to judge the world and to burn up the world and all the wicked.  This, they claimed would occur in 1873, because the 6,000 years from the creation of Adam were complete then.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Well 1873 came, the end of 6,000 years, and yet no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">burning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the world, &amp;c.; but prophecies were found which pointed positively to 1874 as the time when Jesus was due to be present, and the resurrection of Daniel was also due as proved by the ending of jubilee cycles and the 1335 days of `Dan. 12`.  The autumn of 1874 anxiously expected, finally came, but the earth rolled on as ever; &quot;all things continued as they were from the beginning of creation.&quot;  All their hearts were sad; they said, surely we have been in error--but where?  Surely it is clearly taught that Jesus will come again; perhaps our calculation of time is at fault.  Carefully they examined the chronology but it seemed faultless and positively declared that the 6,000 years ended in 1873.  Then the prophetic arguments were carefully re-examined: Was an error found?  No, they stood the test of all investigation and the jubilee argument and &quot;1335 days&quot; of Daniel could not possibly be prolonged beyond the fall of '74 or spring of 1875 and these periods were both past.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Dark indeed seemed the outlook; all were discouraged.  It had seemed as though the Lord had been leading in the past, and yet now all these things which had been thought </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seemed to be proved darkness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Just at this time Bro. Keith, (one of our contributors) was used of the Lord to throw another beam of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the subject which brought order out of confusion, and caused all of the former &quot;light&quot; to shine with tenfold brightness.  Brother K. had been reading carefully `Matt. 24` chapter, using the &quot;Emphatic Diaglott,&quot; a new and very exact word for word translation of the New Testament; when he came to the `37th and 39th verses` he was much surprised to find that it read as follows, viz: &quot;For as the days of Noah, thus will be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Son of Man. For as in those days, those before the deluge they were eating and drinking, marrying and pledging in marriage till the day that Noah entered the Ark, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">understood not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> till the Deluge came and swept them all away; thus will be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Son of Man.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">His surprise was, at finding that the Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">parousia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which signifies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had in our common version been improperly rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">coming,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the new rendering showed, that it was not the act of coming that resembled the days of Noah, but that as in Noah's days the masses of the people </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;knew not&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so it would be in the time of Jesus' </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at the second advent.  Humanity will go on eating, drinking, marrying, etc., as usual and &quot;know not&quot; that he is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The next step was, to see whether the account of the same discourse as recorded by Luke, would harmonize with this new idea of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unseen, except by the eye of faith, until the &quot;little flock&quot; typified by Noah had gone from among men into the condition of safety (from the coming storm) represented by the Ark--&quot;one taken and another left.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Luke's account was in perfect accord with Matthew's, though in different words--&quot;As it was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the days</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Noah so shall it be also </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the days</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Son of Man.&quot; (`Luke 17:26`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This was communicated to others of the disappointed ones, and with the remembrance that the time arguments above referred to had been found faultless and unalterable and proved that Jesus was due here in the fall of 1874, came the thought-- can it be possible that Jesus does not come in a fleshly body at His second advent?  Can it be possible that His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> began at the time indicated in those prophecies and yet we went on eating and drinking, etc., and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;knew not&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of His presence?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A careful examination of the word was begun by all deeply interested, to see whether it, as a whole, would be in harmony with this new thought. It was found to be in perfect harmony and opened up and made clear many scriptures hitherto dark: For instance the differences between </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> earthly bodies and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> heavenly bodies; how that the things which are seen are temporal, natural, but the things that are not seen are eternal, spiritual; that spiritual beings could not be seen by mortals, (without a miracle) and that the object and scope of the Gospel age was, the taking out of the world of mankind a &quot;little flock&quot; to be associated with Jesus in the work of the future--destroying evil and blessing all the families of the earth; that God's plan was not, to destroy all mankind after the gathering of the Gospel church but to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;restore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all things&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and destroy only the evil which now rules in the world; that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> supposed to be literal, was really symbolic and signified a great time of trouble which would be the close of the Gospel age and dawn of the Millennial in which all evil principles of governments and society would be manifested and destroyed, as a necessary preparation for the coming blessing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So says the Prophet: &quot;Wait ye upon me saith the Lord, until </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the day</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms and pour upon them mine indignation even </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my fierce anger for all the earth, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall be devoured with the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire of my jealousy:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> For then will I turn to the people a pure language and they shall all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent.&quot; (`Zeph. 3:8-9`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As to the manner of Christ's coming other scriptures were found to be in perfect accord with the accounts of Matt. and Luke, of its being an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unseen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> For instance, the angel's message--`Acts 1:11`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THIS SAME JESUS SHALL SO COME IN</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">LIKE MANNER</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">as ye have seen him go into heaven.&quot; This had generally been supposed to teach that Jesus would come </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of men, as he was there seen of the disciples: but when carefully examined the text does not say that any one will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">see</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him, but that he will so come as he went away.  He went away not with &quot;flaming fire&quot; and rolling thunder and great outward demonstration, but silently, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unknown</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the world.  And if he &quot;so comes in like manner,&quot; how much in harmony with Matthew's and Luke's record--they will eat and drink and know not of his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the angels' language seemed peculiar--this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus as though there had been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">another</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Jesus: Examination revealed the fact, that Jesus since His resurrection is a totally different being from the Jesus who died; that a great change had taken place. While before his death he had been the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christ Jesus&quot; having the form of a servant and perfect human powers, etc., and yet none but human powers, except as the Father's power was operated and manifested through him: (`John 14:10`.)  Yet now, since his resurrection he claims </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine powers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not as the Father in him, but as His own, saying--&quot;All power in heaven and in earth is given unto </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">me&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and he is no longer a natural, but a spiritual body--&quot;It was sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body-- sown mortal raised immortal and exercising</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">powers peculiar to his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">conditions,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he would appear and disappear and they could not tell whence he came nor whither he went; thus personally illustrating his own teachings to Nicodemus: &quot;That which is born of the Spirit </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is Spirit.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  (Jesus was the first born from the dead to the spiritual plane--&quot;by the Spirit.&quot;) The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can'st not tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">so is every one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that is born of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spirit.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Jno. 3:8`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was clear too that while desiring the disciples to realize that he was risen, Jesus wished them also to realize the change that had taken place and that he was no longer bound by human conditions, etc., therefore, he appeared to them under supernatural circumstances and in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">various forms,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or bodies, none of which bodies were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> spiritual person, but merely a garb by which he made himself known to their human senses.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When it was understood that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same Jesus&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was a spiritual body, unseen</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R189 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">except by the performance of a miracle, the saying of the angels was perfectly clear.  Then, one after another, various scriptures gradually took their places and all began to see how &quot;The Kingdom of God cometh not with observation&quot; (margin, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">outward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">show</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> neither shall men say, lo here, or lo there, for the kingdom of God will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">among</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them (an invisible power.) (`Luke 17:20`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When it was discovered that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;As</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the lightning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which shineth...so shall the Son of Man be in his day;&quot; meant, not that he would be like the shining but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;as the lightning&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">invisible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> electric fluid) which produces the shining, it was manifest why the warning was given: If any man say unto you, lo here is Christ, or lo there! believe it not.  Go not after them nor follow them, for I will not be visible to the natural eye, but as the lightning is discernable only by its shining and power, so will I be in my day recognizable to my waiting bride by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light of truth,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and afterward to the world, in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">light of events</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;the flaming fire&quot; of the day of trouble.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Many other little points were noticed, too numerous to relate, all in full accord with this; such as, that the literal rendering of `verses 46 and 50 of Matt. 24` teach that when the Lord </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">has come</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> some of his servants will be giving to the household of faith &quot;meat in due season&quot; [which of course would be the declaring of His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while other </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">servants</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would say, &quot;My Lord delayeth His coming&quot; [has not come] and smite their fellow servants who present the &quot;meat in due season.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Meantime the grandest &quot;time argument&quot; we have, viz: The two dispensation parallels began to take its place supported by both the law and the prophets, it showed the Jewish age to be the exact pattern or picture on the fleshly plane of the Gospel Age on the higher, spiritual plane, and that the two ages were to be of the same length.  The parallels in the close of the two ages were seen to be especially beautiful and striking, the closing work of their age being called a &quot;harvest&quot; lasted forty years from A.D. 30 to A.D. 70, from the beginning of Jesus' ministry to the destruction of their city and nation. We saw that the work of that harvest, reaping, separating of wheat and chaff, the gathering of the wheat into the Gospel garner and burning the chaff of that age, while done on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> plane, was not apprehended by any but the wheat: As a people, &quot;they knew not the time of their visitation&quot; --&quot;it was hid from their eyes&quot; because they sought it not by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> We saw too, that Jesus taught that there would be such a harvest in the end of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> age. `Matt. 13:39`.  &quot;So shall it be in the end of this world (age).  The character of the work to be done in this harvest, viz: separating wheat from tares, before the wheat should &quot;shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father or the tares go into the fire of trouble, when coupled with the fact that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wheat,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when gathered, would be taken from the ordinary duties of life--the field, bed and mill, showed clearly that the harvest work would be one, invisible to the natural eye, for the separating spiritually must take place before the wheat is gathered.  The next point was to notice that in the separating, or harvesting of the Jewish age</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">TRUTH WAS THE SICKLE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and Jesus in the flesh, the chief reaper or Lord of the harvest, the Apostles and &quot;the seventy&quot; under-reapers.  The message of each of them and of Jesus himself was the sickle which did the dividing work, viz: that Jesus was &quot;the Christ, the Son of the living God,&quot; and that, as represented in him &quot;the Kingdom of God was come nigh unto (them)--repent and believe the good news.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus &quot;He came to his own, but his own received him not&quot; excepting the few.  The parallels of these two ages showed that the time of harvest had come for this Gospel Age, that it was due to begin in 1874, just the place the Prophets and the Law had already shown Jesus as due to be present.  And when it was remembered that this age is higher than the fleshly Jewish Age, it seemed perfectly proper that the harvesting in the end of this age, should be an unseen work.  And so we are taught that it is an invisible work, by invisible, because spiritual beings--Jesus, the chief reaper (`Rev. 14:14-15`) and angels, the under-reapers (`Matt. 13:39`) quietly, and invisible, separating wheat from tares, etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As then the sickle was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that Jesus, the Son of God was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so now the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seems to be used as a separater--the presence of Jesus, the Bridegroom, Reaper and King.  As then only the few who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;had</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ears to hear&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> recognized the truth, so now, only the wheat are expected to know, &quot;the wise (with heavenly wisdom) shall understand.&quot;  &quot;Ye brethren are not in darkness, that that day (the day of the Lord's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should overtake you as a thief.&quot;  So one point after another added </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">harmonious</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> light and evidence that we were not following cunningly devised fables, but walking in the light and we rejoiced.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Coming to the spring of 1878, the time parallel to the giving up of the Jewish church and ending of the Gospel church by the Spirit, we naturally and not unreasonably expected some change of our condition, and all were more or less disappointed when nothing supernatural occurred. But our disappointment was brief, for we noticed that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jewish</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> church (and not the Gospel church) was the pattern of ours, and therefore we should not expect parallels to Pentecost or to anything which happened in the beginning of this church.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We looked again at the Jewish church as the pattern and saw that though Jesus gave them up as a fleshly house at the close of his three and a half years ministry, yet he continued </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">special</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> favor to them afterward saying to the disciples after resurrection, &quot;that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,...</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">beginning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">at Jerusalem.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Luke 24:47`.) `Acts 10:15-34 and 45`, showed that the gospel was not preached to any gentile for some time after Pentecost, Cornelius being the first convert.  Why was this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">favor</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shown to the Jews after the Gospel Age began, we inquired.  We found the answer when we referred to the prophecy of `Daniel, (9:24`,) viz: That seventy weeks of time (seven years to each week) was set apart by God as time during which his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">special favor</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would be extended to fleshly Israel as a people, during which, at the end of sixty-nine weeks, (7 &amp; 62, `Vs. 25`) Messiah should come.  (Fulfilled when Jesus was baptised in Jordan, and received the anointing of the Spirit which constituted him &quot;the Lord's anointed,&quot;--&quot;The Christ.&quot;)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then the seventieth week of the covenant still remained--seven years of God's favor, during which God said he would make an end of sins, anoint the most holy, etc., (`Vs. 24`). And during the seventieth week &quot;Messiah shall be cut off (die) but not for himself,&quot; thus causing all typical &quot;sacrifices and oblations to cease in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">midst of the seventieth week.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We saw clearly, therefore, that the gospel was preached among them as a people, as a part of the favor of those seventy weeks of years, and we therefore believe that Cornelius was converted three and a half years after the cross, and that while Jesus left them desolate as a nation and declared that &quot;the kingdom was taken from them, yet the people of that Jewish church were shown favor individually, by having the invitation to the gospel, spiritual kingdom offered to them.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We then looked for the parallel to this in the Gospel Age and found that the nominal Gospel church, the parallel of the Jewish church, was &quot;cast off&quot; or &quot;left desolate,&quot; &quot;spewed out&quot; at the parallel point of time, 1878, but was due to have favor as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">individuals</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for three and a half years, or until the autumn of 1881, during which they were to separate themselves from the &quot;Babylon&quot; church.  As Peter called those out of the given-up Jewish church, &quot;saying save yourselves from this perverse generation,&quot; (`Acts 2:40`,) so, now the wheat of the gospel church is addressed by the Spirit-- &quot;Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins and receive not of her plagues&quot;--(the seven last,) `Rev. 18`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Just at this time we met with a sad and very severe trial: A brother of influence and ability among us, departed from the very foundation of all faith, claiming that he did not need any one to pay the penalty for his sins, as he and all others did that for themselves when they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">died</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--in a word, that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">act of dying</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was the payment of sin, and that having died they all forthwith had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to life, and in consequence of that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all would be resurrected.  [The argument was specious and led astray many who had not recognized that the race was deprived of life because all were sinners, and that all must continue dead forever unless a ransom for sin had been given, and that</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R190 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Christ died </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for our sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> according to the Scriptures,&quot; and that his right to restore to life by a resurrection was by virtue of having paid the price-- or penalty &quot;in his own body on the tree,&quot; when as Daniel had said &quot;in the midst of the week&quot; he made an end of sin&quot;--&quot;made reconciliation for iniquity.&quot;]</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But this was only the beginning of our trials from this source: Having denied that the Lord bought them-- (`2 Peter 2:1`,)--he speedily went into further error, denying one after another of the above mentioned points of evidence, until finally he has denied that Christ is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and seems to have gone completely out of the light which we as a people hold.  This we say was a severe and unlooked for trial and troubled us much, until we noticed that it was the exact fulfillment of one of our Lord's parables, where he tells how, when the King came in just prior to the marriage, he found among those who were expecting to be united to him &quot;a man not having on a wedding garment,&quot; a person trusting in his own righteousness, believing that he did not need to have his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins forgiven,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that he could </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">die for himself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and pay for his own sins.  In the parable this one was &quot;cast into outer darkness&quot;-- the condition of ignorance in which the whole world is, concerning &quot;The day of the Lord&quot; and the fact which we see, so clearly, that we are now &quot;In the days of the Son of Man.&quot; With this parable fulfilled in harmony with all the others and with our position in general, while bitterly lamenting our brother's course, we were strengthened by the harmony of the truth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The result to our little company was a sifting and shaking which showed us another scripture.  Paul had said to us &quot;take unto you the whole</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ARMOR OF GOD</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">that ye may be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">able to withstand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> IN THE EVIL DAY&quot;--the day of the Lord. `Eph. 6:13`.  Some were unable to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the severity of this trial and like the above mentioned brother, have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">drawn back</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from the light.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The first three and a-half years from 74 to 78 seem as we look back at them, to have been devoted almost entirely to ascertaining and proving the fact of Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the harvest work of separating as now going on.  The latter half of this harvest has however, been spent very differently; very little time is spent in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proving</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the presence and very much time is spent in applying that truth, in urging holiness of heart and purity of life and consecration to his will and work, of all who would &quot;be like Him and see Him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as he is.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The light upon our pathway still shines and is more and more glorious: True the time arguments etc., proving Christ's presence were very essential and enjoyable, and we got all that was needful to us of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that kind of light,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> enough to satisfy all of the correctness of our position.  Since 1878 the light has been of a still more glorious spiritual and elevating character pointing out clearly the footprints of him in whose steps we are to follow.  Let us refresh your memory on some of these points &quot;though ye know them and be established in the present truth.&quot; For instance,</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THE WEDDING GARMENT&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">subject brought us to the consideration of our standing as new creatures in Christ and all saw more fully than ever before, how &quot;He who knew no sin,&quot; took our place and suffered death as though he had been the sinner, while we though actually sinners and imperfect are on that account accepted </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> perfect; how he bore our sins, and we bear and wear his righteousness as our wedding garment.&quot;  Our sins imputed to him, his righteousness imputed to us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The consideration of the same general topic: What is the ransom price? led us to examine The Law which Paul says is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shadow,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we examined as to how the blood of bulls and of goats took away sin typically, to learn how the guilt of the world is removed really.  This proved indeed a mine of wealth in which much digging may be done. [Tract No. 7 will be devoted to this subject].  The type of the day of atonement or making at one with God by sacrifices for sin, `Lev. 16`, was some of the sweetest food we had tasted and seemed to be &quot;meat in due season,&quot; for it showed us more clearly the intimate relationship between us and our head, not only in the glory to follow, but in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sufferings of the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present age,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;The day of atonement.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We saw that all who ever become members of the divine family on the spiritual plane must lose the fleshly being and nature first: that as the bullock was a type of Jesus' earthly-human nature laid down as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> so the two goats represented the church which &quot;fills up the measure of the afflictions of Christ which are behind.&quot; We saw that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">overcomers,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;the little flock&quot; of the church was</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R190 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">typified by the Lord's goat which in every particular followed in the footsteps of the bullock as we are to walk in the footsteps of Christ, our example.  And we saw how the second company, alas, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;great</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> company of Christians, fail to thus crucify and offer themselves, and must be &quot;sent away&quot; (as was the scapegoat) into great tribulation &quot;for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.&quot;  This led to searching inquiry: Am I a sharer in Christ's sufferings, being made conformable unto his death?  Am I a living sacrifice?--resulting, we hope, in &quot;a closer walk with God&quot; on the part of some.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Next came the subject of</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;RESTITUTION FOR WHOM?&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In this we saw the hope of believers of this age to be that of becoming </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> creatures, of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instead of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature, to which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> spiritual conditions we are now begotten and hope soon to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">born,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and for which we pray.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Finish, then, thy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> creation.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This we hope soon to realize, by being made like unto Christ's glorious body.  We saw these hopes of the church strongly contrasted with the hopes of the world, as held out in the scripture, when we saw for the first time, that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that God had promised the world in general --Restitution of all that sin had destroyed through Adam's disobedience, so that they would again be perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whose safeguard from future disobedience and sin would be their knowledge of, and experience with it, in the present life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We saw that the basis of all restitution was the payment of the debt of sin, and that to this end &quot;Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every man.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We next inquired, if his death brought restitution to us and found that it does, not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">actually</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> restoring us to the condition of perfect men, but by God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> all believers </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (though none are so actually).  We saw that we (who believe in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are so reckoned in order that we might have something to offer on God's altar, so that &quot;The righteousness of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the law</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is fulfilled in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If we had not been thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and reckoned righteous we could not present ourselves as &quot;living sacrifices&quot; for sinful creatures would not be acceptable sacrifices. But we are justified ones, redeemed from all sin </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect and restored</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in God's sight, through Christ &quot;by whom we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">have received the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> AT-ONE-MENT.&quot; (`Rom. 5:11`.)  &quot;In whom </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we have</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.&quot; (`Eph. 1:7`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And now our mission as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new creatures,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to yield up our human life, body and talents to God &quot;Doing good unto all men as we have opportunity, especially to the household of faith.&quot;  Next</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;THE NARROW WAY TO LIFE&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">opened up before us and we saw that the life here referred to, is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--or the perfection of life; and this brought to our attention the fact that God has many different orders of beings, all of whom, when in harmony with Him are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> though each is perfect on his own plane of being, as for instance, perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">angels</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are one order and perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (when restored to perfection) are another order.  These orders, one on the human plane and the other on the spiritual, would each be supplied with life forever from the great fountain-- God--and thus supplied enjoy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ever-</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lasting life.  But this showed us that the great prize for which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are running, is not merely continued existence, but if we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">over-comers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the promise is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (or life in ourselves) a quality or perfection of life, said to be possessed only by Father and Son and promised only to &quot;the little flock&quot; who walk the narrow way--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;The way our Leader trod.&quot; &quot;And few there be that find it.&quot;  As scripture began to narrow down to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">overcomers,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as those upon whom the prize, for which we are running should be bestowed it had the effect on many of stirring up to greater activity that &quot;no man take our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">crown&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --a feeling akin to that of Paul when he said: &quot;If by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">any means</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I might attain unto THE </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">resurrection,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the first resurrection which includes Jesus our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and all the members of His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;live and reign</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with Him a thousand years&quot;--only over-comers are to reign).  Therefore we seek to walk separate from the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Fresh light was shed upon the subject of</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">BAPTISM</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and we found the watery grave to be a very beautiful type, or illustration of our dying to the fleshly or human nature, yet that it is not the reality; and though we shall still use the water symbol as we think the Lord desires, and with still deeper pleasure since we see its perfect meaning, yet we now see and appreciate the baptism referred to by Paul as the essential one; in which a man being planted would surely be in Christ's likeness in THE </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(first) resurrection</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- &quot;For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His death </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R191 : page 5::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">shall be also</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the likeness of His resurrection.&quot; (`Rom. 6:5`.)  This taken in connection with the other statements of the same apostle--that we are to be made conformable unto His </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if we would be in His likeness in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (first) resurrection--must be dead with Him if we would live with Him--must suffer with Him if we would reign with Him--shows us plainly that Paul referred to the same baptism into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">death</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which Jesus spoke, when He said to His disciples who asked to sit in His throne of glory: &quot;Are ye indeed able </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(willing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> --the ability comes of God) to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with&quot;--death.  This is our incentive to &quot;both labor and suffer reproach;&quot; that we may honor Him and bless others, and receive the crown of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and glory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And now we come nearer to the time when</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">OUR CHANGE SEEMS DUE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(We know not the day or hour, but expect it during 1881, possibly near the autumn where the parallels show the favor to Zion complete and due to end, the door to the marriage to shut, and the high calling to be the bride of Christ, to cease.) and light on that subject is becoming clearer; we see that as the voices and trumpets of `1 Thes. 4:16`, are symbolic, so also, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">clouds</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are symbolic of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">trouble</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> gathering, in or during which, we shall be caught away to meet the Lord in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">air,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which we find is another symbol and used to represent the spiritual--supernatural-- control of earth's affairs now possessed by Satan the prince of the powers of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">air</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who is soon to be bound and give place to Jesus and His bride--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> powers of the air--(spiritual powers).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And further we have learned that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change and marriage,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while intimately associated, are not the same, that we shall be changed to be on the same spiritual plane as our Lord-- &quot;be like Him&quot;--like unto Christ's glorious body--the perfection of our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature before being joined or united with Him in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">glory of power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or office.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have noted how this was typified by Rebecca's meeting Isaac, which we believe to be a type of the church meeting her Lord.  When the servant had made known to Rebecca the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">presence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Isaac, she put on a vail and went to him and he took her and she became his wife.  So we are under the lead of the Spirit, which as God's servant is bringing the bride to the Bridegroom.  Our Lord is present and the spirit is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (through the word) making known this fact, and when all who constitute members of that little flock have come to realize His presence, they all will as Rebecca did, pass beyond the vail and be with Him and be united to Him.  Other features appeared relative to our condition</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">AFTER CHANGE BEFORE GLORY,</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and the work we shall do, after our change, under the vail of the flesh, for the &quot;great company&quot;--instructing them, separating them from the world, etc., under a series of judgments represented by the first three plagues upon the Egyptians and Israelites.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The first three plagues were visited upon the typical people by the hand of Aaron, who was a type of the translated church.  As Aaron was the mouthpiece of Moses, so we expect that, when changed, we shall, under the vail, be the mouthpiece of the kingdom of God for a time. This same general truth we found illustrated in the building of the temple --the temple built representing the church in its changed or completed condition--yet unglorified until the Levites and Priests had come into full harmony in God's praise.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And now, dearly beloved, as you look back and see how the light of truth has shone upon our path-way more and more, and especially as we see its richness in spiritual teaching, during the last two years have we not reason to do as one of old--&quot;thank God and take courage.&quot;  Do not brother Paul's words, &quot;cast not away your confidence,&quot; come to us with great force?  In view of God's past leading and blessing, have we any reason to cast away our confidence in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his presence?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Do not these precious truths so freely given to us, themselves evidence his presence, when we remember that he said, concerning this time: &quot;Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in and sup with him and he with me.&quot;  &quot;Blessed are those servants whom the Lord when he cometh (has come) shall find watching; verily, I say unto you, that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.&quot; (`Rev. 3:20`, `Luke 12:37`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">What wonder if we have meat to eat that the world knoweth not of. The master is come and himself is serving us with the meat in due season. But let us look more closely at the words of Paul: He says our confidence has</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A GREAT REWARD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have seen that it will have. Next he adds: &quot;For you have need of patience so that having done the will of God, you may receive the promise (things promised); for yet a very little while indeed, the coming one will come (be present) and will not delay.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This has now been accomplished; he has come and no longer delays. What now must we expect?  That we soon shall walk by sight of the natural eye and not by faith, as all through the Gospel Age since Pentecost?  Is this what we may expect?  O no, though the way is very clear and the light strong, yet we must still &quot;walk by faith and not by sight.&quot;  So says the next `verse, (38`). &quot;But my just one by faith shall live, and if he should shrink back my soul does not delight in him.&quot;  The just one referred to, is first of all, Jesus, and secondly all those who constitute members of the body of Christ.  The conditions of all are the same; none of them are children of God on the human plane, but on the divine, and when the evidences of the word are presented, they are expected to walk by faith, and must do so if they would be acceptable with the Lord.  &quot;If any man draw back (to walk by sight) my soul shall have no pleasure in him.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There must be something at </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to which the apostle refers calculated to make some draw back from the aforementioned light.  Brethren, &quot;cast not away your confidence which hath great recompence of reward.&quot; We surely have every reason for greater confidence than ever in the correctness of our position as we call to mind our leading in the past. &quot;We are not of them that draw back.&quot;</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">A SORE HEEL VERSUS A SORE HEAD.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel.&quot; `Gen. 3:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This prophecy was made at a time when all seemed to be lost, at the door of life, at the door of death. With a life of pure unsullied enjoyment in prospect, the new pair had taken possession of the new earth. They had a richer dowry than had ever fallen to the lot of morally intelligent beings.  (The power of transmission, and this power in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lower</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> order of animals was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for man's benefit.)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> They were not the first children of their father, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not the first created, but the first of their class.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In their complex structure the animal and the intellectual were wonderfully united, and they were made capable of receiving (through faith) a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine nature,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Peter 1:4`,) which from an embryo condition (`1 Peter 1:3-5`,) shall finally (in the resurrection) come forth a spiritual, immortal body, (`1 Cor. 15:44`,) the gift of God through Jesus Christ. Some have taught and do teach that man had and still has a spiritual nature, but Paul speaking of the first and second Adam, (`1 Cor. 15:45-46`,) says, &quot;the first man Adam was made a living soul&quot;; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(literally</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> animal soul, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">living being,)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.&quot;  How be it that was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not first</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which is spiritual, but that which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">afterward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that which is spiritual.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There are several scriptures, which, taken </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">alone,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would seem to some to indicate a combination of the natural and spiritual, such as `2 Cor. 4:16`. &quot;Though our outward man perish, yet the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man is renewed day by day.  That the inward man here is the renewed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mind,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we learn from `Rom. 7:22-23`: &quot;For I delight in the law of God after the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man, but I see another law in my </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">members,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> warring against the law of my </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and bringing me into captivity</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R191 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">to the law of sin which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in my</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">members</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--(the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">natural</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man, the sore heel).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, that the inward man is the renewed mind, or the begotten life, we infer from `Col. 3:10`, where Paul says: they &quot;have put on the new man which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">renewed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in knowledge after the image of him that created him.&quot; And this harmonizes with what John said to those who came to him (`Matt. 3:2`) saying: &quot;repent ye (change or have another mind) for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot;  The royal heir was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then present</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> though </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unknown.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We wish to bring before the minds of those who read this, the thought that through the infinite </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wisdom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the ever blessed God, only the animal nature of man (called the heel) will be overcome and fall into the hands of the enemy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for a time;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the superior part, the life, the seed, (hid with Christ in God) shall escape, and even for a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sore heel</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there is an</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R192 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">excellent preparation.  Doubtless the splendid dowry of this wonderful pair excited the cupidity of the enemy, and he thought, that if this marvel of creation, with the power of transmitting its life and qualities, could be smuggled into his kingdom, a powerful ally would be gained.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">That Satan </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">knew</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that man would die, is, to our mind extremely doubtful; he had God's word for it, the same as they had, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">disbelieved</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God's word, just as all Satan's children do.  He had never seen one die and disbelieved in death altogether and accordingly said: &quot;ye shall not surely die, for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.&quot;  Though the latter was true (`Gen. 3:22`,) yet they all soon knew that the former was false.  And yet the enemy still constrains people to believe and teach that they are immortal, and that he will yet get the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">most</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of them and hold dominion of the most cruel sort over them eternally.  But &quot;thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ,&quot; Satan was foiled and man was to die.  What! thank God that man was to die?  Yes, &quot;the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious.&quot; `2 Cor. 3:7`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The condemnation was glorious </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through its execution infinite wisdom and love were seen providing a penalty, from which eternal life could be extracted; that out from the dying race the one should come, who would destroy the deceiver.  Then and there the mandate went forth, and instead of man becoming an immortal ally of the deceivers, the truth of the words &quot;dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return,&quot; and &quot;I will put </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enmity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> between thee and the woman, and between thy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and her </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> took immediate effect, and the first death soon after, showed that the enemy </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only had hold of the heel</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the natural man.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A warfare of six thousand years has not lessened the enmity, but yet the malice and art of the enemy have not been able to reach higher than the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heel</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of &quot;the seed.&quot;  Thank God! What he evidently expected to gain (and what orthodoxy teaches that he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">did</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> gain, viz.: an immortal race,) dissolved in his grasp.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       &quot;Lift your glad voices in triumph on high;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       The plan was complete and man was to die.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  But--&quot;Through death he shall escape from</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">            death,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       And life eternal gain.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us notice here a marked difference in humanity; a class with a sore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and a class with a sore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heel.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (We speak soberly).  We say a marked difference in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">humanity;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the latter class are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not reckoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the flesh, because they have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">crucified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the flesh, and the renewed mind, inner man, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wars</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with it, and says with Paul, (`Gal. 2:20`,) &quot;I (the natural man) am crucified </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with Christ,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nevertheless I (the inner man) live, yet not I but Christ (the divine nature) liveth </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in me,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">renewed mind).</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We understand the sore or bruised heel to represent the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">physical</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> condition of Christ and his church, both as individuals, and a collective body. He humbled </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">himself</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> unto death, even the death of the cross, that he might open a new and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">living</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> way whereby these captives could be set at liberty.&quot; And those who have made, and will make a covenant with him by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sacrifice,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who are willing to suffer </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him, and &quot;fill up that which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">behind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the afflictions of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (heel) for his body's sake, which is the church,&quot; shall also be glorified together with him and have the exalted privilege of helping to lift up a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fallen world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the &quot;ages to come,&quot; and thus show the &quot;exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The sore or bruised </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we understand to represent the superior or thinking part, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mind,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and by metonymy, the whole being.  Satan is the corruptor of the human race, and those whom he corrupts are called his children (`John 8:44`,) and are injured in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Ver. 43`).  &quot;Why do ye not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">understand</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my speech?  Even because ye </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cannot hear</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> my word.&quot; These are the ones spoken of (`Ver. 15`) as &quot;thy seed&quot; and who are to be at </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">enmity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with the seed of the woman, (Christ and those who are his,) who are said (`1 Peter 1:23`,) to be &quot;born (begotten) not of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">corruptible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> seed but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">liveth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and abideth for ever.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This bruise upon the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is corrupt and smells of mortality, and such a head (mind) is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">liable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to sin &quot;against the holy ghost, (reject light when they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">see</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it?) and is in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;danger</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of eternal damnation&quot; (age-lasting condemnation) whether he lives in &quot;this world or the world (age) to come.&quot; (`Mark 3:29`).  But this injury to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;the seed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the woman&quot; is not corrupt above the heel (the physical nature) and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (head and body) when complete, will have put off mortality and will have life in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">itself;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for (`Rom. 2:7`,) to them &quot;who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life&quot; shall be given.  But this injury to the heel is an affliction to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">renewed mind,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and such, like Paul, &quot;find a law in their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">members</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> warring against the law of their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mind,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and bringing them into captivity to the law of sin which is in their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">members,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and cry out with him, (`Rom. 7:24-25`,) &quot;Who shall deliver me from this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">body of death?&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Answer--&quot;Jesus Christ our Lord,&quot; thank God.  So then, with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mind,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh (sore heel) the law of sin.&quot; (`Chap. 8:1`.)  &quot;There is, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">therefore, now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus;&quot; (&quot;renewed in the spirit of their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mind,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Eph. 4:2-3`,) who walk not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (down toward) the flesh, but after (according to) the spirit.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Great as the annoyance and distress is to have a sore heel, it is infinitely better than to have a sore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">head;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the thought that we are so soon to be made perfect should inspire us with patience to bear with fortitude the pain and vexation attending it, (`2 Cor. 4:11,16,17,18`.) For we which live are always delivered unto death </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for Jesus' sake,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh... for which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, (individual and collective </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">physical)</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> yet the inward man </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(mind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`Eph. 4:23`,) is renewed day by day.  For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we look </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at the things which are seen, for the things which are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">temporal;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but the things which are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not seen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eternal.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We would here recommend the remedy to which we have already referred, which is excellent; we have never known it to fail to relieve a limping disciple; it is referred to in `Eph. 6:15`, and is called &quot;the preparation of the gospel of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">peace.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We have tried it and can &quot;speak that we do know and testify that we have seen.&quot;  We can remember the time when our heel was so sensitive that certain </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sights</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sounds</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sensibly affected it; we have known instances where the sight of money caused some to limp badly; we call to mind one notable case where the sight or mention of &quot;thirty pieces of silver&quot; caused one to stumble and fall &quot;headlong.&quot; This is one of the worst cases of bruised heel we ever knew, and should think it was the head (for as we said that involves the whole being) if it were not for the statement made in `Matt. 1:8`; from this we infer that it was a desperate case of sore heel.  Another one, at sight of danger, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">falsified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">swore,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and afterward at the sound of cock-crowing &quot;wept bitterly.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have seen some stumble at sight of show-bills and at sound of music; and we have known some to stumble at sight of others stumbling; this is not unfrequently the case. We have known some to stumble and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fall</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at the sight and smell of whisky; and strange as it may seem, we have known many who limped so badly that they would stumble over a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cigar</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or a small bit of tobacco; and we have known cases quite numerous where even a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">feather</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or a little shining object like a pearl or a diamond were hard to step over.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But this preparation if faithfully used will cure all this and enable one to walk firmly and upright, though there may be a slight twinge in the heel occasionally.  But the bruise upon the head is terrible, much worse than that upon the heel, though some of its manifestations are similar, for instance: We have been credibly informed of cases which were excited to the highest pitch at the sound of the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">office,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who were totally deaf to the words &quot;Christ crucified,&quot; and very many who could distinctly hear the little word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">self</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> at any time, but if you were to add the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">denial</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to it they could not distinguish the sound.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the terrible phases of bruised head, is, that those thus afflicted will believe that nothing ails them, and consequently will have nothing done for them, while the sore heel class know full well what the trouble is and continually try to get better, and look forward hopefully to the time when they shall be well.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Light and heat, are the first requisites for a sore head, but it is very difficult to get such to come to the light. `John 3:19-20`.  There are many dark places now into which they can get away from the light, but the light-bearer is at hand, and though they shall call for the rocks and mountains to cover them that they may remain in the dark, yet the light will shine (`Isaiah 40:5`) &quot;and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One word more to our dear brethren of the bruised heel; (we all limp at times) this preparation is not only a protection, like a shoe, but it is an emollient if rightly used; we find that</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R193 : page 6::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">pouring (or having poured) into it the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;spirit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of truth&quot; is a great improvement, we have known of its being used without the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spirit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of truth and it became dry and hard.  For the benefit of those who would like to get it, we would say that they will find explicit directions in `Luke 11:13`. It has an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">invigorating</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> influence upon one, see `John 6:63`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We need, dear brethren to be well shod, and have on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">whole</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> armor of God, for there is something worse than flesh and blood to contend with. `Eph. 6:12`.  May the Lord enable us, &quot;having done all to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">stand,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the restored and perfected body of which Christ is the head, shall soon rest its crushing weight upon the head of the monster and triumphantly exclaim, &quot;thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&quot;         T. C. S.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">KNOWING AFTER THE FLESH.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.&quot;  &quot;Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature; old things are passed away.&quot; `2 Cor. 5:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Would that all God's children could look at this matter as Bro. Paul here expresses it: Once you and I were alive after the flesh.  Then we knew and criticised each other from a fleshly standpoint--&quot;after the flesh,&quot; but now the conditions are changed, we have become </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">New Creatures</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in Christ.  This new creation, new will, new mind, is still connected with the fleshly body and is thereby in continual danger of being overruled and controlled by the fleshly desires, hence there is a continual warfare between the old and the new natures, and the work of the new is, to conquer and put to death the old nature --to &quot;crucify the flesh.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It will at best be a slow and toilsome work to root up and destroy every vestige of our former selves, but from the time the work begins we should &quot;reckon ourselves dead indeed...but alive toward God.&quot; And not only so but we should reckon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">each other in Christ as dead</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the flesh.  If we were to carry this out fully we should &quot;henceforth know no man (in Christ) after the flesh,&quot; and how much sympathy and love this would develop one toward another. If I should see you, a brother in Christ, &quot;overtaken in a fault,&quot; would I harshly condemn you?  No; I should say to myself: Ah, that dear brother's enemy--his old nature--has overcome him, and instead of harsh condemnation, I would seek to restore such an one, remembering that it is not my brother of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new creation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which has thus sinned, but that his enemy, the flesh, has for the time being, gained the victory over him. And I should seek to &quot;restore such an one,&quot; in loving sympathy, remembering myself lest &quot;I also be tempted&quot; and overcome of my enemy--my fleshly nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Would that we thus knew each other after the new nature and not after the flesh.  It is thus our Father recognizes us--as new creatures in Christ and looks upon us as pure and spotless, covered by Christ's righteousness, &quot;not imputing our iniquities unto</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R216 : page 7::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">us.&quot;  He does not know us after the flesh, and oh how blessed it is for us that he does not.  Let us thus look at each other and it will help us to &quot;bear one another's burdens.&quot;  And &quot;ye that are strong (spiritually) can bear the infirmities of the weak.&quot;  You can remember that your brother's spiritual nature may be weaker than yours and that he may have a stronger enemy to fight in the person of his fleshly nature than you have.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us recognize each other in all things as &quot;members of the body of Christ,&quot; sons of God without rebuke, for &quot;He that dwelleth in God sinneth not for his seed remaineth in him.&quot; `1 John 3:9`.  The only thing that would be counted as sin in such a one would be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">willful sin,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and if your will consents to a sin, be sure you have not the mind of Christ and that you are not in him; you are yet in your sins.  Remember then that, &quot;If any man be in Christ, he is a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new creature,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and let us so regard one another.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FAITH AND WORKS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The relationship existing between faith and works is seemingly much confused in the minds of God's children. We would suggest that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">works</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> without faith would not count, as then it would be a sinner's works, which of necessity are imperfect: &quot;Without faith it is impossible to please God.&quot;  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> might exist alone for a time, for not by works are we justified, but by faith only.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">First, then, while sinners we learned of our ransom by the Lord, from sin, death, and all of the Adamic curse; &quot;that Christ died for our sins&quot; --&quot;the just for the unjust;&quot; that we &quot;were bought with a price, even the precious blood of Christ.&quot;  We believed this, and then God told us that though we do not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">actually</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> become free from the Adamic penalties, we are to reckon ourselves as though we had none of the imperfections and ailments of the fallen nature--as though </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  God tells us that he has received full satisfaction for our sins in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and henceforth looks upon all who come unto him by Jesus, as sinless beings--&quot;justified freely from all things.&quot;  This is the meaning of justified--reckoned righteous, sinless.  And thus we see how we come to this condition by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> without any regard to works.  &quot;Being justified by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we have peace with God.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From that moment you are a saved person and will surely be recovered from the effects of sin, and from that moment forward you should never think nor speak of yourself as &quot;a poor sinner.&quot;  Such we were, but have been redeemed and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But you are not yet an &quot;heir of glory.&quot;  Only believers, justified ones, are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">called</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be &quot;heirs of God, joint heirs with Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;  And now that you are a saved man or woman God calls you to be something more than human. He calls you to become a &quot;partaker of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">divine nature,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and mentions as the conditions upon which you can make your calling and election sure, that you shall resign your will to his, and thus take his will as the law of your being.  He tells you that his will is that you thus crucify, or put to death and ignore the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature which you are finally to lose entirely.  Thus your new divine nature grows up within the old or human, using this earthen vessel to the service of the Lord and not in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">its own</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> service.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And here </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">works</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> join </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We believe God's call and the exceeding great and precious promises of &quot;Glory, Honor and Immortality,&quot; and begin to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seek</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for it.  And </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> comes God's instruction to you: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Work out</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> your (higher spiritual) salvation with fear and trembling,&quot; and let God &quot;work in you to will and to do of his good pleasure.&quot; `Phil. 2:12`.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">This</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> salvation to the divine nature cannot be obtained by faith only-- cannot be obtained without </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">works,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> because there is no other way of complying with the conditions of our call and making our election sure. We were called to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffer,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> if we would reign with Christ.  But if you have faith in all these promises, and keep that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> locked in your bosom and live as an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">earthly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> being, working for earthly things, your faith without works is valueless, and the works of earth will swallow up and destroy the faith, and you will not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and consequently </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> reign.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If you know the conditions of this &quot;high calling&quot; to be: &quot;Take up your cross and follow Jesus' example of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">self</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-denial, do you think that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the promise, without following the example, will insure you the prize?&quot; Not so; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> alone justifies us, but works of obedience, as well as faith, are necessary if we would attain to that whereunto we are called.  It is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">overcomer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that inherits all things promised.  May the Lord help us to work not our own will, but to &quot;work the works of God,&quot; and may he give grace and increase our faith so that the promises may be so real to us that works will be easy.</font><br />

<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">BRO. RUSSELL--I have read carefully your articles in recent papers, touching the distinction between our human nature to which we become dead, and the Divine nature to which we are begotten, and hope soon to be born into its perfection.  But I inquire: Is there not to some extent a vein of truth in the claim made by some, that before we reach the Divine nature and image we must be perfected on the natural plane, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beings?  In other words, while we see that to the gospel church alone, of all human beings, is given the &quot;high calling,&quot; or promise of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">spiritual nature,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the balance of mankind are to be merely restored to perfection as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--natural, earthly beings, is there not a sense in which the church share this restitution as well as the inheritance of spiritual things?  And does it not seem that we must first come to the condition in which we can keep perfectly God's perfect law, which cannot be kept except by perfect beings?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS.  To your first question we reply: Yes, we think there is a vein of truth in the claim that all mankind must be restored to perfection of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nature before the Divine nature is attainable.  But as there is a difference between the final attainment of believers--the Divine nature--and the final attainment of the world in general--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to the perfection, etc., of humanity, so there is a difference too in the way in which the church and world partake of restitution. &quot;Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death for every man&quot;-- thus redeeming every man from sin and its consequences; and because of this purchase or ransom, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must go free from sin and all its results; and it is for this reason, there is to be a restitution.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The restoring of mankind in general will be of the most literal kind; they will during the millennial age, come again to perfection of body and mind, so that no longer will they be &quot;prone to sin as the sparks to fly upward&quot; but again </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">at one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with God. Having come to know good in contrast with evil, their restored powers will lead them to take pleasure in doing good and living in harmony with God.  This will be to them the full completion of the great work of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">at-one-ment.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Bringing into full harmony God and His creature, man, who has been out of harmony ever since sin entered the world.  Thus we see that the effect of restitution to the world, will be the bringing of them again to a condition, where they will have full fellowship and communion with God, and be able to do those things which are well pleasing in his sight.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But now notice, that all these blessings of restoration to God's favor, etc., which are to come to the world in the next age are possessed by believers now--in the Gospel Age.  Restitution to God's favor, etc., comes to believers by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> now.  It comes to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">us,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not actually as it will to the world.  Instead of having a mental and physical restitution, we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or reckoned of God as though we were actually perfect, and instead of exacting of us perfection of thought, word and act, our best efforts in these directions are accepted of God as being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In a word, as our sins were laid upon Jesus, so His righteousness is laid upon us.  As he who knew no sin was reckoned and dealt with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a sinner, bearing the penalty of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sins--death--&quot;in his own body on the tree,&quot; so we who were sinners are reckoned righteous and dealt with as such.  He bore our sins; we bear his righteousness.  As when he took our place and was treated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the sinner, the Father's face was withdrawn, and in his dying anguish he cried, &quot;My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me;&quot; so we who are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> come into the light of God's countenance and are no more reckoned sinners, but saints; no more aliens, but sons; &quot;and because we are sons, he hath sent forth his Spirit into our hearts, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.&quot;  Jesus cried </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a sinner; we cry </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sons.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But this condition of reckoned righteousness --justification--is only of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believers,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and is entered into only by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and cannot be obtained by works &quot;to him that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believeth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on Him that justifieth the ungodly, his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is counted for righteousness.... Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered.&quot; `Rom. 4:5-9`.  This righteousness or justification comes &quot;upon all them that believe,&quot; &quot;therefore we conclude that a man is justified by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 3:19-28`.)  This is our restitution, thus we who were aliens and afar off are made nigh to God by the blood of the cross--restored to his favor, as Adam was before sin.  And it is our high joy that our standing in God's sight is no longer as sinners, but as sons in Christ &quot;not having on our own righteousness...but that which is through the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christ.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Phil. 3:9`.)  And if God reckons us justified and sinless, we should so reckon ourselves.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our harmony with God comes because of justification--&quot;Being justified (by faith) we have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">peace with God.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> This same result will be reached in the next age by mankind in general: Being restored fully, they will have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;peace with God.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  We are apt, however to under-value our justification-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our righteousness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (ours because given to us by our head Jesus) God however puts a high value on it, reckons us--&quot;whiter than snow,&quot; pure as Him whose righteousness we bear--if we abide in Him.  Paul valued it properly when he said: &quot;Who is he that condemneth [us]?  It is Christ that died....Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?  It is God that justifieth.&quot; `Rom. 8:33`.  There is no appeal from this: The Judge of the Supreme Court of heaven says, &quot;we are justified freely from all things&quot; through the death of Jesus Christ His Son, who died the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to this justified condition.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;Free from the Law, oh happy condition,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  Jesus hath died and there is remission.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now how much more restitution do you want--how much more could you ask?  Is not everything that the world will have in the future, now yours by faith?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  &quot;How firm a foundation ye saints of the Lord;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       Is laid for your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in his excellent word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  What more can he say than to you he hath said,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled.&quot; He says--&quot;There is therefore </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.&quot; `Rom. 8:1`. It seems to us that the only thing which we could further ask is--why has our Father seen best to deal with us by imputing righteousness through faith, and with the masses of mankind by restoring actually?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have already given our views of why, and now repeat: that Restitution to perfection of the human nature (which is something grand and glorious, and inferior only when compared with the high exaltation of the church to the divine plane of spiritual perfection) is the full fruition of all promises held out for the world in the bible; but &quot;God (has) provided some </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">better thing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for us, that they without us should not be made perfect,&quot; (restored--`Heb. 11:40`).  Therefore because God has a &quot;better thing&quot; for us--our high calling to joint-heirship with Jesus Christ our Lord, He has found it necessary to give us a schooling and discipline in the school of faith, and calls us out from the world while evil is allowed to triumph in order that, as his sons, we may be trained to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">overcome</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> evil.  He calls us out from the world that we should &quot;walk by faith and not by sight.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These lives are justified then given</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R193 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">to us that we may have something to offer.  As our Leader (Jesus) was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and gave his life a sacrifice, so when we come to realize that we are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we esteem it a privilege to &quot;present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, our reasonable service.&quot;  It is acceptable because it is holy; it is holy because it is justified; it is justified because Christ died.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To your second question I reply: It certainly is true, as you say, that none but perfect beings can keep God's perfect law, and I will go further and add that none but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> beings are acceptable with God.  And when God's plans are all accomplished there will be nothing imperfect--all things will either be brought to perfection or destroyed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But as we have just proved we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">are</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect beings,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> being justified by Christ Jesus and therefore are acceptable with God by Jesus Christ.  And though &quot;by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified in his sight, we being justified not by the deeds of the law but by faith, can &quot;do those things which are well pleasing in his sight.&quot; (`1 John 3:21`).  And the righteousness of the law (love) is fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. (`Rom. 8:4`,) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> We are reckoned as having kept the Law perfectly while we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">walk</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> after the Spirit--use our endeavors to follow the leadings of our new nature.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In conclusion let me say: If we receive our share of restitution </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and present our justified lives a sacrifice acceptable to God, we need look for no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">second</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> restitution, nor can I think that any Christian who realizes his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> standing in Christ, and the begetting of the Spirit to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">newness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of life (the perfect spiritual) has any desire for the restoration of the old (human) nature which he has crucified, but rather for the new--divine nature --into which we so soon hope to come, when we shall be like him and see him as he is.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If only perfect beings can keep the law of God perfectly does it not prove that Jesus was more perfect than his human nature was spotless from the imperfections of the race whose likeness he took?  We think so.  How then, say some, Jesus was as imperfect physically, etc., as any member of the fallen human race--&quot;on the lowest round of the ladder&quot;--yet all admit that Jesus</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R194 : page 8::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">kept the whole law.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Dear Editor, please explain `1 Cor. 14:34`.  Let the women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be under obedience as also saith the law. (`Gen. 3:16`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. It is not for us to say why, when God gives no reasons.  Neither can we tell why Jesus sent none of the noble and good women who believed on him to preach, when he sent first the twelve and then the seventy before his face.  However, much may be said of good accomplished by women in the temperance cause, etc., we nevertheless believe that this scripture has never been disregarded with impunity.  We believe woman to be a type of the church, and man the type of Christ the head of the church, and we might draw the lesson that we, the spouse of Christ, are not to dispute or instruct in the church, but listen to the voice of our Head--give ear to his word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Bro. Russell, please give us your views of `Job 7:9`, and `14:12`. Does Job mean that man will not have a resurrection?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. In considering these and other scriptures, we should remember that different statements are true from different standpoints; for instance, Isaiah said &quot;Unto us a child is born.&quot;  This is true, and in the past; he also said: &quot;The government shall be upon his shoulders.&quot; This will be true in due time.  David said, personating Jesus--They gave me gall, etc., and parted my raiment among them.  This has been fulfilled but some other matters are still future, as for instance: &quot;The Lord reigneth; let the earth keep silence,&quot; etc.  This last will not be fulfilled until He shall </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">take</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his great power and reign, when we shall reign with him a thousand years.  So in the sayings of Job.  He saw mankind going down into death, and that being sinners they had no hope of saving themselves, and says, &quot;He that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.&quot;  This was properly the human standpoint, for remember that as yet Jesus had not died--the ransom price had not been paid, and the resurrection was little understood until Jesus &quot;abolished (vanquished) death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel.&quot; (`2 Tim. 1:10`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The necessity of pardon for sins is recognized in `Ver. 21`.  Job well knew that he could </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;climb up and win life for himself;&quot; that sin would cause him to sleep in the dust; and yet he seems to realize that God intended furnishing a ransom for sin--to take away the sin of the world--and he looks forward to the millennial or Restitution morn, for though he should be gone to dust, yet he says: &quot;Thou shalt seek me in the morning.&quot; In `14:12`, the same general hope is expressed: &quot;So man lieth down and riseth not.&quot;  A tree might be cut off and sprout again, but not so man, he cannot sprout, he cannot help himself; he must await the great deliverer, who says: &quot;I, (the Redeemer of the race--Jesus,) have the keys of death and hades&quot; (the grave) &quot;'Til the heavens be no more, (symbol of present rule of evil or Satan&quot;--the prince of the powers of the air&quot;--heavens) they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have heretofore noticed, that Job was used as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">representative</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the world in general--the great restitution masses, (whether he personally will have anything more than restitution we are not prepared to say,) but in his life he is used as a great illustration of the race.  Possessing much at first he loses almost all, and then a time of restitution comes and he has as many sons and daughters, comforts, friends, etc., as at first.  So our race was at first possessed of wonderful blessings of life, health, etc., almost all of which is now gone; but like Job their type they are soon to have a &quot;restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began.&quot; (`Acts 3:21`.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And not only does Job represent </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in his experience, but he speaks for them when he says--&quot;Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave; that thou wouldest keep me secret (hid) until thy wrath be past; that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me....Thou shalt call and I will answer thee; thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands.&quot; (`Vs. 13-15`.)  The saints are to be raised before the day of wrath for &quot;This honor hath all his saints to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">execute</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the judgments written.&quot; (`Psa. 149:9`.) But the class for whom Job speaks do not arise until the time of trouble is over--the present heavens (Satan's control) be no more and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">new</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> heavens (spiritual government of Christ and his bride over earth) be fully established.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Please explain `Rev. 10:6`: The angel sware &quot;that there should be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no longer.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. Many are the &quot;times and seasons which God hath put in his own power,&quot; and no doubt each of these will end as its work is accomplished; many have so ended already, for instance, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of God's favor to fleshly Israel--the Jewish age-- ended; and the time of favor to the gentiles--the gospel age--during which God is taking out of the gentiles a people for His name (His bride) is also to end, and it is this Gospel time or age which we understand to be referred to as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be no longer.&quot; `Verse 7` shows this: &quot;But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel--&quot;The seventh trump&quot;--&quot;The last trump&quot;--&quot;The trump of God,&quot; (`1 Cor. 15:52`, `1 Thes. 4:16`, and `Rev. 11`, `15`, `18`, `19`,) [during which the first resurrection and change of living saints occurs] the mystery of God should be finished.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Both God's plan and His church are called a &quot;mystery.&quot;  Neither are comprehended by the world.  When, however, the Gospel age or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ends, the church is exalted; and after the time of trouble the great work of blessing all the families of earth begins, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mystery</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> both of the church and God's plan will be finished, and both will shine forth to the praise of Him who loved us and bought us with His own precious blood.  God will no longer veil His plans and be thought vengeful and merciless, but the bud that had the bitter taste will bloom to a beautiful and fragrant flower.  His goodness in full glory shine declaring: &quot;God is LOVE.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Bro. Russell, please explain the command concerning feet washing. `John 13`?  It seems to be so plain a command I wonder why it is so little observed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. To our understanding, the lesson here taught the disciples by our Lord is humility, and that they should love one another to such an extent that they would consider no service too great nor too degrading which would minister to each other's comfort.  &quot;Let him that would be chief among you become servant of all.&quot;  &quot;If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you ought also to wash one another's feet.&quot;  And if you and I lived in the same warm country and wore the same kind of shoe or sandal which permitted the feet to be soiled and sored by the dirt and sand, it would no doubt be a great comfort and privilege for us to wash one another's feet.  But while we live as we do, under totally different circumstances, climate, etc., it would be anything but a service to me if you were to insist upon washing my feet as frequently as they do in Palestine--several times a day.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But there are hundreds of opportunities of showing the meek, lowly and loving spirit of our Master. Would that Christians could realize that, as God's stewards and servants, it is not self we are to minister to and serve and pamper, but it is our mission to &quot;do good unto all men as we have opportunity, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">especially to the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">household of faith,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> remembering that we are to walk in His footsteps who &quot;came not to be ministered unto (served), but to minister (serve) and to give his life a ransom for many.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">QUES. Please explain `Rev. 20:5`. The rest of the dead lived not again until the 1,000 years were finished.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">ANS. We understand that the resurrection is of two general divisions: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">One</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which is the resurrection to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> condition.  [&quot;Neither can </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> die any more.&quot; (`Luke 20:36`,) &quot;on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">such,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the second death hath NO POWER.&quot; (`Rev. 20:6`,)] and is composed exclusively of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;overcomers.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> This is scripturally called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> resurrection,&quot; &quot;The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first resurrection,&quot; etc.  </font></b><font face="Times New Roman">This </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first resurrection</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> (to immortality) commenced 1,800 years ago in the person of Jesus our Lord &quot;who is head over the church (of overcomers) which is His body&quot; and it will be complete when the &quot;overcomers&quot; of this age are made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Him</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">--the Bridegroom and Bride-- head and body united.  This will complete the resurrection to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Immortal</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> life.&quot; (See article &quot;The narrow way to life,&quot; October No. 1880, &quot;Z.W.T.&quot;)</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman">All the balance of mankind are to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">raised,</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> but &quot;every man in his own order.&quot;  The second company of the Gospel church--the great company who &quot;come up out of great tribulation&quot; will be second in order.  These come to the spiritual condition but never reach </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Immortality,</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> the prize for which </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> christians now are running and of which Paul says: &quot;So run that you may obtain,&quot; &amp;c.</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman">After these comes the resurrection of Jews and Gentiles of all ages, (in what order we know not except that it will be God's order.)  Their resurrection includes not only raising to partial life but also the bringing to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> life, hence it is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> and takes place during the Millennial age.  &quot;The times (years) of Restitution.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font face="Times New Roman">The words found in `Rev. 20:5` of the common version of the Bible, viz.: &quot;But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished,&quot; are not found in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">old and</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">authentic</font></b><font face="Times New Roman"> copies of Revelation.</font><br />
