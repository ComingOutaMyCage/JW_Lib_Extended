</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">was physically persecuted, he did not threaten his persecutors with revenge. Setting a fine example for his followers, Jesus at no time rendered injury for injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One who was an eyewitness of Jesus’ conduct said: “When he was being reviled, he did not go reviling in return. When he was suffering, he did not go threatening, but kept on committing himself to the one who judges righteously.” (1 Pct. 2:23) By such actions Jesus established the pattern for Christian conduct in relations with other people. It is a pattern that is not easy for imperfect humans to follow'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It seems to be a common tendency for people to w<sup>T</sup>ant to retaliate in kind for anything bad done toward them. Answering an insult with another insult starts a vicious cycle that can often erupt into a savage fight, with the end result being perhaps physical injuries or even death. It would be better to remain silent than to add fuel to the other person’s anger by returning insult for insult. Silence or a soft answer is the way to preserve peace and avoid actions that you may later deeply regret. There is a proverb that says: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage, but a word causing pain makes anger to come up.”—Prov. 15:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When a wife retaliates for an emotional injury or for a cutting remark from her husband, a cycle can be started that leads to increasingly more serious injuries, until their original love is shattered and their marriage collapses. Would it not have been much wiser for her to follow the Christian procedure of not returning injury for injury? Rather than spitefully seeking to injure her marriage partner with hot words in order to get even, she should remain silent and be long-suffering. That would be showing love. The same should be done by the husband if the wife is the cause of hurt feelings. In either instance the exercising of love maintains peace and harmony in the home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Two important features of love are being long-suffering with others and making a conscious effort not to keep account of any injury that might be done. The apostle Paul points this out by saying: “Love is long-suffering and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, does not get puffed up, does not behave indecently, does not look for its own interests, does not become provoked. It does not keep account of the injury.” (1 Cor. 13:4, 5) Not keeping account of the injury means to dismiss it from mind and not repeatedly bring it up. Dwelling upon it is certain to cause a bad feeling to grow, until resentment bursts into retaliation. It is far better, and more in keeping with the example Jesus set for his followers, to be long-suffering and to dismiss the injury from your mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Vengeance is not what a Christian should seek, not even against enemies. This is a rule of conduct that Jesus established when he said: ‘‘Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you.” (Matt. 5:44) It takes keen love and a deep appreciation for Christian principles to show love for your enemies by doing good to them despite the evil they may do to you. Jesus showed love for his enemies by bringing to them lifegiving knowledge about their Creator and His provision for human salvation. Christians today can do the same. We also find in David, who lived long before the coming of Jesus Christ, an example of not returning evil to an enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">David did not avail himself of the opportunities he had to do injury to Saul, who had become his enemy. For a long time Saul pursued David with the full intent of killing him, hut David successfully avoided a clash with him. Not once did he injure Saul, although he had opportunities to do so. On one occasion he told Saul from a distance: “I have not sinned against you, while you are lying in wait for my soul to take it away.” In reply Saul said: “You are more righteous than I am, for it is you who have rendered me good, and it is I who have rendered you evil.” (1 Sam. 24:11, 17) David properly let Jehovah he the one to take vengeance on Saul. This is the course that we should take today. Just as David did not seek vengeance on Saul, his enemy, Christians should not seek it on their enemies. The apostle Paul expressed this course of action as a Christian command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In his letter to the Romans, Paul said: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, but yield place to the wrath; for it is written: ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says Jehovah.’ ” (Rom. 12:19) Although many Christians in the first century were killed by the order of Roman officials, spiritual brothers of those Christians did not seek revenge by attempting to assassinate the officials or to do injury to them. So today, Christians should not seek vengeance against their persecutors. It is proper for them to appeal to law-enforcement agencies for protection and for restraint of the persecutors, but they will not seek to return injury for injury. They will leave vengeance for Jehovah to execute in his due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Because someone may do evil to you, do not think that your doing evil to him will make things right. Two wrongs never make a right. It will be far better for all concerned if you refuse to retaliate in kind. Why permit the actions of other persons to be the guide to your conduct? With Christian principles directing your actions you will not make the grave mistake of justifying an injurious action because someone acted injuriously toward you. You will recognize it as wrong regardless of what the other person doos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Consider how Jesus reacted to evil done to him, and then copy his example. Heed the good advice given by one of his apostles: “Finally, all of you be like-minded, showing fellow feeling, exercising brotherly love, tenderly affectionate, humble in mind, not paying back injury for injury or reviling for reviling, hut, to the contrary, bestowing a blessing.”—1 Pet. 3: 8, 9.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Are religious works enough? What does God expect?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">H</span><span class="font13">OW can a father be pleased with a son who does not listen to his counsel? Such a son brings no real joy to him. Is it any different with God, our heavenly Father? How can he be pleased with men and women who will not listen to his instructions and who refuse to be obedient to him? How can he find any delight in persons who are so wrapped up in personal interests that they find no time and have no inclination to consider his interests?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Many people who profess to be Christian manifest very little interest in what God has to say to mankind through his Word. Although they may attend church regularly, they have an abysmal ignorance of what is in the Bible. This indifference to God’s Word is not the way to show respect for him. It is not the way to please him. Comment ing on how little many churchgoers know of the Bible, the executive director of the Department of Evangelism for the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A. said in 1961: “Certainly the churchgoer’s ignorance of scriptural teachings must seem less than inspiring to the nonchurchgoer. In a survey of officers in churches, it was found that many of the leaders were not sure, for example, whether the Sermon on the Mount was in the Old or the New Testament.<sup>1</sup>’<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark9">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font13">No matter how active a person may be in religious work, if he does not strive to learn what God has to say to man by studying the Bible, can he really say that he is intercs in Ihc heave Father? Is Inf' like thg son v does not liste his father’s coi scl? Church ac what is in God’kA among religious <sup>/</sup>iieo but this is not the way to please God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">There are many reasons for wanting to please the Almighty. For one thing, he is the Source of man’s life and the One who has purposed a magnificent future for the human race, providing a means whereby man can be made free from the curse of death. This in itself makes him worthy of man’s best efforts to please him. He cannot be expected to permit persons in whom he finds no delight to participate in that future. They arc not. worthy of his gift of life. The promised crown of eternal life will go only “to those who continue loving him.’’ (Jas. 1:12) Love for him is expressed by intense interest in the things he has done, in the things he has caused to be written for man’s instruction and in serving him. Our doing what is good in his eyes is an expression of our gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Another reason for wanting to delight him is the position he holds as the almighty Ruler of the universe. Out of respect and out of fear for his authority and power we should keenly desire to do what is pleasing to him. Because he is absolutely righteous, we can rest assured that his great power will always be used in a manner that is for the good of those loving righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is proper to have a wholesome fear of displeasing him because of his indignation against unrighteousness. “Jehovah himself examines the righteous one as well as the wicked one, and anyone loving violence his soul certainly hates.” (Ps. 11:5) He has the power to execute his adverse judgment of unrighteous persons and has expressed his determination to do it in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Through the prophet Hosea Jehovah mentions two of the many things he delights to see in a man. One is loving-kindness and the other is knowledge of God. “For in loving-kindness I have taken delight, and not in sacrifice; and in the knowledge of God rather than in whole burnt offerings.” (Hos. 6:6) In the days of Hosea when animal sacrifices were in order, there were Israelites who regularly made sacrifices to God in a show of outward devotion, but what God especially wanted was missing. They lacked loving-kindness and knowledge of God. They were not interested in learning what he required of them, and they were not moved by love to obey him. That is why Jehovah warned them: “My people will certainly be silenced, because there is no knowledge. Because the knowledge is what you yourself have rejected, I shall also reject you from serving as a priest to me; and because you keep forgetting the law of your God, I shall forget your sons, even I.” (Hos. 4:6) Since he rejected them for disregarding the knowledge he provided, can we not expect him to do the same with professing Christians who also ignore it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Was not the attitude of the Israelites similar to what is evident among many churchgoers in Christendom ? Although burnt offerings are not being made by them, they engage in religious activities that they think please God but neglect the gaining of accurate knowledge about him. Like the Israelites, they fail to see that religious works are of no value in God’s eyes when those who perform them make no effort to permit God to instruct them through his written Word. When obedience to God’s laws does not seem to be expedient because of circumstances that arise, do they not act as the Israelites did by forgetting them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The person who seeks out the knowledge of God by studying the Scriptures and then permits that knowledge to guide him, humbly putting God’s will first, is the one who delights God. He manifests a right heart attitude. The apostle Paul stressed the importance of seeking the knowledge of God when he said: “Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord.” (Eph. 5:10) Unacceptable religious works, like unacceptable sacrifices by the Israelites, are not the way to make sure of what is pleasing to God. That can be done only by continually testing with the Scriptures whatever a person contemplates doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Good advice on this matter is given at Proverbs 4:20-22. It can be applied to the instructions God gives in his written Word. “My son, to my words do pay attention. To my sayings incline your ear. May they not get away from your eyes. Keep them in the midst of your heart. For they are life to those finding them and health to all their flesh.” But how can a professed Christian keep God’s Word in the midst of his heart if he does not study it and follow its instructions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Faith</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The person who seeks the knowledge of God acquires the hasis for faith as he grows in that knowledge. This was what delighted God about the men of ancient times who received his approval. They respected the instructions he gave and they exercised faith in him. It was Abraham’s faith that led to his being regarded by God as a friend. It was David’s faith that moved God to speak of him as “a man agreeable to my heart.” It was the faith shown by the many persons listed in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews that won for them a good report in the Scriptures. Their good works accompanying their faith were a delight to God.—Jas. 2:23; Acts 13:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How can a professed Christian who is ignorant of God’s promises have faith in them? How can he stand firm for what God approves when he makes no effort to learn and to keep clearly in mind what God requires? Those approved men of ancient times built their faith upon their knowledge of God. People today need that knowledge for the same reason. They must have faith to please God. “Without faith it is impossible to please him well.”—Heb. 11:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Loving-Kindness</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Religious works without the proper motive are what Jehovah condemned through the prophet Hosea. The mechanically performed sacrifices of the Israelites were empty, valueless. They were not done out of love for God and out of a desire to obey him. The Israelites were not interested in the knowledge of what God required of them. Many professed Christians are like them in this respect, thinking that there is merit in religious activities, although love for God and interest in his Word are missing. They would do well to profit from what God said to the Israelites. In Hosea 6:4 he addressed himself to the ten-tribe kingdom, whom he called Ephraim, and the two-tribe kingdom, whom he called Judah, and asked: “What shall I do to you, O Ephraim? What shall I do to you, O Judah, when the loving-kindness of you people is like the morning clouds and like the dew that early goes away?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">God finds no delight in people who have not made loving-kindness a permanent part of their makeup. It must not be like dew that quickly disappears with changing circumstances. When Jesus said: “You must love your neighbor as yourself,” he meant for his followers to show loving-kindness all the time. With it missing, a person’s religious works are a mockery, just as were the sacrifices made by the people of Ephraim and Judah who lacked loving-kindness.—Matt. 22:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is a delight to God w'hen a person strives to imitate him by being merciful, long-suffering and loving as he is. About God himself Exodus 34:6 says: “Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth.” Imitating him in these things brings delight to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you desire to delight your heavenly Father, show a genuine interest in him as he shows in you. Seek the knowledge he has provided for mankind in his written Word. Learn what his will is and strive to be obedient to it. Exercise love for him and for other people. “Become imitators of God, as beloved children,” by striving to manifest his good qualities. (Eph. 5:1) This is the way to receive God’s approval and the blessings he has promised for those who delight him. rriHE activities of Pope John </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font13"> XXIII have created worldwide interest in the men who have headed the Roman Catholic Church. As a pope, each man is himself a potential power—a spiritual leader of some 500 million Roman Catholics. But the importance of a pope is ac-tually more immediate than that. The Roman Catholic people look to him for direction, depend on him for spiritual advice sions regarding</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">and for decisions spiritual and</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">world affairs. They believe him to be the vicegerent of Christ, the bishop of Rome, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">pater patrum,</span><span class="font13"> “father of fathers,” and as such the most outstanding example in the “Christian church.” Therefore, a report on the popes should prove not only timely and important but beneficial to seekers of truth and life in this era of crises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">According to Jesus, much can be learned from an examination of men’s works, for, said he, “every good tree bring-eth forth good fruit: and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit: neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be cut down and shall be cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.” (Matt. 7:17-20, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy)</span><span class="font13"> Thus Jesus authorized men to examine men and organizations to determine whether they were good or bad. “By their fruits you shall know them,&quot; he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As to what sort of men are to head the Christian congregation, the apostle Paul makes plain in his letter to Titus: &quot;A bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to ■wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre: hut given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent: embracing that faithful word.” (Titus 1:7-9, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy) </span><span class="font13">Now, how have the popes measured up to these God-inspired requirements set forth by Paul? The following from Catholic-approved publications will tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font13"> says: When Pope John II was enthroned (533-535) “simony in the election of popes and bishops was rife among clergy and laity.&quot; Glenn D. Kittler, author of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Papal Princes,</span><span class="font13"> bearing the imprimatur of the church, states: “There was some shady politics involved in the election&quot; of Pope John II. Simony and shady politics—does that sound like Christianity to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Pope John VIII (872-882), rated as “one of the greatest of the great popes” that reigned during the ninth century, was regarded by some historians, according to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font13"> “as cruel, passionate, worldly-minded, and inconstant.&quot; John Farrow, author of the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Pageant of the Popes,</span><span class="font13"> which publication also bears the imprimatur of the church, says that this pope’s reign was “one of violence and bloodshed.” His Roman Catholic household poisoned him, then smashed his skull with a hammer. Does this sound Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">After Pope John X (914-928), who is called “a sad example,” was smothered to death with a pillow, Marozzia, daughter of Theodora, wife of Theophylactus, commander of the army, “successively put three of her puppets on the papal throne.” They were Pope Leo VI, Pope Stephen VII,. and her own son, Pope John XI. Can you imagine God, who sets “the members, every one of them, in the body as it hath pleased him,” allowing this ambitious, covetous woman to pick men who should head his congregation?—! Cor. 12:18, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Marozzia was murdered by her own Catholic son Alberic. Between 946 and 955 this wicked murderer put four popes into office, and then named his own sixteen-year-old son to the papacy before his predecessor had time to die. The son, Octavian, took the name of John XII. A synod of fifty Italian and German Roman Catholic bishops charged him with “sacrilege, simony, perjury, murder, adultery, and incest.” In “bloody vengeance” he wreaked havoc on his Catholic opposers. He had a cardinal-deacon’s right hand and the nose and ears of a high palatine official struck off. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font13"> calls him &quot;a coarse, immoral man, whose life was such that the Lateran was spoken of as a brothel, and the moral corruption in Rome became the subject of general odium.” Kit-tler says; “Some historians claim he died suddenly while in the act of adultery, which, whether true or false, was certainly ■ in character.” Is this the vicegerent of Christ, God’s representative?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A Further Evaluation</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font13"> says Pope Benedict IX (1032-1045) “was a disgrace to the Chair of Peter.” This man whom Kittler calls “a wild youngster, openly immoral, flagrantly simonious, utterly indifferent to his responsibilities” was pope three different times. He turned the papal palace into a theater, where he watched “indecent” and “immoral” plays. Why was this corrupt man chosen to head the church, not once, but three times? Was this following the Christian apostle Paul’s advice, wherein he says: “Put away the evil one from among yourselves”? (1 Cor. 5:13, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy)</span><span class="font13"> Obviously not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In 1055 ambitious Cardinal Octavian, a rich nobleman, seized the papal throne immediately after Bandinelli was elected pope. He seized the papal mantle and rushed to the altar and shouted: “I am Pope—Pope Victor II!” His hand-picked soldiers carried him out to be greeted by the crowd. Bandinelli, along with many cardinals, was forced to flee for his life. Later Bandinelli was consecrated Pope Alexander III in the town of Nympha. The church had two popes. And for twenty years to follow there was nothing but strife. There were antipopes and anti-antipopes, wars and insurrections on both sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Now, can you imagine this happening in the true congregation of God? Is this the peace, the unity and the love that Christ promised his congregation? Was Christ’s congregation to be two-headed? Where was the fruitage of the spirit that the apostle speaks about, namely, “charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity, mildness, faith, modesty, con-tinency, chastity”? Did not the apostle say; “They that are Christ’s have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences”? (Gal. 5:22-24, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy)</span><span class="font13"> Then, are we to understand by observing their rotten fruitage that these men were not Christ’s? If not Christ’s, whose servants were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Examine further: </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font13"> says that “scarcely any possible crime was omitted” by Pope Boniface VIII (1294-1303)—“infidelity, heresy, simony, gross and unnatural immorality, idolatry, magic,” so forth and so on. “Even modern Catholic writers,” stated Cardinal Wiseman in 1844, “class him among the wicked popes, as an ambitious, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">haughty,</span><span class="font13"> and unrelenting man, deceitful also and treacherous, his whole pontificate one record of evil.” Still he reigned for nine years. Do you honestly think God picked this man to rule over his congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Pope Urban VI (1378-1389) “turned out to be a wild man. There were some doubts that he was completely sane.” Catherine of Siena, a Dominican nun, one of the most remarkable figures of the Catholic Church, wrote: “Those devils in human form have made an election. They have not elected a vicar of Christ but an anti-Christ!” As a result of his appointment the Catholic Church was in a mess for forty years. “In that period,” writes Kittler, &quot;Rome had four popes, all claiming </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">bonn fide</span><span class="font13"> election.” Ask yourself, Is Christ divided? Was the Christian congregation at any time to be a freakish two-, or three-, or fourheaded body?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">That Enea Silvio De' Piccolomini “freely indulged his passions” before he </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">became </span><span class="font13">Pope Pius II (1458-1464), </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font13"> reports, “is evidenced not only by the birth of two illegitimate children to him (the one in Scotland, the other at Strasburg), but by the frivolous manner in which he glories in his own disorders.” Kittler refers to him as a “first-class scoundrel” and says that his life was “so utterly immoral that he knew better than to take vows.” Even after he became a priest and a bishop he is spoken of as “a bit of a shyster.” When his name was mentioned as a possible candidate for the papacy, the powerful French Cardinal d’Estouteville remarked:</span><span class="font13"> “How can Piccolomini be thought fit for the papacy? . . . Look at his devotion to the heathen Muses. Shall we raise a poet to the Chair of Peter and let the Church be governed by pagan principles?” This “shyster” became Pope Pius II. He was not as pious as his name implies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">In 1491 Pope Innocent VUI, who was </span><span class="font13">neither pious nor innocent, “the father of two illegitimate children,” began to fail in health. Ambitious cardinals moved in. Huge sums of money were being exchanged for cardinal votes. Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, who had conspired for the papacy for forty years, had more than money to make him attractive. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;He</span><span class="font13"> owned towns, abbeys, farms and businesses in Italy and Spain; in Spain he held sixteen bishoprics and several abbeys, each with a good income. All these he was ready to distribute among those who would vote for him,” reports Kittler in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Papal Princes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How unlike the apostle Peter this cardinal! Peter said: “Silver and gold I have none.” The cardinal openly offered plenty of both. To Simon, who tried to buy the free gift of God with money, Peter said: “Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee: because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.” The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">cardinal used his riches to buy </span><span class="font13">the office of the papacy. When Cornelius fell at Peter’s feet, Peter lifted him up and said: “Arise: I myself also am a man.” Cardinal Borgia hungered for the adoration of men. (Acts 3:6; 8:20; 10:26, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy) </span><span class="font13">After becoming Pope Alexander VI, he did , not improve. He had six illegitimate children; two of them were born after he became pope. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia </span><span class="font13">says: “Alexander continued as Pope the manner of life that had disgraced his cardinalate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The influential Dominican monk Savonarola in a letter appealed to the rulers of Christendom to depose Alexander. He wrote: “This Alexander is no Pope at all and should not be accounted as such for besides having attained to the Chair of St. Peter by the shameful sin of simony, and still daily selling Church benefices to the highest bidder, besides his other vices which are known to the world I affirm he is not a Christian and docs not believe in the existence of God.” Yet no matter how base Alexander’s actions, he continued as pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Summary</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This report does not by any means exhaust all the popes who did bad, neither does it consider those who did good. But the point made herein is this: Were these bad popes God’s appointees? If your answer is Yes, then are we to conclude that God chooses murderers, adulterers, cruel men to head his congregation? It must be remembered that many of these men led grossly immoral lives before they were elected popes and that they continued their notorious, dissolute lives thereafter. True, some Christians were persons of dubious reputations before embracing Christianity, but Paul says: “Such some of you </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">were.</span><span class="font13"> But you are </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">washed.” </span><span class="font13">(1 Cor. 6:11, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy)</span><span class="font13"> Yes, they </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font13"> bad, but they did something about it. They cleansed themselves of their filthy past. Judas Iscariot did go bad, but he was </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">not chosen </span><span class="font13">when bad, neither was he left to run the congregation after he deflected. It is true that Peter sinned when he denied Jesus, but he repented of his sin before he received the holy spirit and the “keys.” Thereafter Peter lived a faithful life to the glory of God. But some popes never did clean themselves up and still were allowed to reign. Why? Did not the apostle demand excommunication of an incestuous adulterer and admonish Christians to purge out the old leaven? Did he not tell them not to keep company with fornicators and adulterers, “with such a one, not so much as to eat,” but to “put away the evil one from among yourselves”? (1 Cor. 5:11, 13, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy)</span><span class="font13"> Why were these inspired instructions not followed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In fact, why were these wicked men picked as bishops in the first place? Did not Paul counsel that bishops were to be “blameless” men, men “of good behaviour, chaste,” having “a good testimony of them who are without”? (1 Tim. 3:2-7, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy)</span><span class="font13"> It was common knowledge that many did not morally qualify, and still they were chosen as popes. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Dr. Ludwig Pastor, in his church-approved writings, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The History of the Popes, </span><span class="font13">tries to explain by saying that one must distinguish between the man and the office. “An imperfect setting,” says Dr. Pastor, “does not affect the intrinsic worth of the jewel, nor does the golden coin lose its value when it passes through impure hands.” That may be true with jewels and gold; a jewel cannot do anything about the setting, but the church can do something about its condition. Jesus himself showed this when he said: “Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree evil and its fruit evil. For by the fruit the tree is known.” (Matt. 12:33, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dy)</span><span class="font13"> When the church deliberately selects men to office who are known to be corrupt or allows them to continue in office when they become such, no longer is it merely the man who is corrupt but the system of which he is a part is also.—-1 Tim. 5:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What, then, is to be said of these popes and the organization that laid hands upon them? Catholic publications freely say that these popes carried on sin, and it is evident that the organization that empowered them and supported them shares responsibility for their deeds. But it is the inspired apostle John who tells us; “He who carries on sin originates with the Devil.” (1 John 3:8) It therefore behooves those who love righteousness to obey the divine command: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.”—Rev. 18:4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Obtaining a</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">” camera is not much of a problem even for person of little means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Cameras are available in great variety and in a wide price range Many very inexpensive box cameras are on the market that make picture taking possible without any knowledge of photography. All such a camera requires is for you to point it at a subject, move a lever or depress a plunger and then advance the film. Its very simplicity, however, creates certain drawbacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A box camera is very limited in the conditions under which it can take pictures. In bright sunlight it does fine, but when light conditions are poor, it is of little use. It cannot be adjusted to cope with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As the pupil of your eye dilates when there are poor light conditions, letting more light into the eye, so a camera needs an iris diaphragm that can be opened and closed down when light conditions vary. On a cloudy day, for example, or in the shade of a tree the amount of light is much less than in direct sunlight. To take a picture under these conditions you need a camera with an adjustable diaphragm that permits you to open it wide)' so more light can get into the camera. On the other hand, when the light is very bright, as it is at the beach or when snow is on the ground, the diaphragm must be closed down to a very small opening so you will not overexpose the film. Because a box camera restricts your picture taking to good light conditions, you will And it to be a distinct disadvantage when traveling. It is restrictive even when flashbulbs are used as your light source.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">An adjustable iris diaphragm is very important when taking pictures by flash, because the amount of light reflected from your subject diminishes greatly the farther it is from your flashbulb. For a suitable picture the diaphragm on your camera needs to be adjusted according to that distance. For a close-up picture with flash, a small opening is needed, but for every foot the subject withdraws from the camera the diaphragm must be opened a little. What this opening should be can be determined by dividing the distance the subject is from the flashbulb into one of the guide numbers that appears on the slip of paper coming with the film.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Even with a camera having an adjustable iris diaphragm, it is not possible to take a satisfactory picture of a large audience such as in an auditorium or a stadium with one flashbulb. To attempt such a picture with a box camera would be a total waste of film and bulbs. Do not expect. a box camera to take a flash picture of an object that is twenty feet or more away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Like the iris diaphragm, the speed of the shutter should also be adjustable to make picture taking possible under different conditions. Because the box camera has only one shutter speed, which is usually slow, pictures of moving objects cannot be taken without blurring the picture. Even a little movement by the one holding the camera can cause a blurred picture. Being able to adjust the shutter to a fast speed eliminates this problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The quality of a picture depends to a great extent upon the quality of the lens in your camera. The very poor lens of a box camera produces a correspondingly poor picture. This becomes very evident when a picture taken by a box camera is compared with one taken by a camera of good quality. The better camera produces images of crisp sharpness to the very edges of the picture. Because several fine lenses are used in a high-grade camera, its cost is many times that of a box camera. It also has better workmanship, better materials and a great many features that contribute to making it a precision instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Light Meter</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Many cameras today have a light meter built into the camera body, making it very easy to use. The meter informs you what settings to use on your camera to suit the light conditions under which you are taking pictures. Some camera models make its use very simple by coupling the meter with the shutter and diaphragm. All you have to do is to line up a small indicator connected with the light meter and then focus the camera. The shutter and diaphragm are automatically adjusted to the right settings for a good picture. Some movie cameras have a light meter that automatically adjusts the diaphragm of the camera as the camera is moved about. This maintains a suitable exposure for the average light condition of the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Accuracy of exposure is very important with color film, more so than with black and white films that have a wide margin for error. When using color film it is best to use a light meter to insure that you get consistently good pictures. With such </span><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;">film</span><span class="font13"> a small margin of error can either overexpose or underexpose a picture. Bad pictures because of poor exposures can spoil your story of a beautiful vacation trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When you take a reading with a light meter, tip it down a bit to avoid getting a false reading because of the brightness of the sky. If your subject is a person, move up close and take a reading of the light reflecting from his face. At a distance the meter gives you only an overall reading that might be affected by a large dark or light background. You would not then have the best exposure for a good picture of your subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Take good care of photographic equipment. Both a light meter and a camera are delicate instruments that can be easily ruined by harsh treatment. Avoid dropping them or severely jarring them. Never put a camera in a hot place such as the glove compartment of a car or in the back window where the sun can beat down on it. Heat damages not only the color film you may have in it but also the lens system by loosening the cement that holds the lenses together. Sand is also very injurious to a camera. It should never be taken to the beach and laid where sand can got into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Wherever you may travel hold on to your camera, especially if it is an expensive model. Do not carelessly leave it lying unattended in a parked car, on the seat of a plane or on a seat in an auditorium. It may very well not be there when you return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">How to Take Pictures</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It requires very little more effort to take interesting pictures of good quality than it does to take bad ones. Let us say you have some friends you want to photograph. Would you line them up squarely in front of the camera with all of them looking at it? That is not the way to take an interesting picture of them. It would be much better to have them relax and talk with one another, looking at one another instead of the camera. Better yet, give them something to do, such as looking at some of your flowers, playing with the dog, petting the cat, picking fruit, and so forth. Action makes a picture interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A picture of an individual does not always have to be a full-length view. Standing too far from a subject causes him to become lost in a great expanse of background. Move in close, filling the viewfinder with your subject. Try getting close enough to show the person from just the waist up. Have the person look a little to one side of the camera instead of directly at it. Shoot from an angle, as that is more pleasing than a view straight on. If you want a picture of the person standing, have the subject lean against a railing or some other waist-high object. Then take the picture to one side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Look at the background before snapping the picture. Be certain that no pole or plant appears to be sprouting from the subject’s head. A plain background such as a wall or the sky always gives satisfactory results. When a suitable background cannot, he had, you can prevent it from intruding on your picture by throwing it out of focus. This technique requires a camera with adjustable shutter speeds and diaphragm. It is making use of a peculiarity of camera lenses. They have greater depth of field when a small opening of the diaphragm is used than when you shoot with a large opening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Depth of field is the distance that a camera “sees” in sharp focus. With a small opening this might be from a few feet in front of you to infinity. With a large opening it might mean that only a few feet eleven inches are in sharp focus, depending on the type of camera you are using and the distance you are from the subject. Everything outside this range of sharp focus is. blurred. Thus an undesirable background can be thrown so badly out of focus that nothing in it is distinguishable and yet your subject is in sharp focus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">A picture should have only one center of interest. A common failing in scenery pictures is to put too much in them. For a pleasing picture select something of interest in the scenery and concentrate on that. If it is a mountain, frame it with nearby trees or a branch. Having a stream leading toward the mountain is an effective way of leading the eye to that center of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Sense of depth can be achieved by having someone stand in the foreground, but do not have the person face the camera. That will spoil the composition of your picture by creating two centers of interest. The conflict will ruin an otherwise beautiful picture. Have the person turn toward the scenery, presenting a somewhat side view to the camera. By looking at the scenery the person will then contribute to the picture by focusing attention on it. His presence will also give life to what otherwise might be a static picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Operating the Camera</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Many good pictures can be spoiled by careless operation of your camera. Hold it steady and then gently squeeze the shutter release. Jabbing the shutter release jars the camera and may cause your picture to blur because of camera movement. A steady camera is most important with a box camera. Its slow shutter speed causes a picture to blur with the smallest amount of movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">As you grasp the camera be conscious of where your fingers are. With the small cameras that are in general use today, it is very easy to put a finger in front of the lens. No camera can take a picture through your finger; yet this is a common error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you have a camera that has a protective cap for the lens, be certain to remove the cap before you trip the shutter. The blank film you will receive back from the processors will tell you too late if you forgot about the lens cap. When the lens becomes dusty, use a camel’s-hair brush or fine lens tissue to clean it. Never use a handkerchief or any other rough material. By using such material it is easy to damage the thin chemical coating that is put on good lenses to reduce light reflections within the lens assembly. There is also danger of scratching the lens itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">With a little thought and care you can take interesting pictures of good quality that can bring enjoyment to you as well as to your friends when the happenings you photographed are but memories. By using a modern automatic camera you do not have to know the intricacies of photography to get pictures of consistently good quality. Just keep in mind the few basic points about using your camera and about composition of pictures. The next time you go on a vacation trip you may want to take a camera with you so that you can tell, with pictures, about the fascinating and wonderful things you saw.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">This becomes evident when we realize that every human effort involves some tension. When we look up, our eyes become tense. When we move our head, muscles in our' neck tighten. When we eat, dress, walk and talk—-everything we do involves a certain amount of tension. The object, therefore, is not to do away with all tension, but to modify and control excess tension.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Too much tension can be harmful both to body and mind. Directly or indirectly, according to Dr. Edmund Jacobson, a pioneer in the study of nervous tension, excess tension is responsible for the most common of disorders, such as high blood pressure, ulcers, angina pectoris, heart attacks and colitis. It produces nervousness, irritability, excessive worry, insomnia, speech disorders and psychosis. It is the greatest single cause of fatigue. It is said to be more prevalent than the common cold and is regarded as the “chief killing disease” today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Excess tension is born of one’s thoughts. It grows by the way one thinks about things or by the way one sees them or feels them. A tense person, therefore, is at the mercy of his own thoughts. Within</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">himself is where tension is being manufactured or held in check. So What sort of person is likely F to succumb to the ravages of</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">tension? One New York heart specialist said that the evidence shows that the aggressive, highly emotional and energetic persons are most susceptible to tensions. These people seem to tackle their assignments restlessly, without adequate physical or mental relaxation. The doctor says: “They do good work and get far in their fields— as long as they last. But they also are likely to be irritable and to</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">have sharp emotional ups and downs. They are self-disciplined and pleasant in</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">company. They, bottle up their emotions and keep a calm face to the world, at least when they’re away from home and must keep a ‘Madison Avenue front.’ ” They are not neurotics or psychopaths. They are simply persons who are more exposed to tension-precipitating factors. Their condition does not spell disaster, but it does require attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Are you suffering from stress? How can you tell? Studies show that nearly 50 percent of all persons seeking medical attention today are suffering from ailments brought about or made worse by tension. These people talk about being “all pinned up inside”; they feel as if they are going to explode. Some use such phrases as: “He gives me a pain in the neck!” or, “He makes me sick to my stomach!” Very often it is the sufferer’s way of saying he feels tension building up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Overly tense persons are fidgety with their arms and legs. They often complain about the weather, the food or their health. As a rule they speak fast, in a high pitch and slur their words or even stammer. Insomnia and annoyance are almost always indications of excess tenseness. So is nail-biting. Persistent headaches, usually in the back of the head, are a sign too. Dizziness and nosebleeds, hemorrhages in the retinal layers of the eyes and paralysis are all indications of excessive tenseness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Causes</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">To cope with these distresses their cause must be known and dealt with promptly. Nearly all abnormal tensions are connected with or arise from one’s relations with other persons. They build up as a result of personality clashes, injustices, heavy job requirements or when a person is subject to unpleasant living and working conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Not all people react the same to stresses. Some people thrive under pressure; others are made sick by it. One man can laugh off personality clashes and problems. When confronted with a pile of work, he will roll up his sleeves’ and wade into it with gusto. But, on the other hand, another man just as qualified is hurt by the behavior of others and is distressed by the very sight of heaped-up work. He becomes tense, nervous, sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In a survey of tensions, the Life Extension Foundation found frustration, lack of recognition and worry about decisions the leading stress-producing factors among workers. When some 6,000 American businessmen were asked to check which of eight possible causes they considered most responsible for tension, the one blamed more often than any other was “personalities of superiors.” In one company a medical director noticed that the men in key positions were under extreme emotional strain, but he did not know why. “Then one day,” he says, “the president of the company came in for his interview, and I was no longer puzzled. No one could have been anything but nervous in his presence. He was a tense, driving, demanding type.” The president was warned to slow down, take more holidays and relax. A few months later the men were examined and found to be considerably more relaxed. One of these men said: “Doctor, you certainly changed the whole picture for us. The boss is letting us take much more responsibility, and he’s not riding herd on us. Why, he's now the easiest person in the world to get along with.” Yes, the president of the company had taken the advice, and later he admitted that he became a much better executive as a result of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the last decade or so some businesses have grown so fast that companies have trouble finding enough experienced men to fill top jobs. Consequently, young men are put into positions of great responsibility without proper training and before they are ready for them. To make good, these young men have to put everything they have into their work. As a result, they become tense, and in short order they develop spastic colons, ulcers and what have you. An example of what happens can be seen in the case of a thirty-seven-year-old man who was made vice-president over a group of men who had more experience than he. The young man was a very conscientious worker, a natural manager, the examining doctor said. “But no one took the trouble to build him up, to tell him why we thought he was fitted for the place, to give him that necessary pat on the back.” The young vice-president died of a heart attack not long after he took office. The doctor said: “I am sure a contributing cause was a promotion made too rapidly—without sufficient preparation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It may be hard for some to imagine grown men being inhibited in speech, but, for a fact, many are. Some 30 percent of 6,000 selected executives, men of superior mental and physical alertness, said they became tense and feared to some degree to express themselves to their associates, especially to their superiors. These men carefully prepare their presentations, but do not speak up unless prodded by their superiors to do so. The aggressive person takes the initiative and sets forth his ideas, while the tense man keeps his thoughts to himself. “The unfortunate part of it,&quot; says Dr. Harry J. Johnson, “is that the company may be the loser, for the quiet man has better ideas to communicate than his less-inhibited colleague.” What the quiet man needs is more reassurances from his superiors. These relax him and they, in turn, are rewarded with his fruitful ideas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In many cases wives were found to be responsible for their husbands’ tensions. They would pressurize their husbands to try for promotions and higher-paying jobs. The result was extreme tension on the part of the husband, affecting his work and his homelife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Husbands, too, are often responsible for their wives’ tensions. They complain about meals and conditions at home until wives dread to see them. Children also become tense when father and mother do not get along or when the parents expect more of them than they are actually capable of delivering. If goals are set too high, the child becomes frustrated trying to meet them. Thus he learns to hate school and cringes at the sight of his parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Tension is often closely connected with irregular living habits. Those who complain about tension generally eat too fast and do not rest enough. It has also been found that they do not exercise as much as calmer persons. Living habits are not easily changed, but they can be with conscientious effort. A more relaxed life will be the reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">How to Relieve Tension</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Since tension is created by the individual by the way he thinks about things or by the way he sees them or feels about them, tension release must be brought about by individual thought control. This calls for a constant vigilance upon the part of the individual to examine and reexamine his thinking in relation to his own performance. When he learns to control pressure by his thinking, he will have achieved a poise and stability that will free him from abnormal pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Success will not come from a halfhearted effort nor will it come overnight. It will take determination, persistence and time. Yet the results will be worth the effort, whether yours is an occasional mild case of tension or one that is more lasting and severe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The first step is to be able to recognize what is wrong. This is often easier to determine than finding a solution. The best that can be done, at times, is to provide suggestions that may serve to arrest the harmful effects until something else can be done to put an end to them permanently. Just to tell tense people to relax and forget their troubles and everything will be all right does little if any good. The heavy mental expectancies that have been built up must be removed. The sufferer alone knows what these expectancies are and he must wrestle with them until he finds a way to dispel them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Those tense during the daylight hours must see that they get at least eight hours of sleep. This is essential. Prayer also helps, because it aids one to unburden himself of loads that weigh heavily upon his mind and heart. Regular walks each day are very relaxing. A glass of warm milk before retiring helps some to sleep soundly. Do not fret over things that you have no control over. Practice tolerance. Be moderate. When you feel yourself becoming impatient, take a walk, hum a tune, sing a song. Does the schedule annoy you? Change it. Exercise. Go boating, swimming or read a book. Many people find reading the Psalms relaxing. Does your head feel as if it is in a vice? Rub the back of your neck, scratch the top of your head, stroke your chin. These are all tension dischargers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Many things that create tension have no basis in reality. They do not occur at all. Therefore, train yourself to concentrate more on actualities and less on imaginative roadblocks. Rather than fear failure, give your attention to the job at hand. Think about </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">it.</span><span class="font13"> Do it the best you can. Whatever the outcome, do not brood over it. Trust in God to see you through. Keep looking ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Oftentimes tension mounts when in the presence of a particular person. Is there something about this person you cannot tolerate? If so, what is it and when does it occur? Try to right the matter before it gets too far out of hand. Often emotionally toned words set pressure soaring. Such words as “hate” and “fight” are pressurebuilders. A nagging wife or a domineering mother-in-law can cause men no end of trouble. Talk out your differences. Do not bottle them up. If necessary, confide your problem to a person you can trust. It relieves the strain. It helps you to see your troubles in a clearer light. It clears your mind for sensible action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Tension wells up when you feel like lashing out at someone who has provoked you. Hold off that impulse if you can. Wait until tomorrow or the next day or the next week, then see how insignificant the occasion becomes. Meanwhile, do something to get rid of your pent-up energy. Mow the lawn, clean the car, chop some wood. Build, plant—do something. Work out the anger that is in you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you feel argumentative, change gears. Become more agreeable, less defiant and less obstinate. This will keep pressure down. It is good to yield occasionally. When you do, others will also. Tension will subside. Do not compete—cooperate. Go easy with criticism. Search out good points in people and help them to develop them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do not always tear yourself down. Do your best but try not to be best in everything or else you will open yourself to failure. Reach out to do work, but this does not mean to push yourself forward. Forwardness may be resented and really lead to rejection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These are very simple suggestions. There is no guarantee that they will completely solve your problem. But, if applied, they are bound to do some good. Sometimes the forces within us are so great that outside help is needed. In that case, do not be ashamed to ask for it. Some seek counsel or guidance that is provided in family welfare agencies, schools, industrial plants and public health departments. In the Christian congregation the overseer is always ready to help. But know that, no matter how great the help, the problem is still yours and you yourself will have to learn to cope with your tensions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW STRONG MEN ARE MADE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&quot;Through many years of active life, and the observation of many kinds of people, I have found that the strongest, wisest, most competent and reliable man is also the first to admit his inadequacy. Contradictory though it may sound, he is strong because he is humhle - and remembers always that man is the creation of God. No rule of life is more basic.”.—J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">to be.” (Gen. 1:3) How wise was that first act of the Creator in preparing the earth for the maintenance of life! Is not something so vital to our daily existence worthy of our close attention, in order to gain a better appreciation of’it? What is light? How is it that the sun lights up the earth? Is there any difference between sunlight and the light that man is able to produce?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Origin and Nature of Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The sun is a fiery storehouse of inexhaustible en-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">R</span><span class="font13">EFLECT on how marvelously the Master Architect designed the earth for man’s benefit. As a result of the amazing balance in nature, man is blessed with clean, fragrant air to breathe, a wide variety of delicious foods to eat, clothes to wear, a heated home to keep him warm and gorgeous scenery on which to feast his eyes. But did you ever stop to consider the vital part that light plays in making all this possible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">A Symposium on Light and Life</span><span class="font13"> geneticist II. Bentley Glass says that “it is impossible to think of life originating or existing under terrestrial circumstances except through the agency, remote or immediate, of light.” And scientist J. Gordon Cook observed; “Without our regular daily ration of sunlight there could be no life on earth. Light is the source of power that drives all plant and animal bodies. It provides us with the sense of vision and surrounds us with a world of beauty and colour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Certainly it was with foresight and a purpose in mind that the Master Architect long ago proceeded to say; “Let light come ergy that is continuously radiated in all directions. These radiations travel out from the sun at a little more than 186,000 miles a second in a wide range of wave lengths—a wave length being the distance from the crest of one wave to another. Some of the longer radiations, such as the infrared (heat) waves and radio waves, are from less than an inch to many yards in length, while on the other end of the scale, ultraviolet and cosmic rays are incomprehensibly short. Visible radiation is just a narrow band in between that has a wave length of about sixteen millionths to thirty-two millionths of an inch. It is these wave lengths of visible radiation that, having traveled some 93,000,000 miles from our sun, bathe our earth in life-giving sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Early in his history man also learned to produce light by heating solid substances until they were hot enough to send out visible radiations. As the temperature of an object is raised the wave lengths of the radiations emitted become shorter. When they reach about thiity-two millionths of an inch they enter the range of visible light, the same wave length that the sun radiates to give us sunlight. And just as sunlight promotes the growth and wellbeing of living things so also does artificial light, as we will consider later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is providential that the earth’s atmosphere absorbs most of the harmful rays from the sun, which lie on either side of the narrow band of visible light. If too many of these rays reached the earth they would be fatal to man and other living things. As it is, the majority of the shorter rays are absorbed or dispersed in the upper atmosphere, and most of the longer heat rays are absorbed by dust and moisture in the lower levels of the atmosphere, where they help to warm the air surrounding the earth. Just think of the amazing ingenuity of the earth’s Designer! Of all the radiations emitted by the sun just enough of the proper ones are allowed to reach the earth to bless man with light and all the things it means to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although light is often described in terms of waves in order to explain certain aspects of its behavior, in other ways it behaves as though it were made up of a stream of minute particles. Recent discoveries reveal that when light falls on material substances it causes the atoms of the substance to emit some of their electrons. This behavior, it is said, can be explained only by conceiving light in terms of particles. So as stated in the book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">We Live by the Sun:</span><span class="font13"> “These two conceptions have been welded into a coherent theory. Light consists of waves and particles at the same time.” But scientists are quick to admit that there is still much that they do not understand about light. What is known, however, is of absorbing interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Role in Earth’s Preparation</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Long before man was created light was serving the Creator's purpose in preparing this planet as man’s home. How was this? By means of an amazing process whereby the vegetation captured the energy from sunlight and stored it for future use. Even after the vegetation was eventually changed into different forms and buried in the earth, the energy from the sunlight was preserved and remained untapped. For some time now men have realized that when they burn coal, oil, wood, or peat they are merely releasing the energy that plants long ago obtained from that narrow band of visible light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Early in the nineteenth century engineer George Stephenson showed his appreciation of this fact. While watching a railroad train as it disappeared in the distance, he turned to his friend: “Answer me a question,” he said. “Can you tell me what sort of force it is that drives yonder train along?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Well,” answered his friend, “I should think that the force was one of your great engines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Yes,” acknowledged Stephenson, “but what moves the engine?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“Why, one of your Newcastle engineers, of course,” came the obvious answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“No,” replied Stephenson, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">“sunlight!” </span><span class="font13">To his bewildered friend the engineer explained: “It is light that has lain stored in the earth for many thousands of years; the light absorbed by the plant during its growth is essential to the condensation of carbon, and this light, which has been buried in the coal for so many years, is now unearthed and, being freed again as in this locomotive, serves great human ends.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The vast amount of vegetation that clothed the earth in its early years also served another useful purpose in preparation for the time when the animals and man would come upon the earthly scene. Early in the earth’s history the air was undoubtedly densely laden with carbon dioxide, an excess of which is poisonous to man and animals. However, plants are so constructed that they take in and utilize the carbon, and give free oxygen back to the atmosphere. So by the time the animals and man were created the vegetation had replaced a sufficient amount of carbon dioxide in the air with oxygen to purify it and make it a delight to breathe. In order to maintain this proper balance man and animals were constructed so that they utilized oxygen in respiration and exhaled carbon dioxide. What marvelous intelligence was manifested in the preparation of the earth!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Photosynthesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The amazing process by which the plants capture the energy from sunlight and employ it in converting carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen is called photosynthesis. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Science News Letter</span><span class="font13"> of April 6, 1957, described how it works: “Carbon dioxide in the air enters a leaf or other green part of a plant through minute openings. Once inside, the carbon dioxide dissolves in the water lying between the cell walls of the plant. The solution now readily passes through the cell walls to small bodies within the cells which contain chlorophyll, the substance that gives plants their green color.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">“It is here that the ‘deities’ perform their miracle. Sunlight provides energy for the great chemical change, and chlorophyll acts as the ‘switchboard’ that controls the reaction. Under the influence of these two, the carbon dioxide and water now combine to create the basis of all food, a simple sugar. All the numerous fats, proteins and carbohydrates used by plants and animals must be created later from this sugar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Packed into this simple sugar is a supply of energy captured from sunlight. When a cow eats the grasses of the field it absorbs some of this energy, and by means of it the cow grows to maturity and produces milk. So whether humans eat vegetation or the animals that live off it, they are receiving their energy from sunlight. The key to this miracle lies in the ingenious construction of the beautiful plants of the field. With what wisdom did the Master Architect make them!—Ps. 104:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although man does not fully understand and cannot duplicate this amazing process, he does realize the vital role that light plays in the growth of living things. Experiments with artificial light have produced some remarkable results. For example, in an experiment conducted by the Agriculture Research Service at Beltsville, Maryland, by regulating the intensity, quality and duration of light, a red maple seedling was pushed to a height of nine feet in the time that ordinary seedlings grew to four inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Tests have also revealed that certain rays of visible light in particular promote growth. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font13"> magazine of June 23, 1961, described the development of a new fluorescent tube that trims the spectrum to “a lavender glow that to plants is the light of life.” It explained that light from this particular part of the visible spectrum apparently does most to promote growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Color and Beauty</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It may sound strange to speak of light as being divided into different parts, yet it is a fact that different wave lengths of visible light give us the various colors. When the radiations emitted from a heated object shorten to wave lengths of thirty-two millionths of an inch they become visible, assuming a familiar glowing red appearance. Shorter wave lengths give us such basic colors as orange, yellow, green and blue, and on the other end of the visible spectrum we recognize those wave lengths of about sixteen millionths of aninch as violet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But why does light appear white instead of all these different colors? Because all the colors are seen at once and the combination of all of them produces white. However, when the various wave lengths are seen separately, then the different colors are recognized. Such a separation occurs when light strikes various objects. These objects will absorb certain wave lengths of light and reflect others; our eyes discern the color that is produced by the wave lengths that are reflected. For example, grass absorbs all the wave lengths except the green ones; these are reflected to our eyes, and thus we identify the grass as green. Although it sounds almost unbelievable, it is said that sunlight can be split into 100,000 different colors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">So, contrary to what a person may normally think, all objects are black or no color; the color comes from the light that strikes them, and is determined by what wave lengths are reflected back to the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How marvelous light is! Not only is it instrumental in producing the food we eat and purifying the air we breathe, but it is responsible for all the color in the world. With the words of wise King Solomon we can heartily agree: “The light is also sweet, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun.”—Eccl. 11:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But to whom should we give the thanks for this wonderful gift of light? It would be the superlative height of unintelligence to assume that this remarkable gift that energizes all living things came about by mere chance! No, the maker and giver of light is a Master Architect far wiser than any man. So give thanks to Him. Yes, give praise to “Jehovah, the Giver of the sun for light by day, the statutes of the moon and the stars for light by night.”—Jer. 31:35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">* The following experience was related at the Greensboro, North Carolina, Courageous Ministers District Assembly ot Jehovah’s witnesses: “In 1939, I was a member of a North Carolina National Guard Regiment, the 252nd Coast Artillery. I was a Gun Commander in Battery ‘D’ here in Greensboro, and 1 got to be a good friend with another member of the National Guard. When we went to summer encampment, we always fired in competition with each other. When the National</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Guards mobilized in 1939, my friend was discharged but later drafted into the army. We lost contact with each other. Some years later, in 1954, I learned God’s truth and was baptized and, through Jehovah’s undeserved kindness, I had the privilege of being appointed congregation servant. Last year I received an invitation to attend the 21st class of the Kingdom Ministry School at South Lansing, New York, at the Watch Tower Society’s Kingdom Farm. I arrived on Saturday, August 11, and as I approached the main building, I saw a face that was vaguely familiar. So I walked up to this brother and said, 'Do you remember me?’ He looked at me for a moment as if he couldn’t believe what he saw, and finally he managed to say, ‘Sergeant Kelly!’ That man was my old friend who is now </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">congregation servant in North Carolina and is the one who introduced me today,&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By &quot;Awake!&quot;</span><span class="font0"> correspondent </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">m Ireland</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font13">HY is it that our earth is so green? From what source do man and beast get most of their food? What has been used to thatch man’s roofs and, oftentimes, to cover his floors? Just what is it that has also protected the earth’s surface from erosion? There is one answer that fits all these questions. It is earth’s amazing carpet—grass!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">However, not all the green herbage that covers our earth is classified as grass. Today that term has been narrowed to identify a clearly defined family known as the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Gramineac.</span><span class="font13"> In this family of true grasses there are some 6,000 species, of which there are many thousands of varieties: rice, for example, is said to have 1,400 varieties!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although the grasses may differ tremendously in size, appearance and usefulness, they are all patterned according to a common arrangement. It is their unique leaf structure that in particular identifies them as membei’s of the family </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Gramineae. </span><span class="font13">Close relatives of this family, and sometimes mistaken as grasses, are the Sedges (Cyperaceae), and the Rushes </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Juncaceae).</span><span class="font13"> Somewhat more distant relatives are the Lilies </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Liliaceae),</span><span class="font13"> Palms </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Palmaceae).</span><span class="font13"> Bananas </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Musaceae),</span><span class="font13"> Orchids </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">(Orchidaceae),</span><span class="font13"> and others. All these groups, including the grasses, belong to one of the two major series of plants, the one known to botanists as the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Monocotyledons.</span><span class="font13"> This means that in their seeds there is only one little store of food, one cotyle or cup (Greek: mono-single, and fcotyle-cup). All of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Monocotyledons</span><span class="font13"> have the veins in</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">their leaves running parallel and lengthwise, as contrasted with the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Dicotyledons. </span><span class="font13">which have net-veined leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Of all the different families of plants, the grasses are the most important, most numerous and most widespread. They do not generally have conspicuous flowers to atti’act insects, for they do not need to depend upon them for pollination. The grasses are either self-pollinated within closed blossoms or they are fertilized by the wind, which carries their enormous amounts of pollen over vast areas. It is said that one plant of Indian com produces some fifty million grains of pollen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The many varieties of grasses certainly clothe the earth with an attractive garment. Ireland is noted for its green carpet of grass of many varieties, which clearly explains why it is called the Emerald Isle. One of God’s prophets attributed the same reason for the earth’s being green when he cried out: &quot;The green grass has dried up, the grass has come to an end; nothing has become green.”—Isa. 15:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Food Producer</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Not only does earth’s amazing carpet contribute beauty; it is also the greatest food producer for both man and beast. In many lands throughout the earth the grasses provide more than one-third of the food consumed. But indirectly they produce much more. Stop and consider those sheep and cattle in the fields. The twenty different varieties of common grass that they consume contain vital starch and sugar for them. This, in turn, gives us milk, cheese, meat, leather and wool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Turn your attention around the world for a moment. See the prairies of North America and the pampas of South America! What a beautiful sight is that golden wheat, swaying gently in the summer breeze! Look at the veld of South Africa, the rice fields of India and China and the steppes of Russia! How beautiful and lifesustaining is this amazing carpet! Did you realize that wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice, com, sugar cane and the millets and sorghums are all grasses? Think of the cereals, bread, macaroni, syrup, even whiskey. These arc all derived from earth’s amazing carpet, of grass. In fact, practically all the breadstuffs of the world come from just these few grasses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The growing of wheat for food stretches into the past as far as recorded history. Today hundreds of varieties have been developed and wheat continues to hold its age-old place as the world’s most important food. Why, in the United States alone some 1,148,289,000 bushels are produced annually!</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Challenging wheat as the world’s most important food is rice. It is estimated that about 100,000,000 tons are produced throughout the world each year, some 95 percent of this total being grown in Asia and nearby islands. Rice needs much water in its growth, in fact, the fields are often flooded for it. There the laborers have to keep the land free from weeds by working up to their knees in water. How different from the growing of wheat! Yet this member of the amazing family of grasses provides the main food for about half the world’s population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One of the taller grasses with an interesting history is the sugar cane. It has been used for thousands of years. It was used in India before the Christian era, and Alexander the Great imported it into Asia Minor. In comparatively recent times the Dutch, in the seventeenth century, took it to the West Indies. Today sugar cane is the principal source of the world’s sugar supply, some two-thirds of the world’s annual production of 50,000,000 tons being derived from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">This grass usually reaches a height of ten to twenty feet and is surmounted by a tuft of silky flowers. Sugar cane, however, has been measured at a height of forty-two feet! The sugar is obtained from the juice, which is extracted from these Jong stalks. But this must be done within twenty-four to forty-eight hours after cutting, otherwise there is a loss in sugar recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">These are only a few of the main grasses that feed us. It is staggering to the mind to try to categorize the multitude of foods that are derived from earth’s amazing carpet. With what wisdom the Creator made the grasses! How true are the words of the psalmist; “He is making green grass sprout for the beasts, and vegetation for the service of mankind, to cause food to go forth from the earth.”—Ps. 104:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Uses Other than for Food</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Aside from these important foodproducing grasses, the most useful is probably also the tallest—the bamboo. Some varieties shoot upward at the amazing rate of more than three feet a day and reach a height of over 100 feet in two or three months. “You do not. appreciate its remarkable character,” wrote plant explorer David Fairchild in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Exploring for Plants, </span><span class="font13">“until you arc standing with one hand on a hollow stem almost a foot through . . . You look up a hundred and twenty feet along the hollow stem you have your hand on, and see no sign of a branch for seventy-five feet, just the smooth green stem that is jointed, like a grass, all the way up to the slender leafy tip waving in the breeze. You feel like a Lilliputian in a bunch of meadow grass.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The uses of this unusual grass are almost innumerable. In Asia certain varieties are so strong that they are often used in the construction of houses and bridges. Farm and garden implements, household utensils, furniture, fishing rods and walking sticks are also made from bamboo. Strips of flexible bamboo are woven into mats, screens, boxes and baskets of every description. Their long hollow stems are even converted into water mains, and in Bangkok hats are made from bamboo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Another very useful grass that carpets our earth is the coarse esparto grass. In southern Europe and northern Africa it is harvested twice a year. It is a wonder that this grass that can grow in desolate areas with little water and very poor soil can give so much to man. Commercially it is used in making paper, but it can also be made into carpets, sandals, ropes, baskets and sacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Various types of reed grass grow profusely around ponds and marshes in the Temperate Zone. In Europe reed grass has been used to cover the roofs of farmhouses and outbuildings with a durable, waterproof thatch. But perhaps the most valuable and widely used grass for this purpose is the kogon grass, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Imperata cylindrica.</span><span class="font13"> It is even often called thatch grass in the many places where it is grown expressly for roofing purposes, such as Africa, the islands of the southwest Pacific, southeast Asia, and in India and Burma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Soil Conservation</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Grass also plays an important role in soil conservation. When grass covers the soil, the soil is held together by its roots and thus wind and rain cannot easily move it. By this means earth’s amazing carpet has preserved our very foundation for thousands of years. However, man through his mismanagement has turned attractive green fields into desolate deserts. E. B. Balfour described the situation in his book </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Living Soil:</span><span class="font13"> “Probably more soil has been lost since 1914 than in the whole previous history of the world. This is not a natural phenomenon in the ordinary sense of the word. There cannot be any doubt that so far as the modern growth of deserts is concerned it is not nature but man who is the desert maker. It is not unlikely that most of the great deserts of the world are his making.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, soil erosion is a major man-made problem, but it is being faced today with the help of grass. In north Africa parts of the desert are being reclaimed through the use of grass. Tough grass is planted in five-foot squares with a tree set in the middle. In this way their roots will hold the soil together and eventually make the area suitable for cultivation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">How grateful we ought to be to our Creator for providing us with a carpet that not only has such a varied, beautiful and distinctive pattern, but is so necessary in sustaining life.'</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BIGGEST LIAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Clergyman Warren Allen of Highland Park, California, was recently voted the best liar after competing in a liars contest with politicians, fishermen, hunters and some of the community’s most brilliant salesmen.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"><img src="g_E_19630122_files/g_E_19630122-11.png" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:118pt;">
<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font13">HAT is God’s name? His Word, the Bible, tells us—when it is not hidden by faulty translation: “I am Jehovah. That is my name; and to no one else shall I give my own glory, neither my praise to graven images.” In the Hebrew Scriptures this name consists of four letters, corresponding to YHWH in English, which four letters are known as the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">tetragrammaton. </span><span class="font13">—Isa. 42:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Modern Bible translators do not consider God's name important. Typical is the attitude of the committee that is presently working on the Hebrew Scriptures for </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The New English Bible,</span><span class="font13"> as revealed by an interview published in the London </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Times,</span><span class="font13"> August 19, 1962, regarding the progress of the work, in which to date twenty-two of the thirty-nine books of the Hebrew Scriptures are in next-to-final form and two have not yet been begun. Professor Driver, the director of the project, among other things, stated that “ ‘Jehovah<sup>1</sup> is merely a solecism produced in 1520 by inserting the vowels of the Hebrew ‘edona’ into YHWH and it will go out.” So the name Jehovah will not appear in this new English translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">But the name “Jehovah” cannot be dismissed simply by the charge of its being a solecism, “a minor blunder in speech or grammar.” For one thing, let it be noted that “Jehovah” goes back to at least A.D. 1100. Further, if, granting for the sake of argument, some other form of the tetragrammaton may be more nearly correct than the popular form “Jehovah,” and it be a “solecism,” is that any justification for ignoring the distinctive name by which Jehovah God revealed himself to his people and which literally means “He Causes to Become”? Is it not ‘straining out the gnat and gulping down the camel,’ to cover up the distinctiveness of the tetragrammaton by merely using the capital form of LORD, the same English word used to translate such Hebrew words as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">adon</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">adonai </span><span class="font13">and Aramaic </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">mare,</span><span class="font13"> just because “Jehovah” may not be technically the most correct form? Besides, what is gained by being technical about just what is the correct form of the name when no one can dogmatically state exactly how the ancient Hebrews pronounced the tetragrammaton?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The very number of times that the tetragrammaton appears in the Hebrew Scriptures of itself gives eloquent testimony as to the importance that Jehovah attached to his name, and especially when compared with the number of times he is referred to by his various titles. Among the more common titles used when referring to the true God are: Almighty, Creator, Father, God, Judge, King, Lord, Maker, Most High and Rock. Of these ten, four are used less than twenty times: Creator, Father, Judge and Maker. Four others are used upward of thirty but less than fifty times: Rock, King, Most High and Almighty. “Lord,” when referring to the Creator and translating words other than the tetragrammaton, occurs less than 325 times. And “God,” when likewise used, appears some 2,670 times. Nor may it be overlooked that in at least one-third of these instances the titles are used in conjunction with “Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What is the import of these figures? These ten titles when used in referring to Jehovah appear some 3,300 times all together. And how do these compare with the number of times that “Jehovah” appears? The tetragrammaton appears in the Hebrew Scriptures 6,932 times to be exact, or </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">more than twice as often as all these other references to Him combined! </span><span class="font13">Nor is that all. When we take a total of all references to other deities, such as to Baal, some one hundred times, Chemosh, Dagon, Molech and Nebo less than fifteen times each, the terms “god” and “gods” as applied to such, and so forth, we find that the name Jehovah still occurs more than 50 percent oftencr than do all other appellatives to all deities, true and false, put together. Certainly this prominence that Jehovah gave to his name in his Word is no mere happenstance but bears eloquent testimony of design, of purpose, to stress its importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Modern Bible translators may claim to be Christian, but when they slight the name Jehovah, as so many of them do, they are not following the example set by Jesus Christ. He had a very keen appreciation of his Father’s name—a fact not generally recognized due to a misunderstanding as to its place in the Greek Septuagint Version of the Bible, which, doubtless, was the one Jesus and his apostles used. While the tetragrammaton does not appear in later copies of it, that four-letter word did appear in early copies, fragments of which are still extant. The emphasis Jesus placed upon his Father’s name shows that he must have been familiar with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Thus, in teaching his followers to pray, he put his Father’s name first: “Our Father in the heavens, let your </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font13"> be sanctified.” To his opposers he said: “I have come in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font13"> of my Father, but you do not receive me.” “The works that I am doing in the name of my Father, these bear witness about me.” He also prayed, “Father, glorify your </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name”</span><span class="font13"> And on the night of his betrayal he said to his Father: “I have made your </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font13"> manifest to the men you gave me out of the world.” “Holy Father, watch over them on account of your own </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font13"> which you have given me.” “I have made your </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font13"> known to them and will make it known.” And when Jesus rode into Jerusalem the crowds cried out: “Blessed is he that comes in Jehovah’s </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name!”—</span><span class="font13">Matt. 6:9; John 5:43; 10:25; 12:28; 17:6, 11, 12, 26; Matt. 21:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">That Christ’s early followers likewise appreciated its importance is also clear from the Scriptures. On the day of Pentecost Peter quoted from Joel's prophecy to the effect that “everyone who calls on the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name of Jehovah</span><span class="font13"> will be saved.” The disciple James noted that Jehovah called the Christian congregation “a people for his </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name”</span><span class="font13"> Paul rebuked certain Jewish Christians because their loose conduct brought reproach on God’s name: “The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name of God</span><span class="font13"> is being blasphemed on account of you people among the nations.” And the Hebrew Christians were told: “Through him [Jesus[ let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">name”—</span><span class="font13">Acts 2:21; 15:14; Rom. 2:24; Heb. 13:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Yes, Jehovah’s name is most important. His Word repeatedly tells of his bringing punishment upon the wicked for the sake of his name. That was why he permitted Pharaoh to remain and kept sending plagues upon him instead of at once destroying him. And it is also for the sake of his name that Jehovah in times past delivered his people from their foes. Those who would escape destruction at the hastening battle of Armageddon must heed the command: “Seek Jehovah, all you meek ones of the earth, who have practiced His own judicial decision. Seek righteousness, seek meekness.” Yes, “the name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.” —Zeph, 2:3; Prov. 18:10.</span></p>

Whereas the average increase in the number of most serious crimes—murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault- was 3 percent throughout the country, it was nearly 13 percent in New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Airplane Crashes</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; During the final eight days of November a series of six airplane disasters claimed 206 lives. They began with three crashes on the 23d. On that day all 17 persons aboard a United Air Lines Viscount died when the plane plummeted to earth near Ellicott City, Maryland; similarly, all 21 persons were killed when a Hungarian airliner plunged into a snow-flecked beet field north of Paris, and 19 died in the crash of a Portuguese military transport on Sao Tome Island off the west coast of Africa. On the 26th another 27 persons were killed when a Brazilian airliner collided with a private cabin plane about 60 miles northeast of Sao Paulo. The following day 97 lives were claimed in the crash of a Brazilian Jetliner en route to Los Angeles. It smashed into a 2,400-foot-high mountain near Lima, Peru. And on the last day of the month, 25 of the 51 persons aboard an Eastern Air Lines plane perished when it crashed while landing in a heavy fog at Idlewild Airport in New York,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Trading Stamps for A’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&amp; Not only arc trading stamps offered for church attendance, but now, at the Brooklyn Avenue School in New York, third-grade students are rewarded with twenty trading stamps for each “A” on their report cards. The idea originated at a current affairs discussion, where it was observed that trading stamps had been given for A’s in a Miami school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Adulterated Foods</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Last fall adulterated foods in distressing numbers were discovered on the market throughout Italy. Outstanding examples were 5,000 pounds of Trieste cheese made of banana peel, butter sold in Gorizia that was produced from tallow normally used as a lubricant in ship launchings, and Genoa bread that contained 50 percent pig fodder. A new Italian wine exported to Ger many had gained popularity there until German health authorities discovered that it was fortified with ox blood, veal bones, skimmed milk, fish glue, seaweed and a tar derivative to help the coloring. Italian Premier Amintore Fanfani ordered an investigation and promised new laws to deal with the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On November 10 Egyptian health officials reported that poisoned cooking oil had stricken 119 persons, paralyzing their hands and feet. All the victims were residents of Ismailia, located beside the Suez Canal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Friends of the World</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">•$&gt; At a political rally last fall priest Edmund Cuneo prayed before 1,500 diners in behalf of the Democratic party. His prayer, as reported in the Philadelphia </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Bulletin</span><span class="font11"> of October 17, 1962, petitioned; “We return Thee thanks, O Almighty God, for all the blessings of this day. We are particularly grateful for the new inspiration, the new enthusiasm and, we hope, the new courage to go out and work for the Democratic Party with all our available energy. The Democratic Party has been the party of the people. It has been a party of action. If we wish greater benefits from the government, we must Work to keep the Democrats in. This is our challenge and we beg</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Thee, God, to give us divine assistance. Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Prayers </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">for the U.N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; At the 77th annual meeting of the Baptist General Convention of Texas last fall the United Nations was commended fnr its work relative to the Cuban crisis, and Baptists were urged to pray for the United Nations in its efforts to preserve world peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Young Criminals</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">BPI</span><span class="font11"> dispatch from Loughborough, England, told of a two-week wrecking spree on which a 7-year-old girl led her two brothers, aged 5 and 2. The damage included a $5,600 lumberyard fire that put its owner out of business, another fire in a deserted house, a bur glary, an egg-smashing spree in a pnultry yard, a tractor so badly damaged that it was out of action for a week and a slap on the flank of a horse that sent it bolting down the street into a car. Whereas the boys were left in the custody of the mother, the girl was ruled “beyond her mother's control,” and was placed under council care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Floating Diamond Mine</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A large barge has been converted into a floating diamond mine and is operating off the southwestern coast of South Africa, using suction dredges for taking diamonds from the seabed. In a week's operation it is reported to have obtained 2,100 gems, valued at $56,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Clergy Organize Demonstration</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On October 28 several thou sand Antiguans were organized by their clergy to take part in a demonstration to protest against the government’s intention to allow a gambling casino to be built on the island. Methodist minister Martin C. Roberts, addressing the demonstrators, said it was not a political gathering, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">but a gathering of the church</span><span class="font11">es throughout Antigua to fight an issue that concerns the ‘'kingdom of God and His righteousness.” The demonstrators, led by the clergy, then marched through the streets of the capital to Government House, where their protest was presented. </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Al</span><span class="font11">though the demonstration was conducted without mishap, it has not been viewed lightly by government officials. The Secretary of the Trades and Labour Union was quoted as saying: “I view the situation of the churches demonstrating so serious that I think it is quite time that the church be dealt with politically for it to stop its political activities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Pedestrian Oasis</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;S&gt; Stroget, Copenhagen, Denmark’s main street, was closed to all vehicular traffic on November 17, and will remain closed until at least February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">If the experiment </span><span class="font11">works, </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font11">pedestrians will continue to have Stroget, this narrow thoroughfare, two thirds of a mile long, all to themselves. When the pedestrians were given free rein in the capital’s principal shopping center, they danced in the street. Some now suggest that Stroget be covered with a glass canopy to protect the pedestrians from frequent rains and to turn it into a special tourist attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Minute an Earthquake</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;§&gt; The</span><span class="font11"> earth is virtually trembling beneath our feet, for, according to a report in the Toronto Daily </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font11"> of September 6, 1962, there is an earthquake every minute of the day on an average and a major quake at least once every two weeks. Every year there are as many as 900 earthquakes of such intensity as to cause serious destruction and to involve heavy death tolls. It has been estimated that during the last 4,000 years 13,000,000 people lost their lives because of earthquakes. It is reported that during the past century there have been 2,096 recorded earthquakes, of which 1,222 were severe enough to crack walls, 510 shattered buildings and 364 devastated towns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">&lt;$&gt; Dr. Gustave E. von Grune-baum, director of the Center for Near Eastern Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, reports that in medieval Europe and in Moslem society as recently as sixty years ago people decided important matters of state and religion on the basis of their dreams. He found that even today many people seek guidance from dreams, even though there is no scientific basis for doing so.</span></p>
