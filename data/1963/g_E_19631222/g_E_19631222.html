<p><span class="font25">I</span><span class="font20">T WAS cool and overcast on the morning of September 15 in Birmingham, Alabama. Sundayschool classes were just concluding in the basement of the large yellowbrick 16th Street Baptist Church. Suddenly the calm was shattered by a terrific explosion that ripped a hole in the wall, blew out stained-glass windows and sent glass and splintered debris everywhere. As the air cleared, scores of terrified children began pouring out of the entrances, some were screaming and others were moaning and bleeding. Four little girls, however, did nol^utter a sound. They were buried beneath the debris—dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The shock waves from the bomb blast in this Birmingham Negro church quickly reverberated from one end of the country to the other, with powerful echoes being heard around the world. Why? Who is responsible for the senseless murder of these innocent Negro children? Is this the fruitage of a Christian society? Such are the questions that are still in the minds of millions of persons. In its weekend review of the news, the New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font20"> observed: “Americans everywhere turned toward Birmingham and asked why, what was it that made it seemingly impossible for whites and Negroes to live together here in peace </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">T*</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There are, of course, many conflicting opinions as to who is to blame for the race troubles that culminated in the church bombing. The United States president, J. F. Kennedy, pointed to the “public disparagement of law and order” as being responsible for the “violence which has fallen on the innocent.” He evidently was making reference to the failure of public officials and citizens to comply with the Supreme Court's decision outlawing segregation. However, the former police commissioner of Birmingham, Eugene Connor, told a large gathering in Mobile, Alabama, that “if you're going to blame anyone for getting those children killed in Birmingham, it’s your Supreme Court.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Editorials in various Alabama newspapers recognized that the people, and not the law, were at fault. Many share the blame, the Talladega </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Home</span><span class="font20"> said, including “all the rioters and all the demonstrators, black and white, who have so scoffed at the law in weeks and months gone by.” And the Huntsville Times agreed: “Many people in Alabama are partly to blame for the Sunday bombing. In the final sense, the attitudes of the many who have felt that the end justifies almost any means are in large measure responsible.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Perhaps the most pointed remarks of all were those of a white Birmingham lawyer named Charles Morgan, Jr. According to </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font20"> magazine, what he said before a segregated meeting of the Young Men’s Business Club was this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Who did it? It’s really rather simple. The 'who’ is every little individual who talks about the ‘niggers’ and spreads the seeds of his hate to his neighbor and his son. The ‘who’ is every governor who ever shouted for lawlessness and became a law violator. It is every senator and every representative who in the halls of Congress stands and with mock humility tells the world that things back home aren’t really like they are. It is courts that move ever so slowly and newspapers that timorously defend the law. It is all the Christians and all their ministers who spoke too late in anguished cries against violence. It is the coward in each of us who clucks admonitions. We are 10 years of lawless preachments, 10 years of criticism of law, of courts, of our fellow man; a decade of telling schoolchildren the opposite of what the civics books say. We are a mass of intolerance and bigotry and stand indicted hefore our young. We are cursed by the failure of each of us to accept responsibility, by our defense of an already dead institution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Who is really guilty? Each of us. Each (jitizen who has not consciously attempted to bring about peaceful compliance with the decisions of the Supreme Court; each citizen who has ever said, ‘They ought to kill that “nigger.” * Every person in this community who has in any way contributed to the popularity of hatred is at least as guilty, or more so, as the demented fool who threw that bomb.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">What is it in humans that breeds such deep feelings against another race, to the extent that they violate the integration laws of the country? Is it their love for God and His Word the Bible? By no means! For God does not favor one race over another because of skin color. His Word plainly says that “God is not partial,” and that he “does not go by a man’s outward appearance.” “God . , . made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth.” —Acts 10:34; Gal. 2:6; Acts 17:24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Disregard for God’s law to love your neighbor as yourself,’ regardless of race or color, springs from deeply engrained teachings and beliefs. Such false teachings lead to hatred, strife, and in the past have culminated in bloody wars. But instead of pointing to the failings of others, would it not be much wiser to examine our own feelings and attitudes? Are our hearts clean from prejudice? Do we have genuine love for all races and nationalities of people?—Matt. 22:39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">How about other laws of God and man? God’s Word commands wives to be in subjection to their husbands. (Col. 3:18) Are you, if you are a wife? Do you comply with your husband’s decisions and work whole-souled to ensure their success? Governments make many laws that are not in conflict with God’s laws, but which may not be to the liking of individuals. There are tax laws, safety laws, building requirements, and so forth. Do you comply with all such duly constituted legislation, or do you rebel against it? Minor infractions of the law open the way to more serious violations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In Birmingham failure to comply with the laws that govern the country has led to strife and bloodshed. This situation, Alabama’s Anniston </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font20"> editorialized, “should serve as a grim warning to all that lawlessness, disregard for duly constituted law and its enforcement breed disorder and wanton recklessness that makes no person or no place safe and secure.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">continue to be practiced. It is evident that the wicked are prospering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Seeing this, some righteously disposed persons ask, Does God care? How can an all-wise, loving and righteous God tolerate wickedness so long? Lik*<sup>3</sup> Job and Jeremiah of ancient times, some ask: &quot;Why is it that the wicked themselves keep living, have grown old, also have become superior in wealth?” “Why is it that the way of wicked ones is what has succeeded, that all those who are committing treachery are the unworried ones?” Appropriate questions these!—Job 21:7; Jer. 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Some answer that God allows the wicked to prosper to teach men the bad effects thereof. But would a sane parent allow someone to murder some of his children so as to teach the others not to kill? Would a man offer rewards to coarse lechers to violate his daughters and thereby teach them virtue? Preposterous! God does not allow wickedness to teach people goodness! There has to be some other explanation of why God allows the wicked to prosper, for, as the Hebrew prophet</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Habakkuk said to Jehovah: “You are too pure in eyes to see what is bad; and to look [approvingly] on trouble you are not able?' —Hab. 1:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Habakkuk Questions God</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Although he was convinced of Jehovah’s righteousness, Habakkuk was nevertheless puzzled and distressed because of the suffering of the lowly ones at the hand of oppressors. Evidently, at the time Habakkuk wrote, faithful King Josiah had died, and, due to poor administration of affairs by his wicked son Jehoiakim, conditions in Judah had become very bad. “Therefore law grows numb, and justice never goes forth. Because the wicked one is surrounding the righteous one, for that reason justice goes forth crooked.” Such injustice troubled Habakkuk.—Hab. 1:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At the same time the rapacious Chaldeans, or Babylonians, had started on the rampage, terrorizing peoples all around. They despoiled other nations, and prospered at their expense. That wicked ones should appear to have the best of everything perplexed Habakkuk; so he inquired of God: “Why is it that you look on those dealing treacherously, that you keep silent when someone wicked swallows up someone more righteous than he is?”—Hab. 1: 5-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Yes, Habakkuk wanted an answer from God himself. When the wicked prosper, do you care, Jehovah? Habakkuk kept himself stationed at his guard post watching to see what God would speak. To get reasonable and satisfying answers we must likewise be watchfully attentive to God’s Word.—Hab. 2:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Before considering God’s answer to Habakkuk it is important that we understand that God is not responsible for the wickedness in the world. The Bible explains that “God made mankind upright/’ in His image and likeness, “but they themselves have sought out many plans?’ “They have acted ruinously on their own part; they are not his children, the defect is their own. A generation crooked and twisted!”—Eccl 7:29; Deut. 32:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">True, mankind has had to suffer a great deal through the centuries because of the wickedness of wayward men who have rejected God’s Word. But, remember, Jehovah is not responsible for their badness. The selfish spirit creature Satan the Devil is the one that has been stirring up violence and trouble in the earth. And while Jehovah does not snatch his faithful servants away from these wicked conditions, he does give them guidance and comfort, even as he did Habakkuk. So it will be to our benefit to consider what Jehovah told Habakkuk in answer to his inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">God’s Answer to Habakkuk</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Habakkuk was sorely troubled over the injustice in his day, so God gave him a vision in which he assured Habakkuk that the prosperity of the wicked was only temporary. “For the vision is yet for the appointed time, and it keeps panting on to the end, and it will not tell a lie. Even if it should delay, keep in expectation of it; for it will without fail come true. It will not be late?<sup>1</sup>—Hab. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There is an appointed time for meting out punishment to the wicked and, even though that time should appear to delay, it will without fail come on schedule, Jehovah promised. He went on to assure Habakkuk that </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">even though the unrighteous </span><span class="font20">one’s “soul has been swelled up” and he becomes self-assuming, “he will not reach his goal, he who has made his soul spacious just like Sheol, and who is like death and cannot be satisfied. And he keeps gathering to himself all the nations and collecting together to himself all the peoples?’—Hab. 2:4,5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In Habakkuk’s day the oppressive military power of Babylon was like an ablebodied man that kept “gathering to himself the nations and collecting together to himself all the peoples?' Yet, those nations and greedy men that conquer and oppress others to appease their selfish appetite for power and riches are like Sheol and death, in that they are never satisfied, but are always looking for more.—Prov. 27:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">On the other hand, Jehovah showed that, “as for the righteous one, by his faithfulness he will keep living?’ (Hab. 2:4) By inserting this statement, God emphasized the importance of faithfulness in the face of the flourishing of wickedness and the apparent prosperity of evildoers. Yes, in the end it is the righteous one who remains faithful that will receive the reward of life. The Christian apostle Paul repeatedly quoted this text in his letters to emphasize to Christians their need of faith.—Rom. 1:17; Gal, 3:11; Heb. 10:38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Jehovah’s vision to Habakkuk next records the proverbial saying that one took up against those who prosper at the expense of others. &quot;Woe to him who is multiplying what is not his own—O how long! —and who is making debt heavy against himself! Will not those claiming interest of you rise up suddenly, and those wake up who are violently shaking you, and you certainly become to them something to pillage? Because you yourself despoiled many nations, all the remaining ones of the peoples will despoil you, because of the shedding of blood of mankind.”—Hab. 2:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">How true Jehovah's vision proved to be! Peoples often rise up and throw down oppressive rulers that despoil and fill the earth with bloodshed. Evildoers reap what they sow. In a very short time Babylon herself was despoiled, even as she had despoiled others. And in our day Hitler, Mussolini and Trujillo are among persons that pillaged others, only to be pillaged themselves. And if the revolutioi iry elements among the people themselves do not do it, Jehovah will see to it that tl 2 wicked are punished for their wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Jehovah revealed this to Habakkuk in the vision he gave him. After pronouncing &quot;woe to the one that is making evil gain for his house,” and &quot;to the one that is building a city by bloodshed, and that has solidly established a town by unrighteousness!” the inspired account goes on to show what Jehovah will do to such ones: &quot;Look! Is it not from Jehovah of armies that [those wicked J peoples will toil on only for the fire, and that national groups [who oppress the lowly] will tire themselves out merely for nothing?”—Hab. 2:9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Here Jehovah assures Habakkuk that he would see to it that oppressors, like the Babylonians, would receive an accounting. In keeping with this vision, through the contemporary prophet Jeremiah he explained what would happen to the rapacious Babylonians: &quot;This is what Jehovah of armies has said: ‘The wall of Babylon, although broad, will without fail be demolished; and her gates, although high, will be set aflame with fire. And the peoples will have to toil for simply nothing, and national groups simply for the fire; and they will just tire themselves out? ” Jehovah brought execution upon the selfconfident Babylonians by the hand of the Medes and Persians in 539 B.C.E. just as he foretold.—Jer. 51:11, 12, 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Repeatedly in his answer to Habakkuk Jehovah emphasized that evildoers will not get away with their evildoing. Eventhough the meting out of justice appears to delay, it will come on schedule. This should serve as a warning to any that may think they can get away with wrongdoing. The vision to Habakkuk particularly takes note of evil persons that make their companions drunk &quot;for the purpose of looking upon their parts of shame.” One that tries to weaken another's resistance so as to make immoral advances toward that one will have to answer to Jehovah. And &quot;the cup of the right hand of Jehovah will come around to” them, and they will be disgraced.—Hab. 2:15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the day of judgment upon such evildoers their religiousness will not benefit them at all. The Babylonians were a very devout people who looked to their religious idols for protection and blessings. Yet Jehovah said: “Of what benefit has a carved image been, when the former of it has carved it, . . . when the former of its form has trusted in it, to the extent of making valueless gods that are speechless? Woe to the one saying to the piece of wood: <sup>(</sup>O do awake!’ to a dumb stone: ‘O wake up! It itself will give instruction’! fjook! It is sheathed in gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.”—Hab, 2:18,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Just as their religious idols did not save the Babylonians when the time came for God’s execution upon them, so neither can anyone today do evil deeds, and still think he can escape God’s judgment by attending religious services or by performing some acts of worship. “Jehovah is in his holy terhple” watching, and if one would escape destruction he must practice the clean, pure worship of Jehovah, “rendering him sacred service day and night in his temple.”—Hab. 2:20; Rev. 7:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">What an assuring and comforting answer Habakkuk received from Jehovah! God does care when the wicked prosper, and in no uncertain terms He revealed that in his appointed time they would be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Appointed Time Is at Hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Jehovah’s answer to Habakkuk is actually a prophecy that has its grand, climactic fulfillment when Satan and his entire wicked organization will be despoiled and given to the fire. Down through the centuries this organization of wickedness has ruled the earth and oppressed the peoples. It has accumulated heavy debt against itself. Jehovah has observed and patiently waited, allowing sufficient time for Satan to try to carry out his boast that he could turn all mankind into the ways of wickedness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the meantime Jehovah counsels his people: “Do not avenge yourselves, beloved, . . . ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay.’ ” And so, in his prophecy to Habakkuk, Jehovah said to keep in expectation of the appointed time for this execution of vengeance, “for it will without fail come true.” But when?—Rom. 12:19; Hab. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The many Bible prophecies combine to prove beyond question that since the first world war, in 1914, we have entered “the time of the end.” (Dan. 12:4) Jesus Christ foretold that “the conclusion of the system of things” would be marked by world war, food shortages, earthquakes, pestilences, persecution of Christians, lawlessness, the preaching of the Kingdom good news and many other evidences that unite to mark this as “the time of the end.” So, as Jehovah said, “even if [the vision’s fulfillment] should delay, keep in expectation of it; for it will without fail come true. It will not be late.” Yes, Jehovah’s destruction of all wickedness is scheduled for this generation!—Matt. 24:3-42; Luke 21:7-36; 2 Tim. 3:1-5; Hab. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">This means that the wicked among men will prosper for only a short time longer. At the fast-approaching “war of the great day of God the Almighty,” called in the Bible Armageddon, they will be “annihilated forever.” So follow the Scriptural advice: “Do not be envious of bad men, and do not show yourself craving to get in with them. For there will prove to be no future for anyone bad; the very lamp of wicked people will be extinguished.” Yes, “hope in Jehovah and keep his way, and he will exalt you to take possession of the earth. When the wicked ones are cut off, you will see it.” Of this preservation you can be assured, because you have God’s word to Habakkuk: “As for the righteous one, by his faithfulness he will keep living,”—Rev. 16:14-16; Ps. 92:7; Prov. 24:1, 20; Ps. 37: 34; Hab. 2:4,</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">erly used. This had to be learned from experience. Now that we have lived with TV for more than two decades, it has become very evident what effects TV can cause. Some are good but others are very detrimental. More often than not the bad effects are due to improper control of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The occasions when TV has been involved with the breaking up of marriages, the fault has been not TV itself but the lack of self-control on the part of those watching it. Instead of quarreling over what to watch, a man and wife should be mature enough to compromise when tastes differ. Getting separate television sets is not solving the basic problem, which is learning how to be considerate and unselfish. For adults to quarrel over something so unimportant as TV programs is to reveal their immaturity. They are acting like selfish, spoiled children who must always have their way. Such persons do not know how to use TV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">made as to which party of the divorce will get the television set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To the childish thinking of such immature adults, watching their favorite television show appears to be the most important thing in their lives, even more important than their marriage. This foolishness is not the fault of TV, Until these people learn how to exercise self-control, to recognize what is really important in life and to show loving consideration for their partner in marriage, they will have trouble over anything about which their interests conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As an entertainer, television can provide hours of pleasant diversion. Without any physical or mental exertion a person can be whisked away to the land of fantasy by means of realistic dramas, taken to sporting events, transported to different countries, put on the actual spot of current world happenings or moved into the quiet confines of a lecture hall where a teacher Is giving a lecture on an educational subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Television is such a fascinating entertainer that the average American home has the TV set on about six hours daily. Adults look at it about half of this time, and children the other half. But can it be said that what they see is quality entertainment?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Program Content</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">A rising tide of criticism about television programs has focused public attention on their generally low level of quality. Television critic Harriet Van Horne said: “It’s utterly appalling that people waste so much time on the trash and trivia the networks throw at them.” The New York </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Times Magazine</span><span class="font20"> observed: “The predictability, repetition and over-all mediocrity of many regularly scheduled shows can be numbing and these items are ground out with a relentless determination to avoid any intrusion of style, substance or imagination.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In England the National Association of Schoolmasters deplored the low level of TV programing and advertising. Reporting what was said at a conference of this association, the </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Express</span><span class="font20"> stated: “Stricter censorship of TV programmes was called for in a resolution moved by Mr. Wilfred Ridealgh, of Hull.... 'Those bringing up children by Christian standards must often shudder at the portrayal of death, destruction, and lack of emotion on the screen/ went on Mr. Ridealgh, father of two boys. ‘Sojne programmes have caused unpleasant and unwanted reactions/ . . . Mr. Arthur Peasnell, executive member of Birmingham, said he felt like throwing a brick at his TV set while watching the advertisements. 'They have such a low opinion of our intelligence/ he added. He described Sunday night plays as ‘depressingly sexy, violent and of low morality/ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Even Newton N. Minow, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission in America, has expressed disgust at the low level of TV programs. In a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters, he pointed out that if they would spend an entire day watching TV, they would see “a vast wasteland.” “You will see/’ he said, “a procession of game shows, violence, audience participation shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western badmen, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence. ... I believe in the people’s good sense and good taste, and I am not convinced that the people’s taste is as low as some of you assume.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Making a wasteland with TV programs is a disservice to the general public. It is an abuse of television by the television broadcasters. It is not what was envisioned for television by its pioneers. One of these is Dr. Vladimir Zworykin, who played a major role in the development of television cameras in the United States. He said recently: “Television today is chiefly used for entertainment, and unfortunately this has obscured the most useful application, which is an extension of human sight. It was in this way that all the early research workers thought about it. Some of the programs going out today are objectionable. There is too much crime and violence. I discourage my own grandchildren from watching. It does not represent life, and it is all very disappointing.” Of course, the broadcasters have their reasons for putting on the type of programs they show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Television companies in some countries are supported financially by advertisers who, quite naturally, want as large an audience as possible for their products. Programs that do not draw a large audience, which to the television industry must be in the millions, do not usually interest advertisers. So the companies stick to shallow, stereotyped programs that rely heavily upon sex and violence, because these attract audiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">During the daytime hours when the viewing audience is small, the companies do not broadcast quality programs because, they argue, it does not pay. The small audiences do not warrant a big investment. So aside from frequent re-runs of quality shows, what is generally shown is largely rubbish. Evening hours get the more expensive and better programs, but even those hours have some very poor shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Moral Effect</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The continual showing of programs filled with immorality, violence, crime and sadism week after week is certain to have an unwholesome effect upon the bent of thinking of those who view them. This is especially so with regard to children whose impressionable and imaginative minds do not easily draw a clear distinction between the world of fantasy and the world of reality. As continuously dripping water can wear away a stone, so the continuous parade of crime, corruption and violence that passes children’s eyes on the TV screen can affect their thinking and actions in real life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The power of suggestion in TV cannot be discounted as of little consequence. In an experiment made by psychologist Albert Bandura, it was found, as reported by the Redwood City </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font20"> that “children are more aggressive after watching aggression on film and that they are apt to model their actions after the aggressive person they watch/’ Dr. Bandura found that after a film showing a woman pounding, kicking and beating with a mallet a five-foot doll was seen by little children, they invariably would reenact the woman’s actions when let into a room with a similar doll. Out of a group of twenty-four children between the ages of three and five, 80 percent, the report says, “ignored the other toys and went straight for the Bobo doll. . . . They were not considered aggressive unless they imitated the actions of the woman in the film. The 80 percent did imitate the actions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">For impressionable children, television is very real, and when they play they tend to reenact what they see, sometimes trying to transfer fantasy into awful reality, as in the case of the son of a policeman who wanted real bullets to use on his sister, because, as he told his father, “she doesn’t die for real when I shoot her like they do when Hopalong Cassidy kills them/’ There is the case of a boy of thirteen who, after watching a TV show that depicted a man turning on gas jets in a kitchen and then sitting down in a chair to commit suicide, did the very same thing. But unlike the fantasy world of television, he was not rescued at the last moment but was found dead by his horrified mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Television Westerns made such an impression on a twelve-year-old Canadian boy that he used to argue with his brother about the reality of the hangings in the shows. One day his mother found him dangling from his bed dead, strangled by a belt around his neck. Even adults are deeply impressed by TV and try to mimic what they see. This is evident from the number of adults who shoot themselves in the leg while practicing the quick draw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In Britain a ten-year-old boy was inspired by television to stab to death a nine-year-old girl. He told the police: “I have seen stabbing on television and the next week you see them in another part. I watch all the murders.” Like so many imaginative youngsters, he lived what he saw on TV. Is it not worth the effort for parents to censor what their children see in order to prevent such tragedies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Television can be a good educator in worthwhile things, but it also can educate children in crime. Two American high school boys got the idea from TV to extort $500 from a business firm by means of a bomb threat. They were arrested by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Like these two boys, other children, especially those who already are a social problem, have learned from TV how to execute crimes. The book </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Television in the Lives of Our Children</span><span class="font20"> states: “In general these older boys’ use of television violence has been fairly realistic. They have found on television an effective way to do something, and they have adopted it., .. Ralph Banay, a psychiatrist, said that ‘if the proverb is true that prison is a college for crime, I believe that for young disturbed adolescents, TV is a preparatory school for delinquency? ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The influence from the continuous torrent of depraved, violent and criminal dramas that deluge the public through television is certain to exert a detrimental influence upon young minds as well as those of adults. It seems unlikely, however, that the television industry will do much in the way of upgrading their programs as long as they believe that their best profits come from appealing to the public’s morbid fascination </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font20"> what is sordid, violent, brutal and sadistic, which in ancient times filled the gruesome arenas of Rome with attentive audiences. It is up to each family to use television wisely by imposing its own censorship on TV programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Selective Viewing</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The channel selection dial and the off switch are handy means by which a TV viewer can select quality programs when they are showing and eliminate trashy ones. If nothing of quality is being broadcast, it is a foolish waste of time to ait and watch whatever happens to come on. Wise use of TV requires discreet program selection. This is especially important with regard to children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Parents should supervise what programs their children watch, not permitting them to be brainwashed by TV's flood of sadism, brutality, viciousness and every other devilish thing brought up from the miry depths of this corrupt world. They should exercise the same loving oversight about what their children feed their minds as they do about what the children feed their bodies. Parental supervision and regulation of the TV set can make it an innocuous entertainer and educator of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">There are many things in the realities of life that are far more deserving of one’s time and attention than the fantasies of television. It would be wise, therefore, to view it only during the time that a person allots for entertainment or special programs. It should by no means be permitted to infringe upon the time that is intended or should be given to more important things. Such control of TV requires a certain amount of self-control. Due to its absorbing nature, a person should not turn it on when he should be doing something else. For some people it is too difficult to turn the set off: When it is used longer than the time that should be allotted to TV entertainment, television can become a great time waster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Television should be regarded as a slave to serve the entertainment and educational desires of its owner. It is misused when its owner becomes a slave to it. By controlling its use and by being selective in the programs viewed, a person can make television a wholesome teacher and a delightful entertainer in his home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Role to 'Play</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font25">W</span><span class="font20">INGED creatures, such as birds and insects, play a vital part in the grand design of life on our planet, the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Since birds are generally acknowledged as interesting and pleasant, there is usually no objection to their being classified as vital. But not so with the winged creatures of the insect world! Many quickly conclude that it would be a far better world without those pesky creatures around to bother us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">However, before hastily jumping to such a conclusion, reflect on this thought: The total absence of insects would mean the eventual death of many forms of life on earth. Even man’s existence would be seriously endangered!</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Role Insects Play</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">What role do insects play that is so vital? To understand this we must appreciate a fundamental truth regarding our earth. It is this: All living things, insects included, are dependent upon one another in one way or another. No living thing, whether plant or animal, can exist totally independent of other living things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Insects are essential to this integrated community of living things because of their relationship to plant life. Their existence is a necessity for many forms of plant life. Without insects, these plants would cease to exist. This, in turn, would jeopardize animal life dependent on such plants. Here we are confronted by another fundamental truth concerning life on earth: Without plant life, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font20"> animal life would disappear from earth—and so would man! Plant life is absolutely necessary as food for all other forms of life. This is so because plants alone can transform inorganic materials into food. They accomplish this by the remarkable process of photosynthesis, combining the energy of the sun with the elements of the air, water and soil to produce food. Animals cannot perform this indispensable function. Hence, green plants are the basic source of all food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Here is where insects play their role. They perform two functions for plants. Together with soil bacteria, worms, and roots of plants, they build fertility in the soil, “plowing” and aerating it, turning it into an absorbent sponge that holds water for plants. Dead plant and animal forms attract a host of these small creatures that help to break down this dead matter into new chemical combinations that can be used again as food by succeeding plant generations. Myriads of insects spend parts of their lives in the soil: ants, beetles, wasps, and others. The activity of these insects and other creatures combines to carry on the work of turning, airing, and fertilizing the soil as they aid in the decomposition of dead plants and animals, adding their own remains as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Each of these small insects adds its tiny bit to the building of the living earth. Why, even that pesky housefly does its share! The larvae of flies feed on dead matter. Not only does this aid in disposing of such dead matter, but the feeding larvae help decompose it, making it available for plant food. Also, insects such as burying beetles carry the remains of dead matter underground to enrich the soil, laying the foundation for a new cycle of life on a cleansed surface.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19631222_files/g_E_19631222-9.png" alt="" style="width:108pt;height:76pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">Another amazing function of insects is their pollination of many forms of plant life. Without insects to perform this fertilizing, many plants and trees would perish. Insects make their rounds of flowers for the nectar or pollen that in many instances constitutes their sole food supply. In return, the insects, in their journey from flower to flower, carry pollen from the male flower to the female flower, fertilizing the plant and making possible its reproduction. So close is this relationship that a whole host of plants and insects are totally dependent upon one another for their survival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">An example of this intricate and specially designed partnership is the yucca moth and the yucca plant. The yucca plant cannot be pollinated except by the aid of this moth. If these moths are kept away, the plant cannot develop seeds for reproduction and would soon die out. The yucca moth lays her eggs in no other plant. However, before laying her eggs she gathers pollen from other yucca plants. Then she flies to the flower, where she lays her eggs. Immediately thereafter she takes some of the pollen she has previously gathered and stuffs this into the stigma of the plant, thus fertilizing it, an act the plant could not possibly do for itself. Interestingly, the young moth larvae only consume about a third of the seeds in the plant as their food, leaving the remainder for the plant to perpetuate itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Is man affected by all this? Yes, because nearly all the fruits and vegetables used by man are directly dependent on this partnership with insects! Without these insects, man’s food supply would be disastrously curtailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Birds Play Their Role</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">This partnership of insect and plant requires the most exacting regulation in order to continue. Insects must have the ability to multiply faster than their normal death rate to insure survival. But this power carries tremendous danger with it, for if insects were allowed to multiply unchecked they would soon destroy the plants they use as food. This is observed clearly during locust plagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So while in balance, insects perform their vital role for plant life. Out of balance they threaten the very source of their sustenance. Also, all other forms of life are denied their basic food source when plants are devastated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">To control these otherwise beneficial insects and prevent their doing harm where good was purposed, the Creator has wisely provided a highly organized police force of insect eaters, the birds. Each type of bird is a specialist designed for a particular role. For example, the larvae of many insects live in the upper soil. For controlling these, there are ground-nesting birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">These hunt for insects on the ground, turning up leaves and other obstacles to get at their prey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Where insects inhabit plants and trees, other specially designed birds play their role. Birds such as brown thrashers hunt on</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19631222_files/g_E_19631222-10.png" alt="" style="width:95pt;height:148pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Woodpecker <sub>t</sub>j<sub>ie</sub> </span><span class="font20">ground but extend their search to the bushes where they make their nests. They are joined by other varieties of birds that continue this search to the very tops of trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As trees grow, lower branches die and the wood softens, inviting insects into the tree. If unchecked, they would multiply at a rapid rate and begin infesting the healthy parts of the tree, soon destroying it altogether. But in the softer wood of the lower branches we find the favorite nesting sites for birds such as woodpeckers. The feet of several varieties of birds are specially designed to hunt on the bark of trees, but the woodpeckers go one step farther. They drill holes through the bark to catch the insects hidden within. In this way, about 95 percent of these insects are cleared from the vegetation, keeping enough alive to perform their role, allowing the plants to live, and providing food for the bird population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Some of the insects survive to emerge and fly over the trees. Here, too, control is exercised by birds such as swifts and swallows by day, and by nighthawks at dusk. Later these are joined by bats equipped to hunt insects in the dark, using their unique sonar system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Every part of every tree, bush and plant in communities that man has not tampered with has its regular protection from its own special guardian. Each of these different birds is equipped to find its own special food in its own special way. Several species of birds may live in the same tree and not interfere with one another, because each would probably starve if it had to depend on using the food that supports the others. Only where there is competition for food is there an effort made to keep others away. But when the balance of nature has not been upset, these find food elsewhere in the area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Without the help of birds, whose young often eat their own weight in insects every day, plants could not survive the onslaught of insects. Insects are a necessary part of a plant community, but so are the birds that exercise control over them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">When the Balance Is Upset</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">It is only when the balance between insects and their controls is upset that they become a menace. Where natural disasters, or man, upsets this balance, then the entire community suffers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">For instance, when too many birds are killed off or die from disasters, insects such as the tree beetle multiply explosively. At first they attack dead and dying trees. But then, unchecked, they soon infest healthy ones and by the sheer weight of their numbers overwhelm them. Dead trees dry out and become tinder, making fire more likely. After a fire the land is dead and, with the protective vegetation gone, rain carries away its life-sustaining topsoil. The misuse of the natural creation, especially by man, has created barren areas that cannot sustain plant life. As a result, animal life cannot live there in abundance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Created with a Role to Play</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">This entire community of plant and animal life is very highly organized and beautifully controlled, with its own automatic system of farming, sanitation and policing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Plants build food for plant eaters such as insects. In turn, these insects aid in cultivating the soil and pollinating the plants. However, these need the controlling force of other forms of life, such as birds. In the end, all go back to the earth, where the bacteria and insects once again begin their work of preparing them as food for plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Yes, winged creatures were created with a role to play. This role is absolutely vital for much of the food man himself needs. When man appreciates the role that this integrated community of living creatures plays, he will be careful to guard it as a precious trust given to him by his Creator. At the same time, he will acknowledge the One whose wisdom made it possible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">diTEHOVAH’S WITNESSES WIN”— </span><span class="font8">J </span><span class="font20">this was the bold, front-page headline in the August 30, 1963, issue of the Arizona jEepublic, the headline yelled out by the newsboys on the streets of the city of Phoenix<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark15">1</a></sup> Readers of the newspaper quickly noted the crux of a federal court decision: &quot;Jehovah’s Witnesses need not stand when the national anthem is sung in public school classrooms, a federal judge ruled here yesterday in U.S. District Court,” Actually a federal judge had decided in favor of freedom. Why did the judge so rule, and how did this unusual case come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Because of their religious convictions, three children of Jehovah’s witnesses in Arizona refrained from standing during a national anthem ceremony at school. They viewed acts such as flag saluting and standing for national anthems as religious ceremonies in which they could not conscientiously participate.<sup><a href="#bookmark15">1</a></sup> School authorities expelled the three children from school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">That was back in September, 1961, at Pinetop, a small village about 200 miles northeast of Phoenix. The school, a four-room elementary one, required all students to stand for the anthem ceremony. When they silently refrained from standing, the three Witness children, Jere Wingo, Bill Wingo and Daniel Sheldon, were expelled from school, obliging them to pursue their education by taking correspondence courses. The reason given by the school board for their action was that the children’s refusal to stand for the anthem would pose disciplinary problems for the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Issue Goes to Federal Court</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Civil rights action was then brought by the two sets of parents in behalf of their three children. Judge Arthur Davis of federal district court refused to order the students readmitted; so counsel for the Witnesses asked for a three-judge court to hear the case; but the United States Supreme Court ruled that a one-judge court should try the anthem case. In the meantime Judge Davis died. A new judge was specially appointed; this was Judge William C. Mathes, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, presiding at Phoenix by special assignment. The case opened on August 27, 1963, almost two years after the expulsion of the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The federal courtroom at Phoenix, Arizona, that day overflowed with a crowd of more than 200 persons, many of them Jehovah’s witnesses. People were standing in the aisles. On the witness stand, a member of the school board explained that the children had been expelled because of the principle of &quot;discipline.” School authorities would not accept the view that standing for the national anthem was a religious ceremony. But to the children of Jehovah’s witnesses it was; and counsel for the Witnesses pointed out that the children were religiously motivated, and that it is not in the jurisdiction of any school board to define what is and what is not religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Victor Blackwell, counsel for the Witnesses, told the Court that it was about 149 years ago that Francis Scott Key, a lawyer, had written the poem, the Star Spangled Banner, which was set to music and later became the United States national anthem, and that Key certainly desired to stress freedom in this song as denoted by the phrase “the land of the free.” Counsel for the Witnesses stressed the point that if Key could be there in the courtroom to see this song being used by a school board as a weapon of oppression, he would surely object to such usage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Into the court record was introduced a copy of </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font20"> of February 15, 1960, which explained why Jehovah’s witnesses do not stand for national anthems, that very issue showing that a witness of Jehovah could not take such special action toward a national anthem any more than the three Hebrews could have taken the special action demanded of them by King Nebuchadnezzar toward the image he set up. (Dan. 3:1-23) Counsel for the Witnesses also asked the judge where the greater danger is: Is it in putting these children and perhaps thousands of others out of school and possibly having a wave of mob violence against the Witnesses as in 1942, or in letting the children sit or leave the schoolroom, so as not to violate their conscience?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Decision Given Wide Publicity</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The trial concluded August 29, with Judge Mathes giving a twenty-two-minute ruling. “Since it appears,” ruled the judge, “that the conduct of the pupils involved here was not disorderly and did not materially disrupt the conduct and discipline of the school, an injunction will be issued permanently restraining the defendants from excluding them [the children] from Pinetop School solely because they silently refused to rise and stand while the national anthem is being sung.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">News media widely publicized the decision, and it became a topic of conversation by people on the street. A group waiting for a bus in Phoenix were heard to discuss the case, most of them seeming to be glad about the decision. One old colored man remarked: “People sure better watch out how they treat God’s people, or they’ll get in trouble with the Lord.” Newspapers discussed the decision editorially, the Arizona </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font20"> of Tucson saying that the right of a minority to its religious belief had properly been upheld under the First Amendment. The St. Louis </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Post-Dispatch</span><span class="font20"> of September 26,1963, commented:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">'To most Americans the views of the Jehovah’s Witnesses on this point may seem fallacious, but are they not entitled to their views? Indeed, if they had been 'made to stand to sing the anthem, or successfully expelled, would force have changed their views? . . . Surely our whole history as a nation shows that compulsion in the field of ideas is self-defeating and not worth the wreckage it does to constitutional principle.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Letters written to newspapers were published, such as one sent to the Phoenix </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font20"> and published in its issue of September 6,1963, which said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">“I am not a Jehovah’s Witness, but I am definitely for the preserving of one of our important civil rights, freedom of religious belief. ... I feel that it is a serious business when a school board keeps three boys from receiving their rightful education, with the board’s only logical, evident reasoning being that the boys refused to stand during the national anthem. Aren’t there many other ways they can show respect and love for our country than by just standing for a song? Can’t they be law-abiding citizens, pay their taxes, etc., which I might add, some of the people that do stand for the national anthem, do not do,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">‘'Also, if the other children in the class ask the teacher why there are a few students not saluting the flag, don’t you think that would be a wonderful opportunity right there for the teacher to explain that that is just exactly what the national anthem and flag salute stand for? The right to freedom of worship, along with our other civil rights guaranteed in the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">“These boys in Pinetop are setting a good example by sticking with it. Many other boys, especially today, probably would have run away from home, gone to another school, moved to another state, or even become juvenile delinquents, which would have been the easy way out, especially after all they've been through; but, no, these boys from Pinetop have stayed right with it, still desiring to enter school and receive an education. I wonder how many other boys that age in today’s society would have taken such a stand for their religious freedom and Christian conscience?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Extended Court Opinion</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">When Judge Mathes decided the anthem case, he gave his decision from the bench. It was not known at that time that he would enter a more extended and complete decision and opinion. Though the opinion limited the injunction to the three children who had been expelled, the judge had told the attorney general of the State of Arizona that he assumed that school boards all over the State would be instructed that children of Jehovah’s witnesses could not be expelled from school for declining to stand during the singing of the national anthem. Judge Mathes’ opinion is a lengthy one and a very scholarly one, described by an attorney as “classic.” From this “Memorandum of Decision,” United States District Court, District of Arizona, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">George</span><span class="font20"> W. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Sheldon et al.</span><span class="font20"> v. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Paid Fannin et al.,</span><span class="font20"> Civil No. 749, Prescott Division, we quote a few excerpts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“I like to recall,” wrote Judge Mathes, “that the founding fathers inscribed upon the Great Seal of the United States [appearing on the reverse side of a one dollar bill] the Latin phrase </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">novus ordo seclorum</span><span class="font20">—‘a new order of the ages? This proud boast proclaimed their pride and their faith in the new nation they had founded here—a nation where everyone from the highest official to the most humble citizen must act under and in accordance with the law. The keystone of this ‘new order’ has always been freedom of expression—the widest practicable individual freedom to believe, to speak, to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Our forebears realized that ideas for preservation and improvement of a free society must come, not from the government, but from the people, and must compete for acceptance by the people, just as goods and services compete for acceptance in our free-enterprise economy. They realized too that in order to compete for acceptance, these ideas must be freely expressed by act and deed; that only in this way can the truth prevail; that only in this way can an idea despised today win the acceptance of reason tomorrow, or be thoroughly discredited; and that only by protecting the freedom of the smallest minority to express unpopular ideas by word or deed can the majority insure freedom to believe and express its own ideas, and to dispute and criticize those of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“This principle of freedom of belief and expression was so esteemed by the founding fathers that it was embodied in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States with the unqualified declaration that: ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and petition the Government for a redress of grievances.’ And these freedoms have since been held protected against State action by the Fourteenth Amendment, [See, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., Cantwell</span><span class="font20"> v. Con-</span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">nectieut,</span><span class="font20"> 310 U.S. 296 (1940)*]&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Flag-Salute Case Relevant</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Judge Mathes then referred to what is known as the flag-salute case, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">West</span><span class="font20"> Virginia </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">State Board of Education</span><span class="font20"> v. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Barnette, </span><span class="font20">and quoted from this Supreme Court decision: “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The judge pointed out that the State may curtail religious expressions if there is present danger of “impairing the public health or safety.” “Where, however, a particular application of a general law not protective of some fundamental State concern materially abridges free expression or practice of religious belief, then the law must give way to the exercise of religion. . . . Clearly, then, if the refusal to participate in the ceremony attendant upon the singing or playing of the National Anthem had not occurred in a public-school classroom, but in some other public or private place, there would be not the slightest doubt that the plaintiffs were free to participate or not as they choose. Every citizen is free to stand or sit, sing or remain silent, when the Star Spangled Banner is played. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“All who live under the protection of our Flag are free to believe whatever they may choose to believe and to express that belief, within the limits of free expression, no matter how unfounded, or even ludicrous the professed belief may seem to others. While implicitly demanding that all freedom of expression be exercised reasonably under the circumstances, the Constitution fortunately does not require that the beliefs or thoughts expressed be reasonable, or wise, or even sensible. The First Amendment thus guarantees to the plaintiffs the right to claim that their objection to standing is based upon religious belief, and the sincerity or reasonableness of this claim may not be examined by this or any other Court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Accepting, then, the plaintiffs’ characterization of their conduct as religiously inspired, this case is ruled by </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Board of Education</span><span class="font20"> v. </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Barnette,</span><span class="font20"> 319 U.S. 624 (1943), where the Supreme Court held unconstitutional the expulsion of Jehovah’s Witnesses from a public school for refusal to recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag. The decision there rested not merely upon the 'free-exercise clause,’ but also upon the principle inherent in the entire First Amendment: that governmental authority may not directly coerce the unwilling expression of any belief, even in the name of 'national unity’ in time of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;Manifestly, the State’s interest was much stronger in </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Barnette</span><span class="font20"> than in the case at bar. The sole justification offered by the defendants here is the opinion of the school authorities that to tolerate refusal of these plaintiffs to stand for the National Anthem would create a disciplinary problem. Evidence as to this is speculative at best and pales altogether when balanced against the 'preferred position’ of First Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Indeed,” stressed Judge Mathes at the close of his opinion, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">“there is much to be said for the view that,</span><span class="font20"> rather than creating a disciplinary problem, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">acceptance of the refusal of a few pupils to stand</span><span class="font20"> while the remainder stand and sing of their devotion to flag and country </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">might well be turned into a fine lesson in American Government for the entire class&quot;</span><span class="font20"> (Italics ours)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Certainly this is good counsel from a Federal Judge to all school authorities. Rather than imagining problems in discipline, let teachers show ingenuity, teaching the whole class a valuable lesson in freedom of worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font29">■</span><span class="font20">4E Church’s Mission to the World” was the theme chosen for the general conference of the Anglican Church held at Toronto, Canada, August 13 to 23, 1963. Approximately 1,000 delegates from 78 countries were present. There are eighteen member churches recognized as part of the Anglican Communion, which claims 44,000,000 adherents. Delegates came from different parts of Africa, Japan, Australia, India, Pakistan, the Philippine Republic, Britain and North America. In the United States the church is known as Episcopalian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">At the Congress it seemed to be agreed on all sides that the church had fallen on difficult times and the issue was: How could the difficulties be overcome? The Toronto </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</span><span class="font20"> pointed out the problem in an editorial stating: “In this century, the churches generally have been steadily losing their influence and leadership, For millions of people, including many regular church goers, the churches have ceased to be a decisive influence on ethics and behaviour, and conventional religion has seemed Irrelevant to the conduct of life. For much of this the churches have only themselves to blame . . . they have tended to hold themselves aloof from the real problems of the times, or to express their concern in pious generalities of small practical import. . . . The Anglicans are gathering at a time of challenge.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Was the challenge met? The delegates, chiefly bishops and clergy, were loud in their criticisms and denunciations of their munion will have its barnacles removed.” So badly has the Anglican Church failed in England that the archbishop of Canterbury even suggested that African and Asian missionaries might come to help convert “Post Christian heathenism” in England. Another English cleric spoke of the people “staying away in droves.&quot; Bishop Bayne, an American, said: “The platitudinous religious language of yesterday, and to-day, won’t do. Christianity must find new ways to spread its message.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Political Ties</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Anglican Church has always been dominated by England. Most of the speakers were English in background and training. However, the eighteen member churches are really independent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In England the Anglican Church has been the established church, and the head of the State, the queen, is also the head of the church. This tie-in with what was formerly a dominant political power brought many privileges to the Anglican Church at one time, but in this era when “colonialism” is resented in many parts of the earth this long-time association with the British political state has become a liability. The Toronto </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font20"> summed up the difficulty: “These features of Imperialism which provided so many open doors for the Anglican Church in the past are deadly hindrances to-day. The Anglican communion is seeking to live down its past as almost an accoutrement of British Colonial expansion. ...” So close has been the association of the Church of England with the ruling classes there that it has been unkindly described as “the Tory party on its knees?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Speakers at the Congress covered a wide range of subjects, Alan Edmonds, a writer analyzed the speeches for the Toronto </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star:</span><span class="font20"> &quot;Daily the public sessions of the World Anglican Congress become an orgy of self-condemnation ... a procession of leading churchmen have mounted the speaker's rostrum to lash out at the very foundations of Anglicanism. Each one of them has had some bitter criticism of the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">&quot;The delegates have been told that:</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“You don’t have to be religious—or ‘churchy’—to be a good God-fearing Christian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“The church language is so archaic that it speaks to itself and its voice never reaches the marketplace of humanity . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“The church’s record of supporting nationalistic policies in countries where it is established has hindered the cause of international peace;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Immorality is encouraged because the church’s attitude is too lenient;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Anglican priests are often not educated to think and reason; they’re just ‘brainwashed’ to accept the conventional—and reactionary—party line doctrines of the church,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">“Anglicanism has failed the people because it fails to take stands on issues facing the world; ‘it straddles any fence it can find,’ claimed one bishop.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The same writer went on to say: “What is surprising is that the Anglican church is nowhere at a lower ebb than it is in England itself; nowhere is it more demonstrably clear that the church is failing in its mission to the ordinary people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In the midst of the self-condemnation by the various bishops and other clerics, much was said about the conflicts, the secularism, the unbelief of modem society, the necessity of the church to adapt itself. World economic problems; inadequate housing in England; discrimination against the black races; the possibility of union with other churches, notably the Roman Catholic; the damage that political association has done to the work of the church; the need to work with the United Nations —all these subjects came up for consideration. Substantially they were the same problems that any social or political group might raise for discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">New Messiahs</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">In its efforts to cope with a secular and unbelieving world the Congress seemed prepared to accommodate secular and scientific unbelief rather than meet or overcome it. Canon Warren expressed the view that God even works through men who do not so much as acknowledge His existence, such as Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. Canon Warren asked: “Have we the moral and intellectual integrity to admit that our concern for social righteousness owes not a little, under God, to the stimulus of Karl Marx?” Of Freud, he said, Christians “will humbly thank God for his Grace at work in Sigmund Freud, not less at work because Freud did not acknowledge Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Can one imagine a God so weak and poverty-stricken that he must rely on the founder of Godless communism to do the work that He entrusted to His Son, Christ Jesus, who has been given “all power in heaven and earth”! Freud, in his arrogance, rejected God, concentrated on the analysis of dreams, and concluded that most human behavior has a sexual motivation. Can one seriously expect that from the debased reasoning of this Godless man a Christian will find something for which to give thanks? Fancy an Anglican Church, searching for an answer to its own failures, pointing to new messiahs, Marx and Freud! Can one see in this any strong Christian lead, any real reliance on the true Messiah? Is this its “mission to the world”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Congress was alleged to presage something wholly new for the Anglican churches. In spite of this, Archbishop Ramsay opposed the passing of any resolution at all. Nevertheless, a draft resolution was placed before the entire body of 1,500 people on the last day. It covered only two pages of doublespaced typewritten material, but the entire session spent over an hour arguing about it. Then it was referred back to the editorial committee for rewriting. Nothing was said about racial discrimination until one of the African delegates said that such omission would be nothing but ‘sheer cowardice’ on the part of the entire group. Another member decried the resolution as a ‘cold document, lacking inspiration?</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Among other things, the final resolution said: “Our lay delegates have asked urgently for more adequate training. They want to understand their faith; they want to know how it applies to questions of poverty, politics, race and family, and to their everyday work and leisure so that they may witness for Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">So all these clergymen, who claim to represent 44,000,000 people, in essence are admitting that their teaching is so weak that their lay delegates at a world congress have to ask in a resolution for an understanding of their own faith. Is one surprised at their inability to witness for Christ when they do not even understand their own faith?</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">In the face of the serious weaknesses revealed by the church leaders themselves it was obvious that some fairly drastic action was necessary. Was it provided? The Toronto </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font20"> explained: “The pious hope is that from the . . . Royal York hotel, Toronto, will emerge a church reborn; a new and vital Anglicanism shorn of the stifling heritages of history ... a few hundred thousand words will have been spoken publicly . . . they’re proud, bold words, all of them . . . But will words be enough? ... Or will the brave sentiments of Toronto be lost as the church settles back into an apathy consolidated by those who resent and resist change? Even the church itself wonders?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The weaknesses and the failure of the church had led to the “orgy of selfcondemnation?* But was anything substantial done to cure it, to meet the challenge? Or did they just go away to continue the same political and religious practices that have led to failure, unhappiness and disappointment? Since no really serious changes were adopted, it becomes obvious that the same old pattern is intended to be pursued. The challenge was not met. They admit change is needed, but like the Pharisees of Jesus' day, “they say but do not perform?’ (Matt. 23:3) Can God’s holy spirit be seen on a church that admits itself to be a church of unbelief, weakness and failure? The words of Jesus give eloquent reply: “Every tree not producing fine fruit gets cut down and thrown into the fire.”—Matt. 7:19.</span></p><a name="caption3"></a>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">-LOST CITY OF THE JUNGLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">By “Awake!&quot; correspondent in Thailand</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">UR plane was rapidly descending. A few of us peered out of the small windows to see what was below. Behind us was Cam</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">bodia’s jungle of green, ahead was the town of Siem Reap, and in the distance, the lost city of the jungle, Angkor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Just the sight of the city gave us a strange sensation. No doubt we felt a little like the French naturalist Henri Mouhot did that January afternoon in 1861 when he first saw the lost city of Angkor. Mouhot was hacking his way through the thick undergrowth in search of rare insects when, suddenly, he came into a clearing. There before him long gray battlements disappeared into the jungle, magnificent terraces and galleries vaulted upward. He was convinced that he had stumbled upon the legendary capital of the Khmer (Cambodian) Empire, Angkor, an empire that is alleged to have stretched over most of southeast Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Angkor Wat is perhaps the most perfect of all the Khmer or Cambodian monuments. It was built in the first half of the twelfth century as a shrine to the Hindu god Vishnu and was constructed to represent mythical Mount Meru, legendary abode of the gods and center of the cosmos. Angkor Wat is surrounded by a huge moat 200 yards wide, and each side measures approximately a mile and is approached by a quarter-mile-long causeway. The temple rises in three successive flights of terraces connected by vaulted staircases, and is topped by towers, the tallest of which rises 215 feet from ground level. Stones averaging a ton each were taken from a quarry twenty-five miles away and were transported by barge, then later over land on rollers by elephant power. Finally, they were hoisted into position high in the sky by some method now unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Angkor Thom, or &quot;the Great City,&quot; was built by Jayavarman VII, greatest of all Khmer kings. Convinced he was the living Buddha, he developed many temples. His personal sanctuary, the massive Bayon, hat} chapels pointing in every direction, with fifty-four soaring towers containing more than two hundred huge sculptured faces, which are supposed to be in the king’s likeness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In its heyday this great walled city may have been one of the largest tn the world, with a population of more than a million. Gold-topped temples, emeralds, rubies and silver fountains decorated the thoroughfares. Pomp, ceremony and colorful pageantry were everywhere. King Jayavarman VII must have been well satisfied with his achievements when he died about 1220 (A.D.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Khmers were the marvel and scourge of the Orient for six hundred years. They came into prominence swiftly and disappeared as abruptly and mysteriously in 1432, leaving little trace and certainly no records of their empire save two hundred or more massive monuments in the Angkor area. From the bas-reliefs and from early accounts written by Chinese visitors, scholars have been able to piece together some details of this lost civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Khmers settled their capital around Angkor about A.D. 600. They assimilated from Hinduism and Buddhism what they could use and created their own culture. Their empire, called Kambuga-Cambodla, lasted until the fifteenth century, when it was abruptly snuffed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Exactly what happened may never be known. Some authorities believe the people tired of war and were left indefensible to the rampaging Siamese. Others believe a killer plague or pestilence destroyed them. Still others think the slaves revolted, killed their masters, looted Angkor’s riches and left forever the scene of their bondage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">This much is known: while they lasted, the kings of Khmer were remarkable. They went to war periodically, brought back whole nations in chains to quarry the rock and to build their buildings. Along the mighty Mekong River they uprooted the jungle to plant large areas of rice. They laid out a network of paVed roads. It was an amazing society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Today, however, Angkor is a ruin. Standing here looking up at these ruins, one is moved to reflect on the past, the present and the future. These very stones stand as a testimony against a warring, materialistic and oppressive way of life. Just as Jesus Christ, the greatest of prophets, said: &quot;What benefit will it be to a man if he gains the whole world but forfeits his soul?” &quot;Even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.&quot; (Matt. 16:26; Luke 12:15) Angkor, once great, is today silent proof of the truthfulness of these words. Will this twentieth century take heed? Will you?</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">lems. He is keenly interested only in the growing and successful harvesting of his crops, that his family may not go hungry. But in 1963 a threefold calamity caused deep concern to the farmers in the state of Parana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">First, the Drought—</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Since February no rain had fallen. The withered vegetation left the cattle without pasturage. Rivers dwindled to mere rivulets. Wells had gone dry. The parched earth resembled a dust bowl. The state government had to ration electricity because of the dangerously low water supply. Without water and with no green pastures for the cows, the milk supply was greatly diminished and the babies were feeling keenly the lack of their most important food. Even in the memory of the old-timers, there had never been so</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font20">half the Brazilian coffee, 90 percent of its newsprint, and abundant crops of beans, cassava (manioc), corn, cotton, mate, rice and other food products, making it one of the most valuable agricultural states of the Republic, the “breadbasket,” so to speak, of Brazil’s teeming millions of a fastgrowing population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Generally speaking, the Brazilian farmer is far removed from such burning questions of the day as the arms race and threat of atomic warfare. It is of little concern to him that some moonlight night he might gaze up at a Communist moon. The Berlin wall, Jewish and Arab brothers killing each other, the bamboo curtain of China, divided Korea and revolt in Vietnam, apartheid in South Africa and desegregation in the United States are not his probsevere a drought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Then, the Freeze—</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">‘The full moon of August is the last chance of a freeze,’ say long-time residents, but farmers and technicians are little inclined to expect freezing weather at this late date, when the winter is practically over here. But on August 6, the date of the full moon, a cold wave swept down from the Andes, through Mato Grosso and on into Sao Paulo, Parana and Santa Catarina. The thermometer dropped to twelve degrees below zero, Centigrade (ten degrees above zero, Fahrenheit). The coffee trees were in bud. It is estimated that this freeze and a second cold wave wiped out above five-sixths of the 1964 crop. The northern part of the state was hardest hit. Banana and other crops were also severely damaged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Finally, the Fire—</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The stage was set. What the drought did not dry up, the freeze finished. Parana was like a tinderbox. No one knows how it started, whether by firebugs, spontaneous combustion or fanners burning stubble off the land for spring planting, but the fire that started on August 30 and raged for three weeks on that parched land was quickly beyond human control. Twenty-two municipalities were affected. This was the worst fire in Parana's history, in fact, the worst in the history of any country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The dry leaves furnished perfect fuel for the hungry flames, which seemed never to be satisfied. All the timberland of this agricultural state was in danger of going up in smoke. Desperate farmers fought the flames bravely in an effort to save their farms and homes, but in many cases the giant flames won out. Many had to flee for their lives; some never made it. One truck loaded with thirty-three people trying to escape was reached by the flames. In the explosion that followed, twenty-two lost their lives. In Ortigueira, a short distance from Cidade Nova and one of the communities hardest hit, thirty-one victims were buried in a common grave. It was impossible to identify many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The fire, at first attracting little attention, soon became a public calamity. Help to combat the flames was offered by firemen and volunteers from other states. The number of fire fighters was estimated to be 10,000. United States fire-control experts were sent in to try to put out the giant fire. But the storm of flame rolled on, devastating everything in its path. Tongues of fire leaped across highways and rivers to start anew. Man seemed incapable of coping with it. When there was nothing more for it to devour, it calmed down. The smog caused by the fire was so heavy that commercial airline traffic had to be suspended in the stricken areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Industrias Klabin, the largest paper industry in South America, in the municipality of Tabagi, was directly in the path of the fire. Of its more than 250,000 acres of forest, considered the largest artificially planted woodland in the world, less than 150,000 acres remain intact. Twenty-five years of dedicated labor were required to grow this forest, partly natural, largely planted, and it will probably take another twenty years to replace the loss. The more than three thousand employees of the firm worked around the clock in an effort to save the factory in Cidade Nova. This was accomplished by clearing a two-mile lane around the city with the help of seventeen bulldozers from the State Department of Sao Paulo. Thus the town and the factory were saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Most of the fire fighting was concentrated on the towns, leaving the farms and forests to their fate when it was realized that it was impossible to stop the flames. In many instances frightened animals and reptiles, fleeing from the woods on fire, invaded the towns, thus adding to the terror of the inhabitants. Lack of rain for so many months greatly increased the fire menace in the towns and villages. The majority of the towns in the state most affected have poor fire equipment or none at all. In one town where fire broke out in a home the villagers had to form a bucket brigade and run to try to put out the blaze. They succeeded only after seven houses had been reduced to ashes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The dangerously low water supply also threatened the populace with typhus and other diseases. In some localities the authorities have inoculated the people as a precautionary measure against an epidemic. More than 60,000 vaccinations against smallpox and typhus have been applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Long-delayed rains began to fall at the end of the third week in September, thus putting an end to the greatest three-way tragedy in Brazilian history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">The Aftermath</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The attack by these three elements— drought, freeze and fire—has left in its wake almost a hundred known dead, hundreds injured and many thousands homeless and out of employment, not to mention incalculable destruction of domestic animals and material losses. Help is pouring in from all sides to the afflicted inhabitants of Parana. Money, seeds, clothing, food, medicaments and agricultural implements come from all parts of Brazil and from many foreign countries. The Peace Corps of the U.S. Embassy in Rio de Janeiro has been sending in fifteen tons of food and medicine daily. The physical needs of a stricken community are being taken care of in a marvelous display of solidarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Shattered hopes are part of the aftermath; for, after so extensive a disaster, many who have lost much or all of their material goods may also have lost hope. Despite the material help already provided, they may feel, ‘Why try again?’ They wonder what the future holds for them if they do try again. Only another calamity, causing them to lose what they treasure? So what is needed for many persons is incentive, encouragement and a hope to help them through the trying time now and into the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Many of Brazil’s stricken people are receiving needed encouragement and hope from Jehovah's witnesses, who, by turning them to Jehovah, “the God of all comfort,” give them hope to try again. With hope amazing things can be accomplished and incredibly great obstacles surmounted. And after these persons have reestablished themselves physically, they need not worry over an uncertain future—provided they do as Jesus Christ counseled: “Store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal.” Doing this, they can look forward to the future with assurance, knowing that neither fire nor freeze nor thieving men can take away this credit or goodwill with God, their real treasure.—2 Cor. 1:3; Matt. 6:20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">UNSCRIPTURAL RECIPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">• The American magazine FM </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fine Arts,</span><span class="font18"> an entertainment magazine of southern California, has an article in its issue of February, 1963, on “Restaurants.” The article says: &quot;There are many entrees, dishes and courses served in the restaurants of Los Angeles of French origin. The following are some of the more popular entrees and a simple explanation of each.” The recipe given for one of these “popular entrees,” apparently served in the aforementioned restaurants, is: &quot;Coq au Vin (young chicken cooked in wine). A young chicken is divided into six pieces. It is fried lightly in butter, together with some lean bacon, cut in dice, and an equal amount of fresh mushrooms. Mixed herbs and a chopped clove of garlic are added. It is sprinkled with good brandy and set afire. To this is added a pint of good red wine, Bordeaux or Burgundy. The sauce is then thickened with blood of the chicken and served very hot in a deep round dish with small slices of bread which have been browned in the oven.” Since God's Word commands Christians to abstain “from what is strangled and from blood,” this recipe, with the sauce thickened with blood, Is unscriptural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">(Acts 15:20, 29) Hence Christians going to such restaurants, whether in California or elsewhere, will want to keep In mind the possibility of such misuse of blood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Reason Along with the Bible Writer</span></p><img src="g_E_19631222_files/g_E_19631222-15.png" alt="" style="width:235pt;height:33pt;">
<p><span class="font25">M</span><span class="font20">ODERN translations of the Bible have done much to enhance appreciation and understanding of the wisdom contained in this inspired book. This does not mean, however, that, because the modem reader finds his Bible using words easily understood, everyone now comprehends the depth of significance behind them. No doubt many have found this to be the case, but even with an excellent Bible translation in their hand, perplexing problems still cause them to pause and wonder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">One of the reasons why this is so is that the reader is not always aware of the reasons behind the writing of the Bible book. It is beneficial to know something of the background of the writer and those immediately addressed and, on the basis of this knowledge, reason along with the Bible writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">As an example of this we might take the letters written by the apostle Paul to the Christians in Corinth. Paul was in Ephesus and the Corinthian brothers had written to ask him some questions, among them matters having to do with marriage. The apostle answers these particular points in the part of his reply that we now find at 1 Corinthians chapter 7. But can we take all he says as being authoritative? Some question this in view of Paul’s own words: “To the others I say, yes, I, </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">not the Lord ...&quot; </span><span class="font20">And again: “Now concerning virgins I have no command from the Lord, but </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">I give my opinion”</span><span class="font20"> What is this? Is Paul trying to tell us that he is merely expressing his own ideas and that we should not take his words as being written under inspiration? No, for he later assures us, “I certainly think I also have God’s spirit.” Then why does he seem to make an exception in the earlier verses mentioned? —1 Cor. 7:12, 25, 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Well, who is “the Lord” Paul is here speaking about? It is not Jehovah God, the Bible's inspirer, but the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul was well aware of the teachings of Jesus. For one thing, Matthew had already recorded many of these in his Gospel written about fourteen years earlier. Since the brothers did not question Jesus’ teachings, the logical thing for Paul and others to do when problems arose in the Christian congregation was to recall what Jesus had said or refer to earlier scriptures and quote these as authority. So when Paul says that it is not he, but the Lord, who is speaking, he is referring to Jesus’ words on the subject. (1 Cor. 7:10; Matt. 19:4-9) On the other hand, when he says it is not the Lord, but he, Paul, who is speaking, then he is not quoting Jesus but writing under inspiration by God’s spirit and his words here are no less authoritative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Not much later Paul wrote his second letter to this same congregation, but this time he had other matters to handle that required writing in a different vein. He must have expected the brothers themselves to be a little puzzled when they read his letter, and he requests them: “I wish you would put up with me in some little unreasonableness.” Was Paul an unreasonable man? Why would the Corinthians think he was? Well, it was because of the way he appeared to be boasting in this letter. This apparently boastful spirit is evident throughout all the latter part of the second epistle. But there was a very good reason for it. Paul states: “I have become unreasonable. You compelled me to, for I ought to have been recommended by you. For I did not prove to be inferior to your superfine apostles in a single thing, even if I am nothing.”—2 Cor. 11:1; 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">The Corinthian Christians were in danger. Among them there were some who were setting themselves up as being just as authorized to take the lead in<sub>:</sub> worship as the twelve apostles who had been appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ. These were “deceitful workers, transforming themselves </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">into apostles</span><span class="font20"> of Christ.” They were not apostles at all, but “superfine apostles” as Paul calls them sarcastically. They were doing much harm in the congregation, breaking down the respect that the brothers had for Paul and his teaching. “For, say they: ‘his letters are weighty and forceful, but his presence in person </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font20"> weak and his speech contemptible/ ” And here were the Corinthian brothers, Paul’s own “letters of recommendation,” apparently being persuaded by these men instead of recommending him and his work. Certainly they had compelled him to boast in order to reestablish his God-given authority. His boasting was by no means unreasonable under these circumstances, yet under other more normal circumstances it might have seemed so. —2 Cor. 11:13, 5, 16; 10:10; 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Apparently one of the reasons why these “superfine apostles” had attacked the authority of Paul was that he had worked as a mere tentmaker while he was among them rather than being supported by the financially solvent Corinthians. They were as much as saying that he was unworthy to receive material aid from them. Paul's answer to this charge might be difficult to understand if we did not discern his use of sarcasm to sting their conscience: “Did I commit a sin by humbling myself that you might be exalted, because without cost I gladly declared the good news of God to you? . . . Kindly forgive me this wrong.” (2 Cor. 11:7; 12:13) Of course, Paul knew that he had not sinned in this respect and he had no need to beg their forgiveness. Putting ourselves in his position and reasoning along with him makes the understanding of his words clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">What was the meaning of Paul’s earlier statement in chapter 5, verses 12 and 13: “For if we were </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">out of our mind,</span><span class="font20"> it was for God; if we are sound in mind, it is for you”? Was Paul out of his mind? Again his boasting may have made it seem so. But he had to boast “for God.” How could that be? Well, it was to prevent the Corinthians from being lost to God through their mistaken thinking, to recover them for God. But this may not have seemed to be so upbuilding for the brothers as would have been a </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">letter from Paul completely </span><span class="font20">devoted to giving them answers to their Bible questions. In other words, it would have been more beneficial for them if he had not had to spend his words in this necessary boasting, but rather could have dedicated his entire letter to other matters. If they had allowed him to write exclusively as one “sound in mind,” it would have been to their greater advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">These are but a few of the things that may at first seem very puzzling to the sincere Bible reader, but they illustrate how many of these difficulties resolve themselves by reasoning along with the writer, taking the entire context into consideration. It is wise and beneficial to investigate the prevailing circumstances behind the writing of each book before embarking on a verse-by-verse reading of it. We can be thankful that God has provided publications whereby this is possible. The time spent in making use of these, in personal research, is more than rewarded by the satisfaction of deeper understanding of the Word of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Test of Nerves</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&lt;$&gt; A disagreement over &quot;established procedure” on the autobahn in East Germany had a United States military convoy stalled for 41 hours. In notes to Moscow the West charged that the detention of a Berlin-bound convoy had been &quot;an inadmissible attempt to prejudice the Allied right of free access to Berlin.” Premier Khrushchev of the Soviet Union called it a &quot;test of nerves” and hinted to a group of American businessmen touring Russia that the incident raised the risk of war. &quot;Evidently it must be a test of nerves on your part,” said Khrushchev. &quot;When you decided to test our nerves, we decided in response to put our armored cars across the autobahn to test your nerves and see if you would start shooting or not And we were glad you didn't.” The convoy was allowed to continue; both sides claimed the other backed down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">New Government Recognized</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Less than a week after military officers in South Vietnam engineered the overthrow of President Ngo Dinh Diem’s regime, the United States extended its recognition to the new provisional government headed by Ngyuen Ngoc Tho. This swift U.S. action that took place on November 7 was preceded by similar recognition by the British.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">On November 12 the Southeast Asian kingdom of Cambodia notified the United States that it was renouncing both military and economic aid as of January 1, 1964. There were no indications, however, that Cambodia had also renounced aid from the Communist bloc nations. Indications were to the contrary, for five Chinese Communist experts were called into the nation to help organize &quot;state control.” At a news conference Prince Norodom Sihanouk stated that he realized his country would be poorer for renouncing American aid, but he added that it would also be &quot;more independent.” Cambodia is in a very strategic spot at present. It is bordered by South Vietnam, Thailand and Laos, all sensitive to developments in that part of the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">&lt;$&gt; On November 12 the Commerce Clearing House, a private U.S. reporting agency on tax and business laws, stated that Americans spent a record amount of eash on what the government calls &quot;luxuries.” The Federal tax collections on the items amounted to $105,-900,000,000. Taxes on liquor, gasoline and cigarettes accounted for more than half the $13,400,000,000 collected in excise taxes.</span></p>

Arnold Chase, assistant commissioner of the U.S, Bureau of Labor Statistics, said there is a lot of interest in this. Funeral costs, which will include the cost of the funeral service, coffin, and all the things that generally go with the service, will be added to food, rent, clothing and the other items in the bureau’s Consumer Price Index. The first funeral-cost figure will come out tn February. It will be based on January’s cost.</span></p>

A recent statistical report out from Katmandu shows Nepal has 1,620,000 water buffaloes, 2,820,000 oxen, 2,850,000 cows and 8,500,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">46th Anniversary</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&lt;$&gt; On November 7 Moscow’s Red Square was the scene of a new array of tanks, trucks, antimissile missiles and other military equipment. The parade marked the 46th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. Premier Khrushchev of the Soviet Union along with other Russian leaders viewed the massive display of arms from atop the Lenin Mauso. leum. Later, at a reception in the Kremlin, the Russian premier drank toasts and jibed that within seven years the Soviet Union would overtake the United States. Khrushchev declared: &quot;Before the Revolution Russia was a beggar. Now she has become the Soviet Union and a king in the land. From the lowest she has become the second country in the world, and in a maximum of seven years we will be first.” Western observers present at the reception expressed disappointment with the spirit of the occasion. &quot;Where is the spirit of Moscow?” asked United States ambassador to Russia Foy D. Kohler, He said that he did not hear a toast that he could drink to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Could Not Stand Civilization </span><span class="font18">$ In November 1961 the entire population of 263 persons was rescued from the bleak South Atlantic Island of Tristan da Cunha and brought to Great Britain to make a new life for themselves. The Island’s dormant volcano came alive and the evacuation became necessary. After two years of trying to adjust to modem man and his ways, the islanders finally decided that there was no use. So on October 24, 198 of them boarded the Dutch ship Bornholm to return to their home island. An advance group of 52 left in March, During the two years that they have been in Britain only some of the young folks came to like the ways of modern man, his rock ’n’ roll, movies and television. In the two years five of the islanders died, eight babies were born, twenty-four married, fourteen were remaining in England. Their main objection to life in Britain was the climate. They hated the British winters and were disappointed with the summers. They also disliked the traffic, telephones and television.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Friendship with Soviets</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&amp; Western leaders had hoped to capitalize on the seeming division between Red China and the Soviet Union. But the cleavage between the two Communist powers does not appear as great as some thought. On November 6 Communist China’s rulers stated that friendship between the Chinese and the Soviet peoples was &quot;eternal and unbreakable.” They, in faet, sent congratulatory messages to Premier Khrushchev stating that on the basis of Marxism and Leninism the Chinese people would work to uphold and strengthen Soviet-Chinese unity and the unity of the International Communist movement. A complete breakdown between the two powers appeared to be wishful thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">“Church Is Optional”</span></p>

Joseph M, Harte, bishop of Arizona, was quoted by the Phoenix, Arizona, </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gazette,</span><span class="font18"> October 16, as saying: &quot;To the great Majority of the world the church is optional.&quot; He added: ^The pluralist and secularist world looks upon us with the kind of respect we have for an aging maiden aunt.” &quot;So the great unanswered question of our age is ‘How can the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ be a significant force in our nation and in our world today?’ ” Perhaps that is what the Episcopal church is today—a little old lady, lost in the world’s downtown traffic, wondering which way to turn next. The bishop himself evidently had no direction to give to the convention delegates. His only suggestion, according to the </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gazette,</span><span class="font18"> was that a professional survey be taken to find out &quot;where we are and where we are going.” Instead of turning to surveys, the bishop would do well to turn to his Bible, for the answer lies there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">President Ben Bella</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">♦ Premier Ahmed Ben Bella was put into office by more than five million votes. The results of the election were officially announced on September 15. They showed that 6,581,340 were eligible to vote. The number who voted was 5,827,618. Ben Bella received 99.6 percent of the ballot, or 5,805,103 votes. As president of Algeria Ben Bella heads the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, the Armed Forces and the FLN, Algeria’s only political party. The new president said that in the coming year he would move fast toward socialism. In the field of foreign policy he pledged that Algeria would take a neutral course.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Assembly Line Ships</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Mass production has entered the shipbuilding trade. At Arendal, Sweden, is the world’s first assembly line shipyard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The ships are built in huge chunks. The sections, which weigh up to 300 tons, are placed on giant conveyors. Piece by piece the ship is put together in dry dock. When completed, the dock is flooded and the ship is sent to sea. Building time is cut in half and the quality is improved too, it is claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Vatican on Jesus’ Death</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">An official document to the Roman Catholic churchmen attending the Ecumenical Council in Rome stated that it was both wrong and harmful to blame the Jews for the death of Jesus, The document highlights the concern of the Vatican over the play “The Representative,” in Which Pope Plus XII is assailed for failure to denounce the Roman Catholic dictator Adolf Hitler for his destruction of some six million Jews. Zachariah Shuster, European director of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">American Jewish Committee, felt that “this Ecumenical Council may finally do away with the epithet ‘Christ-killer,* which was hurled upon Jews in so many countries in the past and present/’ However, it is not known how the Council will resolve the inspired text at Matthew 27:25, according to the Roman Catholic Douay Bible, which says: &quot;And the whole [Jewish] people answering, said: His blood be upon us and upon our children,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A Financial Success</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&lt;$&gt; In the first nine months of 1963 the General Motors Corporation of America reported net sales of $11,700,000,000 —the largest ever—with a profit over the one thousand million mark. The company paid over $1,000,000,000 in income taxes alone. Its car and truck sales exceeded all its previous records.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">Just three days before his death Jesus uttered this prophecy that was to find fulfillment during his second presence: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached </span><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">in all the inhabited earth</span><span class="font20"> for a witness to all the nations.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">Consider for a moment what would be necessary to fulfill these words. Think of the time, energy, money, manpower and organization involved, not to mention the willingness, determination and courage of the preachers! But since Jesus said that such Kingdom preaching would be done, and since the unparalleled events of this generation mark this as the time for it to be accomplished, the question arises, What is being done about it? More than you might realize. And since this preaching work involves the lives of all persons now living, you will greatly benefit by a view of its worldwide operations.
