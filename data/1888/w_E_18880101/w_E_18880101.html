<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">NOT A SINFUL LIKENESS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Briefly notice first some of the inconsistencies of this passage as it stands in the common version--&quot;In the likeness of sinful flesh.&quot;  Looked at one way the term &quot;sinful flesh&quot; would cast a reflection upon the Creator by intimating that humanity is sinful by nature, created so; whereas the Scriptures everywhere hold out the thought that man's nature was good, and that he is now bound by Sin's power or dominion, and that when man is set free from Sin and Death--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restored</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to original perfection--he will again be &quot;very good,&quot; as at first pronounced.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But suppose it were claimed that this passage refers to flesh (humanity) that had gotten into a state of sin, and suppose for argument's sake we admitted this to be its significance [which we really cannot admit except for the argument], still it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">would not prove</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> what the no-ransom advocates want to have proved.  Because for our Lord to take the likeness </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh which has become sinful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would still leave it an open question whether the likeness </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">before</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it had become sinful was meant, or the likeness </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it had become sinful.  Surely none will deny that the likeness of mankind to-day is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">human</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">likeness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor that Adam had the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">-- human likeness.  If the depraved race wanted to point out its likeness to-day, the finest, least depraved and least degraded specimen would be selected as a sample of human nature, as a sample of the nature which sinners are of.  And, if the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">best</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> living sample of our race would be selected to represent it, why should not the race (now sinful) look back to its first parent, Adam, who before sinning was perfect, and claim his likeness as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">its</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">real likeness,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which had since been marred by sin and death?  In thinking of the real likeness of human nature, to which nature human sinners belong, we should think of a likeness to properly represent our nature, no matter how degraded and fallen from that model, many, yea all of the race have now become.  Thus indeed our Lord was made in the likeness [nature] of sinful flesh--the nature which the sinful race is of--human nature.  He partook of that nature perfectly which in the sinners had become contaminated, imperfect, sinful.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Those who urge that our Lord was only like the race </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">after</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it was sinful, and chiefly like it in respect to the imperfections, should consider that Adam's form and flesh did not undergo so great a change in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">moment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of disobedience, that the original likeness before sin, could be disclaimed for him.  Hence, when first Adam became a sinner by disobedience, before sentence was pronounced upon him, and before he began in the slightest degree to be imperfect, there was one example of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> under control of the great enemy Sin, which was perfect flesh and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">best</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> example of humanity, whose likeness our Lord took: in fact the only example and true representative of manhood.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But note another absurdity the false theory would involve:  Though the flesh or nature is all one, and has one standard of perfection, or one likeness, the sinfulness varies in degree; some of the race being more degraded and depraved by sin than others.  Now will those who want this passage to read that our Lord was made in a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful likeness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of flesh, please tell us just how sinful, how imperfect he was, seeing that if we are looking at the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> likeness of flesh [of humanity] there is such an infinite variety of gradation?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Bold as many seem to be on this subject, few probably would have the temerity to say that our Redeemer was like the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">most</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> like the most debased and degraded in mind and body; and yet this they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">must</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> claim, else their theory falls.  Because any argument or theory that would require that our Lord should be a sinner at all, would require that he be as depraved and degraded as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">most</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sin-polluted. For, denying his ransom work, and therefore ignoring the necessity for him to be as sinless as the one for whom he became the substitute was before sin entered, and ignoring the fact that he is a pattern and example, not to sinners, but to justified believers, and that it is not like unto sinners, but &quot;like unto his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brethren&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that he was tempted: ignoring all this, we say, they must claim that our Lord had an experience like that of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> fallen wretch in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> particular, and that the only work he did while here was to get </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that kind</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of experience; hence as shown in July and August TOWERS they are forced to claim that our Lord underwent all the depraved feelings and thoughts of all libertines, drunkards, thieves and thugs, or else their theory falls. How preposterous, absurd and almost blasphemous is such a view.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And how inconsistent to claim that one who &quot;knew no sin,&quot; and who, even before he was anointed, from earliest childhood showed no sign of evil, and who was miraculously born so as to be separate from the race of sinners, and who was referred to before his birth as &quot;that holy thing&quot; (`Luke 1:35`), how unreasonable to claim that this being had the worst and most depraved disposition of any member of the human race ever born into the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If our Lord did no sin, he certainly lacked that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful likeness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> common to sinners, but he could be without sin and have in its perfection that human likeness or nature which all sinners share, though in a degraded state.  Could one be said to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sinners, who never sinned?  No, our Lord was unlike sinners in respect to sin, imperfection, etc., but like them in the sense of having their same </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nature</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or flesh, he having it in its perfection, they in various degrees of imperfection through sin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the following article we will show that whatever support was thought to be given by this mistranslated text, to the idea that our Lord was imperfect, a sinner, is removed by a proper translation of the passage.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;IN THE LIKENESS OF SINFUL FLESH.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">`ROMANS 8:3`.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We note with regret that the above text as it stands is favorable to the &quot;no ransom views,&quot; and is being used to prove that our Lord, when he became a man, had a body full of sinful weakness and imperfections, or as they hold it to mean, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">just like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sinful, fallen, depraved humanity. This suits the ideas of the no-ransom theorists exactly; for if he were imperfect, he could not be a ransom or corresponding price for the first perfect man</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R998 : page 1::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">who sinned, and was condemned, and we in him.  But those who thus claim that our Lord was imperfect, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> overlook the fact that if their claim were true, our Lord could not keep the Law, under which he was born, and by which he was proved perfect and worthy of the high exaltation to the divine nature. They seem to forget that the Law was the full measure of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> man's ability, and that if he had been in the least degree imperfect, our Lord could not have kept it, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">could not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have been justified to life under and by it.  Hence if our Lord had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> his coming into the world was useless; for under such circumstances he could neither have set a perfect example, nor could he have redeemed the condemned sinners.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the no-ransom theorists would perhaps claim that he did not need to be free from sin, nor to give a ransom (a corresponding price) for the first perfect man who had sinned; and that his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was perfect,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they cannot deny.  When we ask them, How could </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> obey the perfect Law of God fully and set an example to others, they would perhaps answer: Oh! he had divine help; he had the indwelling of the holy spirit to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">help</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">him,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and to enable him to overcome his sinful flesh.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we reply, that takes away all the virtue or honor of our Lord as an overcomer. If his flesh was sinful and sin-disposed as that of other men, and he overcame the world by outside help merely, then he has no honor whatever; and justice would suggest that he should not have been highly exalted and honored above angels, for what he did not do, but for what was merely done in him by God's overmastering power.  Indeed, if this theory be true, we see neither </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">merit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the part of our Lord Jesus to be rewarded, nor any necessity for his coming into the world at all.  For surely if God merely took possession of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and worked out results totally different from what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful flesh</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> itself was capable of, there was no need of specially bringing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">that</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sinful flesh into the world where there was too much of that sort already.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R998 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">And it would have been far more like the divine economy to have used and acted upon </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">some other</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sinful flesh as a pattern and example.  Indeed, if this were God's object and plan, we cannot question that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of some man who had lived for a time in sin, and thus proved that he had sinful flesh, would have been far more powerful as an illustration of how God could </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">change</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and force a man to do his will.  So, then, if another sinful flesh could have done as well or better, where was the necessity for our Lord's coming in the flesh at all?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But further, while we do not claim that God could not so force any man, but merely that he does not and never has so forced any--and challenge proof to the contrary--yet we ask, If it is a question only of an indwelling divine power, forcing sinful flesh into harmony with the divine will, where was the necessity for specially making an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">example</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of it, either in our Lord Jesus, or in any other </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Why not rather let the holy power </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">force</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ALL sinful flesh at once?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But further examination of these errors on this line we trust is unnecessary.  We now proceed to show that opposers of the Bible doctrine that our Lord was holy and free from sin, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">separate</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from sinners, and gave his holy, perfect manhood a sacrificial ransom </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(corresponding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> price) for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Adam (whose sin involves his race), are mistaken when they use this text (&quot;In the likeness of sinful flesh&quot;) for the support of their theory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are surprised that some whose knowledge of the Greek should protect them from falling into such an error, have not more carefully and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">critically</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> noted this passage.  A failure to note the fact that the apostle throughout this entire discourse treats of sin as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">personality,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [This we showed at length in May '87 TOWER, article, &quot;The body of sin to be destroyed.&quot;] is the cause of this error, but this cannot excuse critical students of the Greek text, which is most explicit.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Greek word here rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartia.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It occurs 174 times in the New Testament, yet is only this once improperly translated by our English </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">adjective</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sinful.  The Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> should always be translated as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">substantive,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> SIN, not as an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">adjective,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> SINFUL; and it is so treated by the translators in every instance of its 174 occurrences, except this one text.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Greek has another word to represent our adjective sinful, namely, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartolos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and every other occurrence of the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the New Testament except the one above noted (`Rom. 8:3`), which is a mistranslation, comes from the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartolos.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As instances of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartolos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> properly translated by the adjective </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> see `Mark 8:38`, `Luke 5:8`; `24:7` and `Rom. 7:13`. The last instance shows conclusively that the apostle knew what he was about when using those two words, and did not misuse the one for the other; and be it noted that in the one verse he there uses </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> three times as a substantive SIN, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartolos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> once as an adjective, SINFUL. We quote--&quot;But sin </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[hamartia]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that it might be shown to be sin </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[hamartia,]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by working death to me by that which is good;--that through the commandment, sin </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[hamartia]</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> might become exceeding sinful </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[hamartolos&quot;].</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Rom. 7:13`.) Surely this illustration makes the subject clear to even an ordinary English student, and should convince all that the translation of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hamartia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the adjective sinful in `Rom. 8:3` is wholly wrong and inexcusable; it should be there as elsewhere translated as a substantive, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So, then, though the translators erred grievously in this case, and have furnished the only (apparent) prop to the theory that Christ was a sinner, yet, God duly provides the needed helps, so that no member of the true body need stumble, showing us clearly the error of the translators as above.  The Lord promises that none shall be tempted above that they are able to bear, and that if the test of faith were too weighty for us, he would provide a way of escape.  And surely those who have misrepresented this text, owe a duty to God, to the truth, and to any whom they have mistaught, concerning the text in question.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But some unfamiliar with the rules of grammar may not see the importance of the change from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sinful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the above text.  To such the changed phraseology may imply little, and they may read, &quot;In the likeness of flesh of sin,&quot; the proper translation,* and think of it as meaning the same as &quot;In the likeness of sinful flesh.&quot;  Let us therefore help them to distinguish.  The common and erroneous translation, &quot;sinful flesh,&quot; implies that human nature [flesh] is a sinful nature, which is not true; for human nature [flesh] as God created it was perfect, and was pronounced by the Creator &quot;very good;&quot; and over it sin had no control. Human nature [flesh] came under the influence, control, or dominion of sin, which Paul in this and the three preceding chapters personifies as a tyrant, reigning over, and ruling in all flesh.  He speaks of this tyrant Sin's law and the captivity in which he (the tyrant Sin) </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> holds all flesh as slaves: he tells of how we who were once the slaves of this great tyrant, have been made </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">free</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from his control, and from respect to his law, penalty, etc., and have enlisted as slaves or bond-servants under God's Son, our Redeemer and new Captain, and are now voluntarily under his law and pledged to fight against and lay down even life itself in this conflict against our former enslaver and tyrant, Sin.  In `Rom. 7:23 to 8:3` the Apostle is telling how our deliverance from this tyrant, Sin, was accomplished.  The Law given to Israel failed to deliver them, and could no more deliver us, from this tyrant who had gotten such a hold upon us that the flesh [human nature] was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">too</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">weak</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to resist it.  Hence when the Law Covenant pointed out to Israel a road back to harmony with God and to the service of righteousness, they found themselves so </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">weak</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as to be unable to resist the &quot;law of Sin,&quot; their captor, so that the best they could do was to mentally acknowledge God's dominion, and show the loyalty of their wills toward God by resisting as much as possible, which was but little, the law of the tyrant, Sin.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then the Apostle thanks God that though not accomplished by the Law, given at Sinai, yet our release is otherwise and effectually accomplished through Jesus Christ our Lord.  What the Law was powerless to accomplish for us, because our flesh was too weak to withstand the tyranny of Sin, God accomplished for us, by sending his Son in the likeness of the flesh of Sin </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the likeness of humanity, which the tyrant Sin possessed control of] and because of Sin [sin's power over us].  [Thus God] condemned Sin [our tyrant, not humanity] through [or in] the flesh [Christ's flesh, given as our ransom].</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But how, in what sense, did God through Christ's flesh condemn the tyrant Sin?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We answer, man, as originally created, was a free agent, and voluntarily rendered himself Sin's servant, and was soon enslaved to Sin.  God had arranged before the fall that man might serve either of two masters, Righteousness or Sin, and that he should surely receive the wages of whichever one he served.  So long as he did serve Righteousness the pay was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">life,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which would have continued, had he continued in its service.  But when, in disobedience, he became the servant of Sin, its wages, death, were also sure.  And though he did not like the wages, and would have fled to the former master, Righteousness, Sin held him, and had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to hold him until the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wages</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (death) should be fully paid.  And since the wages</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R999 : page 2::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">cost man his life, he was hopelessly bound both for time and eternity.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This slavery to Sin and his servant Death, was the wretched condition of all humanity when God sentenced or condemned to overthrow, the tyrant Sin, as having no longer legal right to reign over the redeemed flesh--mankind, which is officially declared to be emancipated, freed from his dominion.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But in what way did God do this?  And why did he for thousands of years permit Sin and Death to rule and ruin the race, if he could justly condemn and remove them from dominion over mankind?  If they had a recognized </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to hold and oppress man (their voluntary slave) for four thousand years, how can God </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> set aside their authority now?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Ah yes!  Sin and Death did reign from Adam to Moses, when the Law came apparently to help mankind.  And as it helped none, Sin and Death still reigned as high handed as ever, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">until</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God sent his Son in the likeness of the flesh (humanity) which Sin had captivated; in the likeness of Adam, the very </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who voluntarily became Sin's servant and involved his posterity as those born in slavery.  And it was through this one who himself </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;knew</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> no sin,&quot; but who by willingly receiving the penalty or wages of sin on behalf of the enslaved and sentenced race, as their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> proclaimed liberty to the captives and sentenced the dominion of Sin and death to an overthrow. The wages being paid, Sin and Death no longer have authority over the redeemed, ransomed race.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let go the prisoner from the pit, [the tomb] for I have found a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the sentence or condemnation of God against the rule of this personified power, Sin. The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;condemned&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `Rom. 8:3` is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">katakrino,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and is the same used in `Heb. 11:7` with reference to the overthrow of the world of Antediluvians; and it is the same word that Peter uses (`2 Pet. 2:6`) when speaking of Sodom, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Condemned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with an overthrow.&quot;  So Sin and Death were condemned or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sentenced</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to overthrow, by reason of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> given for the slaves over whom they reign.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God's due time for condemning Sin by redeeming its captives, was nearly two thousand years ago; and the due time for putting the sentence into </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">execution,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dethroning this tyrant, and breaking up his prison house, is now just at hand--the Millennial age.  Right speedily he who redeemed all, and whose right it consequently is to release all, will take his great power and reign, enforcing the liberation of all captives, and granting to all a new opportunity to become again the servants of Righteousness, and receive its reward of life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Though Sin still reigns over and holds in slavery our race, those who believe in Christ's ransom know that it no longer has a right to reign, that its </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">authority</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is cancelled now, that it is CONDEMNED and is now only a usurper without real authority; that its slaves have been officially emancipated and soon will be actually released by the great Deliverer.  The Apostle urges that we no longer recognize this tyrant from whose dominion God through Christ hath set us free.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not Sin therefore have dominion over you, but as you once obeyed it now obey Christ, your new Ruler, who promises to fully deliver you back to your original master Righteousness whose wages is life.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So, then, our Lord who was made flesh when he partook of the flesh nature--human nature--partook not of imperfect flesh, partook not of fallen flesh, but was holy and separate from sinners, yet took the likeness of the flesh lorded over and enslaved by sin (humanity), and was not like any of the imperfect or depraved specimens of that race, but like the original and only proper perfect specimen of it--Adam, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">he was</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when he first became Sin's slave.  To have been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">less</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than that first perfect slave through whom Sin first gained control of all, would have prevented our Redeemer from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeeming</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;those captives, by giving the ransom </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[corresponding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> price] for all.&quot; (`1 Tim. 2:4-6`). By the way, the no-ransom teachers have never attempted to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">analyze</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> nor to disprove or twist this or the other texts which tell of our ransom: Nor can it be shown that any other than a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could be a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">corresponding</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> price for Adam, through whom came condemnation and death.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ADVICE TO THE SAINTS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Keep in touch with Christ.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Avoid the spirit of fault-finding, criticism, uncharitableness, and anything inconsistent with His perfect love.  Go where He is most likely to be found, either where two or three of His children are gathered, or where the lost sheep is straying.  Ask Him to wake you morning by morning for communion and Bible-study.  Make other times in the day, especially in the still hour of evening twilight, between the work of the day and the avocations of the evening, when you shall get alone with Him, telling Him all things, and reviewing the past under the gentle light that streams from His eyes.&quot;</font><br />

Her friend, wishful to pass her into the better life of consecration, placed before her a blank sheet of paper, and pressed her to write her name at the foot, and then to lay it before God in prayer.  She did so and at once entered this blessed life.  Are you willing to do this?  Are you prepared to sign your name to a blank sheet of paper and then hand it over to God, for Him to fill in as He pleases?  If not, ask Him to make you willing and able to do this and all things else.  You will never be happy until you let the Lord Jesus keep the house of your nature, closely scrutinizing every visitor and admitting only His friends.  He must reign.  He must have all or none.  He must have the key of every closet, of every cupboard, and of every room.  Do not try to make them fit for Him.  Simply give Him the key. And He will cleanse and renovate and make beautiful.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Selected.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ABOUT HELL.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;I don't care to think about the awful place,&quot; says one, &quot;for I don't expect to go there--I have no interest in it.&quot;  Yet, if the &quot;orthodox&quot; view of it be true, that all except the saints of God go there,-- that it is the penalty for Adam's sin, that all of Adam's posterity are under that penalty except those few </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faithful believers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in Christ who escape it, then it follows that you, and I, and all, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ought to be</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> deeply interested in finding out all we can about that which is represented as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">surest</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and most </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">awful,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and most </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">general</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> calamity to which our poor race is exposed.  If you and I do expect to escape, we should be anxious on behalf of the others; for in proportion to the world's population even in this enlightened day, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faithful believers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in Christ</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are but as one out of a thousand.  Nor will it do to excuse one's self with the idea that &quot;My friends and relations will all escape.&quot;  You know that many, yea </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">most</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of your friends and relatives are not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faithful believers;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and as you look back over the pages of history, it is not a great way back that you find your great-great-grandparents were heathen idolaters who knew not of the Redeemer, and hence could not have been justified </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in him.  Besides, are not all mankind our relatives? and are not all brethren?--children of one common father--Adam?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Subjects like slavery, intemperance, pestilence, or epidemics affecting only a part of the human family, we would and should, as we do, see hundreds, yes thousands, of men and women spending time and talent and money in examining, and arranging for the relief and safety of their fellows.  Yet there is no comparison between human slavery, etc., and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">everlasting</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">torture</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in misery and anguish, which human tongue, we are told, cannot describe. The most terrible human sufferings of the present, which soon end life and thus bring relief, are really pleasurable moments in comparison to what we are told of hell, which besides will never end while the years of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eternity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> roll.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now what is being done about this monstrous evil before which all others combined pale into insignificance-- anything?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Oh yes, there are thousands of clergymen who are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">supposed to have studied all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">about this awful subject,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> who weekly meet with about </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">two</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> millions of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fourteen</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hundred</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> millions of the earth's present population, to consider this very subject which they claim is all-important.  They meet in comfortable and elegant buildings, expensively attired, and are entertained by music and oratory, and if the subject they claim as the all-important </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cause</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of their assembling is mentioned AT ALL, it is to assure the hearts of those present that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> have nothing to fear; for though God will deal most awfully with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">others,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he will deal kindly with them, and instead of delighting to torture </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to all eternity, God will be glad to have such genteel people as attend their entertaining church services and participate in the usual suppers, fairs, etc., to adorn heaven.  Why will God thus favor </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Not because of good </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">works,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they admit; nor because of great </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we would claim, for they know little of God or his Word, and hence cannot believe much or firmly. Their hopes must therefore be built mainly upon their morality, because they are refined and not vulgar, and specially </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they have joined a sect</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and assented to a creed which they do not know, nor understand, nor believe--in a word because they are thus acting a lie with a form of godliness without the real power thereof. Do these people really believe</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THIS AWFUL DOCTRINE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">concerning hell?  Surely not!  To us their </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">actions</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> speak, louder than words.  They even count the Salvation Army people fools and fanatics, because they, poor creatures, less intelligent, less learned, BELIEVE the story of the clergy about this awful place they describe hell to be, and honestly act out their belief.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of all the people in the world to-day who profess to believe this awful doctrine of eternal torment, the &quot;Salvation Army&quot; alone acts reasonably and consistently. And their wildest freaks and fancies are tame compared with what might be expected if they were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fully</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> convinced of the truth of the doctrine.  The men and women who have ever </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fully believed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the doctrine, are undoubtedly those hundreds who have gone insane from sympathy with their fellows; the effort to save others from everlasting torture unbalanced their reason.  We cannot imagine any sincere believer of this terrible doctrine going from day to day about the ordinary affairs of life, or meeting quietly in elegance every Sunday to hear an essay from some of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">peculiar</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> servants of the truth on the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">peculiar subjects</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> often advertised, really believing all the time that at the rate of one hundred a minute fellow mortals are dying, and entering</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;That lone land of deep </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">despair,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> where</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     &quot;No God regards their bitter prayer.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">They could not complacently sit there and think of those hurrying every moment into that awful state described by the good, well-meaning, but terribly deluded man John Watts (whose own heart was infinitely warmer and larger than that he ascribed to the great Jehovah), when he wrote that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sweet</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hymn, which, thank God, sensible people have ceased to love and almost ceased to sing:--</font><br />
<br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Tempests of angry fire shall roll</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To blast the rebel worm,</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And beat upon the naked soul</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In one eternal storm.&quot;</font></tt><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Surely men and women </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thus would rush frantically to the heathen and to all unbelievers everywhere, and would describe hell and make people </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">join their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">churches</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or set them crazy with fear, or both.  Mothers, fathers, and children have become insane from anguish, when their loved ones have been caught in a burning building, though they knew that their pain would endure but a few minutes, yet they pretend to believe that God is less loving than they, and that He can look with indifference, if not with delight, at the billions of his creatures enduring an eternity of torture far more terrible, which he prepares for them and prevents any escape from, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forever.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Not only so, but they expect they will get literally into Abraham's bosom, and will then look across the gulf and see and hear the agonies of the multitudes some of whom they now love and weep over and will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">so changed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (become so like </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> present idea of God), so hardened against all pity and so barren of love and sympathy that they will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">delight</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in God and in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this plan.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is wonderful that otherwise sensible looking and acting men and women, who love their fellows, establish hospitals, orphanages, asylums and societies for the prevention of cruelty to even the brute creation, are so unbalanced mentally that they can believe and subscribe to such a doctrine, and yet be so indifferent about investigating the subject of &quot;everlasting torture.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Only one exception can we think of, --those who hold the ultra-Calvinistic doctrine; who believe that God has </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">decreed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">it thus,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that all the efforts they could put forth could not alter the result with a single person, and that all the prayers they could offer would not change that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">awful plan</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they believe God has marked out for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">His</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> eternal pleasure. These indeed could sit still, so far as effort for their fellows is concerned, but why </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sing the praises</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of such a God and such a plan?  These who hold this view of their own </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unconditional</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unalterable</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">election,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> could surely afford to be honest, since they think that they could not be rejected.  Why should not these, instead of singing the praises of such a plan and keeping quiet, hide their faces in shame for their God, and express their true heart-sympathy for the people, and instead of singing, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">weep</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and lament.  It would be far more creditable to their faith and their hearts;--would it not?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Why not rather begin to doubt the self-exalted clergy, and to wonder whether this &quot;doctrine of devils,&quot; this blasphemy against the great God, was not hatched in the &quot;dark ages,&quot; when a crafty priesthood thought it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">godly to do evil,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that good might result?  The doctrine of eternal torment was introduced by Papacy to compel pagans to join her system and support her priesthood.  It flourished at the same time that &quot;bull fighting&quot; and gladiatorial contests were the public amusement most enjoyed, when the Crusades were called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;holy wars,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and when men and women were called &quot;heretics&quot; and slaughtered, for thinking or speaking contrary to the teachings of Papacy; at a time when the sun of gospel truth was obscure, when the Word of God had fallen into disuse and was prohibited to be read by any but the clergy, whose </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">love</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of their neighbors was often shown in torturing heretics to induce them to recant and deny their faith and their Bibles--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to save</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">them if possible,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they explained, from the more awful future of heretics, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">eternal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> torture. They did not borrow this doctrine from the heathens, for no heathen people in the world have a doctrine half so terrible, cruel, fiendish and unjust.  Find it, whoever can, and show it up in all its blackness, that if possible it may be shown that the essence of barbarism, malice, hate and ungodliness, has not been </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">exclusively</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> appropriated by those whom God has most highly favored with light from every quarter, to whom God has committed the holy oracle--His Word. Oh! the shame and confusion of face that will cover many even good men (who verily thought that they did God service while propagating this misrepresentation of the devil) when they awake in the resurrection to learn of the love and justice of God, and when they shall come to know that the Bible for which some of them would lay down their lives, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">does not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">teach</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> this God-dishonoring, love-extinguishing, truth-beclouding, saint-hindering, sinner-hardening, damnable heresy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But we repeat that in the light and moral development of this day, sensible people </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">do not believe</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> this doctrine.  However, since they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">think</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the Bible teaches it, every step they progress in real intelligence and godlikeness of mind, which hinders such belief, is in most cases a step away from God's Word which they falsely accuse of this teaching.  Hence this second crop of evil fruit, which the devil's engraftment of this error is producing. The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">intelligent,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> honest thinkers are thus driven from the Bible into vain philosophies and sciences, falsely so-called, and into skepticism.  Nor do the &quot;worldly&quot; really believe this doctrine.  It does not restrain from crime: theft, murder, suicide, immorality and drunkenness are more common by far in the countries where this doctrine is taught, than in other lands.  Mohammedan and Buddhist countries are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">much</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> more moral than those misnamed &quot;Christendom.&quot;  True, some instances are known, where murderers nearing death's door under pressure of fear or sickness </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">confess a faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> under the teaching that to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doubt it</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is to make sure the getting of it.  But their lives of disregard, as well as their profanity, show that if this doctrine ever restrained men, it does not now.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, did the error not do </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">real good?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Have not many been brought into the churches by the preaching of this doctrine in the past?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">No error, we answer, ever did </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">real good,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but always harm.  Those whom error brings into a church, and whom the truth would not move, are an injury to the church.  The thousands which this doctrine forced into Papacy, terrorized, but not at heart converted, which swelled her numbers and her wealth, diluted what little truth was held before, and mingled it with their unholy and ignorant sentiments, so that to meet the changed condition of things, the &quot;clergy&quot; found it needful to add error to error, and to resort to methods, forms, etc., not taught in the Scriptures and useless to the truly converted whom the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> controls. Among these were pictures, images, beads, vestments, candles, grand cathedrals, altars, etc., to help the unconverted heathen to a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">form of godliness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> more nearly corresponding to his former heathen worship.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The heathen were not benefited, for they were still heathen in God's sight, deluded into aping what they did not understand or do from the heart.  They were tares to choke the wheat without being profited thereby themselves.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The same is true of those brought under the name Christian to-day, who are not really at heart converted by the truth, but merely frightened by the error, or allured by promised earthly advantages of a social or business kind.  Such add nothing to the true church; by their ideas and manners they become stumbling blocks to the truly consecrated, and by their numbers and their inability to digest the truth, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">real food</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the saints, they lead even the few true pastors to defraud the true sheep in order to satisfy the demands of these goats for something pleasing to their unconverted tastes.  No, in no way has this error accomplished good, but in every way harm.  Let us now inquire:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R1000 : page 4::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WHAT SAITH THE BIBLE ABOUT HELL?</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Seeing then the unreasonableness of man's view, let us leave human creeds and dogmas and come to the oracle of God, that we may hear his own word on this subject, convinced fully that:--</font><br />
<br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Blind prejudice is sure to err</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And scan his word in vain;</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;God is his own interpreter</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And he will make it plain.&quot;</font></tt><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the first place, let none forget that the Bible was not inspired in the English language, that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">inspired</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Scriptures which &quot;holy men wrote and spoke as they were moved by the holy Spirit&quot; were written --the Old Testament in the Hebrew and the New Testament in the Greek language. We know further, that the translators were not inspired of God so as to prevent mistakes creeping in; for all scholars recognize some mistakes in the English translations.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, admitting that the translators were honest men who reverently desired to serve God and the church by giving English readers a faithful translation from the original, yet all who have a knowledge of more than one language, and who have ever tried translating from one to another, well know they had a difficult task, the range of both languages making it often possible to translate a word by any one of several words, all having slightly different shades of meaning; besides which the idiomatic differences, the peculiarities in the construction of sentences in both languages, must be taken into account. This makes it necessary for a translator to frequently use </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his judgment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> both in deciding which of several words he had best use, and also as to their arrangement to faithfully reproduce the original thought. And, if the translators have certain false ideas </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fixed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in their minds, they are almost sure at times to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">color</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> their renderings, without wrong intention.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, no matter how little </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is talked, or thought, or sung about to-day, there is no other point of doctrine more firmly </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">held</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by Christian people, who feel sure that to deny hell would be to deny the Bible, and yet who know little about what the Bible says about hell.  So, in coming to the English Bible to examine the subject, do not forget to exercise charity toward the translators when we show that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their translation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has helped forward the wrong ideas generally held. You will be far more justifiable in feeling unthankful toward the &quot;pastors&quot; and &quot;shepherds,&quot; whom you have for years helped to support and educate, who [the educated] </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the errors of the translators, and who yet deliberately cover and hide those errors from the people who are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">paying them for the information.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  They have kept back the truth about </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for several reasons: First, there is a sort of understanding, or etiquette among them, as among physicians, that if they wish to maintain their standing in the &quot;profession&quot; they &quot;must not tell tales out of school&quot;--must not divulge professional secrets to the &quot;common people&quot;--the &quot;laity.&quot;  Secondly, they all fear that to let it be known that they had been teaching an unscriptural doctrine for years, would bring disgrace and disreverence upon the &quot;clergy,&quot; and unsettle the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">confidence</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the laity in their wisdom--and O how much depends upon confidence and reverence for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">men,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when God's Word is so generally ignored.  Thirdly, they </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that many of the members of their sects are not constrained by &quot;the love of Christ,&quot; (`2 Cor. 5:14`), but merely by the fear of hell, and they see clearly therefore that to let the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be known, would soon cut loose the names and the dollars of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">many</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in their flocks; and this, to those who desire to make a fair show in the flesh (`Gal. 6:12`), would be terrible in the extreme.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nevertheless, it has for some years been seen that knowledge is increasing among the people (`Dan. 12:4`), and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Revised</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> English Version&quot; of the Bible was gotten out--in great part to patch up this hell doctrine.  But they had not the courage to come out and give a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">correct</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">translation:</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that, as we have shown, would be too serious a matter to be thought of; so they merely </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">refused</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to translate the word at all, and put the Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hades</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> into the English text. They well knew that the English reader would know little difference between </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hades</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and would soon come to use them as synonymous.  And this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">is</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the case.  They feel, however, that they have justified themselves before men, by their course, though they never explain the meaning of the Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hades;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but by their use of the word, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">without saying</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">so directly,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they give their confiding flocks to understand that it means a place of torture, a lake of fire.  But what will be the judgment of the Great Jehovah whose character and plan are traduced by the blasphemous doctrine which this mistranslated word helps to support? Will he commend them?  Will he justify their course?  Will the Chief Shepherd call these his beloved &quot;friends&quot;?  Will he make known unto them his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">further</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> plans (`John 15:14`), that they may misrepresent them also, to preserve their own dignity and reverence?  Will he continue to send forth &quot;things new and old,&quot; &quot;meat in due season&quot; to the household of faith, by the hand of these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unfaithful</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> servants?  Nay, such shall not continue to be his mouthpieces: he will spew them out of his mouth. (`Rev. 3:16`.)  He will choose instead, as at the first advent, from among the laity--&quot;the common people&quot; --mouthpieces, and will give them words which none of the chief priests shall be able to gainsay or resist. (`Luke 21:15`.) And as foretold, &quot;the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.&quot; --`Isa. 29:9-19`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Consider first then:--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HELL IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> occurs thirty-one times in the Old Testament, and in every instance it is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sheol</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the Hebrew.  It does not mean a lake of fire and brimstone, nor anything at all resembling that thought: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not in the slightest degree!</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Quite the reverse: instead of a place of blazing fire it is described in the context as a state of &quot;darkness;&quot; instead of being a place where shrieks and groans are heard, it is described in the context as a place of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;silence;&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instead of representing in any sense pain and suffering, or remorse, the context describes it as one of forgetfulness, where there is no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;knowledge&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;work&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;remembrance.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The meaning of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sheol</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is, THE HIDDEN STATE, as applied to man's condition in death; in and beyond which all is hidden, except to the eye of faith: hence by proper and close association the word was often used in the sense of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grave</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tomb,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the hidden place, or place beyond which only those who have the enlightened eye of the understanding can see resurrection, restitution of being.  And be it particularly noted, that this very same word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sheol,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">pit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grave</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thirty-four times in our common version by the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">same translators*</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--more times than it is translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and twice where it is translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it seemed so absurd, according to the at </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> accepted meaning of the word hell, that in modern Bibles the publishers explain in the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">margin</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that it means </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">grave.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">   See `Isa. 14:9` and `Jonah 2:2`.  In the latter case, the HIDDEN STATE, or grave, was the belly of the fish in which Jonah was buried alive, and from which he cried to God.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   *To the credit of the translators of the Common Version (the King James Version) it should be stated that the English word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has gradually come to have a very different meaning from what it once had, and that when used by them in the sixteenth century, the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> still retained much of its </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">original meaning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which made it a fair equivalent for the Greek and Hebrew words they used it to translate.  There is no such excuse, however, for modern translators and teachers, for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">original</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">meaning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has entirely passed from the word, except as found occasionally in old books, giving place to the &quot;hell</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> idea.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is Anglo Saxon, and in old English usage meant </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the place of concealment</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the hidden, or secret, or covered place.  Its transitive verb was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hele</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hill</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> meaning to hide, to conceal, to cover, to roof.  In old English books you will find numerous instances of the use of this word, in connection with roofing of houses, planting, hilling, hiding, etc.  To hele a house did not mean to burn it, or torture it, but to cover or thatch it; to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hele</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> their potatoes did not mean to burn them, but to conceal them in a pit; and so likewise when men were </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> there was no thought of fire, torture and pain, but of covering, concealing, etc.  Both good and bad were thus </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heled</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or buried.</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Conceal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the corresponding word from the Latin. See Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, under hell, hele, hill and conceal.  From this it will be seen that the use of the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by the translators of the King James' Version, was at a time when the word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hell</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> had not so utterly changed its meaning as at present.  Yet modern translators and ministers, who well know that the word hell, as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> used, does not cover the thought of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hades</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Greek, or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sheol</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Hebrew, refuse to enlighten their credulous flocks.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   This parable, recorded in `Luke 16:19-31`, is generally regarded as being the utterance of our Lord (though nothing is said of his having uttered it), and we so regard it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The great difficulty with many is, that though they call it a parable, they reason on it, and draw conclusions from it, as though it were a literal statement and not a parable.  To think of it as a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">literal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">statement</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> involves quite a number of absurdities: for instance, that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rich man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> went to hell because he had enjoyed many earthly blessings and gave nothing but crumbs to Lazarus.  Not a word is said about his wickedness.  Again, Lazarus is blessed, not because he is a sincere child of God, full of faith and trust--not because he was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but simply because he was </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">poor and sick.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  If this be understood literally, the only logical lesson to be drawn from it is, that unless you are a poor beggar, full of sores, you will never enter into future bliss, and if now you wear any </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;fine linen&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and &quot;purple&quot; and have plenty to eat </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every day,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you are sure to go to hades.  Again, the place of bliss is &quot;Abraham's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bosom,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and if the whole statement is literal, the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bosom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> must be literal and would not hold very many of earth's millions of sick and poor.  But why consider the absurdities?  All unprejudiced minds recognize it as a parable.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As a parable, how shall we understand it?  We answer, that a parable is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one thing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">said, another thing meant;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we know this from some of the parables explained by Jesus: for instance, the parable of the &quot;Wheat and Tares.&quot;  From his explanation we learn that when in that parable he said </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wheat,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he meant &quot;children of the kingdom;&quot; when he said </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tares,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he meant (to those who would understand the parable) &quot;the children of the devil;&quot; when he said </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reapers,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> angels were to be understood, etc. (See `Matt. 13`).  So you will find it in every parable </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">explained</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by our Lord; the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thing said</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is never the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thing</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">meant;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> consequently in this parable &quot;a rich man&quot; means something else.  Lazarus and Abraham's bosom are not literal, but represent some class or condition.  In attempting to expound a parable such as this, an explanation of which the Lord does not furnish us, modesty in expressing our </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">opinion</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> regarding it is certainly appropriate. We therefore offer the following explanation without any attempt to force our views upon the reader, except so far as his own truth-enlightened judgment may commend them, as in accord with God's Word and plan.  To our understanding the &quot;rich man&quot; represented the Jewish nation.  At the time of the utterance of the parable, and for a long time previous, they had &quot;fared sumptuously every day&quot; --being the especial recipients of God's favors.  As Paul says: &quot;What advantage then hath the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jew?</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Much every way; chiefly, because to them was committed the oracles of God.&quot;--[Law and Prophecy.]  The promises to Abraham and David invested the people with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">royalty,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as represented by the rich man's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;purple.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  The ritual and (typical) sacrifices of the Law constituted them, in a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">typical</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> sense, a holy nation--righteous-- represented by the rich man's &quot;fine linen.&quot;--Fine linen is a symbol of righteousness. --`Rev. 19:8`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Lazarus represented the Gentiles--all nations of the world aside from the Israelites. These, at the time of the utterance of this parable, were entirely destitute of those blessings which Israel enjoyed; they lay at the gate of the rich man.  No rich promises of royalty were theirs; not even typically were they cleansed; but in moral sickness, pollution, and sin they were companions of &quot;dogs.&quot;  Dogs were regarded as detestable creatures in those days, and the typically clean Jew called the outsiders &quot;heathen&quot; and &quot;dogs,&quot; and would never eat with them, nor marry nor have any dealings with them.--`John 4:9`. As to the &quot;eating the crumbs (of favor) which fell from the rich man's table&quot; of bounties, Jesus' words to the Syro-Phoenician woman give us a key. He said to this Gentile woman--&quot;It is not meet (proper) to take the children's (Israelites) bread and give it to the dogs&quot; (Gentiles); and she answered, &quot;Truth, Lord, but the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.&quot;--`Matt. 15:27`. Jesus healed her daughter, thus giving the desired crumb of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">favor.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  But there came a time when the typical righteousness ceased--when the promise of royalty ceased to be theirs, and the kingdom was taken from them to be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.--`Matt. 21:43`. The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">rich man</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> died to all these special advantages and soon he (the Jewish nation) found himself in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;gehenna</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fire&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--a cast-off condition, in trouble, tribulation and affliction, in which they have suffered from that day to this.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Lazarus also died: the condition of the Gentiles underwent a change, and from the Gentiles many were carried by the angels (messengers, apostles, etc.) to Abraham's bosom.  Abraham is represented as the father of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faithful,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and receives to his bosom all the children of faith, who thus are recognized as the heirs to all the promises made to Abraham. For the children of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">flesh,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> these are not the children of God, but the &quot;children of the promise are counted for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seed&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (children of Abraham) &quot;which seed is Christ,&quot;--and &quot;if ye be Christ's then are ye (believers) Abraham's seed (children) and heirs according to the (Abrahamic) promise.&quot;--`Gal. 3:29`. Yes, the condition of things then existing terminated by death--at the death of Jesus --&quot;for if one died for all, then were all dead.&quot;  There the Jew was cast off and has since been shown &quot;no favor,&quot; and the poor Gentiles who before had been &quot;aliens from the commonwealth (the promises) of Israel and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">without God</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">having no hope</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the world,&quot; were then &quot;made nigh by the blood of Christ&quot; and &quot;reconciled to God.&quot;--`Eph. 2:13`. If the two tribes living in Judea (Judah and Benjamin) were represented by </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> rich man, would it not be in harmony to suppose that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">five</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> brethren represented the remaining </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ten</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> tribes, who had &quot;Moses and the Prophets&quot; as their instructors? The question relative to them was doubtless introduced to show that all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">special</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> favor of God ceased to the ten tribes, as well as to the two directly addressed.  It seems to us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">evident,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that Israel only was meant, for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">none other nation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than Israel had &quot;Moses and the prophets&quot; as instructors.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In a word, this parable seems to teach precisely what Paul explained in `Rom. 11:19-31`, how that because of unbelief, the natural branches were broken off, and the wild branches grafted into the Abrahamic promises.  In the parable, Jesus leaves them in trouble, and does not refer to their final restoration to favor, doubtless because it was not pertinent to the feature of the subject treated; but Paul assures us, that when the fullness of the Gentiles--the Bride--be come in, &quot;they (the Israelites) shall obtain mercy through your (the Church's) mercy.&quot;  He assures us that this is God's covenant with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fleshly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Israel</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (who lost the higher--spiritual --promises, but are still the possessors of certain earthly promises), to become the chief nation of earth, etc.  In proof of this statement, he quotes the Prophets, saying: &quot;The deliverer shall come out of Zion, (the glorified church,) and shall turn away ungodliness from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jacob,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (the fleshly seed).  &quot;As concerning the Gospel, (high calling) they are enemies, (cast off) for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.&quot;  &quot;For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.  O the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!&quot; --`Rom. 11:30-32`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;I HAVE been reading about holiness,&quot; said one to me the other day: &quot;I do wish I could find it.&quot;</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">WAILING AND GNASHING OF TEETH.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;So shall it be at the end of the world [age]: the angels [messengers] shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.&quot;--`Matt. 13:49,50`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   These words follow one of our Lord's parables which represented the kingdom of heaven as it exists in its incipient and imperfected stage in this age--which in its widest sense is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nominal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Christian church--as a net cast into the sea (the world) which gathered fish of every kind; which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. In harmony also with this parable are those words of our Lord to the fishermen of Galilee, &quot;Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.&quot; (`Matt. 4:19`).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This net was first cast into the sea at the beginning of the Gospel Age when the Christian Church was first established. It has been out during the entire age; and now in the time of harvest it is drawn to shore, and the most desirable fish for the purpose for which God is making the present </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">selection,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are being gathered out and the rest cast away.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The great Fisherman has no special use for any more or other than the one kind of fish </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> though by and by in his own good time, &quot;the abundance of the sea shall be converted.&quot;--`Isa. 60:5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It should also be noticed, that when the net is drawn to shore, the work of the fishermen is not to dive into the sea either with a net or with hook and line to gather more fish: enough have been gathered for the present purpose; the net which the Lord sent out at the beginning of the age is full, and the present work, as indicated by the parable, is to sort and separate the fish already gathered.  Let those in the sea remain there for the present, and any in the net not suitable for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">present</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> purpose (the &quot;high calling&quot;) will be rejected and cast one side as unfit for present purposes.  This is another figure of the harvest work, and how clearly it indicates and marks out the exact work of the present hour.  When he had finished the parable Jesus said to his disciples, &quot;Have ye understood all these things?&quot; and they answered &quot;Yea, Lord.&quot; &quot;Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed into the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is a householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure, things new and old&quot;--thus implying that those who understand the parable and the plan of God as indicated by it, and who are instructed from the Scriptures with reference to the kingdom of heaven, will be able to see the new features of his work as well as the old, whenever the new features become due. And therefore they will not reject the new features because they are new, but will be ready promptly, both to work by and teach the new unfoldings of God's plans.  They will not insist on keeping the net out to catch more, but under the Master's eye will be ready to attend to the new work of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">separating.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So--in a manner similar to that indicated in the parable--shall it be in the end or harvest of this age.  And as we are now living in the very time indicated, we see this very separating work going on in our midst.  Truly the great net, the nominal gospel church, has gathered in fish of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all kinds,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and multitudes of them. And now the angels, the messengers of God--the saints who are acquainted with his word and plan, go forth commissioned of God through his Word, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">by the presentation</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of his unfolding truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they are now accomplishing the great work of separation in the church nominal--of good and bad fish, of wheat and tares, of loyal and consecrated saints and lukewarm and hypocritical professors.  Those in the net who are not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">really</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the kingdom of heaven, and who therefore should not be in the net, but should still be in the sea (the world) where they actually belong, shall be subjected to rough handling in this time of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">separating,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as illustrated in the parable of the tares being cast into the furnace of fire--the great trouble which shall undermine, overthrow, and finally completely destroy the nominal systems--the nominal churches and the nominal kingdoms of Christ.  We say, the nominal kingdoms of Christ; for all the civilized governments claim to be kingdoms of Christ, as moral societies generally claim to be churches of Christ, while really our Lord recognizes only one church, and one kingdom not yet </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">set up</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in power</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and authority over the world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In that great time of trouble there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth--bitter disappointment, great chagrin.  The gnashing or gritting of teeth symbolically expresses the vexation and anger of those in whom the truth only awakens a spirit of opposition and hatred against the Lord's messengers and against his plans which run counter to their prejudices, pride and plans.  Those who have not the spirit of truth, will not, and do not meet the truth with candor and an earnest effort to prove what is truth and what is error.  The truth they do not want, and even so much of it as they see, they endeavor to cover and hide; and their reasonings against it partake more of the nature of sarcasm, sophistry and enmity, than of sound scriptural reasonings.  In their fruitless efforts to substantiate errors which they have come to reverence and love, they will contradict each other's arguments, as well as the arguments of their predecessors who helped to found or establish the errors. This, in the symbolic language of Revelation, is called </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;gnawing their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tongues</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in pain.&quot;  All such opposition to the truth is the gnashing of teeth predicted; and we may expect to see more and more of it as the harvest work continues.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Not only will those merely </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">professors</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the nominal church be thus rejected in this &quot;harvest&quot; separation, but some of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> children of God will also be rejected and get into the wailing and gnashing of teeth condition, because they have assimilated with the worldly minded and have become imbued with the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;spirit of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the world&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--plans, ideas, aims, etc., which are worldly; for instance, the upbuilding of the various </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sects</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in numbers, wealth, or both, rather than the service of the TRUTH, and of the true </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;body</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ.&quot;  These fish are not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;good&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the sense of the parable; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they are not </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">fit</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for the purpose of the present selection.  They are undeveloped--not overcomers of the world, but are overcome by the world--by the spirit, ideas and disposition of the worldly minded. Their case is mentioned by our Lord in `Matt. 24:51`.  He says: He will cut him assunder, [separate him from the real &quot;body&quot;] and appoint him his portion </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the hypocrites--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the tares in the trouble, though only an unripe grain of wheat.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It should be clearly recognized by all that our Lord's parables nearly all relate to the Church </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  In every instance where they refer to &quot;the Kingdom of heaven,&quot; it is the Church, not the world surely, except when the worldly are shown as improperly getting into and identified with the church nominal.  Thus in these two parables now briefly considered, wheat and tares, as well as good and bad fish, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">represent</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> classes and mixtures IN THE CHURCH, and have no reference whatever to the non-professing </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;world,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which in the one parable is represented by the sea, and in the other by the field.  So then the great bundles of tares which daily are being bound tighter and tighter--organized more and more thoroughly and systematically, are all parts of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nominal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Church of Christ.  The great Reaper comes to harvest his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">wheat,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and separates from his own FREE ones (`Matt. 13:30,41`) all those </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">bound</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in bundles by human traditions and by a worldly spirit.  And the symbolic </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">burning</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of these, represents the trouble coming upon so-called Christendom [Christ's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nominal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Kingdom.]  This imposing worldly structure with its many divisions, or sects, will entirely consume: that is, it will cease to be.  The people will not perish, but the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">systems</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will perish, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imitation saints</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (tares) will cease to be such imitations, and will pass for what they really are--members of the &quot;world&quot; and not of the select church-- some of them moral, benevolent, kind, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">good people,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but not of the class recognized in Scripture as the &quot;overcomers,&quot; the bride and joint-heirs with Christ, to whom alone God has promised and will give the Kingdom.  This is the scene in which God will gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend [that are not acceptable to him as joint-heirs with Christ].  None of the sects can claim to be this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">one</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> true church which God has all along recognized, which already contains </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the wheat.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Church of God throughout the Gospel Age has always consisted only of those wholly consecrated believers &quot;whose names are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">written</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in heaven;&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> none of them have ever been missed from their Father's sight and care though often the world did not at all recognize this true &quot;body of Christ,&quot; being attracted to look rather at the many </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">churches of men</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whose names were written on earth, whose outward show and pomp and ceremonies and titles correspond more to the world's ideas.  But </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the &quot;harvest,&quot; it is the Father's plan and the Chief Reaper's work to disabuse the world of its wrong ideas on this and other subjects; and He will show forth soon the living members of the REAL CHURCH as a sample of those he has been choosing all along during the age.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As in the harvest at the close of the Jewish Age, so in this harvest, the &quot;remnant&quot; which the Lord will own as his, will contain few of the Chief Priests, Scribes, Pharisees--few of the Clergy or great ones, many more of the &quot;laity&quot; or &quot;common people,&quot; those reckoned publicans and sinners in comparison with the &quot;holier than thou&quot; ministers and priests. So our Lord plainly indicated when in his prayer he said: &quot;I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the [worldly] wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.  Even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.&quot; `Luke 10:21`.  See also `1 Cor. 1:26-31`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact then that not many of earth's wise and great receive and preach these &quot;harvest&quot; truths, is not an argument against them.  Remember that among the Apostles, only Paul was before a theologian--a Pharisee.  How </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">hardly</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> shall they that have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">riches</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [earthly honors and wealth--of talents, of respect, etc., as well as of gold] enter into the Kingdom of God.  God chooses such a method in selecting the &quot;little flock&quot; as will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cost</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">each</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the loss of these to obtain the prize he offers.  Thus God selects and proves the &quot;overcomers.&quot;  None are so poor that fidelity to the truth will not cost them something--even </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all they have.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us, dearly beloved, make our calling and election to this great prize sure, by doing as did the Apostles, following the Lord, one of whom wrote, &quot;I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">loss of all</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">things,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and do count them but dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him ...: that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto THE resurrection of THE dead.&quot;--`Phil. 3:8-11`.</font><br />
<br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Not many rich or noble called</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not many great or wise;</font></tt><br />
<tt><font size="2">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They whom God makes His kings and priests</font></tt><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">AN ACCUSER SILENCED.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Two fellow-travellers were seated together in a railway carriage engaged in earnest conversation.  It was of a religious nature, and one of them, a skeptic, was evidently seeking to excuse his skepticism by expatiating on the various evils which afflict Christendom.  He was detailing, with manifest pleasure, the hypocrisy and the craft and the covetousness and the divisions found in the professing Church, and then he pointed to some of the leaders, as the most markedly corrupt of the whole.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In front of them sat a Christian who was compelled to hear all this.  Had he felt the accusations to be false, he might have suffered them all, as a part of the hatred the world bears toward Christ, and been truly happy in so suffering; but he knew them to be true--too true to be concealed from the most charitable mind, so all he could do was to bow his head and bear the deserved reproach.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Soon, however, the accuser, anxious to extend the circle of his audience, addressed this fellow passenger in front of him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I see you are quick to detect evil,&quot; answered the Christian, &quot;and you read character pretty well.  You have been uncovering here the abominable things which have turned Christendom into a wreck, and are fast ripening it for the judgment of God.  You have spared none but given all a good measure.  Now I am a Christian, and I love the Lord Jesus and his people.  Not a word shall I offer in defense, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">but I here solemnly challenge</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">you to speak the first word against</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The skeptic was surprised.  He seemed almost frightened, and sheepishly replied, &quot;Well, no; I couldn't find fault with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Him.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  He was perfect.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Just so,&quot; said the Christian; &quot;and therefore was my heart attracted to Him; and the more I look at Him, the more I found I wasn't like Him at all, but only a poor, sinful, guilty man.  But tell me yourself if I haven't a right to be happy and to love Him when I found out that He had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">died</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for me; that on the cross He had fully paid all my debt, and thus cleared me of all guilt?  Ever since then I truly love Him, and all the evil which professed followers of His may do, cannot turn me away from Him.  My salvation hangs on what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">He</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> has done, and not on what </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are doing.&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Horatius</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bonar.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE THIEF.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;He said to Jesus, Remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.  And he [Jesus] said to him, Indeed I say to thee this day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.&quot;--`Luke 23:42,43`.-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Diaglott.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Those who consider salvation to be an escape from everlasting torture to a paradise of pleasure, and dependent only on accidental circumstances of favor, see in this narration the doctrine of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">election</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> exemplified --Jesus, being pleased by the consoling words of the one thief, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">elected</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> him to heaven, and equally elected that the other should roast to all eternity, unpitied, unrelieved.  Truly if God has made salvation such a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">lottery,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> such a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">chance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> thing, those who believe it to be such should have little to say against church lotteries, and less against worldly ones.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But this is not the case.  The scripture has evidently been much misunderstood. To get its true import, let us take in the surroundings and connections.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Jesus had just been condemned, and was now being executed on the charge of treason to Caesar's government, in saying that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">He</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was a king: though he had told them that his kingdom was &quot;not of this world.&quot;  There, upon the cross above his head, was the inscription of his charged crime, written in three languages: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.&quot;   All knew of his claims and derided him, except one of the thieves crucified with him. Doubtless he had heard of Jesus and of his wonderful character, and said in his heart: This is truly a strange and wonderful man; who can know that there is no foundation to his claims?  He certainly lives close to God: I will speak to him in sympathy; it can do no harm.  Then he rebuked his companion, mentioning the innocence of Jesus, and, turning to Jesus, the conversation noted above took place.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We cannot suppose that this thief had any correct or definite idea of Jesus-- nothing more than a mere feeling that he was about to die, and a straw of hope was better than nothing.  To give him credit for more would be to place him </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> ahead of all Apostles and followers of Jesus, who at this time had left him and fled, and who three days after, said: &quot;We [had] trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We can have no doubt as to the import of his petition; he meant that whenever Jesus reached his kingdom power, he desired favor.  Now, note Jesus' answer. He does not say that he has no kingdom, but on the contrary, by his response he indicates that the thief's request was proper.  The word translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;verily,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;indeed,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;amen,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and signifies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;so be it,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as you have asked: &quot;I say to thee this day, [this dark day, when it </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">seems</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as though I am an imposter and about to die as a felon,] thou shalt be with me in Paradise.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now the substance of this is, that when the Lord has established his kingdom, the thief will be remembered and be in Paradise.  Notice that we have changed the comma from before to after to-day. This makes it perfectly clear and reasonable. Jesus might have told the thief more if he had chosen.  He might have told him that the reason he should be privileged to come to Paradise was because he was paying his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ransom</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> then and there --dying for his sins.  He might have told him further that he was dying for and ransoming also the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">other thief,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as well as the whole gaping and deriding multitude before him; as well as the millions yet unborn and millions then entombed.  We know this, because we know that &quot;Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">every man,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and that as in Adam, or on his account, all die, even so in Christ, or on his account, shall all be made alive and be privileged to come back to that Edenic condition forfeited by the first man's sin, and redeemed for men by Christ's righteous sacrifice.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As already shown, the garden of Eden was but an illustration of the perfect and beautiful earth when fully released from the curse.  The word Paradise is of Arabic origin, not Greek--it signifies </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">a garden.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The Septuagint renders `Gen. 2:8` thus: &quot;God planted a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">paradise</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in Eden.&quot; When Jesus has established his kingdom, bound evil, etc., this earth will become a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">paradise,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and the two thieves and all that are in their graves shall come into it. And by becoming obedient to its laws they may live forever in it.  We doubt not, however, that the kind words spoken in that dark hour to the Lord of glory, will no more lose a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suitable reward</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> than the gift of a cup of cold water, or other small kindnesses done to those whom this King is &quot;not ashamed to call his </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">brethren.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But have we the right to change the comma?  Certainly: the punctuation of the Bible is not inspired.  The writers of the Bible used </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">no punctuation.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  It was invented about four hundred years ago.  It is merely a modern convenience, and should be so used as to bring out sense and harmony with all other Scriptures. This harmony and sense is obtained only by the punctuation we have given above. To read it as usually punctuated, it would teach that Jesus and the thief went away somewhere that day, which is contrary to the following Scriptures, which read carefully: `Luke 24:46`; `John 20:17`; `John 3:13`. In the latter text note that the words, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;which is in heaven,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are an interpolation as shown by the oldest MSS.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE IRON WOLF.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;I conducted, two months ago,&quot; said a clergyman, &quot;the funeral services of one of my parishioners.  He had been a farmer.  Forty years ago he had commenced work with one hundred acres of land, and he ended with one hundred. He was a skillful, industrious working-man, but he had laid by no money in the bank.  I understood the reason as I listened to the comments of his friends and neighbors.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;'It was always a warm, hospitable house,' said one.  'The poor man was never turned away from that door.  His sons and daughters all received the best education which his means could command. One is a clergyman, one a civil engineer, two are teachers--all lead useful and happy lives.'</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Said another: 'Those children sitting there weeping are the orphans of a friend. He gave them a home.  That crippled girl is his wife's niece.  She lived with them for years.  That young fellow who is also weeping so bitterly, was a waif that he rescued from the slums of the city.'</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And so the story went on--not of a miser who had heaped dollar upon dollar, but of a servant of God who helped many lives, and had lifted many of them out of misery and ignorance into life and joy.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;On my way home from the funeral I stopped at the farm of another parishioner, who said to me in a shrill, rasping tone:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;'So poor Gould is dead!  He left a poor account--not a penny more than he got from his father.  Now I started with nothing; and look here,' pointing to his broad fields.  'I own down to the creek. D'ye know why?  When I started to keep house I brought this into it the first thing,' taking an iron savings-bank in the shape of a wolf out of the closet. 'Every penny I could save went into its jaws.  It is surprising how many pennies you can save when you've a purpose. My purpose was to die worth $100,000. Other folks ate meat; we ate molasses. Other folks dressed their wives in merino; mine wore calico.  Other men wasted money on schooling; my boys and girls learned to work early and keep it up late.  I wasted no money on churches, sick people, paupers, and books.  And,' he concluded triumphantly, 'now I own to the creek; and that land with the fields yonder, and the stock in the barns, are worth $100,000.  Do you see it?'</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And on the thin, hard lips was a wretched attempt to laugh.  The house was bare and comfortless; his wife, worn out with work, had long ago gone to her grave.  Of his children, taught only to make money a god, one daughter, starved in body and mind, was still drudging in the kitchen; one son had taken to drink, having no other resource, and died in prison.  The other, a harder miser than his father, remained at home to fight with him over every penny wrung out of their fertile fields.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Yesterday I buried this man,&quot; continued the clergyman.  &quot;Neither neighbor nor friend, son nor daughter, shed a tear over him.  His children were eager to begin the quarrel for the ground he had sacrificed his life to earn.  Of it all he had now only enough to cover his decaying body.  Economy for a noble purpose is a virtue; but in the house of some it is avarice, and like a wolf, devours intelligence, religion, hope and life itself.&quot; --</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Friendly Companion.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE KING AND THE POPE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The King of Italy and the Pope are not on anything like the distant terms which the popular idea ascribes to them. The &quot;prisoner of the Vatican,&quot; as the Church likes to call the Pope, is no prisoner at all in any true sense.  Neither is the King the obdurate enemy of the Church he is sometimes represented. In simpler terms, there is masking in Rome on both sides, a fact with which Catholics even, throughout the world, it is probable are not perfectly familiar.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are assured from Rome that there is a secret understanding between the King and the Pope, and that it will not be long when the settlement will be made that will end forever all misunderstandings, --at least such is said to be the intention.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Some time ago it was alleged that the Pope had extensive plans for regaining temporal power and that the prospect was good for his plans.  Whether what is now on foot has this realization in view, nothing certain is known.  It is certain, however, that the Italian Government has made important concessions with mutual benefits in view.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Italy is ambitious of a place among nations as nearly the head as possible, and of late, the Pope--who is nothing if not a diplomat--has shown a growing desire to mix himself up with the world's affairs something after the fashion of years ago, when the Church was more nearly omnipotent than now.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Late accounts from Rome declare that at the recent Parliamentary elections throughout the country, in every case the names of the Government candidates were identical with those put forward and supported by the Papal party.  In nothing does the Italian Government seem to have changed its policy.  Nothing on the surface shows what the understanding is, though that there is one is shown in a number of ways.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pitts.

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CHRISTIAN LIBERTY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;The true doctrine is not our right to think for ourselves, but the right of the other man to think for himself.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The impression very widely prevails that the battle for Christian liberty has been fought and won.  So far as regards precaution of the more active kind, this is the case in the larger part of the civilized world.  The right of the minority to free speech and free action in the line of conscientious conviction, is, in theory at least, conceded.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But it is a mistake to assume that because harsh laws have been softened, human nature has been radically changed. The grosser forms of persecution have disappeared, but subtler forms remain. The intolerant spirit has survived the death of many institutions by which intolerance was once manifested.  Christian liberty is still, in a considerable degree, conceded only in theory.  Men still endeavor to punish those who have the temerity to differ from them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is no cause for astonishment at this manifestation of inconsistency.  It is one of the curious things in human history to see how generally the persecuted have become in turn the persecutors the moment the power was lodged in their hands.  And why?  Because the true principle of Christian liberty had not been grasped, and is to this day apprehended by only a few.  The right of any body of men to differ from others has always been claimed by them; there is no novelty in that.  From the beginning, every Christian sect that has arisen has vehemently contended for its right to differ from others.  It has protested against persecution--that is to say, the persecution of itself by others.  But in few cases has any sect conceded the right of others to differ from it, or forborne to persecute when it had the power.  And in our own day each man is prompt to claim and assert the right to think for himself, but how loth most are to concede the equal right of all other men to think for themselves. Every one resents any attempt to coerce him into the avowal of anything that he does not honestly believe, but how few fail to attempt to coerce others.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The true doctrine of Christian liberty is not our right to think for ourselves, but the right of the other man to think for himself.  There is no danger now that our right will not be insisted upon and enforced, particularly if our thinking happens to fall in with that of the majority. It is the other man's liberty that is in danger, particularly if he is in the minority. It is his liberty that demands defense at all hazards; for, if liberty is denied him, how long will it be conceded to us?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">To demand liberty for the other man, even when he differs from us, is not to admit that truth and error are essentially one, or to deny that it is of great consequence what the other man believes and teaches.  It may be our duty to oppose with all our might what he teaches, to denounce it as a deadly error.  But this may be done without identifying the man with what he teaches, and without the display of the spirit of intolerance and persecution. We need not try to make the man odious because his opinion is odious to us. To be loyal to the truth, and yet faithfully to recognize the equal rights of all men to free thought and free speech, is not always an easy task.  The two may, however, be combined.  And nothing can be more certain than that the preservation of Christian liberty for any, is conditioned on the concession of that liberty for all.--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">N.Y.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Examiner.</font></b><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">CHRIST THE CENTRE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   As the sun is the centre of our solar system, so Christ is the Christian's sun and centre of desire.  As gravitation holds the planets in their proper orbits, so love holds the trusting heart in the pathway of willing obedience.  As in completing the solar circuit, the earth receives the pleasing variety of seasons adapted to beauty and health, and to promote all organic life, so in our loving service of Christ, there is a pleasing and useful variety of gracious and profitable experiences.  Sometimes fierce storms sweep across our pathway to drive us into the shelter of his promised grace.  Sometimes the cold repulsiveness of the world's unbelief and sin chills us like a winter's blast, driving us to the central, steady sunlight of a Savior's constant love, causing springtime to burst forth in the Christian's heart, and bursting buds of developing faith and love to expand into the fruits of Christian grace.  But there is no winter in the sun.  And he who has the Sun of Righteousness in his heart will have constantly the springtime of his abiding love.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">IMMORTALITY AND INCORRUPTION.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The following, in answer to a correspondent's question, may be of general interest to our readers:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">aphtharsia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortality</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `Rom. 2:7` and `2 Tim. 1:10`. The same word is rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sincerity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `Eph. 6:24` and `Titus 2:7`; and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruption</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `1 Cor. 15:42,50,53,54`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">aphthartos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is rendered </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `1 Tim. 1:17`; and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruptible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `Rom. 1:23`, `1 Cor. 9:25` and `15:52`, and `1 Pet. 1:4,23` and `3:4`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">These are the only occurrences of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">this</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> word.  The Greek word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">athanasia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortality,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">three times</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--`1 Cor. 15:53,54` and `1 Tim. 6:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Both these words are given the sense of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> by lexicographers.  Liddell and Scott, standard authorities, give it thus. Plutarch uses </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">aphthartos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruptible,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  And it seems to be the exact word corresponding to our words, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruptible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [not liable to corrupt, or to be corrupted], and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [not mortal-- not subject or liable to death].</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Athanasia,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> while it is properly translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> according to usage, does not so much have the sense of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not liable to die,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as that of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unchangeability.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Hence </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">aphthartos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is the word which most closely corresponds to our word immortal, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e., not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> mortal, not perishable, not corruptible. This is shown by the relationship between corruptible and incorruptible in `1 Cor. 15:53 and 54`, which in the Greek as in the English stand related, of the same root, the Greek being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">phthartos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">aphthartos.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Not so, however, the words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the same verses. In the English these words are closely related, but the Greek uses words totally distinct and not related--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">thnetos</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">athanasia,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the sense being, &quot;This mortal [dying condition] shall put on [or assume] immortality&quot; [a lasting or unchangeable condition].</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">So, then, the attempt of some to make out that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruptible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> refers to one state, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortality</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to another, is without foundation, and probably the result of lack of thoroughness in the examination of the subject.  Prof. Young, Liddell and Scott, and all translators are right in using the two English words </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruptible</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> interchangeably.  As above suggested, however, we would have preferred it had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">athanasia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> been translated </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unchangeability</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the three cases where it occurs, although our word </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">immortality</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> covers the idea of unchangeability.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With this change `1 Cor. 15:53,54` would read thus:--&quot;The [special] dead </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the saints] will be raised incorruptible </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> immortal, not liable to corrupt, decay, or perish] and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [of the same special class] shall be changed.&quot;  &quot;For of necessity this corruptible [diseased, perishable condition] must be invested with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incorruptibility</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> [imperishable quality] and this mortal [dying condition] must be invested with immortality&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">[unchangeability].</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> &quot;And when this corruptible [perishable condition] shall be invested with incorruptibility [imperishable quality] and this mortal [dying condition] shall be clothed with unchangeability [immortality], </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will that prophetic promise be fulfilled [which says] Death will be swallowed up in victory.&quot;  That is to say: when this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">special</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> class, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> dead and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the overcomers, the saints, are changed to undying, changeless conditions, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will that prophecy of `Isaiah 25:8` begin to be fulfilled to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--the Millennial work of abolishing death and restoring life will </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">then</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> go on successfully.</font><br />

<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">DEATH NOT LIFE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   I think we are not warranted in concluding (as some have done), so positively concerning this question, as to make it a point of Christian faith to interpret figuratively, and not literally, the &quot;death&quot; and the &quot;destruction&quot; spoken of in Scripture as the doom of the condemned: and to insist on the belief that they are kept alive forever.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Life,&quot; as applied to their condition, [the condition of the righteous] is usually understood to mean &quot;happy life.&quot;  And that theirs will be a happy life, we are indeed plainly taught; but I do not think we are anywhere taught that the word &quot;life&quot; does of itself necessarily imply happiness.  If so indeed, it would be a mere tautology to speak of a &quot;happy life;&quot; and a contradiction to speak of a &quot;miserable life;&quot; which we know is not the case, according to the usage of any language.  In all ages and countries, &quot;life,&quot; and the words answering to it in their languages, have always been applied, in ordinary discourse, to a wretched life, no less properly than to a happy one.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Life, therefore, in the received sense of the word would apply equally to the condition of the blest and the condemned, supposing these last to be destined to continue forever living in a state of misery. And yet, to their condition the words &quot;life&quot; and &quot;immortality&quot; never are applied in Scripture.  If, therefore, we suppose the hearers of Jesus and his Apostles to have understood, as nearly as possible, in the ordinary sense, the words employed, they must naturally have conceived them to mean (if they were taught nothing to the contrary) that the condemned were really and literally to be &quot;destroyed,&quot; and cease to exist: not that they were to exist forever in a state of wretchedness.  For they are never spoken of as being kept alive, but as forfeiting life; as for instance: &quot;Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life;&quot;--&quot;He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.&quot;  And again, &quot;perdition,&quot; &quot;death,&quot; &quot;destruction,&quot; are employed in numerous passages to express the doom of the condemned.  All which expressions would, as I have said, be naturally taken in their usual and obvious sense, if nothing were taught to the contrary.-- </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Archbishop Whately.</font></b><br />

Now if I can get the books and paper, and especially Vol. II, please let me know at once, and I will send money for them for myself and for a friend.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have been a member of the M.E. church for a number of years, but have often felt that we did not get all of the gospel.  Your book has opened the holy Scriptures to my view in a new and wonderful light, and I am anxious to be further instructed in this way.  I have always been taught from infancy until now--and I am over 40 years old--that this life is the only probation, and that at death our eternal destiny was unalterably fixed, and it nearly took my breath away when I found that no such assertion was made either in the Old or New Testament, and I am familiar with the Bible from Genesis to Revelation.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This book has opened my eyes to some of the most blessed truths, and its perusal has filled my heart anew with the love of our God, and for the last few days I have felt like a newly converted man.  I hoped all along until the last page was reached that I might find something about the rich man and Lazarus.  I felt sadly disappointed when I did not find anything. Well, God bless you, Yours truly,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">MY DEAR SISTER RUSSELL:--Four Dawns sent last week are sold.  People ask for them.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I asked God to take care of this work and he is doing it.  Mr. R. is very much interested in it too.  He tells me at once when he sells one for me, as he knows it does me so much real good.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Train men and travelling men are all eager for it.  They read Bill Arp's comments and then want the book.  I have them pinned up in the waiting room.  I would like some more of them for sending away in letters.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I had a letter from my cousin to whom you wrote, telling me that her son, a young man of twenty, had given up all and gone out to sell Dawns.  May God bless him and his efforts.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With love to you and Bro. R.  May God bless you and forward the work while it is yet day.  Yours in the faith,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BRO. RUSSELL:--Please send me ten more paper covered Dawns for which you will find enclosed $2.50, and also send the &quot;TOWER&quot; to the following address --for one year, and find amt. enclosed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Brother C. has been converted from infidelity by reading DAWN.  His own words are, &quot;I am a changed man.&quot;  His only Bible for five years past has been Thomas Paine's &quot;Age of Reason.&quot;  Another skeptic whom I presented with a copy says, I would not take $5.00 for my DAWN if I could not get another.  I accept the Bible now, but have rejected it because I thought it taught the doctrine of eternal torment.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The most honest people I have found are among skeptics.  O! I wish I could do more to spread the truth.  Never have I received such blessings, as since I have consecrated myself to the Master's service in the spread of the truth.  I had thought I could send you a list of preachers' names this time, to be supplied with DAWNS, but I find that it is impossible at this time as so many others are beginning to inquire for the truth.  Praying for you and the TOWER work, I remain yours in Christ.           LEWIS L. EVARTS.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">[Some time ago Brother Evarts started to send DAWN to all the ministers in Penna., sending us lists from time to time as he found himself able to afford it. While commending his plan, and especially his zeal, we advised him that he would probably find a larger proportion of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">honest</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Bible students out of the pulpits of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">nominal</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> churches than in them.  It seems from the above that his experience is the same as ours.  How like is the present &quot;harvest&quot; to that at the first advent, its prototype or shadow.  See `Matt. 23:13`; `Luke 13:52`.  The word &quot;lawyers&quot; in this last text corresponds in meaning to the present title of D.D.  Doctors of the Law, they were then called, but now Doctors of Divinity.--EDITOR.]</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   DEAR BROTHER: When I became a reader of the TOWER and M. DAWN, I was preparing to enter the ministry of the Baptist faith.  I have had a hard, long struggle with friends and creeds, but now I know I can go joyfully to work with whatever ability I possess circulating DAWN for the truth's sake.  I enclose money.  Please send me 500 &quot;Arp's Joy,&quot; and 100 DAWNS.  Your Bro. in Christ,</font><br />
