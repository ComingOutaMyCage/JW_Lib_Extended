<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Teaching to Serve God, or Mammon?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">By Lester Whitlock (Illinois)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font5">HE American public school has been hailed with due respect, since its foundation, for the making of our nation. It is given credit for making such responsible leaders as Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and other “great” men of America. By means of it the ignorance of the Dark Ages has been dispelled by present educational enlightenment. But such enlightenment has also brought us a ray of knowledge on the imperfection and possibly the injurious reaction of the source of our information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In John 8:32 we read, ‘The truth will make us free’; but Satan is a liar, and the father of lies. (John 8:44) By this standard we may say, “Where source is known, credit is given.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The former “three R’s” have made way for also a new list of subjects, the complete list now containing arithmetic, grammar, physiology, geography, history, and civics. Their merits (or demerits) will be discussed in the order given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fundamental principles of arithmetic, of course, are the processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. But after these have been learned, we enlarge on each. The teaching of interest, stocks and bonds, stock exchange, and profit and loss are examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are the above-mentioned absolutely necessary to promote the career of the American boy or girl? Was not the interest system forbidden to the Jews by Jehovah? Is it necessary to instruct our boys and girls in a system that is denounced by the Most High?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But let us go on down the list. Stocks and bonds! We all admit their purpose is for making money or receiving a profit at the expense of some company or individual. Is this the system by which our boys and girls must make their way in life? Are these the ideals which the American school instills in their young minds ? Does not the scripture teach that the love of money is the root of all evil ?—1 Timothy 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are we instructing the coming generation that they too may be swindled by “Merger, Morgan and Murder” on Bolivian bonds?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And thus it goes. Stock exchange, another means of ill-gotten gains; profit and loss, a means by which we hook the next man for hooking us the last time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are these the high ideals which our great American schools instill into the lives and minds of our children? But let us delve into more atrocious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Physiology, a study of the body in reference to health, should be the most important of all school subjects. Yet, if things are taught which are detrimental to health, then this subject also becomes detrimental.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We were impressed by a picture in the physiology textbook of a rural school. A little six-year-old girl sat innocently holding out her arm to a doctor, well up in years, who was about to inject “pure virgin serum” (decayed pus) into her arm. It read, “Vaccination will prevent diseases among school children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Imagine, a little innocent child with a slender outstretched arm, facing a doctor, well along in years, holding a needle containing poison as dangerous as the virus of a rattler! Imagine, a group of innocent school children studying this picture lesson, facing a teacher who knows the fallacy of this fiendish practice! What must he tell them? In the name of common decency, what must he tell them? Will he have the courage to tell them the book is wrong, the doctor is wrong, the system is wrong, and thus preserve their innocent lives from the pus-shooter fiends? Can he face the school board with a clear eye of defiance if harassed because of his actions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The writer of this article, being a teacher, met this test in a little rural school in southern Illinois. The results were inevitable, but the children were saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At a meeting of the Illinois Medical Association, one of their former presidents addressed them as follows: “Talk vaccination, advocate it, have it preached from the pulpit, for every person is a possible prospect for vaccination; yet if we wait for an epidemic to develop, only a small percent will require our treatment.” Is the American school a salesroom for the medical profession?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Geography is the study of earth, its relationship toward man, how he gains a livelihood, and his relationship to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are thrilled to read the Biblical account of the garden of Eden, earth's paradise, and contrast this with the present condition of the earth, which has degenerated during these some thousands of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A pupil in school asked what was necessary to cause the earth to bring forth its increase equal to its original state. The teacher, in detail, told of the possibilities of the earth if brought to perfection. But the boy, with a look of despair, sighed, “Will that ever come to pass? If so, when?” Did that teacher have the courage to answer a child's question and thus remove despair and in its stead place joy and confidence? He did. But, sad to say, the boy in his enthusiasm took the story home, it grew to a rumor, spread over the district, and the teacher was removed at the end of the term for teaching false religion in school. (Matthew 5:11,12) Are the American schools for the purpose of suppressing the truth? Can they not make way for the present enlightenment?—2 Timothy 3:7; Proverbs 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">History, the study of man’s actions in the past, is one of the most interesting studies in the American school if properly used. Yet, strange to say, the truths of history must be as flexible as India rubber to fit the situation into which they are oftentimes pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">George Washington, our great American patriot, founded our present government and secured the location of the capital at Washington, D.C. Why didn’t they mention that in order to get it thus located he log-rolled, or voted for every other fellow’s measure, right or wrong, in order to secure the victory of his own?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Alexander Hamilton, known as America's great financier, is given credit for putting our government “on its feet”; yet why is his policy withheld that ‘if America is to be a successful nation it must legislate in favor of the wealthy class’? (Proverbs 22:16) Are we so ashamed of the history of this great republic that we must conceal our rags beneath garments of silk? (Matthew 23:27) Will the American boy respect these and us any the more after he has learned the facts? Is the American school a school of deception ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Civics is the study of the workings of our local, state and national government and how we are benefited by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For years a desirable government has been the efforts of man. Yet, looking back down the ages, the strongest and most desirable government lasted only for a while, was corrupted, and fell. Nation after nation has risen up, and, like the story of the “great stone face&quot;, has cried, &quot;Here it is! Here is his likeness!” But after a short time the people, seeing its undesirableness, say, &quot;No, not yet,” and still look forward to the coming of the ideal government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In civics we study of corporations, private utilities, service commissions, laws, judges, etc. The corporations are praised for their worthiness, the private utilities for their services, the commissions for their benefits, and the judges for their performance of duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Should we tell the boys and girls that the corporations have their part in making the textbooks to suppress prejudice against them? Should we tell the boys and girls that the private utilities have their part in making the textbooks so that they may charge exorbitant electric, power, and transportation rates without arousing the ire of the people? Should we tell them the legislators and judges write their own “epitaph” in the textbooks so that they may hold sway among the next generation? (Proverbs 20:6) Do the American schools really resort to treachery in order to hold sway?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reading, without doubt, stands paramount in the list of subjects in the American public schools. It is the gateway to wisdom and learning. It is through reading that we receive our knowledge and proof of our previous learning. Reading, above all other subjects, has the power of interesting the American boy and girl and getting doser to his inner self.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many a boy or girl has been inspired to become more useful and successful in life through the gateway of reading. Even Abraham Lincoln is said to have received his greatest inspiration to become president through the reading of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Life of George Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Yet, with all its importance, if reading should cause the American boy or girl to get the wrong view of life and thus cause them to fall by the wayside either morally or spiritually, then it has become a vain thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The American home was founded upon the principle of “worshiping God according to the dictates of one’s own conscience”, and upon this principle the American school falls in line. Almost every American teacher is instructed either by the law or by the parents to teach no religion in school whatsoever, so that all may be free to worship God as they see fit and thus receive no teaching abominable to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The American school “reader”, however, does not hold so true to this doctrine, and thus the teacher is faced with the gravest of all situations : placed upon the precipice of understanding, he alone is held responsible should the student fall into the abyss of falsity. Let us see, then, what the American school has to offer the young reader and on which the teacher is not allowed to lend a helping hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elson Reader, Book 2, “How the Days Got Their Names”: Here we find eight-year-old children being taught the names of pagan gods and their duties. Strange but true, it states in each case that------is the god of------, etc. Imag</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ine the situation of the teacher whose mouth must be closed as the mouths of the lions with which Daniel abode for a night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does the American school teach a pagan religion? (Exodus 20:3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elson Reader, Book 7, “In Flanders’ Fields” —McCrae:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We are the dead. Short days ago We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow, Loved and were loved, and now we lie In Flanders’ fields.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here we find dead men 'really talking’. Yet Ecclesiastes 9:10 says ‘there is no knowledge nor wisdom in the grave, whither thou goest’. Also Psalm 6: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does the American school teach disrespect for God’s Word?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elson Reader, Book 4, “Annabel Lee”—Poe:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We loved with a love . , .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. . . that even the winged seraphs of heaven Coveted her and me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This was the reason that . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A wind came out of the cloud, by night, Chilling . . . killing my Annabel Lee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here we find the angels in heaven so jealous of a couple that they committed murder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does the American school teach that the angels in heaven are a bunch of gangsters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Snowbound”—Whittier:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“How many a poor one’s blessing went With thee below that low green tent</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whose curtain never outward swings! ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scripture teaches, ‘All in their graves shall come forth.’ Doesn't the American school believe in an earthly resurrection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Safe in thy immortality,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What change can reach the wealth I hold?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Doesn’t that sound like the American school teaches the immortality of the soul?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And looking from some heavenly hill Do those large eyes behold me still?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘David hath not ascended unto heaven.— Acts 2:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“All hearts confess the saints elect Who, twain in faith, in love agree.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does this coincide with Ephesians 4: 5, which reads, “One Lord, one faith, one baptism”? (Read </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Is Truth?</span><span class="font5"> by J. F. Rutherford, page 22.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Young and Field Reader, Book 6:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And the soul of ‘Father Damien’ ascended like a dove unto heaven, unto the one who gave it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strange, it seems, these “heavier than air” souls of Catholic priests always go up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Hamlet”—Shakespeare:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;— For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, . . .”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We never would have suspected the American school if it hadn’t put that one in print. Does the American school teach “eternal torment after death”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not only does the American school teach a false religion. Examine these outbursts!—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elson Reader, Book 4; Patrick Henry:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations and w’ho will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active and the brave.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Surely Jehovah does not participate in Satan’s schemes to gain dominion over many lands or to take sides in political skirmishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Could it then be possible that the American school would desecrate the name of Jehovah God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘Evils of War”—Henry Clay:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Pestilence and famine, no doubt for wise although inscrutable purposes, are inflictions of Providence, to which it is our duty, therefore, to bow with obedience, humble submission, and resignation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does not the scripture teach that God is the Author of every good and perfect gift, is all merciful, and just ? Can we thus accuse God of such horrible crimes. Him who is a Cod of love ? -—2 Corinthians 13:11.</span></p>

One student, Francis B. Sayre, Jr., son of the assistant secretary of state, and grandson of President Wilson, and himself born in the White House, amused all manldnd that will ever hear of it by carrying a large swastika flag down past long lines of cheering students. The students had a good time marching behind two youths with fife and drum representing the decadent “spirit of ’36” that believes in hammering patriotism into the youth with a potato masher.

One notes a growing tendency to suppress individualism, to regiment not only business and industry, but human conduct and character. If the Massachusetts boy had saluted the flag, the authorities would have been satisfied, though the very act of lifting his hand had engendered a hatred for the thing it symbolized. He was expelled from school, then, not because he had less patriotism than his schoolmates, but because he refused to conform.

Margiotti, Roman Catholic attorney general of the State of Pennsylvania, ruled that “religious scruples cannot be considered as justification for refusing to salute the flag”; and so Otto Meng, a citizen of that state who is well posted on its history, wrote the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Presa</span><span class="font5"> as follows :</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Margiotti Compulsory Flag Salute ruling is contrary to the best traditions of the Slate of Pennsylvania. It is also impractical, and unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When William Penn appeared in the presence of King Charles II to receive the grant of land which is now Pennsylvania he declined to bow and to remove his hat. His worship and obeisance were reserved for Jehovah God, and Him alone. He also refused to have an oath administered even in a court of law. This attitude on his part might legally have been construed as high treason punishable by hanging, in which event the brightest chapter in the dark and bloodj’ history of America’s settlement would never have been written. Penn’s noble example of faith in God and justice to the Indians would never have been given. The world would never have learned of the “disloyal” conscientious objector and pacifist who declined the offer of a regiment of soldiers to enforce his claim and who won the love of the Indian by a humane consideration of his rights. Pennsylvania would have been strangled in her infancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ruling is impractical because it defeats its own purpose, as evidenced by a parallel experience, the dismal failure of a legal experiment known as the 18th Amendment. We now know, as the result of bitter experience, that men’s appetites cannot be regulated or controlled by law. We have yet to learn that patriotic devotion cannot be induced by compulsion. The hates and hypocrisies of historj'' have been fostered by force and threats of violence. Not so its loves, which grow only under the sunlight of the good example of those who are faithfully devoted to the service of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The ruling is unjust because it works an injury upon a minority which is law-abiding, clean-living and industrious, whose only offense is that they innocently hold to the belief that Christ’s kingdom was (in fulfillment of prophecy) established in 1914, that Christ is now smiting the nations with the rod of iron, that they will be completely destroyed in the impending Battle of Armageddon, following -which Christ’s authority will be undisputed and world-wide; that then, and not until then, can school children consistently be asked to pledge allegiance to “one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">EFUSAL to salute the flag at the behest of chauvinistic educators, as part of the compulsory school routine, is becoming too stubborn to yield to the stuff-and-nonsense dictums of absent-minded professors. If the disinclination to salute the flag spreads much farther it will become a major issue in the politics of publie education. Minersville, Pa., is not the only place on the map noted for its reticence in parading its patriotism, and our public educators are slow to learn that they can no more force patriotism than the tyrant Gessler could force William Tell to kowtow to his uplifted cap, or King Nebuchadnezzar could bring Daniel to his knees in obeisance to his image. When such a ceremony takes on the appearance of petty tyranny and military despotism it would serve the interests of patriotism to discard it or ignore the few infractions. There are places where the salute can be demanded with perfect propriety, as in the army, but that place is hardly the public school. Insistence on its salute by local school boards will simply promote parochial schools, which the government seeks to discourage. Educators will do a great deal for patriotism if they will stick to their knitting and keep anti-American textbooks out of the curricula and set the good example of keeping their left hand out of the public coffers while saluting the flag with their right. The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Beacon</span><span class="font5"> hopes that the flag-saluting issue will be kept out of sight in the local school district.

<h3><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>The Attorney General of Pennsylvania</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">HE children of Pennsylvania are to be taught to love the flag, even if they have to be choked and beaten to encourage their “love”. (This was done in at least two cases.) The attorney general of Pennsylvania, Charles J. Mar-giotti, has ruled, in the case of an admittedly excellent teacher who refused to worship the flag: “Whether such refusal be based upon conscientious or religious scruples, or upon any other reason, it should be followed by immediate dismissal.” The attorney general is not charged with favoring the beating of pupils, but his “ruling” implies that coercion is all right, and that freedom of conscience and religion are to be wholly ignored. This logically leads to such misdirected efforts to foster “respect” for the flag. Obviously his ruling is contrary to the fundamental laws of the land. On the other hand, being a Roman Catholic, Margiotti would, no doubt, favor appointment of Roman Catholic teachers, who have no scruples about “saluting”, because it means nothing to them to profess outwardly what they deny inwardly. In one case on record these Catholic instruments of a foreign power wore their black habits while teaching children in one of America’s public schools. The very fact that this outfit is so strong for saluting flags should lead one to suspect that there is something rotten, and that it is not as far away as Denmark, either. The truth, plain and unvarnished, is the most dreaded enemy of the Romish ecclesiastical crowd, and since Jehovah’s witnesses stand for the truth they are rightly considered to be the worst enemies of the Papal cult. Hence, the flag-salute test is a good way to weed them out everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">NCE upon a time there was an apple-knocker by the name of William Tell. Probably there isn’t a literate person in the United States that doesn’t know about William’s famous stunt of shooting the apple off his little boy’s head. But it seems that some portions of the population have forgotten just what it was that inspired this feat of archery. To jog the memory a bit, let us recall that William had refused to obey an order to bow before the cap of the tyrannical Austrian governor of Switzerland, hung upon a post in the governor’s absence. As punishment William was sentenced to shoot the apple off his son’s head. So popular did the archer become due to his action that he was shortly able to lead an uprising which threw off the yoke of foreign rule. Now the moral to this tale is that for many centuries compulsory kowtowing to symbols of authority, has been very unpopular with freedom-loving peoples. The good folk of Massachusetts, and to a lesser extent those of Connecticut, seem to have forgotten this. As a consequence we have these absurd incidents involving various members of a religious sect known as Jehovah’s witnesses who have run afoul of a law, inspired by misguided patriotic zeal, requiring all school pupils to salute the American flag every day. The surprising thing about this situation is not the refusal of Jehovah’s witnesses, but that others not belonging to the sect have not likewise refused. Pick a thousand good, loyal, patriotic citizens, tell them they must salute the flag each time they see it, and promptly about 600 of them will rebel. That’s simply typical American perversity. If there is anything which cannot be regimented, it’s loyalty. Also, there is still some constitutional privilege concerning freedom of religion in the United States. Possibly from a strictly legalistic viewpoint the Massachusetts cases do not involve this right, but in principle they certainly do. So far as we know it is still “God and my country”, and not the other way around.—Columbus (Ohio) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Citizen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">UT to require ordinary citizens to pay the same formal respect to the flag (as soldiers, sailors and public officials) is to assume that all citizens are servants of the Government. This is deadly heresy, because the truth is that the Government is the servant of the citizens. The other thought is a survival of the old monarchical idea, which prevailed when there were no citizens, but only subjects. The American Revolution was fought to defeat the monarchical idea; so those who would reintroduce it in this country are striving to undo the work of George Washington, are raising a counter-revolution after a century and a half. They ought to be branded for what they are—false Americans, whose hearts yearn back to the system which our forefathers overthrew, the spiritual, if not the lineal, descendants of the Tories of Revolutionary times.

Yet the world has gone on and the country has met no danger, from them. If the 100-percenters would only have the principles of the flag in their hearts and in their minds and guide their actions by them, it would be vastly better. Lip-service and protestations coming from any source have no meaning, and usually the 100-percenters are fakes and frauds. —Clement H.

It is the ninth such case since recent enactment of a law requiring school children to take the oath of allegiance and salute the emblem. Undoubtedly intended to promote patriotism and respect for American authority, the Massachusetts law apparently succeeds only in making the State and our vaunted ‘patriotism’ seem a little ridiculous. The salute is intended, of course, to be merely an outward evidence of respect. But it is by no means necessary to a proper feeling of patriotism.

On the blank, above the student’s signature appear these words, “If I fail to pass or am not offered an appointment before the termination of my eligibility, my fee is to be returned to me.” The man’s son is 16 years of age. The father wants to know if the son will get his money back in 49 years. Not that you could notice it. The son will pass. Never fear. And when he “passes” the responsibility of the 'school’ also passes. The catch is all in the little word “or”. But if the unexpected should happen, and the boy should not “pass”, it would still be 49 years before one could be sure whether or not he would be offered an appointment. By that time he might be alive and so might the proprietor of the 'school’; but they might not. In either event the collection would be difficult.

They have a natural sign language that enables persons of various races and tongues to make themselves understood without the utterance of a sound. For example: The American Indians, the Australian aborigines and the deaf mutes indicate a house by placing the two hands, with the tips of the fingers together, in the form of a pointed arch; a snake is indicated by a sinuous forward movement of the hand; the command to go is by the hand raised sharply as if throwing something over the shoulder. One of the most touching scenes ever held in London was when 700 of these acted out prayers and hymns at a meeting held in St. Paul’s cathedral without the uttering of a sound.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">HE American people are duly appreciative of the acts of the National Broadcasting Company and the Columbia Broadcasting System in allotting free time on the air to the American Medical Association. When the Citizens Medical Reference Bureau, Inc. (which is against compulsory medicine or surgery for children or adults), desired some time to present their views they found they could have no time allotted. They found also that, in the case of the Columbia Broadcasting System, their application had to be submitted to a board of six allopathic M.D/s. Unable to get on the air, the Bureau registered the following protest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The allopathic school of medicine probably represents the opinion of the majority of the citizens, but it is none the less true that there is a considerable body of the citizens, including many doctors, who feel that one perhaps more important element in public health is the centering of the thought of the public on health rather than disease, on confidence rather than fear, on sanitary engineering rather than medication. It is also our feeling that entire freedom should be given both adults and children and parents of children in the selection of the brand of medicine or surgery they prefer to rely upon. There is also the obvious fact that more exaggerated claims have been made from time to time by commercial houses and commercially minded individuals as to the healing properties of certain substances, vaccines, antitoxins, etc., than unprejudiced analysis of the results achieved would support. Our feeling is that governmental agencies or semi-publie agencies, such as the radio, should not be encouraged to adopt a salesmanship attitude of assuring the public that one particular system is the only one with healing efficacy and without danger if there is any considerable body of intelligent citizens holding to the contrary. At the very least, the opposition should be given their opportunity to present the facts on the other side intelligently, amicably, and fairly. In no sense do wc question the serious and kindly intent of those men and women within or out of the medical profession who are earnestly devoting their time and labor to the relief of human suffering, nor do we differ from anyone as to his right to urge the wisdom of the means of healing recommended by him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Recently some papers appeared in medical journals by not disinterested physicians extolling certain vaccines for the prevention of whooping cough. Foliowing these publications a host of high-pressure salesmen came down to boost these products. These vaccines are, as yet, unapproved by the American Medical Association, or any health department or health authority. Their prophylactic value is still in the experimental stage. It will require many years of study and observation in institutions for children to prove their usefulness. In the end these vaccines may turn out to be either most valuable or entirely useless. In spite of the uncertainty of the prophylactic effect of these vaccines, and in order to make a few paltry dollars, a large number of physicians, especially of the younger set, have descended like locusts on innocent infants and children vaccinating every one of them that comes their way, leaving in their wake swollen arms, infections, high temperature and other discomforts. The use of vaccines or serums in children must have a definite, proved therapeutic or prophylactic indication. No foreign protein should be injected into children on a possible chance that it may do some good in the future. It is well for these enterprising doctors to stop, look and listen before this unsavory practice becomes the talk of the town.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“When the typhoid fever vaccine was first produced it was freely predicted that we would be able to conquer typhoid in our city through its use. Experiments showed that this vaccine, like that for diphtheria, toxin-antitoxin, was difficult to sell to the people.

The item explains that these vaccinations are given in the Missoula county health office. The population of Missoula county is 21,782. What happens to the 19,782 who are never vaccinated against bites of the wood tick (which number, in 1935, is 20,782) remains unexplained; but one can guess. And the guess is that they are just as well off without the serum as they would be with it. There are said to be 15,000 kinds of small bugs or beetles. Some claim that there are more. Would it be good sense to be vaccinated against bites of each kind of bug? If one were in the serum business, the answer might possibly be yes. And so it does not seem to matter seriously that in Missoula somebody let the wood tick serum get too much chilled and the health authorities could give only 1,000 shots of it, where they had planned to give twice as many. Anyway, as the story stands, the serum dispensers lost only half their business; but 90 percent of the people of the county never were customers, anyway. They have to get along just as they did before the serum was invented.</span></p>

The food with which they were poisoned was all first-class food, and well cooked. The report occupies 421 words. In the course of the report the inspector said in parenthesis ten fatal words that gave the whole thing away. Those words were “(the pot or kettle being of the usual material, aluminum)”. To be sure, those ten words of truth constitute but 2.29 percent of the total, and that still leaves the Aluminum Trust 97.71 percent master of the situation ; yet, in a job where it is desired to kill every last man, woman and child in the United States by aluminum poisoning rather than have the truth come to the light, one wonders how it was that these ten words were overlooked. Of course, the head of the “health” department overlooked the ten words. He would have overlooked them if the whole 421 words had been devoted to an angry protest against aluminum poisoning, but in that case the poor inspector would have been fired forthwith, for the poisoning must go on. After this inspector has made enough reports he will learn that nobody is interested in learning that the poisonings were due to the food's being cooked and left to stand in aluminum containers, and will say nothing further on the subject.

<p><span class="font5">BUENOS AIRES newspaper requested the United Press to send a 150-word statement by Upton Sinclair regarding the Ethiopian situation, which he supplied as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Under our social system the natural resources and means of production are in the hands of a small class, which controls the governments of all nations and makes each nation an agency for the promotion of class interest. Since all goods produced must be sold for profit, each nation competes with other nations for colonies and markets, and thus our social system leads automatically and inevitably to predatory wars. The desperation of Italy’s move against Abyssinia is merely a measure of the imminence of the collapse of her political and industrial system under the pressure of unemployment and debts both public and private. When poverty becomes greater than the masses will endure without revolution, it is necessary for the rulers of the nation to undertake a raiding expedition, to seize new wealth, and at the same time provide excitement and arouse patriotic sentiment. For Mussolini it is war or downfall, and probably both.”</span></p>

When the company came to explain the mutilation in court they attributed the mutilation to “normal wear and tear”. The utility people insist that they have not an honest man in their ranks, who can be trusted to manage a public utility plant in the interests of the public, and it appears that on this one point they have told the truth.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">E</span><span class="font5">XPLAINING His mission on earth Jesus said that He came “to give his life a ransom for many”. What did He mean by those words? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ransom</span><span class="font5"> means an exact corresponding price given to purchase a thing of value. God gave Adam the right to live upon condition that he would be obedient to God’s law. Adam’s right to life was of great value to him; and since all men are the offspring of Adam, that right to life is of value to all men. Adam violated God’s law and thereby lost the right to life, and died. All men have inherited the result of that death sentence; hence all men are born sinners, as is stated in Romans 5:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s law is unchangeable; hence Adam and all his offspring must die and remain dead forever unless provision is made for another to pay the penalty imposed upon Adam. Only the life of a perfect man could pay that penalty, because it was the perfect Adam that was sentenced to death. All the offspring of Adam being imperfect, there was no man available to take Adam’s place in death. God graciously provided the way by sending His beloved Son Jesus to earth, making Him a perfect man. Jesus was born pure, holy and without sin, and when He arrived at the age of manhood He exactly corresponded to the perfect man Adam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is written, in Hebrews 2: 9, that ‘Jesus was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, that He by the grace of God might taste death for every man’. The death of the perfect man Jesus provided the ransom price; and dying in the place and stead of the sinner, He thereby purchased the right of life for all men. There is no possible way for any man to get everlasting life save that which God has provided through Christ Jesus. It is written, ‘Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.’ The reason is that by the ransom price the right of man to life has been purchased and God gives life to all men who comply with His requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What are God’s requirements? Faith in God and in Christ Jesus, evidenced by obedience to God’s commandments. One seeking life propounded the question of how he might get life; and the answer is given (Acts 16: 31): “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved.” Further the scripture addressed to those inquiring says (Romans 10:9,10): “If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When a person realizes that by nature he is a sinner and that Jesus by purchase holds his right to life, then, if he believes, he confesses to God and Christ Jesus that he is a sinner and that Jesus is his Redeemer. In this manner the person manifests faith in God and in Christ; and the scripture says, ‘By faith is man justified.’ Faith means to receive a knowledge of God’s truth and then to confidently rely upon it and to act accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus’ words therefore mean that He gave His life a ransom or purchase price for as many as believe on Him. Knowledge of the truth is therefore of vital importance because no one can believe anything unless he first hears about it. The Scriptures say, at Romans 10:14: ‘How shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear unless some be sent to tell them?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has made provision for others to hear by sending His witnesses to bear to the people His message of truth concerning the sacrifice of Christ Jesus and the blessings to be administered to the people by and through His kingdom. Jehovah’s witnesses are coming to you with this needed information, that you may learn God’s provision to give you life everlasting. Take the books that they bring to you, and study these, together with your Bible, and find out God’s provision to administer to man everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is love; which means that God is entirely unselfish. It is written, in John 3:16: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” That means that God unselfishly provided the ransom price for man, through Christ Jesus, and this He does that all who exercise faith in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God and in Christ and devote themselves to the Lord and obey Him shall live, and shall never die. For that reason Jesus made this statement (John 8:51): &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.<sup>-</sup>’ Serve God and Christ, and live.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">By</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 0. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">11. James (Washington)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5"> HAVE been a constant reader of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> almost from the first. One of the friends gave me a couple of copies one day here in town. I did not want them at the time, and told him so, but finally took them to get rid of him. I took them home and threw them down and did not look at them for several days. One day when I didn’t have anything else to read I hunted them up and read them and sent in my subscription at once, and, thanks be to God, it is still coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before that I had been a member of Satan’s dead organization for about twenty years. I believed in eternal torment, Devil dreams and visions, palmistry, astrolog}<sup>7</sup>, “divine” healing, talking with the dead, League of Nations, immortality of the soul, and was always afraid of seeing ghosts on very dark nights. I also believed in the unlucky thirteen, but fortunately I did eat at a table where there were thirteen seated at dinner before I thought to count noses, and not one of us died during the year either. I guess I had about a full quota of all the Devil’s deceptions, excepting the trinity: that was too much of a gag for me to swallow. I never could understand it until I began to understand the light of the truth of God’s Word. But now praise God for His great goodness and His wonderful light, for all my night has passed away. Judge Rutherford has made the whole subject clear and plain in very few words in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age; </span><span class="font5">also a more lengthy explanation is given in the hook </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I did not know that the Kingdom had been horn. I hadn’t heard that the King was present. The abomination of desolation was a mystery. Satan’s organization was not in sight. Babies went straight to heaven at death, the preacher said so; likewise all good people who attended church and paid their dues regularly. All others were headed straight for hell. It was here that I began reading </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> and later </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The 'Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> and that wonderful set of Judge Rutherford’s books. Each and all are a goldmine of information to those seeking the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is my eighth year in the service of the King. I am standing firm on the solid rock. “Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.”</span></p>

The Torres Strait islands were visited without landing permits’ having been first obtained. Though the natives, many of whom read English, were delighted with the music and lectures, and obtained about two hundred bound books, yet the Anglican missionary of the district, being grieved that they taught the people (Acts 4:2), was mean and small enough to report the landing to the magistrate, who happened to be away at the time. Quarantine and other regulations were innocently contravened in this instance. The Devil knew it, and his chosen sons, the clergy (John 8:44), are always on the job, to do whatever mischief is possible.</span></p>

It is to be hoped, if the wounded man’s nerves go back on him, and he becomes delirious, that the attendants will not choke him with a towel around his neck, or pummel him in the stomach, or put him in an ice pack, as is the custom in the land of the free and the home of the brave, in military hospitals for the insane; for, if they do, the wounded man will probably be sorry that he did not have the good luck to go right through to heaven and dodge all the discomforts en route, the same as the other four in the picture.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">‘ ‘ Today much is spoken about the youth bearing the inheritance of the great war. To avoid a false conception it is necessary to know exactly just what is the inheritance of the dead in the great Avar. This inheritance is that the nation is the last word in potential value, a value before which everything else is secondary. Christ, of whom we are in ignorance as to which professed religion contains his true doctrines, has sunk down in the darkness of history. Now we recognize that his visage-marred death, for which the world butchered itself, is of no value to us. But on the other hand the death of those heroic fighters fox’ a nation of Germans is a deed making the old-time ransom mystery superfluous. The death of these heroes fighting for a new empire was not less voluntary than the death of the Nazarene, and their’ death speaks volumes to us, because it represents a sacrificial death for the great nation of Germans. In face of this fact the cross as a symbol of a formci’ most precious value must retreat before the emblem of the highest living value—the nation. The war monuments in German lands are altars of the next generation, and the unknown soldier of the great war is a fitting pathfinder of the next empire, who shall replace Jesus of Nazareth.” (From the German </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age,</span><span class="font4"> June 1, 1935, page 7.)</span></p>

I mean the one that the Catholic campaign is consciously or unconsciously causing when it works so intensely to divide and even place against each other two great nations which nature has made neighbors and which common sense, if nothing else, should keep friends?’ The truth is that the acts of the Mexican government do not permit fair-minded observers to accuse the government of any persecution.</span></p>

The OGPU, Russia’s dreaded secret army police, were believed to be seeking the overthrow of Stalin. They had great power, but not enough. The Red Army was called in, the OGPU became at once not a haven of safety, but a place of death. Something like 200 were slain. Trials were secret, and death by shooting followed instantly upon conviction. At one time, in the dead of winter, there were hundreds of refugees hiding in the forests, exposed to hunger and cold. In some instances they started big forest fires as a protection against pursuing soldiers. The man who murdered Sergei Kiroff was put to death along with his wife, son, two daughters and 85-year-old mother. Probably the latter was glad to go, to get away from such a place and condition.</span></p>

Any German may arrest any Jew, tie and fetter him, and the Jew may not sue him for illegal detention. Hotels and rooming houses near Berlin are putting up signs, “Jews not served here.” Courts have ruled that it is “undesirable” for Jewish attorneys to appear as counsel. Trucks decorated with anti-Jewish signs parade the streets and highways. Although Jews are denied full citizenship rights, they are nevertheless compelled to serve in the German army. In some districts business men and persons on relief have been warned that they must not buy from Jews, otherwise they will be excluded from municipal orders and from relief. In a Nazi official statement by Streicher the Jews have been described as “a mixture of Nordics, Mongols and Negroes, carrying in their soul the bad qualities of all these races”. Some employers have ordered all their employees to break off all business and social relations with Jews, on pain of dismissal.</span></p>

What is more, a native named Kauri did wear a shirt on November 21, 1934, and was fined 2/6d for the offense. He failed to pay, and, in the words of the “authorities”, absconded. On April 29,1935, the same young man came into the shopping area of Port Moresby, and again he committed the heinous offense of having on a shirt (maybe the same one, probably so, and maybe unwashed in the intervening five months). The police grabbed him, asked him to produce his permit to wear a shirt (which permit he had not obtained), and not being able to do so he was fined 10 shillings, which he could not pay, and was forced to go to prison for 30 days, with the first fine of 2/6d still hanging over him. The conscience of the British government is in the care of the Church of England. The missionaries lay great stress on clothes, and probably had got the information to this poor black man that the ability to wear a shirt is about the most important thing the Lord requires of anybody. Gog save the kink!! E Pluribus Aluminum! The police stole the boy’s shirt, and at the expiration of his sentence sent him home without it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Society of Martians, has written an open letter to President Roosevelt setting forth how public confidence can be restored in one day and national prosperity within two weeks if the Government will only act upon its prerogative of creating unborrowed money for all national governmental purposes. His argument, in part, is as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The statement that every cash dollar is a thirty-five-times-borrowed dollar is verified by the fact that we have less than six billion dollars in paper and metal money (gold is not in use), while the total debts of our governments, our institutions and people approximate 210 billions of dollars. These figures show, therefore, that every cash dollar in the country is a thirty-fivc-times-borrowcd dollar. To explain the monstrous bunco game in another way is to say that we owe the money-changers thirty-five times more than all the United States cash currency in the country. So, if the people of the United States were to attempt to pay all the money they owe the money-changers they would find that after gathering together every cash dollar in the country (which of course they could not because it already belongs to the money-changers), they would still be short $205,000,000,000. If they then attempted to settle their debts by surrendering all their property to their creditors at its taxable rate value (estimated at 150 billion dollars) they would find themselves $55,000,000,000 short of squaring their account. In simple yet startling words, the people of the United States are today in a financial hole approximately $50,000,000,000 below the line of financial bankruptcy, and with no possible way of getting out of the hole without the nation’s undergoing a monetary revolution. Our $210,000,000,000 industrial deficit is ample proof of the statement.”</span></p>

Almost every effort of the nation to do away with organized crime has been obstructed by lawyers who make it their business to protect criminals in their activities. An effort is now being made to clean up the legal profession and to purge it of lawyers who will assist by giving advice to criminals even before the crime is committed. (This calls to mind indulgences sold by “holy church” in the Middle Ages, which forgave sins a sinner thought he might commit at some future date.) The “shyster” lawyer is ready to give his regular support to the habitual criminal and get him “protection” before, during and after the crime, if need be. Criminals can get professional advice so as to proceed in a defensible though none the less effective and criminal course of action in gaining their ends.</span></p>

The refusal to give the soldiers their bonus was a crime against civilization.

<p><span class="font5">AM sending in a few facts concerning this </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">J- </span><span class="font5">land of the free. A man from the government has been in and around Buena Vista testing the cattle for tuberculosis. If a party protested he was told it was compulsory, and in one case the government man got the sheriff:. Now here is where the rub comes in. It is O.K. to rid the community of tubercular cattle, if they have tuberculosis, or, as far as that goes, any contagious disease, but the cattle that are condemned are shipped to a central location, in this case Denver, Colo. They are shipped there and sold alive or butchered for meat, which meat is to be canned and distributed to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Now, what I’m wondering is this: Is this meat fit for consumption, supposed to be tubercular, canned or otherwise? Those who had cattle condemned and which cattle were shipped didn’t get a receipt of any kind showing that the government got said cattle. The government man appraised the stock at $35 per head, and stated that the owner would get $20 or thereabouts, but how is the owner going to be sure of what he will get, not having a receipt showing that the government got the stock? One middle-aged couple gave up three head, which were their entire means of self-support. Is this right in a land that is supposed to be free?”—W. E. S----,</span></p>

The Russian thistle is very easy to handle in any fields where the growing crop is cultivated, but in small grain fields, where the grain is a poor stand, or the weather unfavorable to its natural development, especially when drought is the unfavorable condition, Russian thistles literally take the field. Then in stubble fields of the Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas a rank growth of Russian thistles is very common. The young plants are almost as soft as down. Cattle, hogs and horses go out of their way, when grass is plentiful, to eat these young plants. They are succulent and nutritious. Tame hay, cut where Russian thistles are present in this early stage, is rather improved in palatability and nutritive value. The thorns begin to develop according to the season and the location of the growing plant. In cultivated land, where there is little competition, plants may be as large as a half-bushel measure and be handled barehanded with impunity. In sod they may be very small, and irritate through a thickness of cloth. Thousands of tons of Russian thistles were eaten green last year by livestock in the belt west of the Missouri. Other thousands of tons were stacked for winter feed. After blossoming stage is reached Russian thistles are very harsh, woody and covered all over with short, sharp thorns, but probably thousands of cattle are alive today in the middle west because of Russian thistles.”— F.

<p><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font5">EFORE the dawn of the twentieth century, it is estimated, about twenty thousand millions of the children of Adam had been born, run their little span of a fraction of a century, breathed their last, and moldered into dust. They await the Life-giver, without whom all is lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Suppose you had been one of these Suppose you could have had the choice of being of any race, living in any clime, and at any period in those fifty-nine centuries. What would have been your choice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Would you have chosen to be one of the multitudes that gazed with awe upon the military achievements of Alexander the Great, or Caesar, or Napoleon, or any other man that filled the world with widows and orphans, and with blood and tears? Would you even have been willing to be any one of these imperial impersonations of force and murder? You know you would not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would have been a great inducement to live to see the dramas of which Joseph, and Moses, and Mordecai, and David, and Daniel and Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-nego were central figures, or to be one of these, but no one of these brought eternal life to any, and they, all alike, await the voice of Him who spake as never man spake, when they shall rise from their dwellingplaces in the dust.

<h3><a name="bookmark226"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>And So You Were Like Nathanael</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Nathanael Bartholomew was not a great man, as the world counts greatness, and never pretended or desired to be. He was just a common, ordinary man who wanted to be right and do right, and he was hoping the great hope that had been instilled in him by his parents and other teachers that a great Savior would soon make His appearance and he and all such might thereafter and for ever be delivered out of the hands of all their enemies and serve Jehovah God without fear of death or any other evil, in holiness and righteousness, forever and forever. The apostle John always calls Nathanael by his proper name; all the other sacred writers called him Bartholomew (son of Ptolemy).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nathanael was born at Cana, five miles northeast of Nazareth, on the road from Nazareth to those cities at the head of the sea of Galilee where Jesus lived (Capernaum) and where most of His mighty works were performed, there and at Chorazin and Bethsaida. Cana and Nazareth were some twenty-five or thirty miles distant from the three cities last named, which are all within a radius of five miles of each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The word &quot;Bethsaida” means &quot;fishing town”. It was the happy fortune of that town that Jesus selected three of its residents, Peter, Andrew and Philip, to be His disciples. Jesus was at the convention of John the Baptist at Bethabara and was just about to accept an invitation to the wedding at Cana. A day would be required to make the journey. The day following would be the wedding, near His old home town of Nazareth, when the story opens as recorded in John 1: 43-51:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;The day following, Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me. Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter. Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see. Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">slialt see greater things than these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.'’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark228"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>Nathanael Was a Man of Prayer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">Nathanael was a man of prayer. He was '■’found” by Philip, as Philip himself was “found” by Jesus. Both were sought after. Both were previously known. Probably both were followers of John the Baptist, and had been baptized of him, con Cessing their sins. Both, without a doubt, were friends of Andrew, Peter, James and John, who lived in Philip’s own town, and probably by this time the whole convention knew that John the Baptist had pointed out Jesus as “the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The record seems to show that this finding of both Philip and Nathanael was at Bethabara, in the valley of the Jordan, some thirty or more miles from their home, and an equal number of miles (nearly) from Cana and Nazareth. Here was one of John’s favorite places for baptisms; thousands were in attendance. Twice at this convention John the Baptist had called attention to Jesus as the Lamb of God. It is not so easy to “find” people at a convention of thousands of earnest seekers after truth. This was demonstrated recently at Washington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At any rate, even before Nathanael was “found” he was alone with God under a fig tree, and doubtless upon his knees, away from all prying eyes, asking God to direct his course. He did not assume to know it all. He knew he needed guidance. He was ready to be taught of God. He was ready to be led. He wanted only to be led in the right way, and he prayed that God would help him, that he might make no mistake in something so vital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are two ways that Jesus could have seen Nathanael. The most natural one would be that He had seen him with His natural eyes when Nathanael withdrew from the others to pray for guidance; the other would be that, by the ministrations of the angels, a miracle was performed, and an act of television was performed two thousand years ahead of time, by which Jesus saw hiin no matter where He himself chanced to be at the moment. At any rate the identification was complete, and according to the will of Jehovah God, who ‘sets the members in the body as it pleases Him’.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark230"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark231"></a>No Miracles Yet Performed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">No miracles had yet been performed by Jesus. John and Andrew stayed at His lodging place the day when Jesus was identified as the Lamb of God. The next day Peter was located, and the day following, Philip and Nathanael. It is probable that the very day that Philip and Nathanael were found, all five were on their way home. They may all have gone back to the head of the sea of Galilee, some forty-five or fifty miles, by way of Cana, and probably did. In any case it is likely that Nathanael went along with Jesus to the wedding which was to occur at his birthplace. Probably the people that were to be married were well known to Nathanael; they were certainly well known to Jesus, because Jesus’ mother seemed to feel and to show considerable responsibility for the happy management of things pertaining to the marriage festivities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the conclusion of the marriage festivities, after the water had been turned into wine, and the ruler of the feast had praised the wine as excellent, the account says: “This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples [the four, including Nathanael, summoned within the past three days] believed on him. After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples.”—John 2:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was a happy party that went down from Cana to Capernaum; but one of the happiest of all, it is easy to understand, was Nathanael. One day he is praying that he may not go astray in following the one pointed out by John the Baptist as the Lamb of God; the next (or possibly the same day) Philip finds him and tells him that they have really found the Christ, he invites him to come and see that it is really true, and Jesus comforts his fluttering heart by telling him that He knows he is a lover of God, guileless and true, that He saw him under the fig tree, and that he shall have still greater evidence that He i’s all Nathanael supposed Him to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That very same day “Jesus would go forth into Galilee”, and it is exceedingly probable that the whole group of five went along to the wedding. What an opportunity that would be for Nathanael and all the rest, to ask questions, but, above all, to listen to the One who spake as never man spake!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark232"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark233"></a>The Curious Promise</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">In Nathanael's mind there would be Jesus’ curious promise, (Hereafter)<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark234">1</a></sup> &quot;ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.” How could that be fulfilled? When would it be fulfilled? Would there be more than one fulfillment? He would wait and see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not necessary to alter the story by even one word to see the first fulfillment. It took place at Nathanael’s birthplace, at the wedding at Cana of Galilee, where the first miracle was performed. Nathanael there had it clearly revealed to him that the angels of God acting as Jesus’ messengers always have access to the face of the Father which is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When Mary came to Jesus saying, &quot;They have no wine,” it may be that Nathanael took the matter to God in prayer, or he may have heard Jesus do so. In any event the angels of God “ascended”; they had access to the Father’s face; heaven was opened to them; and the result followed that Jesus had predicted. They descended upon the Son of man with commission from the Most High God to turn the water into wine, and well they fulfilled their commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Subsequently, on the night of the betrayal, Nathanael heard Jesus say: “Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions [120,000] of angels?”—Matthew 26:53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not claimed for Nathanael that he was a man of strong faith; rather, his faith was weak. But he had a good heart, and Jesus said, ‘These are they that have received the word into good and honest hearts.’ And because he had a good heart, and because he wanted to do right and be led in the right way, and asked to be led in that way, he got his heart’s desires.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark235"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark236"></a>It All Hinged upon His Obedience</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">But it all hinged upon his obedience. He prayed for guidance. That prayer was answered by Philip’s coming to him and telling him of the great ‘find’. It sounded too good to be true. Nathanael had come from Cana, of which, it might almost be said, Nazareth was but a suburb. He knew the town did not amount to much. He knew it was mentioned in the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When he obeyed he got the blessing. First he had the unspeakable privilege of meeting the One who would die for him that he might live; then he heard that One commend him for his guilelessness, and for his secret prayer for guidance before Philip found him. Then he (most probably, following the record as it runs) walked with Jesus a day’s journey to Cana; then he saw with his own eyes a miniature fulfillment of Jesus’ promise about ‘the angels of God ascending and descending upon Him’ with their gifts from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it did not stop there. The next day he was with the disciples that trudged another day’s march to Capernaum. Then he was with Jesus the rest of His earthly life. He (along with Peter, Thomas, James and John) was one of those who saw Jesus after His resurrection.— John 21: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He did not leave any record except that of his obedience, recorded by John. What more could he leave? Is not that enough? Now he is for ever with the Lord. Does he now see heaven’s portals open to the wishes of the Son of God, now at the temple for judgment work? What think you? Why, you see that yourself. Does he see the angels returning with their gifts, the gifts of an understanding of the prophecies, and the guidance of God’s true remnant on earth further and further in the way that leads to the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the Happy Day? You know he does. You know that he is himself a treasured part of the organization of the great Jehovah God, one of those privileged to inquire forever and forever in the temple. “And still new beauties shall he see, and still increasing light.” And all because he was obedient.</span></p>

While there have been frauds in Italy in such matters within very recent years, and such frauds have been mentioned in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font5"> yet it is quite possible that these two cases are not frauds, but are genuine manifestations of demonism, made public to hold poor creatures in bondage to a devilish ecclesiastical system, and to dishonor God by falsely making it appear that He is interested in seeing others sweat a bloody sweat, as Christ did at Gethsemane.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Kellogg Peace Pact</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">W</span><span class="font5">HY, yes, to be sure, there is the Kellogg</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peace Pact, originated in the United States, that denounces war as immoral and declares against it as an instrument of national policy. Ethiopia, threatened by a powerful murderer already at its very door, happened to think of the Kellogg Pact, and drew it to Uncle Sain’s attention. And Uncle Sam, with sublime hypocrisy, sent back a note that he could not believe that Italy would do such a thing. But on the very same day Mussolini stood on top of a cannon and said that Italy would not be turned aside, and on the very same day the United States ordered out of Ethiopia all the 125 American citizens who then were there. And thus endeth the Kellogg Peace Pact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ethiopia Would Prefer British Rule</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">I</span><span class="font5">N AN address at London the Ethiopian minister to London, Dr. Azaj AV. C. Martin, let fall the statement: “In any case, if worst comes to worst, I think my people would rather be under the just and considerate administration of Britain than Italy.” And perhaps that is what may happen, temporarily. The Ethiopians are up against it. Of the emperor’s fleet of twelve planes only five can get </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font5"> the ground at all, and if one should go up in the sight of Italy’s air force the aviator in charge would be dead before he reached the ground. Ethiopia, humanly speaking, has no chance whatever. The trained lions which once sat on either side of the king, and which on occasion could be used to dispose of unwelcome guests, are now replaced by dogs.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">elassie’s priests are like all the others. They have been going about among the Ethio</span><span class="font5">pians and assuring the young men who will be slain that those dying for their country will be sure of heaven. Talk is cheap, and a priest is paid to talk. No man would cheerfully urge an other man to die, while he himself stayed in the rear, except for good and sufficient compensation. It goes in Ethiopia, the same as in all other lands where this century-old fraud is perpetrated, that the priest is in the priest business because it is a relatively safe and exceedingly well paid job. As far as the common man is concerned, the priest cares nothing whatever what becomes of him, and would not even pray to get him out of a purgatory bake oven without being paid for it.</span></p>
