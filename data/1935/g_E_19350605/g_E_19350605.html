<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses — “To the Lions!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH uses the lion as a symbol of justice and judgment. (Revelation 4:6-8) Christ Jesus is the judicial officer of Jehovah God to whom is committed all judgment in heaven and in earth, together with the authority and power to execute judgment. (John 5:22-27) Jesus Christ is therefore appropriately named “The Lion of the tribe of Juda”. (Revelation 5:5) “Juda” meaning praise, Christ Jesus is the Head and chief of all who praise and serve Jehovah. His judgments are in strict harmony with justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the workers of iniquity Christ Jesus, the Executioner of Jehovah’s judgment, is a power of evil (that is, punishment for their iniquity), but to those who love and serve Jehovah He, the Chief Officer of Jehovah, is a shield and strength and protection.—Philippians 4:13; 1 Timothy 1:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the construction and operation of his organization Satan has attempted to mimic Jehovah. By this means he has succeeded in bringing much reproach upon the name of the Most High. Satan uses the lion to represent his law, his abortive justice, and his judgments. In Satan’s organization men are condemned to death and are often literally thrown to the lions for execution, and the multitude, beholding the infliction of the penalty of the law, wag their heads and remark: “That man got justice.” But in this they were wrong. For centuries men have organized governments, made laws, and tried to administer them in the way of justice; but in almost every instance they have failed and their failures have been due to the power and influence of the wicked one, Satan. In the world the failure of the law and justice to go hand in hand has caused the people to have little respect for the law and also has caused them to greatly reproach the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With Jehovah His law and equity are the same. This is not true in the organizations of men under Satan’s control. Men who organize and rule the nations of the world frequently make and enforce laws exactly contrary to justice. With them law and justice do not mean the same thing, even though the ruling element attempt to induce the common people to believe that law and justice are one and the same. Often when laws that are proper in themselves are improperly construed and enforced the result is great injustice against the person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the religious organizations, such as the Catholic hierarchy, find it desirable to rid themselves of annoyance created now by Jehovah’s witnesses in telling the truth, that politicalreligious organization brings forth a scheme to accomplish its purpose in an apparently lawful manner. The Catholic hierarchy widely advertises itself as strictly adhering to and obeying the law, while at the same time violating the spirit of the law in almost every instance. If </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">person is found doing something that is displeasing to the Catholic hierarchy and its agents, at once an effort is made to find some “lawful means” by which the supposed offender may be apprehended and severely punished. This is very often true, even though the one charged with wrongdoing is at the time proceeding exactly in accordance with God’s law.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Framing Mischief by Law</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The law of God commands His witnesses to go from house to house and preach the gospel of His kingdom. (Matthew 10:11-14; Acts 20: 20) It is the duty of God’s servants to obey this law. When they do so in obedience to God’s commandments the ecclesiastics, particularly the Catholic hierarchy and their agents, misapply and misconstrue the commercial law of men which makes it unlawful for a person to go from house to house and sell goods, wares and merchandise, and they insist that Jehovah’s witnesses should be severely punished, on the theory that they are violating the laws of commerce, although the hierarchy well know that</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in a commercial work. The real purpose of the hierarchy and their agents is to rid the community of Jehovah’s witnesses, and the real and primary author of their unjust scheme and procedure is Satan the Devil. This is proof that the Catholic hierarchy and its agents form a part of the Devil’s organization.—Romans 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A striking example of the injustice of certain laws and the enforcement thereof is found in the sixth chapter of the prophecy of Daniel. Since ‘‘whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope” (Romans 15:4), this record concerning the prophet Daniel was written and kept for the benefit of all who in these last days are endeavoring to serve Jehovah according to His commandments. “Christendom’s” rulers, particularly the religious element thereof, have a strong desire to be rid of Jehovah’s witnesses because such witnesses tell the truth and the truth exposes the sins and delinquencies of the religionists. The experience of Daniel aids one to understand why Jehovah’s witnesses continue to suffer at the hands of men who proceed against them under laws that are conceived in malice and enforced in wickedness.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Epitome</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The record of the sixth chapter of Daniel's prophecy followed immediately upon the fall of Babylon and the coming into power of Darius the Mede as king of Medo-Persia. Babylon being used throughout Scripture to symbolize Satan’s organization, Darius here appears to picture Jehovah God in whom supreme regal power is vested and who assumes rulership over the world from and after 1914, the year in which “the times of the Gentiles” ended. (Luke 21: 24) As The Revelation, chapter 12, shows, Satan was then cast out of heaven, and from and after 1918 Darius, whose name means “coercer, conservator”, pictured Jehovah exercising His power in things pertaining to earth. Daniel (his name meaning “God’s judge”) pictured Christ Jesus, the Judge of all things in heaven and earth; he also pictured Jehovah’s ‘elect servant’ (Isaiah 42:1), of which Christ Jesus is the Head and chief and which includes the faithful remnant of His body members, Jehovah’s witnesses now on earth, who are joined together with Christ Jesus in the covenant for the kingdom of heaven. The lions, being the king’s lions, picture justice of Almighty God. The power of Jehovah God in shutting the mouths of these wild beasts against Daniel foreshadows His protection of those who are wholly devoted to Him as are Jehovah’s witnesses today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom [of Medo-Persia] an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; and over these three presidents, of whom Daniel was first [or, was one]; that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage.” (Daniel 6:1,2) Correspondingly, the ruling group of “Christendom” now on earth assume to represent God’s kingdom, and hence by their assumption they place themselves in an implied covenant to truly represent God’s kingdom but, on the contrary, they are opposed to the Kingdom. Due to its vast colonial possessions and mandates by the League of Nations “Christendom” has its ruling power operating practically throughout the entire earth, as foreshadowed by the 120 satraps of the empire of Medo-Persia scattered tliroughout the various provinces thereof. But to Jehovah’s witnesses, as “the faithful and wise servant” class, are committed all the “goods” or kingdom interests of the King, and they as a faithful remnant deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ according to the commandments of Jehovah God. (Matthew 24:45-47; Revelation 12:17) Back there Daniel “was one” and the only real one of the “presidents”, and even so now Jehovah’s remnant, who are Ilis witnesses, are the “first<sup>-</sup>’ and only real ones who may speak with authority from the King and to whom the King has duly delegated authority to speak in His name.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Conspiracy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">“Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.”—6:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Exactly similar things come to pass in these wicked days. “Christendom,” and particularly its religious element, now seeks some apparent</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ly</span><span class="font8"> lawful means to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses because their telling the truth interferes with the wrongdoers. The clergy have gone to the political element, whom the clergy wrongfully designate as “the higher powers . . . ordained of God” (Romans 13:1), and have laid charges against </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8">ehovah’s witnesses, charging them with being lawbreakers, communists, revolutionists, and anarchists. These malicious conspirators know that their charges are wickedly false, and this proves that their conspiracy is conceived in malice and prosecuted with extreme cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Even after the worldly courts have repeatedly held that Jehovah’s witnesses are not lawbreakers, the religious element and their immediate allies continue to cause the arrest and imprisonment of these witnesses. As no real fault was found in Daniel, even so none can be found in Jehovah’s witnesses in their work which would justify their arrest and imprisonment. They cannot be faithful to Jehovah God and at the same time engage in lawbreaking, such as revolution and anarchy, or otherwise willfully do injury to men. To the faithful followers of Christ Jesus the commandments are given to “love thy neighbour”, and “love worketh no ill to his neighbour”.—Romans 13:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The modern-day conspirators, particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy, well know that the truth is their greatest danger and that if the common people know the truth, these ecclesiastics will lose their power and control over the people and their opportunity to fleece the people will be done; hence they want to “get” the ones whom Daniel foreshadowed, namely, Jehovah’s witnesses, who testify to the truth. At first they treated Jehovah’s witnesses with silent contempt, and then the truth stung them so terrifically and so terribly “shocked their sensibilities” that they were moved to act. Simultaneously they attempt to have a law passed in New Jersey (and it has passed there), New York, the provinces of Canada, in England and in other places, upon the pretext that such law is necessary to protect the people from the wicked movement known as Nazism, which now controls Germany. At the same time they well know that their real purpose is to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses. In Germany the Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Nazis, though not apparently, yet work hand in hand. How? The Nazis are engaged in an effort to kill Jehovah’s witnesses. The Roman Catholic hierarchy is engaged in the same unrighteous business. Whenever some unusual and drastic measure is introduced in the legislative halls the claim is made that “an emergency has arisen”, hence action </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">must</span><span class="font8"> be taken!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Issue</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">“Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever. All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.”—6: 6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Satan seems always to have held that “religious groups” should be safeguarded from slander and libel and hence no one should be permitted to speak the truth or act any truth that would tend to call attention to the frauds and hypocritical practices of such Baal-religion groups. This really involves the great issue: Jehovah God or the Devil, who is supreme? It was tried out with Daniel, and it is tried out now, and the result is certain to be the same way, for Jehovah is at the helm. Of course, any Jew, including Daniel, could within the secrets of his own heart and in his secluded bedchamber make petition to Jehovah and be heard by Jehovah just as well as in doing so by public prayer, and, he so doing in secret, the rulers in the governments could hot know about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The same is also true of the present day. Such hidden worship by Jehovah’s witnesses might be carried on by praying to Him and talking secretly to others about His kingdom without even the hierarchy’s knowing it. But such hidden worship would be positive evidence of fear of man, and a silent admission that Jehovah is not supreme and cannot protect and deliver His own. This is exactly what Satan now desires to accomplish. The Lord foreknew this and warns that The fear of man leadeth into a snare’. (Proverbs 29:25) But “the fear of the Lord tendeth to life”. (Proverbs 19:23) To be a true worshiper of Almighty God one must obey His commandments, one of which is, “Ye are my witnesses” (Isaiah 43:10,12); that is to say, you must make known to others that your trust is in Jehovah and that He is the only source of life and blessings and the One to whom all proper petition can be presented with certainty of having the same answered.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Making the State Supreme</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Back there, to limit all prayers to the king of Persia would be making the king a god and allowing him to control the conscience of men. Such would show supremacy of a power other than Almighty God. The conspiring satraps proposed a law that would make the state the supreme power, to which all the people must yield and thus blindly obey a human dictator. It is exactly so today. Every part of the earth is in a state of turmoil. The powers that rule are being defied by the lawless. The clergy and all religion-mongers come forth with pious faces and hypocritical words and say to the political powers, in substance, this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘The communistic and revolutionists spirit is due to a lack of proper respect for the religious groups in the land; therefore give us a law with teeth in it, which law will not permit any person or organization to in any manner speak or publish or say or do anything that might in any manner whatsoever subject our religious groups to ridicule, scorn, or contempt/ Further the religious conspirators say, ‘This is a Christian nation, and it is the Christian duty of all to be subservient to the state in order that there may be peace and prosperity in the land/ Those words seem to be well chosen, but the speakers know they are hypocritical. They know that their claim is false and that their real purpose is to rid the land of those who faithfully serve and worship Jehovah God and speak the truth about His King and kingdom, which is the only hope of the world. (Matthew 12:21) These conspirators demand, therefore, that provision be made by law that whatsoever the people may hear by radio, phonograph, transcription-record machine, word of mouth, printed page or other means of communication, must first be approved by a committee appointed by the state; hence no one would be permitted to say anything until it is first censored by the duly appointed groups. They proceed to make up a committee of Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who practice their own religion, each of a different kind, and none of which serve Jehovah God, and this committee attempts to tell the people what they shall or shall not hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The evidence offered before the Congress of the United States in 1934, and before the state legislative body in New Jersey in the same year, abundantly proves that the clergy, and particularly the Roman Catholic hierarchy, have formed and are carrying out a conspiracy to prevent the people from worshiping Almighty God as He has commanded them. The enactment of such drastic laws which are destructive of freedom of speech and of press, so far as religion is concerned, proves beyond all doubt that the real purpose is to prevent the people from hearing the truth of and concerning Jehovah God and His kingdom. The Devil himself is back of such a movement.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Permission</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">The enemy of Jehovah’s witnesses desire God’s approval to go ahead in their destructive work, and hence they seek a “lawful means” to accomplish the same. They have long held and openly advocated that the political element of the world rule by divine right and hence that if they can have a law put upon the statute books under which they might “frame” Jehovah’s witnesses they can thereby bring about their destruction and do so in apparently a lawful manner and with the approval of God, as foreshadowed by King Darius. Because the action of the conspirators was, in Daniel’s time, and is now, a challenge to Almighty God, the King eternal, He responds to them as He did on another occasion to the Devil: “Thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.” (Job 2:3) “Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which [throne] frameth mischief by a law?”—Psalm 94: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The king, Darius, yielded to the request of the satraps. This illustrates how Jehovah permits ‘the wicked to spring up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity to flourish’ (Psalm 92:7), and to use so-called “legal” means or methods to bring about the destruction of faithful witnesses of the Lord. God permits the earthly ruling factors to pursue their own way and to enact laws according to their own selfish ideas and to enforce the same, that such laws may operate as a test to His own people; but that does not mean at all that God approves such cruel and unrighteous laws. The great question involved is the vindication of Jehovah’s name, and hence that means that His anointed ones must receive the test and continue to maintain their integrity toward God until the end.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>To the Lions!</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">“Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.” (6:10) Had Daniel gone to the king and asked for a permit or a license to pray to Jehovah, that would have been conforming to the decree of the king, because he must first get the consent of the king before he could pray, and that would be showing that he did not sincerely hold that Jehovah is supreme and above the king on earth, which course of action would have been an insult to Jehovah. The state or earthly government is not a mediator between God and men. Jehovah is above all, and His law is supreme and His people will obey it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As it was with Daniel, so it is with Jehovah’s witnesses. By disregarding the unrighteous law of the realm, Daniel would bring upon him death, but unfaithfulness to Jehovah God would bring upon him destruction. Even so today, Jehovah’s witnesses, by disregarding some law of the land, may be subjected to death, but their disregarding or disobeying Jehovah’s law means the complete destruction of their very existence, as Jesus declared, at Matthew 10:28. To obey Jehovah’s law the faithful anointed ones cannot hide themselves by declining to openly testify to His name, nor can they have an excuse to sit quietly in their homes and hum hymns and read religious books. The true and faithful are Jehovah’s witnesses, and they must not cease to bear the ‘fruits of His kingdom’ before men and to pray for the increase of Jehovah’s kingdom interests and for the destruction of Satan’s rule. In the faithful performance of their divinely given commission the faithful remnant know that they are putting themselves in a position of jeopardy at the hands of men who claim to execute God’s justice for Him; but the remnant are blind to everything save that of fully obeying Jehovah God.—Isaiah 42:19.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>“Dare to Be a Daniel”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">And so Daniel, notwithstanding King Darius’ efforts against it, was thrown to the lions. (6:11-17) Today Jehovah permits His witnesses to be delivered up and subjected to unjust punishment, that the test may be applied in vindication of His name and as a testimony against His enemies. (Mark 13:9) The den of lions was a place of fearfulness and of great danger, and hence a place of certain death to Daniel unless Jehovah furnished him protection. Let those who are faithfully performing their covenant in serving Jehovah God today be just as fearless as was Daniel. Manifestly Daniel did not show any fear. His persecutors were vicious, even as the persecutors and conspirators against Jehovah’s witnesses today are vicious and are just as vicious as wild beasts, and would, thinking themselves to be God’s “lions” of justice, just as quickly tear God’s faithful ones to shreds if permitted to do so. But the lions in the den where Daniel was put were the king’s lions, and therefore those lions pictured Jehovah’s forces of justice, which forces do destroy those who are guilty of breaking the divine law. Jehovah’s witnesses are in danger when the conspirators or executioners assume to be ‘bearers of God’s sword not in vain’ (Romans 13:4), and this they do when taking the law into their own hands. They fail to reckon that God is looking after His own. Jehovah knows full well who serves Him in spirit and in truth, and His own He will preserve.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Deliverance</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Daniel was in the lions’ den all night, and that would afford ample time for the unchangeable law of the realm to be fully satisfied and justice to be fully executed. The lions in that den were the king’s, and hence they represented Jehovah’s justice. Those lions could not destroy Jehovah’s faithful servant, and hence, as Daniel said to King Darius, “My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, 0 king, have I done no hurt.” (6:22) Nor will God’s justice today destroy those who are faithful and true to Him. The malicious enemies may kill the body of some of those who are faithful to Jehovah, but the everlasting existence of these anointed ones is in the hand of the Most High, and nothing can pluck them out. In these wicked days of conspiracy against God’s anointed the beastly element that now rules the earth would quickly destroy them except for the protection that God furnishes through His angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The preservation of Daniel by Jehovah’s angel was proof that Daniel had been faithful. Likewise the preservation of the remnant of God’s organization is a confirmation that these witnesses have been faithfully maintaining their integrity before God. Daniel’s being taken up from the lions’ den seems to picture more particularly that there would be a series of acts of deliverance by Jehovah of the members of His anointed remnant now on earth, to the end that they might continue to serve as His witnesses. (Psalm 68: 20, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> Such acts of deliverance would be an indication of Jehovah’s approval of His servant class. The conspirators reason that the punishment of Jehovah’s witnesses by the terms of their (the conspirators’) laws (improperly called “rules of justice”) would prove that Jehovah’s witnesses are wrong, and hence that their lions (earthly rules of justice) would tear to pieces these “pestiferous” witnesses. The enemy, however, overlooked the fact that the lions belonged to the king and that they represented true justice that proceeds from the throne of God, and that real justice is meted out only by the Lord. No one could ever have occasion to regret his faithful devotion to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The rule of retribution is a just law. In due time, and that shortly, will come the turn of the conspirators in the “den of lions”, Jehovah’s “lions” of divine justice. They and all who now take their stand on the side of the conspirators and against Jehovah, and who render aid and comfort to the conspirators, shall suffer a fate like that which came upon those who conspired against Daniel. “And the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.” (6: 24) None of that wicked crowd will ever be permitted to abide in God’s kingdom. The Scriptures indicate that some of the remnant will actually witness the execution of this retributive justice against the conspirators at the battle of Armageddon, and this they will witness while on the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">W</span><span class="font8">HEN the brethren began working again in H--there were about 31 groups or</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ganized. H. v. A. was out with the books and was stopped by a policeman, who asked what he had. V. A. did not reply; so the policeman examined him and found that he had books. Later in the evening four policemen came to v. A.’s flat and there were also some sisters present taking part in a study. When the police entered they said in a rough voice, “What’s that? a meeting here?” Then one of the policemen said, “It is you who have sent the statement to the government.” V. A. said, “It is not I who have sent it, but I stand by all that was said in it.” One sister rose and would take a Bible from the table, whereupon one of the policemen cried, “Don’t touch.” V. A. was taken to the police station, where he requested that the case could be heard by a judge and that he should not be sent to a concentration camp, where there would be no chance of a hearing. They just took him aw’ay. Sister E---- (house</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">keeper for v. A.) they said must be locked in the kitchen for the night; but when she protested that it was cold there they allowed her to sleep in the bedroom, but locked up every other room. The three sisters who were present at the Bible study were told that they must report to the police the next morning at nine o’clock. This they did, and three were arrested, while the fourth, being over 80 years of age, was allowed to go home. All the brethren have since been sent to a concentration camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Two R.S.D.’s who were on a visit to H----</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the same week heard that v. A. had been arrested, and went to his flat to see if there was anyone there. They were well prepared, and one gave the other all his papers before he went up to the flat to inquire. He called at the flat and as the door was opened by a tall detective, the brother asked, “Does Mr. R----live here?” The</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">man replied, “You mean H. v. A.” “I asked for Mr. R----,” replied the brother. “Well,” said</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">the detective, “he is not here.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The day after v. A. was arrested arrests of the brethren took place in all parts of the town, and in every case the police searched the whole house. The brethren when arrested were taken, together with all literature that could be found, including Bibles, to the police station. V. A. had a large stock, and this was taken six days after. The police who had taken the keys to his flat later returned them to his relatives. The police also took what money they could find (about 60 marks). When v. A. asked how he should pay his rent when they had taken his money, the police did not reply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were arrests right up to the day I left. Now there are about 60 in the H---company</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">who have been arrested. One brother, who was a cutter, was arrested at his business at about 9 a.m., the detective coming in a fine motorcar. The chief of the business was very upset and said, “Now I shall have to apply to the government to get you free; otherwise I shall have to close my business?&quot; One brother, a shoemaker, asked if he could be allowed to wash and change before being taken away, and this was allowed by the ones arresting him. One brother asked the one arresting him why it was he had to go to the police station, seeing that he had done nothing wrong. “Yes, you know I haven’t anything to say,” said the policeman; “I have got to obey the higher powers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One brother (previously an auxiliary) who was put in a concentration camp in 1933 was allowed to go free on October 9, 1934. He had not been before any court, and had not the least idea how long he was to be in the camp. As he is now free, he can report how he was treated. They had to march about 30 kilometers (19 miles) per day. The meals were bad, and sometimes they went for two or three days without any dinner. He was beaten and thrashed many times, and punched in the face, because he would not sing “Deutschland fiber Alles”. He has blue and green marks all over his body. When he would not sing he was lifted by the neck and cast on the road, and many times they asked, “What has Jehovah got to say about that?” Twice he was threatened with death. The first occasion was when the Germans withdrew from the League of Nations and he was told that he must vote “Yes” and he was marched forward at the point of the revolver. On the second occasion one of the leaders in the camp smashed a stink bomb in the brother’s pocket. Later he came back with the camp leader and the brother was asked, “What have you done?” to which he replied, “You know best yourself.” They then announced that in two hours he would be shot. When the two hours had expired they came back with two men armed with rifles. The brother was then told to stand against the wall and then the two men with rifles aimed. “Open your coat!” cried the leader to the brother. The brother did not move. He was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font8"> shot. His father and mother, who were not in the truth, wrote to the Nazis and said that their son did not support </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">that Society</span><span class="font8"> anymore. This letter was placed before the brother and he was told that if he would put his signature to it, then he would be set free at once. The brother replied, “I cannot,” and later explained that Jehovah would free him in due time. Now he has been set free, but all his books have been burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There were about 600 in the camp where he was (they were not all brethren) and all were compelled to attend church. He did not want to go to church; so the Nazis took him forcibly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One old sister (about 90) was compelled to go to the Catholic church. But they could not force her to kneel down. “The church,” she said, “is the great house of murder.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “man of sin” has formed a group and all go to church. One leader of such a group was around to see the brethren who are not yet in prison and asked about calling them “brethren”. “That depends,” said one sister; “we have </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">not </span><span class="font8">broken our covenant with Jehovah.” This man referred boastingly to the fact that he was free while the others were behind stone walls. He also spoke of his connection with the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In one case, when the police came to fetch a brother, they found that he was unable to walk and that he had to be wheeled about in a chair. When the police found that they could not take the man, they said if the wife was one of J. w’s they could take her. They finally found another brother in the house, and, after asking if he was one of Jehovah’s witnesses, they said they would take him instead of the first brother, who was lame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In H---the prison keeper complained that</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses will drive him mad, for they are sitting around in various corners and each one is crying “I want my Bible!” One brother said, “It is not Moscow here; I want my Bible.” It was not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One policeman while making an arrest said, “It is terrible, with all these telegrams we got on October 7.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Generally the police just ask, “Are you one of Jehovah’s witnesses ?” and that is enough for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In H---about 100 brethren were sentenced</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">to three months’ imprisonment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A later contribution from another pen says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Today may be the last day of freedom for me, if Jehovah does not decide otherwise. Yesterday and today the brethren of L----, 35,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">including J. and F., are on trial in court. The Staatsanwalt, which means state attorney, has already addressed the court, and today it is only our lawyers, and then the decision of the court. The state attorney said in his speech that Brother Rutherford had been giving advice to German citizens, thereby poisoning them and making them disobey the rules of the German government. It is too bad, he said, that one could not get hold of him who in a shameless way is attacking the government of his own country. I am sure that the Lord will look after this matter, and also after the man that made such a speech. The Lord will reveal His power within a short time. For Brother K., 9 months have been set, and for all the rest of us, 6 months in jail. Please tell Brother Rutherford that we all love him and that I wish the Lord’s richest blessings on him, that he may continue his work as Jehovah’s faithful servant. In the Lord’s strength we will bear whatever suffering will be laid upon us. I am, I admit, a little worried about N. He is my only boy, and I love him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This, of course, is not the reason why I would not want to leave him with some strange person for a time; but N. is now of an age where children begin to love one who is always with them, and when such a one is taken away such children are not able to control their hearts as we do. I had him with someone yesterday and the result was that he awoke several times at night telling me he was 'drank’, meaning ill or sick, and that I should not go away. I will leave all worries to Jehovah. He will redeem His people, and joy will be in Zion. I want you to have this last message from me before jail. Employees and judges are reading my letters. Once more I send my love to you, who helped me to understand God’s will, when I wanted to come to His holy mountain.—L.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Stay Away from New Jersey!</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">T IS NOW ILLEGAL to laugh or sigh, breathe or smile, talk or hum, in the state of New Jersey. Henceforth the boardwalks of Atlantic City, Asbury Park, Wildwood and other hitherto famous New Jersey resorts will be places of discomfort, uneasiness, cheerlessness and gloom. You might say something to your companions that would hurt somebody’s religious susceptibilities. One can never tell. There may be somebody listening, watching, trailing and spying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When you and your friends have a social get-together in any of New Jersey’s resorts, do not let yourself go! Beware! A chance remark, a grin, or even a look, may arouse some fanatical Catholic waiter’s ire, “incite” the animosity of a straight-laced “Protestant”, or awaken the hostility of a so-called “Jew” who is subject to illusions of grandeur. And before you know it, you are in the hoosegow or minus your roll, or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All this is the result of the amazing piece of legislation adopted by the corrupt New Jersey lawmaking body, which one of its own members calls “rotten”. This law was rushed through the legislature at Trenton under the lash of an agent of the Roman Catholic hierarchy who boasts of his recently enlarged “dictatorial powers”. These “dictatorial powers” of John Rafferty, Knight of Columbus, account for the fact that the “law” was whisked posthaste to the governor for his “signature” shortly before midnight of April 8, 1935, just a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">few,minutes </span><span class="font8">after it was approved by 14 of the 21 members of the New Jersey senate, only one member of which, Dryden Kuser, had the manhood to vote a definite “No”. Previously, in the Assembly, only </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font8"> member, Theron McCampbell, manifested that he was sufficiently independent of “dictatorial” pressure to vote “No”. Nothing, however, could stop the state of New Jersey in its determined effort to pass “laws” that can be used effectively to throttle free speech, free laughter, free breathing and free wheeling, or what have you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Perhaps the law was necessary—in New Jersey. Folks there, some of them, have very sensitive “religious susceptibilities”, which cannot stand the telling of the truth. The clergy, especially the Roman variety, are as frail, shrinking violets. A “misdirected” breath might wither them. They are painfully conscious of their insecure position. So “laws” to protect them against “irresponsible persons” are eagerly urged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Read the “law” which is now on the statute books of New Jersey, and laugh to your heart’s content—provided you are not in New Jersey. If you are so unfortunate as to live in that state, be careful! Beware! Tie Fido at the front gate! Lock the doors, draw the shades! Be sure the roof does not leak! Then go ahead and read the New Jersey anti-smile law, alias “anti-Nazi” law, which is reproduced here in full for the entertainment of the public.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">(From the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Review of Reviews)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt;&lt;rpFTE </span><span class="font8">stage was now set for the break with J- President Roosevelt, whose monetary and social policies stopped far short of what seemed desirable to Father Coughlin. By this time the Radio League had collected a staff of economic and political advisers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Use was also made of opportunities to confer with numerous 'big people’, notably Hearst. It must not be supposed that Coughlin was without connections in the realm of big business, even though he kept entirely clear of financial ties or commitments. Numerous railroad, mining, and real estate executives who favored inflation did everything in their power to aid and abet the Detroit priest. During 1934 several such gentlemen did their best to persuade relatively conservative journals to get behind Father Coughlin. For the most part they failed. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“If the reader finds Father Coughlin’s views . . . vague, he must not be surprised. They are not so much statements of a plan as reflections of a conviction—a belief that the United States will find Utopia if its repudiation of ‘international bankers’ is followed by a rally to the standard of nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“. . . It has not escaped the notice of observers that the general contour of his doctrine is oddly similar to that of National Socialism (Hitlerism). Although the Nazi dictator has abandoned virtually the whole of the program which he sold to the German people in 1930, the fact remains that it was excellent political copy. The Nazis too (before they took power) advocated a central national bank, the abolition of interest, government control of labor, a better return for agricultural effort, and—above all— the superiority of human rights to property rights.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sedition—Inquisition</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HERE is considerable talk about enacting a United States sedition law which would make it unlawful for an American citizen to talk or write in any manner that could be construed as advocating that the existing order be terminated. Department of Justice agents would be detailed specially to eavesdrop upon those who merely talk and do not put their thoughts into writing. So says the Baltimore </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Sun.</span><span class="font8"> We have no doubt that the Catholic priesthood would like to put something like this across. These days of stress are furnishing splendid opportunities for the enemies of freedom to get in their work. Catholicism is the traditional and inveterate enemy of liberty of any kind for the people. This extreme they seek to balance by unlimited license for the priesthood. There is far too much Catholic monkey-business going on at Washington. We do not say that all Catholics are the conscious enemies of liberty. Far from it. But many of them do not seem to realize that the system which they support from force of habit is essentially and unavoidably against true freedom. While professing to protect American institutions the activities of the hierarchy whose seat is on Vatican Hill is the greatest of all dangers to the American form of government. In consideration of the fact &quot;that the Catholics are a minority in the United States their activities in a political way are particularly offensive to those who wish to preserve the government of the people, for the people, and by the people. Catholics, as individuals, have their rights, of course; and as long as they exercise these rights simply as Americans, without intruding their religious prejudices into questions where they have no place, it would be unjust and un-American to deny them a voice in the affairs of the nation in proportion to their numerical status. But when it comes to insinuating a form of inquisition into the government, it is certain that the American people will register an unmistakable protest.</span></p>

They were raking in the shekels in good shape until some smart detective caught them; but even after they were caught it was hard to know w’hat to do with them, because to have told the whole truth would have exposed the whole wretched fraud. For more than two months detectives were trying to find out where the leak was, not that there was any honest attempt to stop illegal Roman Catholic lotteries in the United States. Far from it. What was sought was some way to keep these double crooks from double-crossing the single crooks. So the boys were finally charged with conspiracy; and probably that was the easiest way out of an embarrassing situation. Certainly nobody in authority wants the truth told about these Catholic lottery tickets.</span></p>

But it was all wrong for him to lose, because then the widows and Orphans don’t get back anything at all.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Model Prayer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A</span><span class="font8"> MODEL prayer is one made in conformity to God’s Word. To those who desire to learn how to pray Jesus said: ‘God knows what things you need before you ask. After this manner therefore pray: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.’ Those words acknowledge Jehovah as the Giver of life to all who get life, and that all right-minded creattires regard God’s name as sacred. The model prayer as stated by Jesus further is: ‘Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as in heaven.’ Those words acknowledge that the present rule of this world is out of harmony with God’s will, hence that the present world is unrighteous, and the prayer expresses a desire that God’s kingdom of righteousness shall come and rule the world in righteousness. From the Scriptures you learn that Jehovah God has appointed Christ Jesus as the rightful Ruler of the world, and that in His due time God through Christ will destroy the wicked rule of Satan, and in the place and stead of that wicked rule God’s kingdom under Christ will rule in righteousness. That means that the kingdom under Christ will control the affairs of this world in harmony with God’s will, which is always right and righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The kingdom of God is of greatest importance, because it will vindicate His holy name, show all creatures that God is just, wise, loving and all-powerful, and the Giver of life and blessings to all who obey Him. Such are the things that honest men desire. The doing of God’s will on earth means that all wickedness and all workers of iniquity will cease for ever. It means that there will be no more war, no more harsh and oppressive men at work depriving people of their just rights and privileges; that there will be no more poverty in the land, but that every man who obeys God will have plenty; that there will be no more sickness, sorrow, pain and death, and hence no more tears of bitterness will flow; that then the earth will be filled with the glory of God, and all who obey will dwell together in peace and happiness. Such are the things that the people need, and all these needs will be freely supplied by the kingdom of God under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For centuries the Devil has been the invisible ruler of this world and has caused all the sorrow, sickness, suffering and death that has come upon men. The masses of the people have labored hard in order to find their daily bread. Under this unrighteous rule it is proper for those who love God to ask Him for the necessities of life; hence the prayer according to Jesus’ instruction continues: “Give us this day our daily bread.” That means food for the body and food for the mind, the latter being knowledge and understanding of the Word of God that we may learn what is His will. You must therefore study His Word, as set forth in the Bible and in the helps which He has provided for you to learn His will. Jehovah’s witnesses bring to your doors books showing you where to find these truths in the Bible and to learn them. The prayer then asks that God will forgive us our wrongs as we forgive those that wrong us, and that when in temptation we shall not be abandoned by the Lord. This shows that the one who thus prays desires the spirit of the Lord to rule in his mind and that he will always be on the side of God and do that which is pleasing to the Lord. It is thus easily to be determined that a Catholic priest or a clergyman can do you no good in praying, but that you must learn the will of God, obey Him, and pray for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The proper understanding of the Scriptures will convince any person that virtue and the right to pray do not belong to religious organizations of the clergymen, but that prayer is an individual privilege granted to those who love and serve God. The world as it now exists cannot be reformed, but first the kingdom of God under Christ must take charge, destroy this wicked rule of the world, and then the righteous rule of Christ will prevail throughout the world. The will of God must be done on earth in order for the people to have what they need. By the model prayer Jesus was teaching His followers as to what things they might properly pray for.

<p><span class="font8">HE Melbourne (Australia) </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Age</span><span class="font8"> says of Jehovah’s witnesses in Australia:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Judge Rutherford, of the United States, whose religious teachings are heard regularly from broadcasting stations, has a very big following in Sydney. Many of the devotees of his teachings have met the judge, who has the power of implanting enthusiasm in the hearts of his followers and making every one of them a missionary. It is not an easy task for even the most eloquent and the most ardent to start out on propaganda in Australia, where people are more practical and less emotional than the people of the United States—a more polyglot nation which has become fixed in its type and outlook. Consequently those who have espoused the teachings of Judge Rutherford, and are spreading them, meet with many rebuffs, sometimes from the most unexpected quarters. Unlike other religious teachers with a new light, he has the advantage of modern invention to carry his cause to the most remote parts, and his own voice is heard. The missionaries, therefore, always travel about with a supply of records and a talking machine, which gives out through a dynamic speaker the actual teachings without variation or equivocation. But they find that in some places the voice is not loud enough, and when they draw up in a town somebody is sure to order’ out the town band to play ragtime or jazz close handy, thus drowning the vocal efforts of the machine-made voice. The followers of the judge, who are most enthusiastic, have decided to make a new move, and have purchased a huge loud-speaker, known as Big Bill, the dynamic force of which is operated by the motor-ear machinery. This loud-speaker can be heard two miles away. It will be fitted on a ear, and it will be possible to turn on Judge Rutherford’s special lectures and operate them a mile or so from a town, and thus deliver a message from the clouds, as it were, long before they reach the town. This huge loud-speaker will be taken on tour shortly, and is sure to create sensation in the bush. It will not be long before it reaches the suburbs of Melbourne, which is marked out in the itinerary.</span></p>

There are twenty-nine Democratic members in this House of Assembly and not a single one of them would dare disobey an order from the Jersey City city hall. I repeat, we have the rottenest government of any state in this country; and I ask Mr. Rafferty if the word Nazi or Nazism appears anywhere in this bill.” Rafferty, in a low tone, had to admit that it did not. The real purpose of the bill is to find a way to put a stop to the activities of Jehovah’s witnesses in New Jersey.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Messengers of Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">W</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">m. Southern, Jr.,</span><span class="font8"> writing “Sunday School Lessons” for the Kansas City </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Journal-Post,</span><span class="font8"> said in the issue for March 15, 1935:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A moment ago, just as I was getting down to work, the doorbell rang. I answered, and standing on the porch was a woman I had never seen before. There was an abnormal look in her eyes I have seen and identified many times as always to be found in persons who are very earnest in what they believe and who are willing to undergo anything in support of that belief. She said, ‘I bring you a message from Jehovah,’ shoving toward me a printed page. When I had gotten rid of my visitor as politely as I could I came back to my desk wondering about the way religion affects people. Then I wondered how the apostles toward the late half of the first century went about their work. They had no tracts to pass out. There were no newspapers, they could not get your ear on the telephone and mercilessly compel you to listen. If the facts were known, I expect the people of that day were probably as impatient with them as I was with the self-confessed messenger of Jehovah who disturbed me when I did not want to be disturbed. Those apostles, however, had a lot sterner and more relentless and more intolerant public with which to deal than we have in the present day. I could not call the city marshal and have the woman who came to my door in a perfectly peaceable manner locked up in jail, and I did not wish to do so. If she had been hungry I would have fed her; in trouble, I would have tried to help. I often wonder if those who are sure they are doing the Lord’s work should receive more attention and more consideration at our hands. I wonder if we are not a little more intolerant than they. I cannot see their message any more than the old Jews could see the message of the apostles in A.D. 44.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the same article, referring to Peter’s imprisonment, Mr. Southern said: “None of us like to be abused and accused, and especially is this true when we feel down in our hearts that the accusation is true. A liar takes a great deal more offense at being called a liar than one who knows he is not a liar.” Jehovah’s witnesses will forgive Mr. Southern for the unhappy expression “abnormal look”, in recompense for the truth which his little skit contained. He gave the tale the title “Messengers of Jehovah”, thus sensing the great truth that one of His witnesses called at his door.</span></p>

The communications went on to state that two men and one woman are wrongfully held in the county prison at Elizabeth to which they were committed jesterday by City Judge William G. De Meza, with the knowledge and consent of Corporation Counsel William Newcorn, after all three had been held in the Plainfield jail since Saturday. The three persons failed to appear in court last Thursday and were arrested on bench warrants. Bail was fixed at $100 each yesterday, in lieu of which they were sent to jail.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“We compare the Roosevelt depression with the Hoover depression and we find the Roosevelt depression debt is $9,000,000,000 more than the Hoover depression debt; the unemployment under Roosevelt has eclipsed everything Hoover ever heard about, and approximates more than one-half the whole population of America; the wage earner of today is living farther below the standard of a fair living than ever before in the history of the country; the wealth of the country is more in the hands of the big interests and the big men than it has ever been, and the common people and masses in general have less than they have ever had; two-thirds of all the money in the banks is owned by one-one hundred and fiftieth of the people, according to the figures furnished by the Government bureau itself; there are 5,000,000 more people on the dole than there were last year, and another 5,000,000 trying to get on the dole. . . . There is only one way to save our people; only one way to save America. How ? Pull down wealth from the top and spread ■wealth at the bottom: free people of these debts they owe; God told us exactly how to do it all.” [Senator Long then read extracts from Nehemiah 5, Leviticus 25, Ecclesiastes 5:19, and Deuteronomy 15:1, 2.] “Maybe you do not believe the Bible; maybe you do not accept God as your Supreme Lawgiver. God help you if you do not; but if you do not, then all I ask of you is to believe the simple problems of arithmetic, the tables of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. If you believe them you xvill know that we cannot tolerate this condition of a handful of- people owning nearly all and all owning nearly nothing. In a land of plenty there is no need to starve unless we allow greed to starve us to please the vanity of someone else. ’ ’</span></p>

In the eyes of Lowell Thomas and certain newspapers these sentiments justify them in trying to ridicule Senator Long, call him names, etc. But the people of Louisiana are said to believe in him, about seven to one, and the ones that do not believe in him are the ones that now have it about all and want the people to have next to nothing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">I</span><span class="font8">N HIS radio address of April 28, president Roosevelt said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Never since my inauguration in March, 1933, have I felt so unmistakably the atmosphere of recovery. But it is more than the recovery of the material basis of our individual lives. It is the recovery of confidence in our democratic processes and our republican institutions. We have survived all of the arduous burdens and the threatening dangers of a great economic calamity. We have in the darkest moments of our national trials retained our faith in our own ability to master our destiny. Fear is vanishing and confidence is growing on every side: renewed faith in the vast possibilities of human beings to improve their material and spiritual status through the instrumentality of democratic government. That faith is receiving its just reward. For that we can be thankful to the god who watches over America.”</span></p>

But what is this evil thing that we see from the pen of Ogden Nash in the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Post, </span><span class="font8">and whom was he kidding when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Higgledy Piggledy, my black hen, she lays eggs for gentlemen. Gentlemen come every day to count what my black hen doth lay. If perchance she lays too many, they fine my hen a pretty penny. If perchance she fails to lay, the gentlemen a bonus pay. Mumbledy Pumbledy, my red cow, she’s co-operating now. At first she didn’t understand that milk production must be planned. She didn’t understand at first; she either had to plan or burst. But now the government reports she's giving pints instead of quarts. Fiddle-de-dee, my next door neighbors, they are giggling at their labors. First they plant the tiny seed; then they water, then they weed; then they hoe and prune and lop ; then they raise a record crop; then they laugh their sides asunder, and plow the whole caboodle under. Abracadabra, thus we learn, the more you make, the less you earn. The less you eavn, the more you’re given; the less you lead, the more you’re driven; the more destroyed, the more they feed; the more you pay, the more they need; the more you earn, the less you keep; and now I lay me down to sleep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Isn’t there some way we can keep this kind of poetry away from the people at this critical time, when prosperity is just around Hoover’s corner ?</span></p>

Worse yet, in Florida a black man was tortured twelve hours while word was spread all over the country that the father of a wronged girl should have the privilege of putting him to death. It was necessary to put on special cars to accommodate the crowds that wanted to attend the exercises. The crowd of torturers had done such a good job that when the man arrived who was to illegally put his fellow man to death, he was already dead.

It is accomplished, secondly, through widely publicized articles and books written by administration leaders—employing only the brightest colors in painting the picture. And it is accomplished, thirdly, through administration speakers sent everywhere at the taxpayer’s expense—in meetings and over the radio, telling only one side of the story, not so much as admitting that there could be any other side.

<p><span class="font8">Georgian Cafeterias to examine each of their employees at regular intervals and instruct them in their daily hygiene. The Georgian booklet contains much interesting data about food values, and an article by Dr. William S. Sadler, on “ Tep’ and How to Get It” through diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These foods are named in the order of the amount of iron they contain, which should be eaten to replenish the iron in one’s blood, thus building pep:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Spinach, especially fresh green spinach. Tomatoes, apples, milk, yolks of eggs, asparagus, oranges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These foods are named as influencing the amount of acid poison in the blood, in turn having an important influence on pep:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FOODS WHICH TEND TO ACIDIFY THE BLOOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. All the forms of flesh foods, including meat, fish, fowl, meat broths, beef tea, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. Eggs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. All kinds of breadstuffs, whether made of wheat, rye or corn: bread, crackers, toast, griddle cakes, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4. All sorts of pies and cakes, except fruit pies and other desserts made chiefly from milk or of fruits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5. All cereals: rice, oatmeal, hominy, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">6. Peanuts, prunes, plums and cranberries. The last two contain benzoic acid, which the body cannot fully oxidize.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">FOODS WHICH TEND TO ALKALINIZE NONACIDIFY THE BLOOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">1. All dairy products, including milk, cheese, ice cream, buttermilk, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2. All kinds of vegetable and fruit soups and broths.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3. All the fresh fruits, except plums and cranberries.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">4. All of the dried fruits (except prunes), especially figs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5. All kinds of vegetables; especially beets, carrots, celery, lettuce and other “leafy” vegetables.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">6. The legumes: beans, peas and lentils.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">7. All the nuts, except peanuts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">Note: Butter and sugar are not included in the list, for the reason that these two foods are quite completely burned up in the body. Tea, coffee, tobacco, alcohol or certain kinds of drugs are designated as almost pure acid poisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dr. Sadler points out that many people are habitually “overeating” the acid-producing foods, those that bring lethargy and fatigue. He also disperses the popular feeling that fresh fruits produce acid. He designates them as non-acidous, when “burned up” in the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“non-acidify&quot; your menus</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many people do habitually overeat acid-producing foods. This point is especially important to bear in mind, for these same persons have the habit of placing the blame for the condition induced by these foods on restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the doctor tells you that you have too much acid in your blood, then you should go in for grapefruit, lemons, and oranges, for that will be the quickest way to reduce your acidity. Without going into the details of chemistry, this apparent anomaly is explained by saying that in the process of digestion the acids of all the fruits, with the exception of the two mentioned, are converted into alkaline salts which tend to neutralize the acidity of the blood, and thereby increase its “alkaline reserve”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Soy Bean</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By Eston Groves (New York)</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">S</span><span class="font8">OMEWHAT over a dozen years ago there were only a few thousand acres of soy bean cultivated in America. In 1934, it was estimated, about five million acres. In the early part of the nineteenth century the first seed was planted in America. There are now several hundred types in the United States, each type being developed to meet certain sectional requirements of the country. In the Orient the soy bean has been used for centuries. The wide use of soy has been a substitute for meat and wheat among countless millions of Orientals, supplementing their rice diet. The bean is cooked green, ground for flour, fermented into food and drink, its oil extracted for salad oil, and its milk preparation used for curds and cheese. The Chinese use soy meal for fertilizer for their rice crops. By a process of soaking the beans, and then grinding them, the Oriental processes a form of milk. This is due to the protein and oil in the soy. A creamy mixture results which, when properly boiled and strained, can be used for practically the same purposes as cow’s milk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The flour from soy has recently been improved in taste, and is now used extensively in Europe. In America the soy meal is an important livestock food, equaling linseed or cottonseed cake even when most of its oil is extracted. The oil content of the bean varies from 15 percent low to 22 percent high. The chemical analysis of the oil shows it to be a hydrocarbon plus oxygen. By removing the oxygen, a form of petroleum is left. This can be distilled into a lubricating oil. Japanese scientists are now reported working on the idea of drawing gasoline from this oil, but no practical method has yet been found. However, there are possibilities. American soap factories use several million pounds of soy bean oil a year. The Chinese varnishes and lacquers are unexcelled, and soy bean oil has been used in them for centuries. Many paints manufactured in this country are using increasing quantities of soy bean oil. A splendid waterproof glue is said to be made from it. Its industrial uses are many.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Soy bean makes a splendid hay crop, giving one to three tons of excellent hay per acre. The straw makes fine nitrogen fertilizer for the soil. A good stand of soy bean builds up the soil, the plant being a legume, which means storing up that great plant essential, nitrogen, under its roots. The soy bean does well even on poor soil, which is an advantage to many farmers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font8">HE Church of England is supported largely by tithes forcibly levied upon the farmers, because others would not pay them. Now the farmers are refusing to pay, and are even poisoning their livestock and setting fire to their haystacks rather than that they should fall into the hands of the tithe collectors. The latter will take anything a farmer possesses. They have been known to carry away his firewood, and his furniture, even rousing him out of sleep to take away his bed. As-a result, in some districts it is not safe for parsons to appear on the streets, farmers and innkeepers and storekeepers refuse even so much as a glass of water to officers of the law, and when sales are forced, sheep are knocked down at two cents a head, haystacks at 3c each, and a farmer’s furniture, said to be worth $2,500, produced exactly $6.75.
