<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced’to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH’S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever. •</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Act of March 3, 1319.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CONVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> reminds its readers that a convention of Jehovah’s witnesses and Jonadabs will be held at Washington, D. C., beginning May 30 and ending June 3, 1935. It is hoped that many of the remnant and the Jonadabs may find it convenient to attend this convention. Heretofore not many Jonadabs have had the privilege of attending a convention, and the convention at Washington may be a real comfort and benefit to them. See page 127 of this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RADIO AND THE PRINTED WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All witnessing parties and all individuals who engage in the witness work should mention the radio station in their vicinity that is broadcasting the watchtower programs. This often proves a means of opening the way to place the books in the hands of the people. Have in mind that the chief purpose of the radio is to call the people’s attention to the truth and then furnish the opportunity for them to get a wider understanding of the message concerning the government of Jehovah by reading what is being printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Every one who now participates in the field work in territory served by broadcasts of the watchtower program may have a share in telling the people that this unique service is available each week. Workers report that distribution of the radio folder (supplied by the Society) is proving to be a convenient and effective method of giving </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">continual</span><span class="font4"> public notice of this program while engaging in the house-to-house witnessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PUBLIC LECTURES BY TRANSCRIPTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah’s blessing has been markedly upon the use of the portable transcription machine. He has plainly manifested that this machine meets the need of the hour, when the enemy, under Gog, is seeking to curtail the use of the radio by God's anointed and when the people’s ears are eager to hear, not man’s message, but God’s. The transcription machine has increased the power of Jehovah’s witnesses afield to preach His truth manyfold, so that the desire for the literature is stimulated and study classes of many interested hearers are being formed. Besides more than 600 such machines in the United States alone, great numbers are now being effectively used in countries near and afar. For more information, write the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TRANSCRIPTION MACHINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society has made arrangements to construct and assemble portable transcription machines at our own factory at 117 Adams Street. These machines are somewhat different in construction from those previously furnished. They will be spring-wound, and operated from a 6-volt wet-cell battery. Every machine will be furnished complete with the battery and a battery charger, so that it can be kept up to its full strength. We are pleased to announce that this machine can be offered at $100, complete, to brethren in the United States.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark13"></a>KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WILL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘That ye might</span><span class="font5"> be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.”—Col. 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">EHOVAH GOD </span><span class="font5">has chosen from among men </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">people for his name, and it is to this people that the words of the foregoing text are addressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each one, therefore, who has the witness of the spirit that he is a son of God, born of Jehovah’s organization, should apply these words to himself. The apostle Paul was first specially chosen by Jehovah through Christ Jesus, and then the apostle was moved by the power of the Lord God to address these words to the faithful ones in Christ Jesus. The foregoing language of the apostle was peculiarly appropriate to the saints on earth when that language was first published. Those words are even more appropriate to Jehovah’s witnesses, who today constitute the remnant of God on </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">earth. When Paul learned that some at Colosse had devoted themselves to the Lord God his prayer </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">desire was that they might be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah’s will. Under the conditions and circumstances existing today it is of vital importance to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font5">one of Jehovah’s witnesses that he be filled with the knowledge of God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;HIS WILL”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> The will of God is the same as his purpose. When his will is expressed, that is the expression of his purpose, decree or determination to do that thing as expressed. Jehovah has a fixed and definite reason for every expression of his will or purpose. There are no idle or superfluous words in his expressed purpose. His will or purpose is his unchangeable law; hence his will is the law or rule of action by which his approved children must be guided. Concerning the unchangeableness of his will he caused his prophet to write: “The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back ? ’ ’ —Isa. 14: 24, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* The words of this text foregoing are peculiarly appropriate to the present time. Wherever the words “Jehovah of hosts’’ are used the reference is to the Almighty directing his militant forces to the accomplishment of his expressed will. Again says Jehovah: “My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure. I have purposed it, I will also do it.’’—Isa. 46: 10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">KNOWLEDGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup> In the language of the scripture just above quoted it is the desire that Jehovah’s witnesses be filled with the knowledge of God’s will. Knowledge, within the meaning of this text, does not consist merely in a mental putting together of certain facts, but it does mean that facts or truths as expressed in God’s Word are collected and put together in wisdom and understanding. Knowledge of the truth means a clear perception of the truth. A knowledge of God’s will means a clear perception of what God has expressed in his Word of and concerning his purpose as the same is related to his chosen people. Knowledge in “wisdom and spiritual understanding ’ ’ means that a knowledge of the truth is received and is accompanied by thorough or true wisdom and discernment of spiritual things. Spiritual things can be discerned only by those who have devoted themselves to God and his kingdom.— 1 Cor. 2: 10.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">“Wisdom means the receiving of knowledge into a good and honest mind and then that creature moved by a pure heart or motive pursues a course of action in harmony with the knowledge of the truth. One may gather together or assemble in an abstract manner the facts as stated in the text of the Bible, and be able to repeat the text without hesitation, and at the same time have no spiritual discernment thereof and be entirely void of wisdom. There must be a proper appreciation of the true relationship of the creature to the infinite Creator before one can have wisdom. For that reason it is written that a man should not think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but that he should think soberly and with faith in God. (Rom. 12: 3) One who thinks too highly' of himself is never able to succeed in the accomplishment of a good thing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> It is written that “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge”. (Prov. 1: 7) It necessarily follows that a man who does not fear God does not begin even to acquire knowledge and wisdom. For the benefit of those who seek the Lord it is written: “What</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose. His soul shall dwell at ease; and his Seed shall inherit the earth. The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.”—Ps. 25: 12-14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> The promise to the man beginning in the right way is that God will show him his covenant. As here stated, God’s covenant is an expression of his purpose. Fear, as that word is used in the foregoing texts, does not mean merely reverence for God. What constitutes fear is defined in these words: “The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.” (Prov. 8: 13) These words are a warning that a child of God should fear to entertain or to cultivate pride, arrogancy and an evil way, that is, a way that would do injury to others. These things Jehovah hates, and the wise creature likewise hates them and fears to do or to approve what is hated by Jehovah. One who fears God fears to do any injury to his brethren, and he puts away from him pride and arrogancy, regarding these as deadly enemies. All persons who have undertaken to be servants of God, and particularly those persons placed in a position of responsibility, such as service directors, should give careful consideration to these texts and strive to pursue a course in strict conformity thereto. If one thinks of himself as of more than ordinary importance, and that he should lord it over and browbeat his brethren, then he does not have the fear of God in his heart. One who is arrogant or proud and haughty, and hence without fear of God, is in very grave danger. The wise person fears pride, arrogancy and an evil way, because the same is contrary to God’s law; hence the wise person fears God, and this is the beginning of wisdom. To increase in wisdom he must always fear to displease God and fear to think of himself as of great importance. He must remember the things that God requires of those whom he approves, as it is written: “What doth [Jehovah] require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, find to walk humbly [obediently] with thy God?” (Mic. 6: 8) Every one of the temple class will observe this rule and follow it, and those who do not observe and follow this rule thereby give evidence that they are not of the temple. There must now be exact unity amongst all of those who are of Jehovah’s temple organization.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">VALUE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> It is of great value to the one justified in Christ Jesus to continue to increase in knowledge. “Through knowledge shall the just be delivered.” (Prov. 11: 9) That means, to be sure, through a knowledge of God’s will which is received in wisdom and in spiritual understanding. The value of a knowledge of the truth as compared with other things is expressed in the words of the scripture, to wit: “There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">precious</span><span class="font5"> jewel.” (Prov. 20: 15) It is those who gain wisdom from above that are strong in the Lord. “And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches. A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength. For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war, and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.”—Prov. 24: 4-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Without the strength of the Lord no one is now able to stand. This is a time of war, and God’s people need the strength that eometh from him. “Wise counsel,” as used in the foregoing text, means the Word of God clearly received into an honest heart, and then that counsel must be followed. Only those who are guided by such divine counsel will be received into glory. (Ps. 73: 24) ‘A multitude of counsel’ therefore means knowledge of God’s will as abundantly expressed in the Scriptures. The people of God now stand at Armageddon, and that great war will be fought within a short time, and only those who possess and are in harmony with a knowledge of God’s purposes received in wisdom and spiritual understanding will successfully go through that great battle. It may then properly be said that a ‘multitude of counsel’ means the assembly of a great amount of knowledge in spiritual understanding of the Word of God. This scripture could not mean the assembling of a multitude of persons each expressing himself. It is the counsel of the Lord that gives strength, and the counsel of the Lord is his word or purpose expressed, received in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. God’s children now filled with a knowledge of his will in wisdom and spiritual understanding necessarily fear to engage in quarrels with their brethren. If some want to quarrel, let them do so, but let those who wish to be guided by God’s counsel refrain from quarreling and strife. Those who quarrel and bite one another are in the way of everlasting destruction.—Gal. 5: 14, 15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">FOOLS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> There are those claiming to be in the truth and who insist that all the truth of and concerning God’s will was published prior to 1917, and hence they oppose the Watch Tower publications of the past ten years. Their claim is that God committed to one man between the years 1874 and 1916 all the truth that is ever to be known and published, and that since that time God’s people should follow the teachings of that one man. That position or claim is equivalent to saying that God is not capable of carrying out his purpose without the aid of some creature; hence the same is a denial of God. Such persons by their course of action say, “There is no God”; and the Scriptures declare that such creatures are plain fools; as it is written: ‘The fool despiseth wisdom and instruction.’ (Prov. 1:7) “The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.” (Ps. 14: 1) They do not say so by their mouths, but their motive or heart condition is determined by their course of action. Despising instruction they oppose the instruction that God gives to his people through his appointed method. Such opposers pursue their own selfish way, and hence are lawless; and being lawless, they violently oppose Jehovah’s witnesses. Being workers of lawlessness or iniquity, they thereby give evidence that they have no knowledge. “They have not called upon God.” (Ps. 53: 4) Jehovah God through Christ Jesus is teaching his people. No man is teaching them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">STUDY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> During the past ten years the Lord has given his people through the Watch Tower publications much information concerning his prophecies and their fulfillment, which truth enlightens the remnant concerning the will or purpose of Jehovah. There are those who profess to be the children of God and to be his witnesses, who not only have access to these publications but who carry them about and publish them to others; and yet many of such have little or no conception of the truth set forth in those publications, such as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and the books. The persons here mentioned proceed upon the theory that the books and booklets which we now have contain merely a repetition of what was contained in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies </span><span class="font5">and that hence it is not necessary to study them. If the present-day publications of the Watch Tower are the thoughts of a man or men, then no child of God should give heed to them. On the other hand, if these publications are not the thoughts of creatures expressed, but contain the spiritual food which the Lord has provided for his people, a failure or refusal to study the same works detrimentally to those who thus fail or refuse to study. No one can today successfully withstand the assault of the enemy and prove his own faithfulness and integrity toward God who fails or refuses to feed upon the spiritual food which God has provided for his people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> It is only those whom Jehovah approves when put to the test that will be for ever in the kingdom. To the called ones the apostle under inspiration of the holy spirit wrote: “Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” (2 Tim. 2: 15) A workman that is ashamed or abashed cannot be bold in this day of judgment in declaring the truth as God has commanded his witnesses to do. (1 John </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">4: 17, 18) </span><span class="font5">He must grow in a knowledge of presentday truth with wisdom and spiritual understanding in order to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might and in order to be a true witness to the name of Jehovah. To ‘rightly divide the truth’ means to have a knowledge and understanding of God’s purposes as disclosed by his prophecies, the meaning of which is now unfolded by the Lord to his people. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">is only those who love God that keep his commandments, and one must know what God commands in order to obey those commandments. The prophecies and prophetic pictures were recorded long centuries ago for the special benefit of those who now constitute the people of God on earth. The reason for this is that we have come to the end of Satan’s world and to the beginning of the world under Christ. (1 Cor. 10: 11; Rom. 15: 4) One who studies to show himself approved unto God is not meditating on how wonderful and beautiful he is within himself, but he is gaining a knowledge of God’s expressed will and receiving that knowledge in wisdom and with spiritual understanding. He sees that properly dividing the Word of truth means to apply the Word of truth to the physical facts that have come to pass in fulfillment of prophetic utterances. The words of the apostle urging his brethren to grow in knowledge and wisdom and understanding were therefore important when written, but they are of far greater necessity and importance to God’s people now, because the time of great climax has been reached.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">PURPOSE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> The man who has a knowledge of Jehovah’s purpose or will and who then is diligent to perform his divinely given commission is greatly blessed. To Abraham God declared his purpose; but there is no reason to believe that Abraham had a clear understanding thereof, because it was not then God’s due time for him to understand. Christ Jesus was the first one on earth who had an understanding of Jehovah’s purpose and who declared it openly. Jesus was sent by Jehovah to earth to carry forward God’s purpose or will, and for that reason he said that he came not to do his own will but to do the will of his Father who sent him. (John 5: 30; 4: 34; 6: 38) He was born a man-child, and at his maturity as a man he began to carry forward his Father’s purpose. For that reason he said: “To this end [that I might accomplish this purpose] was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.”—John 18: 37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> What was the primary truth that he came to declare? We may be sure that he would begin his ministry by declaring that great important truth, and these are the words he used in opening his campaign, to wit: “The kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 4: 17) This declaration he made before he chose his disciples, who also must thereafter be witnesses to the truth. Why should Jesus announce the kingdom then, seeing that it was not the time to set it up ? Because Lucifer, whom God had originally made the overlord of man, had rebelled and Jehovah had cast him out of his holy mountain or organization and had named him Satan, or Adversary. God had cut down Lucifer’s “tree”. Then Satan the Devil went forth and builded an organization in opposition to Jehovah God, and into that organization he drew wicked angels and almost all of mankind. Jehovah’s purpose from the beginning was to build a new organization that shall rule heaven and earth, and that organization is the kingdom of heaven, which Jesus announced at the beginning of his ministry. Jehovah God had then selected Jesus to be the King or rightful Ruler of the world, and Jesus was then at hand.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">CHALLENGE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>15</sup> The announcement of Jesus that the kingdom of heaven is at hand meant that he, as the rightful King, had come, and his announcement was an open and bold challenge to Satan the Devil. The rulership of the world there became involved, and Satan knew that </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">success of God’s kingdom under Christ would mean his, that is, Satan’s complete defeat. For this reason Satan waged a deadly warfare against Jesus from that time forward. This is proved by the fact that Satan began his assault upon Jesus in the mountain of tempta</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">tion </span><span class="font5">by fraudulently attempting to cause Jesus to commit some act to bring about his own violent destruction. Failing in those three temptations in the wilderness the Devil brought up thereafter all of his forces and agencies to accomplish the downfall and destruction </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">Christ Jesus. Jesus foreknew Satan’s purpose and knew the agencies that the Devil was then using in opposition to God’s kingdom. For this reason Jesus spoke a parable to the Pharisaical clergymen who came </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">engage him in conversation. This parable disclosed </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">that the </span><span class="font5">Lord had committed to certain husbandmen duties in connection with his vineyard; that these husbandmen ill-treated and killed God’s servants; but at last he sent unto them his Son. “But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font5">his inheritance.” (Matt. 21: 38) In that same connection Jesus identified himself as the One whom Satan’s agents sought to destroy. This opposition was due </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">the fact that the world’s rightful King was in </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan</span><span class="font5">’s way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> Immediately preceding his ascension into heaven Jesus instructed his disciples that they would receive the power of the holy spirit and that then they must be witnesses throughout the earth. (Acts 1: 8) At Pentecost the apostles did receive the power of the holy spirit, and they immediately began to give testimony, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">their first testimony was that Jehovah God had made Jesus Lord and Christ, that is to say, the anointed One to rule the world. (Acts 2: 36) That which the apostles thereafter stressed and emphasized </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font5">their testimony was that the kingdom of God under Christ must rule the world. Their testimony was a direct challenge to the Devil, and for them it meant a fight. All the facts show that the lives of these faithful apostles on earth were spent in a warfare forced </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">upon them </span><span class="font5">by Satan. They were repeatedly assaulted </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font5">Satan and his agents because they were witnesses </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font5">the truth concerning the kingdom. The apostle </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">said to his </span><span class="font5">brethren: “We must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14: 22) Necessarily that means that those who shall be associated with Christ Jesus and his kingdom of a certainty must be subject to repeated assaults by Satan and his agents. The persecution of the apostles and of other faithful followers of Christ Jesus in the early days was due to the fact that they told the truth. Many of those faithful ones were foully killed. And what was the real reason for it? Was it because the earthly agents of Satan feared these men who were faithful to God ? Not at all. It was because these faithful ones were proclaiming the truth of and concerning the kingdom of God under Christ and that proclamation of the truth was a challenge to the Devil; and for that reason he sought their destruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Then followed the organization of the Papacy, which is a so-called “religious organization”, and which organization is ruled by the Roman Catholic hierarchy. From the very beginning that organization has been and is a political-religious organization of Satan. Be it noted that the Catholic hierarchy has never suffered persecution from Satan, and the reason is that it is a part of Satan’s organization. Then arose an organization called “Protestants”, and the faithful amongst those were persecuted by the Catholic hierarchy; but in the course of time that Protestant organization became a political-commercial-religious organization, and hence a part of Satan’s world. During the long period of time from the organization of the Papacy until about the year 1874 (A.D.) there was a very small number of people who gave testimony to the Lord of and concerning his kingdom, and only such faithful persons suffered any particular persecution. The reason therefor is announced by Jesus, in John 15, and that reason is that the religionists in that period of time, as well as now, are a part of the world.—John 15: 19.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">ELIJAH PERIOD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> During the Elijah period of the church there was a very small amount of testimony given concerning the kingdom of God, because the purpose of Jehovah was not then clearly understood. During that period of time the controversy was chiefly about doctrines, such as hell torment, purgatory and the “restitution” of the human family. The rulership of the world was not involved, because the right of Satan to rule was not brought prominently to the fore. Near the end of the Elijah period God’s people were given more knowledge concerning the kingdom, and the faithful ones began to stress the importance of the rulership of the world under Christ Jesus, and then the real persecution began. Call to mind that it was the publication of the paper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> that fired the enemy to come down on the heads of God’s people with great wrath, and the publication of that paper occurred early in 1918. The real reason for that persecution was that the testimony was there a challenge to the Devil and his agencies.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">HIS WILL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>19</sup> The apostle had knowledge of God’s will or purpose, and it was his desire that all saints should gain a knowledge of Jehovah’s will. With intelligence and real earnestness the work of God’s people in the Elisha period began about 1922, which date marks the second outpouring of the holy spirit. Since then the work of Jehovah’s witnesses has been to declare the message of God’s kingdom with boldness, and their testimony has been and is an open declaration of war to Satan. The testimony and work of the remnant has drawn the fire of Satan and his agents upon them, and the remnant has been and is subjected to persecution like that which came upon the apostles. The past ten years have marked a constant and continuous increase of persecution upon Jehovah’s witnesses, and now we can plainly see the reason therefor, and the reason is that Jehovah’s witnesses now stress the fact and the importance of the rule of the world by Christ Jesus.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">UNDERSTANDING</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>80</sup> Jehovah God gave to Jesus Christ a revelation of his purposes, the understanding of which began to come to God’s people on earth after 1922. It was in March 1925 that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> published for the first time the article entitled “The Birth of The Nation”, meaning the beginning of the kingdom under Christ. That clearly marked the beginning of the understanding of God’s people on earth of Jehovah’s purpose. It was then that we saw for the first time the two great organizations, to wit, Jehovah’s organization and Satan’s organization, in deadly conflict. We saw then that the testimony of Jesus Christ had been committed to God’s remnant on earth and that the remnant must obey God’s commandments in delivering that testimony, and that hence the Devil goes forth to make war upon such witnesses and attempts to bring about their destruction. (Rev. 12: 17) Of necessity the testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses must be and is a declaration of war against Satan, because that message declares God’s purpose to destroy Satan and his wicked organization and that he will bring about this destruction by and through Christ Jesus his great Vindicator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>81</sup> Then it was that we began to see and to understand that Christ Jesus had come to the temple of Jehovah and was gathering unto himself God’s approved ones. By the light of the temple our understanding became enlarged. Those who have not seen and appreciated the great truth of the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple have been left in the dark. Those in the temple, and who have abode there, have been marvelously enlightened and refreshed. It is to these faithful ones that the words of the apostle now apply when he says: “That ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding.” Those who abide in the temple must have now a knowledge of God’s purpose, and Jehovah has made abundant provision for such increase of knowledge.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">TRUTH REVEALED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> During the Elijah period it was understood to be God’s purpose to save men from death, take a small number thereof to heaven, and then to “restore” to earthly perfection all who would obey during the millennial reign of Christ, and that he would destroy all disobedient ones. Stated in other phrase, it was understood to be the paramount purpose of Jehovah God to save human creatures. In the temple God’s people have now learned that such is not the chief purpose of Jehovah, but that the salvation of human creatures is merely incidental to God’s great purpose, and that only those who meet the conditions imposed upon them can be saved at all. The great and paramount purpose is the vindication of Jehovah’s name by and through his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> The declaration of Jehovah at Eden that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head now has a far greater meaning to us than it had in former days. The seed of God’s woman is his kingdom or royal house, the offspring of Jehovah’s universal organization. The serpent and his seed is not merely the Devil, but means Satan’s entire organization, both visible and invisible, and that seed shall be destroyed by God’s kingdom of heaven. From the very time of Eden till now the words of Jehovah, as stated in Genesis 3: 15, have been a declaration of deadly warfare against Satan, which war will find its completion in the battle of the great day of God Almighty, which is just at hand.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">HIS NAME</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> The paramount issue or question to be settled by the battle of the great day of God Almighty is the name of Jehovah God, and hence the most important thing is the vindication of his holy name. By keeping this great truth at all times in mind we are better enabled to see and understand the will of God as expressed in the unfolding of his prophecies. When Satan defied God and challenged him to put on earth men who would maintain their integrity toward God under the test, that raised the question of Jehovah’s supremacy, and hence of his name, because the name of Jehovah stands for supreme power, perfect wisdom, complete justice and entire unselfishness. The purpose of Jehovah must be accomplished. The name of Jehovah is magnified as of supreme importance by the words uttered by the prototype of Christ Jesus, to wit: “His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun; and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed. Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things. And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen, and Amen. The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.”—Ps. 72: 17-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> These words constitute a declaration of war against Satan. Furthermore the Lord Jesus as Jehovah’s faithful and true witness hurled defiance at Satan when he declared: “I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.” (Ps. 22: 22) The apostle specifically applied the words of this psalm to Jesus and his brethren and declared God’s purpose to destroy Satan and his organization by his “Hand”, Christ Jesus. (Heb. 2:12-14) The time draws near when this final conflict will take place; hence the increased persecution of those who are on the Lord’s side.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">HIS WITNESSES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Since the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple and the enlargement of our knowledge we have learned that God’s purpose in bringing men to a knowledge of the truth is not to get them to heaven to help rule the universe, but that he has been taking out from the world a people for his name. It seems quite certain that those thus taken out as a people </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">for </span><span class="font5">his name God selected chiefly at the beginning and at the end of the Christian era. By that is meant that Jehovah’s true witnesses were selected chiefly in the days of the apostles, and after the coming of the Lord Jesus to the temple. Why, then, has Jehovah suffered Satan to carry on his wicked organization during all the centuries past? The true answer to that question we did not learn until the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple. The answer is that God has permitted Satan to go his limit in his attempt to carry out his boastful challenge and that in due time Jehovah may show all creation his own supreme power, and in the meantime have his witnesses declare his name in all the earth.—Ex. 9: 16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> Jehovah has given Satan open and full opportunity to prove his wicked challenge, and before he executes Satan and his wicked agents God will have his witnesses boldly declare throughout the earth his own great name. To carry out his purpose Jehovah sent Jesus to the earth to tell the truth, and for telling the truth Satan caused Jesus to be put to death. Jesus plainly declared that every one who hears and obeys his voice must likewise tell the truth of and concerning Jehovah and his purpose, hence all such must expect to be assaulted by the Devil and his agents. (John 18: 37; 15: 19, 20) Because Jesus was faithful unto death in bearing testimony to Jehovah's name God raised him up out of death and gave him the highest place in the universe and designated him as “the faithful and true witness”. This further proves that the chief purpose of Jehovah in sending Jesus to earth was to declare the truth in vindication of his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The apostles were witnesses for Jehovah, and they were put to a violent death because of their faithfulness in declaring the truth. Upon the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple those faithful witnesses are first resurrected and gathered to himself. Then the remnant on earth are gathered unto the Lord to </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">temple, because these are the ones taken out from the world for the name of Jehovah and they must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah. Every one who now enjoys the light of the temple of God was once in darkness in Satan’s world. Now these have been brought out of darkness into the light of God’s kingdom. Why has God taken them out of darkness and brought them into the light? Has he done this merely that they might be saved and find a home in heaven ? That question must be answered, No, the purpose being stated by the apostle in these words: “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.” (1 Pet. 2: 9) It is impossible for us to show forth the praises of God unless we have a knowledge of his will or purpose. Since being brought into the temple Jehovah through Christ Jesus has provided all the means for the acquiring of the desired knowledge. Take note of some of the spiritual food Jehovah has provided for the benefit of his witnesses. He has taught us that love means an unselfish devotion to God, which Jesus has demonstrated by his complete devotion to his Father. He has informed us that Jehovah is the great Rock and that his universal organization is his mountain, out of which the Stone is cut without hands, and which Stone becomes the Ruler of the world. He has made known to us that the kingdom is his highest creation, because it is by and through his kingdom that he will vindicate his holy name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>29</sup> Since bringing the faithful into the temple the Lord has unfolded to them his prophecies written in times of old. These prophecies and the physical facts showing fulfillment thereof he has caused to be published in the Watch Tower publications, that his people might grow in knowledge concerning his purposes. He has caused the revelation of his prophecy to be published in numerous books and booklets. The information therein contained could not become knowledge to anyone unless he studies the contents of those publications. Hence study is vitally necessary. If these books and booklets contain merely a repetition of what was published in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Scripture Studies,</span><span class="font5"> then there would have been no reason for their publication. If we believe that Christ Jesus is at the temple of God and that he and Jehovah are our Teachers, then we may know that these great Teachers have provided this information that we might grow in the knowledge of Jehovah’s will in wisdom and in spiritual understanding. Believing these things, every one of the temple class should be exceedingly diligent not merely in casually reading what is published, but in carefully studying and considering what God has caused to be published. We cannot show ourselves approved unto God unless we study the truth which he has revealed for our benefit. Those who are neglecting to study carefully the truth as it is unfolded are sorely neglecting the food which God has provided for them and by and through which their strength is derived.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> In the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preservation</span><span class="font5"> God has given his people the opportunity to learn how his protection is provided for those who love him. In the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font5"> he has caused to be set forth the facts showing the fulfillment of the prophecy of Zechariah and disclosing his purpose to destroy Satan’s organization, and the means by which he will bring about the destruction for the vindication of his holy name. In the book bearing the name </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah</span><span class="font5"> he makes known his purposes as expressed by his covenants, the meaning of the plagues at Egypt, and their antitypical fulfillment, and how these shall come upon the whole world, and what position Jehovah’s people must take. Now he gives to his people an explanation of the prophetic picture of Gideon and his army, and this may properly be taken as an indication that the day of battle of final settlement of the great issue is very near at hand. These are some of the things which we need to know, and which Jehovah has provided that we may know them and that we may increase in wisdom, take the wise and proper course, and .continue to increase in spiritual understanding that we may be more efficient in fulfilling the commission he has given to his people.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">WORTHY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> The greatest privilege ever accorded to a creature is that of serving Jehovah God. Those whom he has taken out of the world for his name’s sake Jehovah has constituted his witnesses, and to them he has said: &quot;Ye are my witnesses . . . that I am God.&quot; Why was the apostle so anxious and why did he pray so earnestly that the saints might come to a knowledge of God’s purpose in wisdom and in spiritual understanding? His own words constitute the answer: &quot;That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.”—Col. 1: 10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> The walking worthy before God does not mean what we formerly thought, such as character development. It means to know God’s purpose and then to be faithful in performing the commission and obligation laid upon his witnesses. To be &quot;&nbsp;fruitful in every good work” means to be bearers of the fruit of God’s kingdom, which fruit is the message of truth concerning the kingdom. This he has committed to his witnesses, and this life-giving and life-sustaining message of truth they must carry to others; and in doing this such witnesses increase in the knowledge of God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NEEDED STRENGTH</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>83</sup> Now the remnant see and appreciate the truth that there are two mighty organizations facing each other for final battle and that those who are in God’s organization are absolutely in need of divine strength to be exercised in their behalf. Such strength is exercised only in behalf of those who are wholly devoted to God; as it is written: &quot;For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.” (2 Chron. 16: 9) That is another reason why the remnant must be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, that they might be &quot;strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness”. (Col. 1: 11) The remnant must study to gain this knowledge and strength.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> Because of the repeated and continuous persecution of the remnant by the agents of Satan Jehovah’s witnesses must suffer long and be patient. Patience means the constant and steadfast forward movement of the remnant in the performance of their God-given commission and doing so amidst great persecution, at the same time rejoicing that they have a part in suffering the reproaches like those which the Devil heaped upon Christ Jesus because of his faithfulness in telling the truth. &quot;For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.” (Rom. 15: 3) There is no other way to enter into the kingdom save through suffering for righteousness’ sake; and the remnant, having'a knowledge of that truth, rejoice because they are permitted to engage in the fight on the Lord’s side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>35</sup> It is the faithful witnesses for Jehovah, taken out of the world for his name and who continue faithful in the performance of their duties and obligations, that are made partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. These rejoice in the light given to them at the temple, and they delight to do the will of God. Shall we therefore give thanks and honor to any man for this knowledge and light gained by feeding upon the spiritual food provided? Most certainly, no; because to do so would be an insult to God. He is the one who through Christ Jesus at the temple has provided this spiritual food. For this reason, continues the apostle: &quot;Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light: who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son.” (Col. 1: 12, 13) It is now easy to be seen why those who give honor and praise to a man for what truth they have received continue in the dark and have no appreciation of present-day truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> Jehovah has made Christ Jesus Lord and King and has given him pre-eminence in all things. By his blood arc we redeemed and made righteous before the Lord God, and by and through his merit are privileged to be partakers with him in his kingdom. (Col. 1: 14-16) As a condition precedent, however, to entering into the kingdom we must suffer like reproaches that came upon Jesus, and hence suffer because of our faithfulness in bearing testimony to the truth, and which testimony is now committed to the remnant. God provides the strength for the remnant to meet these trying conditions.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">BOLDNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> Every one who enters fully into the kingdom must be a witness to the truth and must deliver the testimony with boldness and without fear of man or devil. (1 John 4: 17, 18) Let Jehovah’s witnesses think of themselves soberly and as they ought to think. Why should a witness for the Most High be abashed and tremble in the presence of the harsh rulers of Satan’s world, or be arrogant in the presence of the most lowly person ? To think soberly and properly means that Jehovah’s witnesses must keep in mind, in substance, these things: By the grace of Jehovah God I am his witness, and back of me is unlimited power as long as I am acting according to his will. I must expect the enemy to persecute me, and I know that my God is able to deliver me when and in the manner that is pleasing to him. I will continue to declare his name and his kingdom regardless of what creatures may do to me.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> To all of his faithful follower’s Christ Jesus says: “Behold! I send you forth as sheep into the midst of wolves; be, therefore, sagacious as serpents, and innocent as doves. But beware of these men; for they will deliver you up to high councils [courts], and scourge you in their synagogues; and they will bring you before governors and kings, on my account, to bear testimony to them and the [nations].”—Matt. 10:16-18, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>39</sup> The very things here mentioned were done to the apostles, and to the faithful ones immediately associated with the apostles, because they were faithful in declaring Jehovah’s purpose to rule the world by his righteous King Christ Jesus. Like persecutions and things have come upon the remnant who are now Jehovah’s witnesses, and for the reason that they boldly declare Jehovah’s purpose to rule the world by his righteous King Christ Jesus. Such persecution is made manifest particularly upon the first and the last witnesses of Jehovah on earth. Jesus did not say to his faithful followers that they should hide out when they are persecuted, but he told them that they should go on in giving the testimony. It was impossible for his apostles and those immediately associated with them to complete the testimony before the coming of the Lord Jesus, because they lived only a few years. Therefore Jesus said to them: “But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.”—Matt. 10: 23.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> But how shall Jehovah’s witnesses now act? When persecuted in one place, shall they flee to another to avoid persecution ? No; for the reason that Christ has now come, has taken his authority and has gathered the temple class and instructed them and sent them forth as his witnesses. Now the remnant must finish the testimony; therefore they must boldly continue to bear witness to the truth, trusting in the Lord to deliver them in his own time and way. Hence the Lord says to these faithful ones: “Be not afraid of those who kill the body, but cannot destroy the [future] life; but rather fear him who can utterly destroy both life and body in Gehenna. Whoever, therefore, shall acknowledge me before men, I also will acknowledge him before that Father of mine in the heavens. But whoever shall renounce me before men, I also will renounce him before that Father of mine in the heavens. Think not that I am come to send forth peace on this land; I am come not to send peace, but war.” (Matt. 10: 28, 32-34, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diag.)</span><span class="font5"> This is a time of war, and the faithful witnesses of Jehovah need expect nothing less than a fight.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> Each one who enters into the kingdom must be changed from a human to a spirit organism; and what difference does it make how such die, just so they are faithful unto God and unto his kingdom? Satan persecuted Jesus and his apostles because they were declaring the kingdom of God, which kingdom will destroy Satan and his organization. Likewise Satan and his earthly agents now persecute Jehovah’s witnesses because they deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ which is committed to the remnant. The remnant.must deliver this testimony or declaration of war against Satan. It is a glorious fight, and will end in a glorious victory for Jehovah and his Christ. The faithful followers of Christ Jesus now rejoice to fill up the sufferings left over and to be received by the faithful ones at the present time.—Col. 1: 24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> Let the remnant therefore be diligent today in fulfilling the prayer and desire expressed by the apostle, to be “filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; that [they may] walk worthy of the Lord”, with whom they are privileged to be associated in the battle for righteousness and for the kingdom. Continue to increase in the knowledge of his will; and to that end the remnant must be diligent daily in feeding upon the spiritual food published in the Watch Tower publications by the grace of God and for the aid and comfort, strength and hope of the people who are devoted to Jehovah and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark15"></a>EARTH’S NEW RULER ENTHRONED</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">S</span><span class="font5">OME claim that the Almighty God has always ruled as King over the earth. Others, when disappointed or suffering, give expression to their inmost thought by saying, “If there is a God, why must I have an experience like this ? ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in 1914 that God began to exercise his authority over the affairs of the world through his beloved Son, whom he then placed upon his holy throne. There began the fulfilment of the prophecy: “Say among the nations, Jehovah hath become King. Surely he hath fixed the world. It shall not be shaken, he will judge the peoples with equity.”—Ps. 96:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ God hath become king over the nations, God hath taken his seat upon his holy throne.”—Ps. 47: 8, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Jehovah hath become king. Let the earth exult, let the multitude of coastlands rejoice. Clouds and thick darkness are round about him, righteousness and justice are the establishing of his throne. Fire before him proceedcth, that it may consume round about his adversaries. His lightnings have illumined the world, the earth hath seen and hath trembled.”—Ps. 97:1-4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Roth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Zion is the name given to God’s organization. Jerusalem is also a name applied thereto, and the two names are often used to mean the same thing. The people of Israel organized by Jehovah constituted typical Zion. That government, as long as the people remained in harmony with God, was a theocracy. It failed, not because of the Lord Jehovah, but because of the imperfection of man and because of the evil influence exercised over man by Satan, which influence will not be permitted when God’s righteous government is in full sway. God withdrew his favor from typical Zion in 606 B.C. His prophets foretold a time when he would set up real Zion and thereby represented the Lord as returning to Zion. This undoubtedly takes place at the time God places his anointed Son upon his throne. (Ps. 2:6) “Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury. Thus saith the Lord, I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called, A city of truth; and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, The holy mountain.” (Zech. 8: 2, 3) “The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord. ’ ’—Ps. 146:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great theocracy, when seen and appreciated by the people, will be the joy of the whole earth. It will be Zion, God’s organization, exercising power and authority over man for his good. “Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness. Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.” (Ps. 48:1, 2) “For the Lord is a great God [in Zion], and a great King above all gods. In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the strength of the hills is his also. ’ ’— Ps. 95:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Jehovah inheres all original power, to which there is no limitation. His name Almighty God means that there is no power above him. (Gen. 17:1) In his hand the nations of the earth are no more than the small dust of the balance or the drop of a bucket. (Isa. 40:15-22) He has complete and absolute power over all things. (Rom. 9:21) He may delegate that power to whomsoever he will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is all-wise. He knew the end from the beginning. (Acts 15:18) His counsel stands for ever. (Ps. 33:11) “The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. ’ ’—Prov. 3:19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is just. “Justice and judgment are the’ habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.”—Ps. 89:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is no respecter of persons or classes. (1 Pet. 1:17; Jas. 3:17) He is unchangeable. (Mal. 3:6) “Righteous art thou, 0 Lord, and upright are thy judgments.” (Ps. 119:137) “Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: 0 Lord, thou preservest man and beast.”— Ps. 36:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is love. (1 John 4:16) That means that he is entirely unselfish and that his power is administered not for selfish benefit but for the benefit of all his creatures who obey him. “How excellent is thy lovingkindness, 0 God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.” (Ps. 36:7)—Ps. 63:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus taught his followers to always pray to God: “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” Because Jehovah God is the great King above all, the government is therefore spoken of in the Scriptures as God’s kingdom, which it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God has anointed his beloved Son and delegated to him the power to be ruler over all the world. God anointed Lucifer for a certain work, and Lucifer abused the power that was delegated to him. God gave his Son Jesus a higher anointing, and he has been faithful thereto.—Ezek. 28:14; Num. 24: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the year 1914 (A.D.) the end of the period of waiting came, and at that time the great prophecy came true. God caused to be written: “Yet have I set my king [Anointed One] upon my holy hill of Zion.” (Ps. 2:6) The kingdom is therefore God’s kingdom and Christ’s kingdom, because Christ acts by reason of the power and authority delegated to him by Jehovah his Father. (John 5: 22-27; Matt. 28: 18) It was in that year, 1914, that the following prophecy began to be fulfilled: ‘ ‘ And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, saying, We give thee thanks, 0 Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.”—Rev. 11: 15-17, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lucifer, who has long been the invisible ruler of the peoples of earth, loved wickedness. Jesus the beloved Son of God has always loved righteousness and hated iniquity. “Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. ’ ’—Ps. 45: 2, 7; Heb. 1: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is by divine wisdom that Christ Jesus becomes the ruler. (Prov. 8:1,15) By the authority conferred by Jehovah upon Jesus Christ the responsibility of the righteous government rests upon his shoulder. (Isa. 9:6) Christ Jesus is that One “whose right it is”, to whom God has promised and has given the kingdom. (Ezek. 21:27) Having placed him upon the throne and given him the right to rule, Jehovah says to Christ: “Thy throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.” —Ps. 45: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He is the One whom Jehovah has sent forth to rule in the midst of his enemies. (Ps. 110:2) It is the mighty Son of God or Priest after the order of Mel-chizedek whom God will use to make all things new. (Rev. 21:5) Concerning him Jehovah God says: “His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown flourish.” (Ps. 132:18) He is the first-born of every creature. (Col. 1:15) “I also will make him my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore; and my covenant shall stand fast with him. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the moon.”—Ps. 89: 27, 28, 36, 37, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Scriptures ‘ ‘ The Stone ’ ’ is used to symbolize God’s anointed King. All government-builders, including the clergy both of the Jews and of so-called “Christendom”, have rejected him. “The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.” (Ps. 118:22,23) This mighty Stone has become the great King, and his kingdom is one that can never be wrongfully influenced or moved out of the way.—Heb. 12:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God used Moses as a type to foreshadow Jesus Christ. Moses might have become the king of Egypt; but he refused, preferring to serve Jehovah. (Heb. 11:25) Likewise Jesus refused Satan’s offer to him of the rulership of the world. (Matt. 4:8-10) Moses did not seek to exalt himself as king over Israel. He knew that the scepter could never depart from Judah. Likewise Jesus did not seek earthly kingship over Israel, but withdrew when the people would by force make him king. (John 6:15) Him who was abased Jehovah God has exalted above all others; and in due time all others shall bow before him to the glory of Jehovah God.—Phil. 2: 5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ, earth’s new and rightful Governor, is the “express image” of Jehovah God and he acts in exact harmony with Jehovah. In him is therefore found the complete expression of justice, wisdom, power, and love; and such is a guarantee that as Ruler over all the peoples he shall exercise all his power and authority unselfishly for the benefit of the people. (Heb. 1:3) Jehovah God has made him, Christ Jesus, the “leader and commander to the people”. (Isa. 55:4) His leadership and rule over the people will be in exact accord with Jehovah’s will. “The [anointed] king’s heart is in the hand of the Lord [Jehovah], as the rivers of water; he [Jehovah] turneth it [the King’s heart] whithersoever he will.” (Prov. 21:1) His thoughts are so lofty, good and righteous, and so far above those of man, that they are unsearchable. (Prov. 25:2,3) “An oracle [God’s Word] is on the lips of a king [Christ], ... his mouth must not be unfaithful.” (Prov. 16:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “Behold, the Lord God will come with strong hand [unlimited power], and his arm [his anointed King] shall rule for him; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.” (Isa. 40:10) That Jehovah God has prepared him and made him the ruler over all the world is testified to by the prophet: “Who hath raised up one [Christ Jesus] from the east, whom he calleth in righteousness to his foot ? he giveth nations before him, and maketh him rule over kings; he giveth them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow. ... I, Jehovah, the first, and with the last, I am he. ’ ’ —Isa. 41: 2-4, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A..R.V.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark17"></a>EVERLASTING COVENANT BROKEN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font5">REAKING of the everlasting covenant, made centuries ago between God and the human race, is mentioned in the prophecy of Isaiah as one of the reasons for the manifestation of God’s wrath against the enemy Satan’s organization upon earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If Satan is the chief evil one, why should God express his vengeance upon the nations and the peoples of the earth ? One of the reasons is given by the prophet of the Lord: “The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse devoured the eai'th, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.”—Isa. 24:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What is the everlasting covenant here mentioned? When the flood was done and Noah came out of the ark, God made a covenant with Noah; and that is the first mention made in the Bible of a direct covenant between God and man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God told Noah that every living creature should be meat unto him; but that he must not eat the blood, because the life is in the blood. “And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made he man.”—Gen. 9: 2-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without doubt the words of verse six just quoted form a part of that covenant and establish the everlasting rule that God is the Giver of life and that no one can with impunity take life except by authority or permission of God as his servant or executioner. Later, God gave his statutes, which are a specific expression of his law, to the Israelites. Therein it was expressly set forth: ‘ ‘ Thou shalt not kill. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When God specifically gave his law to Israel he emphasized the meaning thereof by stating it in more explicit terms. He speaks of the blood that is unrighteously shed as defiling the land. “For blood it dcfileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.”—Num. 35: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is exactly in accord with the statement made by the prophet Isaiah in the text of Isaiah 24:5, 6, and both of such Scriptural statements relate back to the terms of the covenant which God made with Noah concerning the sanctity of human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the covenant with Noah God promised that never again should there come upon the earth a flood of waters to destroy all flesh. But that is not all of the covenant. It seems that man has proceeded generally upon the theory that he can always claim benefits of this part of the covenant without being responsible for the other part. Men and nations that have claimed the benefit of that part of the covenant with relationship to the preservation of all flesh from destruction by the flood are bound by every part of the covenant, even though many have thought that that part is all of the covenant. If to refrain from destroying all flesh by </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5">flood of water is all the covenant, then God could keep that covenant and at the same time destroy all flesh by some other means should he deem that necessary. There would therefore not be much consolation in the promise that the earth should be preserved from a flood, when there are so many other means of destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The very language employed in the covenant shows that the promise that there should never again be a great flood was not the most important part of the covenant. God said: “And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.’’—Gen. 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The entire context must here be taken, and that which is expressed as the law is necessarily a part of the covenant. Be it observed that God said, “I will establish my covenant with you,” and then shows that refraining from shedding blood was a part thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The covenant also included every creature that has life. To remind man of the covenant a token thereof was given. “And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you, and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you, and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the -cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. ’ ’—Gen. 9:12-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The rainbow is the token of the covenant made and of what it embraces. It is a token of the sanctity of life. Men looking upon the token and understanding it would know that it means that life is a sacred thing and shall not be taken without just authority from Jehovah. The rainbow is the token of the entire covenant, as is plainly shown by the Lord’s words: ‘ ‘ This is the token of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">covenant,</span><span class="font5"> which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.”— Gen. 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font5">is manifest that God purposed that when man </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">looks </span><span class="font5">upon the rainbow he shall call to mind that life proceeds from Jehovah, that life is a sacred thing, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font5">that it cannot be taken with impunity. This is an everlasting covenant because God calls it the everlast</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font5">covenant and because it must stand forever. God will never change his expressed rule concerning the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">sanctity of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has not attempted to regulate the affairs of the rulers of earth, but he holds such rulers responsible in proportion to the knowledge they have or the opportunity for acquiring knowledge of the terms of his law. God’s covenant with Noah included all the living creatures on the earth. It was his official covenant because it announced his law. The breaking of the covenant time and again by the rulers and inhabitants of the earth has resulted in defiling the earth. The prophet therefore assigns the breaking of the everlasting covenant as one of the reasons for God’s wrath against the organizations of men on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God is the great Creator and the Life-giver of creatures. He is the source of life. Every living creature has an inherent right to such measure of life as God has permitted that creature to have. Anyone who deprives another of life contrary to God’s appointed way is a covenant-breaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The chief covenant-breakers among men have been the rulers of the earth. Satan of course has induced them to take such a wrongful course. But that does not release them from responsibility. Lucifer as man’s overlord was given power of death over those who violated God’s law. Lucifer defied God, and became Satan, the father of lies, and a murderer. He has taken human life to suit his own whims. He has planted murder in the hearts of men and caused many murders to be committed. Satan has caused men to defy God and to become covenant-breakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every nation of “Christendom” has broken the law of the everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of human life. Other nations, of course, have likewise broken it; but those nations which have claimed to be Christian proved by their course that they were willful hypocrites and therefore reprehensible. When Jesus was on earth he restated the law of the everlasting covenant relating to the sanctity of human life. He said: “Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment.”—Matt. 5: 21, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A.Il.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most reprehensible amongst men are those who have caused wars between the peoples, and caused them to kill each other, and then remained at home to profit from the misfortunes of those who were forced to fight. Among these reprehensible and responsible ones are the clergy who have claimed to represent Christ and God and at the same time have preached millions of young men into the trenches, and to induce them to go have represented to those young men that if they died fighting upon the battlefield they would go straight to heaven. Call to mind the millions of innocent men, women and children that have suffered and continue to suffer on account of war, and know that God will square the account. In so doing, this constitutes God’s judgment upon the governments of the world and is a part of the administration of his King, who is earth’s rightful Ruler, and must take place shortly after the beginning of his reign.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">All mail regarding the convention is to be sent, as noted above, to Washington. Do not write to Brooklyn about this convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All persons who are on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom are welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A bureau of information will be maintained at the Union Railway Station to instruct the persons upon arrival where to find accommodations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REGISTRATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is a service convention, and it is expected that all the remnant and the Jonadabs will participate in the service. In order to assign territory it is quite necessary for everyone to register quickly upon arrival. For that purpose a registration bureau will be maintained at the headquarters, on the mezzanine floor at the Washington Auditorium, situate at New York Avenue and 19th Street Northwest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It will not be necessary to bring campaign literature, but each one who attends the convention is urged to bring along his carrying case for use in the door-to-door witnessing, also to bring the identification card which every publisher should have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ROOMS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention committee is making a canvass of the city to locate rooms for those who will attend the convention. It is expected that the price of such rooms will range from 75c to $2.00 per day, depending on the kind of accommodation desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The convention committee will send (to all who write) a blank to be filled out showing the type of accommodations desired, in order that this may be on file and the accommodations ready for any who come to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">MEALS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Arrangements have been made to feed those who attend the convention, at a cafeteria located in the Washington Auditorium and which will be manned and operated by our own people in the truth and will furnish meals at such nominal cost that it will be advantageous for all. This will be our own private eating place, with good food prepared properly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TRANSPORTATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the convenience of those desiring to travel by train, the following arrangements are being made. A special convention round-trip rate of a fare and one-third will be available on all railroads. A special convention certificate will be necessary for those traveling by train from the East and the West to Washington. Write to Anton Koerber, Convention Committee, 1603 Massachusetts Ave. NW., Washington, D. C., for these certificates. Ask for a sufficient number of certificates for all in your company who contemplate attending the convention and traveling by rail. Present this certificate to the railroad ticket agent in your city and you will be allowed on a round-trip ticket the rate of one full fare and one-third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the South there is a 15-day excursion rate to Washington, D.C., which is equivalent to the certificate rate. There are also many personally conducted tours arranged by different railroads, as well as special 10-day excursion rates. In many cases these excursion rates are cheaper than the above-mentioned round-trip rate of a fare and one-third. Inquire of all railroads if there are such excursions or special rates for the week of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Any companies desiring to operate a special train between Washington and any other point will either take up this matter with their local railway company agent or communicate with Anton Koerber, Washington, D. C. If special trains are arranged in due time they will be announced in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Many will attend who will travel by bus or private automobile. A parking space for cars will be arranged. Also a camp for tourists and for house-cars and trailers. It is suggested that each company secure rates from local reliable bus lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IMMERSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Arrangements will be made for all who desire to symbolize their consecration by water immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">SPEAKERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Various brethren from America and foreign countries will address the convention, and all meetings will be conducted in the English language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The public address by the president of the Society will be delivered on Sunday, June 2, and this lecture will be broadcast on a world-wide radio network both in the United States and including stations and publicaddress systems in all the principal countries, linked together by means of telephone lines, overseas radiotelephone circuits, radio beam and short-wave facilities, making it possible by the gracious provision of Jehovah for all brethren and people of good will throughout the earth to hear this vital message of tremendous importance delivered by the president of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PIONEERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The pioneers will desire to attend the convention, and those living far away may find it difficult to cover their expenses. To aid them in paying their expenses the following arrangement is made by the Society: All pioneers who have been continuously and actively in the pioneer service for a period of three months prior to the convention, that is to say, the months of March, April and May, may receive from the Society a credit of $25 on book account, which books will be furnished to them at pioneer rates. Application for such credit may be made to the convention committee at Washington by the pioneers registering at the </span><span class="font3">PIONEER DESK.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This convention, being held at the national capital of America, should afford an opportunity to give a wide witness to people in all walks of life; therefore let all who are devoted to Jehovah present this matter in prayer before the Lord that his blessings may be added to the efforts of his people, and that the convention may magnify his holy name.</span></p>
