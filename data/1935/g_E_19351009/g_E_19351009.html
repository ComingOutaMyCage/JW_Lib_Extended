<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>First Signs of Weakness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">H</span><span class="font8">ITLER’S first signs of weakness are in the fact that in the building of the new Nazi headquarters in Munich the roof was made eight feet thick, so as to be as nearly bombproof as possible, while beneath are eighteen bombproof cellars each accommodating sixty persons. Also, these buildings are connected with others by subterranean passages thirty-two feet beneath the street. Extreme care for one’s person, and efforts to forestall death by violence, are signs of mental weakness, if not insanity. After the death of Dowie his house at Zion City, Ill., was found to be an arsenal similar to the Hitler castle at Munich, only not so extensive.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Herald Probably Has It Right</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font8"> claims that the Nazis were out of funds and in such desperate circumstances that Hitler was threatening suicide; then Hitler learned that the Junker aristocrats of Germany, of whom Hindenburg was one, had plundered the public funds in a most outrageous way; the Nazi organization forcibly suppressed those who were trying to get the facts before the public, and in this way gained control of Hindenburg and of Germany.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Hitler Paid the Bill</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font8"> DISPATCH from the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font8"> states that the Hitler government paid the traveling expenses both ways of 350 Saarlanders from the United States and South America who returned home to vote for the return of the Saar to Germany.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Nazi Headquarters at Munich</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE Nazi headquarters at Munich are not built on anything as substantial as sand. They are built on swamp land, which, until but very recently, it was thought could not hold the weight of a public building. The Nazis put down 1,780 concrete pillars, however, by keeping the pumps working night and day, and they expect their building to stand. It is seven stories in height; appropriately, four of these stories are below ground. There, of course, the Nazis will have their treasury and seek to hide from the face of Almighty God in Armageddon. But all in vain.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Demonstrations a la Coupon</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">G</span><span class="font8">ERMAN efficiency has provided the world with one form of demonstration that is new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the government wishes a demonstration held in any or all of its 16,000 centers throughout Germany every brain and manual worker is provided with a form which has to be signed and handed to a Nazi official before leaving the alleged “spontaneous” demonstration, and woe betide any worker that fails to show up.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Hitler Still a Catholic at Heart</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">dolf Hitler, though nominally a renegade Catholic, is still a Catholic at heart. One of his most trusted aides, Helmuth Brueckner, Nazi regional leader for Silesia, and governor of that province, was summarily ousted from both positions and expelled from the Nazi party for referring to the priests as sensitive old men that belong in the church and not on the street.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>In an Unnamed Prison</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font8">N AN unnamed prison in Germany, according to the Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font8"> a prisoner, a youthful workman, had been subjected to physical torments extended over several weeks. “Then he was informed that his aged mother had received permission to visit him, but when she arrived she was not allowed to see him, although she had obtained the permit with the greatest difficulty and lived many hours’ journey from the prison. She was taken into a room where her son could not see her but could hear all that was said. She was cross-examined for several hours on end on her son’s political activities, and told that she would be detained in the prison herself if her son did not reveal everything, and if she did not tell the police what they wanted to know she would not be allowed to see her son at all. Then she was told that so severe a punishment awaited her son that she would not live to see him a free man again. But both mother and son remained constant in their refusal to betray anyone or anything under these menaces.” The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font8"> stated that such methods are in common use in Germany. It is plain that the Nazis are demonized, and retain nothing of manhood to which an appeal can be made.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Reds and Catholics May Fight Nazis</span></h3>
<div><img src="g_E_19351009_files/g_E_19351009-2.png" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:18pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">THE seventh congress of the Third International, in Moscow, the proposition was made that the Reds and Catholics unite in a fight in Germany against the Nazis. That is probably what will happen, with the expected result that after the Reds and Nazis have destroyed each other the Catholics will have everything to themselves. In other words, the Roman Hierarchy is perfectly willing to back a fight between these two organizations, provided it can rule the roost thereafter.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Cruelty to the Aged</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">r. Sam Hall, leader of the Power Workers’ Group, in an address to the Transport and General Workers Union, held at the Isle of Man, reported that he had come in personal contact with the Nazi regime in Germany and that “men over 70 are expected to go through the same exercises as men of 20, and when they are no longer able to stand they are kicked up again and ordered to go on”. The measure of a people’s civilization is best determined by its treatment of the aged and helpless.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>The German Bible—Mein Kampf</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">ADVERTISEMENTS carried in German papers show that Hitler’s book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf </span><span class="font8">(My Fight) has reached a total printing of 1,820,000 copies. That is nothing at all. In the Brooklyn factory alone 5,620,000 copies have been printed of Judge Rutherford’s book </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Harp of God,</span><span class="font8"> 3,403,500 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font8"> 2,774,000 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Creation,</span><span class="font8"> 2,058,000 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation,</span><span class="font8"> 2,495,000 of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Government,</span><span class="font8"> and ten other clothbound books of over 1,000,000 each. The printing of booklets has literally run into the hundreds of millions. Of the last booklet, on “Government”, 5,000,000 were printed in the first edition. Hitler thinks he is a great man; but when his bubble bursts and the people look for the place where it was, they will find nothing but a small hole in the ground.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">T Berlin, on May Day, every worker in the city had to parade to the Tempelhof Field and rejoice before Hitler or else lose his job. The only exceptions allowed were expectant mothers and women over 40. Men had to wear long blue trousers, black shoes, white shirts, black ties and blue peaked caps. Women had to wear blue skirts, white blouses and black ties. The marchers were 11 abreast, each row in charge of a Nazi under orders to inflict severe punishment on anybody that fell out of the ranks. What do you think about that, you Americans ? Is that what you want in America? Well, it is what you will get, if the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is allowed to have its way.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>How Hitler Was Financed</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font8">AYS Upton Sinclair, of California: “More recently, five great German arms manufacturers contributed heavily to Hitler’s campaign funds. And the French-owned Skoda, Czechoslovakia’s great armament firm, donated millions of marks to Hitler’s campaign. These same Frenchmen also own newspapers that did more than any others to enrage France against Hitler, exhorting the people to build up the French defenses against the menace of rearming Germany, screaming, 'Awake, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">La Patrie!'</span><span class="font8"> But it was left to the Federal Laboratories of Pittsburgh to carry the art of double-dealing to high perfection; it sold gas bombs simultaneously to all antagonists in war-torn Cuba in 1933.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Treatment of Prisoners</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font8"> in its issue of May 10, tells of prisoners in Germany being struck so that the blood flows from ears and mouth; of a girl so severely beaten that she lost consciousness; of another girl of 18 who was kicked in the abdomen and also lost consciousness ; of the special cell where the stench is unbearable, the window can be opened only an inch, there are only wooden planks upon which to sleep, there is a hot meal only once in three days; of a prisoner 20 years of age being in chains for two weeks, the bridge of his nose broken; of a prisoner being beaten in the face with a bunch of keys; of a prisoner having his eardrum broken; of women chained at night; of the arrest of old men and women and cripples; of two prisoners hitting back, and both being beaten to death.

<p><span class="font8">THE Manchester </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span><span class="font8"> gives details of the treatment of prisoners at the Dachau prison camp in Germany. Some of the cells are unheated throughout the winter, some are dark, and some have chains let into the walls. Prisoners are compelled to work at the double-quick. One so working was ordered to drop his load and run. He obeyed and did so and, when he ran, was shot twice on the pretext that he was trying to escape. This man, Hans Max Kohn, is a mass of scars. One of his fingers was completely severed by a blow. Some prisoners have been beaten until they have lost most of their teeth. Rather than lose its dividends and its grip on the throat of the people Big Business would gladly turn all mankind over to the Devil himself, as they have done in Germany.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font8">E WERE prepared to find here and there a placard at the main gate of a farm property prohibiting Jews from entering on pain of bodily ill-treatment, but of these placards we saw not one or two, but hundreds. In the villages they are on almost every door; it is a matter of honor to flaunt them. Not to one of the peasants who go on Sunday in their splendid old peasant costumes to the church service does it occur that these placards are the coarsest re-vilings of the “Evangel” which they profess. Worse still is the warning that whole villages cry out in unison: “Jews are forbidden to enter the village.” Really this might fairly be brought before a magistrate for the restraint of what amounts to a breach of the peace. But nobody dreams of doing so. This brutal outlawry of the Jews has become a commonplace in Oberhessen —the Jews themselves no longer take umbrage at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">They have worse things to endure. For how many Jewish families it is now an anxious moment when the father of the family lights the Sabbath lights. The window shutters are closed for safety, and in hundreds of cases stones rain upon them. Woe to anyone who ventures, not to protest—nobody any longer has the strength and the hardihood for that—but even to ask for some consideration to be shown. I know of a case in which a white-haired Jew, a man whose simple piety and warm humanity had earned him in the past the respect of the peasants among whom he lived, who begged for the uproar to be ended because his wife lay near to death. The reply came from a stone that struck him on the forehead amid a chorus of derision and obscenity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">She died. When he had buried his life companion the old Jew left everything as it stood, house and garden and all that was in them; his possessions had become worthless to him. He collected those few things that his heart still clung to, a few trifles of no interest to anybody else, closed the shutters over his windows, and walked out of the village—jeered at by the young men, slandered by the twenty-year-old hero of this tragedy, greeted with silent sympathy by an old peasant woman. He has never returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are hundreds of such exiles, wandering with the little remains of what they had, in Frankfort; they have abandoned their homes because they cannot endure the malevolence and the humiliations to which they were exposed in their village.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The program of the young heroes is to allow them no peace until they disappear. I was told of one young fellow of this type, employed in some town, who went home to his parents on Saturdays. At home he amused himself with a shotgun, aiming through a hole in the roof of his father’s house and breaking the windows of any Jews’ houses that he could reach. The whole village knows all about it, but there is no police interference with the young wretch. Evidently none of the injured parties dares to make a complaint.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Devil’s Real Target—Jehovah’s witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE following is a summary of an article in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Westdeutscher Beobachter</span><span class="font8"> of Cologne: </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“no room for peace disturbers!’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At a convention of the German Labor Front, in Annaberg, Saxony, Pg. Stiehler, a leader, said in an address to the leaders: “The German Labor Front cannot permit any longer that people who do not belong to this national organization remain employed. They disturb the labor peace in the works [mills, factories, mines, etc.], and it is the duty of the German Labor Front to see to it that such elements are kicked out.” He stated: “Such peace disturbers are especially from the camp of the International Bible Students, who are nothing else than a continuation of the Marxist parties, the traitors of country and people. People who refuse to join the Horst-Wessel-Song [a Nazi hero-worship song] and to join the salute to the leader [Hitler] or claim their faith does not permit them to join the German Labor Front, and by other acts of sabotage disturb the unity in the works, must be removed. The German Labor Front will not stand for any incitement against confessions or spreading of religious fanaticism.” The labor trustee [Pg. Stiehler] called on the leaders of the German Labor Front to no more merely talk, but henceforth to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Copenhagen </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Aftenbladet</span><span class="font8"> has the following from its Berlin correspondent. Its Roman Catholic origin is self-evident:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The German authorities have now banned the books of Judge Rutherford, the investigator, in Germany. They have been put on the black list and must not be published any more in the German Reich.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“The reason therefor stated is that an examination has shown that a close connection existed between an association of Bible students and Judge Rutherford’s movement ‘Friends of Jehovah’. All members of this association were Communists, and Nazi can only see in it a masked Marxist organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“However, there seems to be more reason to suppose that Rutherford has been banned on account of a sensational speech he delivered recently, wherein he declared that he was going to fight the pope, Mussolini, and Hitler with all his might, as he regards them to be enemies of the people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Westdeutscher Beobachter,</span><span class="font8"> Cologne, which, because it is especially venomous against Jehovah’s witnesses, is most certainly under Roman Catholic influence, says, gleefully:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PRISON FOR “INTERNATIONAL BIBLE STUDENTS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Lower Court in Seesen [Germany] sentenced five persons, who were actively engaged for the prohibited “Bible Students Association”, to prison terms ranging from three to six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reporting the imprisonment of eight of Jehovah’s witnesses from Darmstadt another Cologne paper says truthfully, and should have said with bowed head: “The defendants refused to admit that there was anything criminal in their creed, since they wanted only to preach God’s Word and to serve mankind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Limbacher </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Tageblatt und Anzeiger</span><span class="font8"> reports two brethren sentenced to nine and seven months respectively in prison, because, so said the judge, they spread “heresy”. The judge went on to say: “The Nazi movement has become great because of its faith in the Fuehrer [Hitler] • that he [Hitler] is very religious [he is a Roman Catholic] and does not place himself above God, as the defendants have claimed. The defendants should not claim that they have received greater enlightenment than other Christians. The Third Reich [Hitler’s government] must live on and must not tolerate the destruction of its foundations. Never before have the German people been as happy as at present, knowing that again there is a future for them.” Both defendants refused to give the German salute, both admitted they had put the message of the Kingdom in the hands of the people, and both said that the Judgment Day is at hand, when the world of the Devil will be destroyed and there will be only one State. They were taken into custody when a meeting of “Bible Students” was raided by the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A brother writes from a place in Germany, via a neighboring country: “Throughout Germany hundreds of brethren have been arrested for celebrating together the memorial of Jehovah and Christ Jesus. Even where only two or three assembled, and this in their own homes, they were espied upon by the secret police and betrayed by their neighbors.” At the time of writing these were still kept in prison without having had a trial and without being convicted; all together, there were, to his knowledge, about 1,500 of Jehovah’s witnesses behind prison bars. In one camp were eighty brethren. Each, as he entered, was given twenty-five hard blows with a stick; brutal punishments, such as the dark cell, follow for the least offense. Brethren were placed on a scaffold as a spectacle, and after the Nazis had made sport of them they threw them down from the scaffold. In one city ten are in prison, two of them sisters, one 72 and one 75 years of age. In one prison the brethren were sentenced to four, two and a half, and two years, respectively, for passing </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font8"> from one to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A German newspaper clipping shows that one</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">brave brother was given one year in prison and three days extra because he refused to stand up when the court pronounced sentence. The account shows the Devil’s crowd are cut to the heart. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The prosecution pointed out that the defendant sold Bibles from house to house in order to obtain an opportunity to spread his illegal propaganda for the International Bible Students Association, and this he did under the disguise of the name “Jehovah’s witness” in order to prevent interference with his work by the authorities. By his activity the defendant has placed before the people deep-cutting questions of conscience, although this was entirely unnecessary, and has robbed them of their faith and love toward state and God.</span></p>

All of the columns and columns of stuff about proposed attacks on the Catholics and Protestants was intended to cover up the fact that Germany at that very time had about 2,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses in prison, and was putting more of them in prison every day. On the day the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times’</span><span class="font8"> editorial was published, Martin Harbeck, Jehovah’s witness, and one of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society’s European representatives, was then in Germany and in prison, and it was thought best by the Hierarchy, and its employee, Hitler, to set up a smoke screen for the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> and others.</span></p>

That was learned today along with the revelation of the first known imprisonment of a Catholic priest in Germany for statements from the pulpit.” Ponder that well. Consider that at that time 2,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses were in prison in Germany, the American newspapers have been filled for months with lurid stories of proposed attacks on Catholics and others, and now is the first instance of such attack. The news of the world is in the grip of the most unprincipled people in the world— the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. They are determined to prevent the people from knowing the facts.</span></p>

Then how about the fact that some 2,000 of Jehovah’s witnesses are in prison in Germany, and they are not allowed any liberties in the land whatever? Ambassadors should tell the truth first, and make their explanations in accord therewith. The whole German campaign is a put-up job by a Roman Catholic dictator, the real object being to put the pope back in power in that land, and crush out Jehovah’s witnesses, and all other truth-lovers.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Extract from German Golden Age</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">ON THE 16th of April, 1935, I was present at a trial in a small town in the Pfalz, Germany. A young lady, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, stood before the court. The prosecutor read, in substance, the following statement: “About a year ago the daughter of Mrs. K---</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">in U----was murdered by a fiend. The parents</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of the murdered girl were deeply grieved and even contemplated suicide. When the defendant heard of it she called on Mrs. K----to comfort</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">her. While thus doing she was nabbed and arrested. This is her statement: T am one of Jehovah’s witnesses, and am in duty bound to comfort mourners, according to the Scriptures. When I heard of the tragedy that befell family K----I decided to visit and comfort them. I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">was there about once a week. Once I went to the cemetery with Mrs. K----.’ Mrs. K----her</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">self testified that the defendant spoke only kind and comforting words to her. Had she conversed about politics, as the prosecutor presumed, the visits would not have been welcome. The Bible only was discussed.&quot; In spite of this evidence the state prosecutor demanded a one-month jail sentence, for this reason: “The defendant wanted couple K----to join the International Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Students Association; she had success. If the couple had not been in poor circumstances contributions would have been invited. In this activity of the defendant I see a misdemeanor against the peace and safety of state and people, and seeing how the poison is penetrating the German people through such channels, I therefore demand a jail sentence of one month.” Now the defendant’s counsel had the word: “Among other things the prosecutor stated, ‘The whole crime of the defendant consisted of saving two people from suicide.’ This witness of Jehovah has done what no clergyman could do, and for that shall she be punished ? Such people should be rewarded.” His plea for freedom for the defendant was granted. On the same day and before the same court nine of Jehovah’s witnesses were sentenced to fines of from 150 to 200 marks for the sole reason that they attended a meeting of Jehovah’s witnesses. In other words, they chose obedience to the divine command in regard to “not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together” for studying the Bible. It was remarkable that in all cases the accusers, police officers, always admitted that Jehovah’s witnesses are quiet, diligent and industrious, against whom nothing can be objected except that they take the Bible seriously.’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>In a Few Days, in a Single District</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">TN A few days, in a single district in Germany, the following occurred: The next day after the memorial of Jesus’ death two of Jehovah’s witnesses were taken into custody, on complaint of a clergyman, and that without any reason whatever; three were arrested while yet in their beds and were brought to concentration camp; three sisters were taken into custody for attending the memorial of the Savior’s death; six brethren were given sentences of three to six months for attending study meetings; six were arrested at the Memorial itself; similarly six others, in another place, were arrested; three brothers and two sisters were sentenced to three months each for confessing themselves Jehovah’s witnesses; a 70-year-old man was sentenced to two months in prison for reading a booklet with Biblical statements; in one town the housewuves have received orders to notify the police at once when any of Jehovah’s witnesses receive friends in their home; the best worker on a certain job must forfeit his position because he refused to say “Heil Hitler”; seven brothers have been in a concentration camp four to six months, without trial, and deprived of legal advice; in another place six were condemned to prison and when the prison terms expired they were put in concentration camps; a brother in a concentration camp was told he would not be set free until Jehovah would fetch him thence at Armageddon. Two hundred actions against Jehovah’s witnesses are impending in the district, and similar conditions prevail throughout the whole of Germany. The country has gone entirely to the Devil.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Further Distressing Reports</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font8">EPORTS from Germany are that the persecutions there now beggar description. Men born in Germany are saying, “Today I am ashamed to be a German.” Hundreds of preachers who opposed the Neo-Paganism of the new German National Church were arrested, some of them as they stood in the pulpit. Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany have been proscribed at the instigation of the clergy. A regional service director disappeared completely, either imprisoned or foully murdered. A brother was dismissed from prison for no known reason except that his son-in-law is a member of the nobility and an ardent supporter of the Nazis. Women have cheerfully accepted prison sentences rather than compromise the name of Jehovah God. The work goes on, under great difficulties. A writer in a Nazi paper, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Drehscheibe, </span><span class="font8">quotes a page from </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span><span class="font8"> and then says: “The time is short. Jehovah is gathering His troops. In America sits His war minister, Judge Rutherford, a man with a very long and sharp pen. The army of fighters against Jehovah must become more and more numerous. We must get the start of Him by a preventive war.” At the conclusion of his article the writer last quoted said: ‘We shall meet again in the battlefield of Armageddon.” A brother at Gelsenkirchen, for writings found in his possession, allegedly entitled “A Witness of Jehovah”, and allegedly against State and “Christianity”, received seven months in jail</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">; yet</span><span class="font8"> writings completely repudiating the Bible altogether find hearty acceptance in Nazidom. In H----a girl, a daughter of one of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah’s witnesses, wrote a letter to the state police declaring that her father had never had anything to do with politics and that the action of the police in sending him to prison was a persecution of Christians smacking of the Dark Ages. For this she was fined 25 marks or five days in jail. In the Mecklenburg district thirty of Jehovah’s witnesses were sent to prison for terms varying from eighteen months for Brother T---- to six months for all the others. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hamburg papers said of these brethren: “As a community in our nation they had no right to live. Their alpha and omega is the Bible, according to which there is no fatherland on earth, and the word ‘Heil’ (Hail or Salvation) properly belongs only to Jehovah but never and in no wise to Adolf Hitler. They refused the Hitler salute; besides, they are devoted to pacifism, and they confess that in the case of war they would refuse war service. Who is not for us is against us.” Something like that is stated in the Bible. The prelude of the trial was that the public in the background refused to give the Hitler salute when the court entered, thereby identifying themselves as Jehovah’s witnesses, wherefore they were expelled offhand.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Jehovah’s witnesses in the Fiery Furnace</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font8"> N Associated Press dispatch from Berlin, dated June 18, says: “Secret police raided bookshops and newspaper stands today, confiscating all pamphlets by J. F. Rutherford, head of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Brooklyn, on the ground they contained treasonable charges. The Nazis are trying to wipe out the Society of Bible Researchers, explaining the religious society cannot be tolerated because it defies the Hitler dictatorship, acknowledging only the rule of God. In Darmstadt thirteen members of the Bible society, which is now forbidden, were sentenced to four months’ imprisonment for the distribution of treasonable propaganda.” In explanation of the foregoing it should be stated that all the names above used have reference to Jehovah’s witnesses, of whom J. F. Rutherford is one. It should also be explained that these innocent Christian people now falsely accused by the Roman Catholic and other clergy as conspiring against the German state are the very same people that were accused falsely, in 1918, of being pro-German. Judge Rutherford was one of those thus falsely accused, and was sentenced to eighty years in Atlanta Penitentiary. Strange how the Devil can use the clergy!

The letter cannot be printed, because it would aid the devils in swastika to commit yet other outrages, but it is enough to break the heart of any man who has a heart to read the simple words “Er hat eine Frau und drei kleine Kinder”. May Jehovah, the true and loving and almighty God fulfill the imprecations of the Psalms upon the souls of these beasts that have insulted God by killing one of His witnesses and at the same time have deprived “three little children” of their father and caretaker. It is bad enough for the frau to be deprived of her life companion, but for the poor “drei kleine kinder”, the three little kids, all one can do is to cry for Armageddon to come soon. But meantime God may see to it that the little ones are safely hidden in the midst of the storm.</span></p>

The values represented in the German character, therefore, are the eternal values with which everything else must be compared and upon which all else must be constructed.

After denouncing in savage language the historical and prophetical books that preceded Christ’s first advent, he says that these “stories of pimps and cattle dealers will be replaced by Nordic sagas and legends”. On page 636 he says: “The principal requirement of all German education is to recognize the fact that we have not derived our ethical standards from Christianity, but that Christianity owes its permanent qualities to the German character. It is therefore the virtues of the German character that are eternal. Everything else must adapt itself to these virtues.” This kind of “spiritual food” has the definite approval of Big Business, and would be entirely acceptable to them in America, if the American people would fall for it. And people that will swallow what the American people swallowed just after Mr. Wilson “kept us out of the war” will swallow anything at all.</span></p>

We do not permit ourselves to be fascinated by disbelief or revealed miracles, for there never has happened a greater miracle than in our time. This miracle of the Almighty has been performed through Adolf Hitler—a miracle of resurrection of the German people.” In the Hitler Youth Hour, broadcast June 30 over Germany, the demand was made that the youth of the land decide “Are you with our Leader or do you want to have besides another leader?” These and hundreds of other items show that Hitler, in Germany, has, for millions of Germans, become Antichrist.</span></p>

The following are translations of some of the statements made therein:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘ The excellent gods of the old Germanic religion are more closely related to us and holier than the Jew God Jehovah and the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The German children must learn to know their own ancestors and learn to respect them, and that is a higher way towards faith in Germany than the characters of the Jewish Bible.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘The old blood of Germanic spirit is awakening again in us, and no power in the world can put it down again. One thing Christianity has not been able to do is to put the old joyful heathen laughing out of the world. All laughing comes from heathendom, and joy is heathenish. Christianity knows not to laugh, and no evangelist reports that Jesus of Nazareth ever laughed. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Nations of the world, be loyal to yourselves, or be loyal to your own gods. Be loyal to your race and country and whatever is grown thereon. Challenge Jehovah to battle, who threatens your life. [Was there reference here to the numerous telegrams sent to the head of the German government by Jehovah’s witnesses from all over the earth ? These telegrams read, in part, “Cease persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses, or Jehovah will destroy you and your national party.”] ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Jehovah must die in us and amongst us. If we continue this fight against Jehovah we will do the greatest service and accomplish the world mission of the German people. We do not need the Bible any longer. The Bible does not mean anything to us. We Germans are not mere men. We are gods!’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘Service of Jehovah means indifference to everyone for himself. Jehovah must die in us and to us in order that we as a people may live. When this dawn of demonism is accomplished within us, then we render to the world the highest and the greatest service, and that is the real mission of the German people.’ (Paper for the German faith, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Lightning</span><span class="font7"> No. 18.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘The church has not prevented the German workingman from losing his faith in God, and in his home, and that he has sold out to atheism and Marxism. The church, by its covenant with the bourgeois, and by the marriage of throne and altar, has driven the German workingmen into international Marxism and bolshevism. The German workingmen will not voluntarily return to the church and to Christianity.’ (The ABC of the German heathen.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">‘The German youth do not any longer find moral foundation in the Bible, but in their faith in Germany. ’</span></p>

No longer do we want merely to believe in Christ, but we want to be Christ ourselves and act like Christ, for ourselves, for our people, and for humanity.” To this may be added the fact that the cruelties practiced in German concentration camps are so terrible as to defy description and sufficient to break the will of the most determined.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">A five-minute talk</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">J</span><span class="font8">EHOVAH is the God of order, and His organization is His systematic arrangement employed to carry out His purpose. His universal organization is called Zion, and is symbolically pictured by a woman. The Scriptures speak of that organization as “mount Zion” or God’s “holy mountain”. Lucifer was once a part of that holy mountain. When Lucifer rebelled against Jehovah he was cast out of God’s holy organization. Jehovah expressed His purpose to build a special organization by and through ■which He would carry forward His purpose concerning the human race. That special organization is called the seed or offspring of the universal organization of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To Abraham God made a promise in these words (Genesis 22:18): “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” Later God, by the Scriptures, declared that the promised seed is The Christ, meaning His anointed royal Son whom He has made the world’s Ruler. (Galatians 3:16-29) In the prophecies are found many pictures foretelling the building up of God’s seed or capital organization. Christ Jesus, the Head of that organization, is pictured by a precious stone. In the prophecy of Isaiah (28:16) He says: “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone.” By the apostle Peter God explains that this Stone means Christ Jesus and that faithful men who become a part of His organization are called living stones. (1 Peter 2:1-9) In the prophecy of Daniel (second chapter) Jehovah’s royal organization is pictured as ‘The Stone cut out of the mountain without hands’, which stone becomes a great mountain, meaning a mighty organization, and which organization destroys Satan’s power, and then administers blessings to the nations of the earth. Thus it is seen that Jehovah’s universal organization is pictured as a mountain and that His special organization is likewise pictured as a mountain. It is to these two mountains Jesus in His great prophecy warned the people that they must flee during the time of distress at the end of the world. This mighty organization of God, symbolized by the mountains, is the kingdom of God under Christ, and it is the sole and complete hope of the peoples of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus was anointed, following His baptism in the Jordan, there began the building up of God’s special organization or seed of promise. When God raised up Jesus out of death and exalted Him to heaven He was then the Rightful Ruler of the world, but it pleased God to wait a long period of time before the rule of Christ should begin. (Psalm 110:1) During that waiting period God has been selecting from amongst men a few whom He makes a part of His organization. These are the ones that are ‘taken out as a people for His name’ and whom God makes His witnesses in the earth. (Acts 15:14; Isaiah 43:10) The apostles of Jesus were witnesses, and likewise faithful followers of Christ Jesus now on earth are Jehovah’s witnesses. The end of the world has now come, and within a short time Jesus Christ as the mighty Officer of Jehovah will destroy Satan’s power; but before doing so the Lord sends forth men and women as His witnesses to tell the people of His purpose and of His provision for their blessings. For that reason Jehovah’s witnesses now come to you with books explaining these truths and which show you where to find them in your Bible that you may learn them for yourselves. The booklet </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Final War</span><span class="font8"> gives an explanation of some of these truths, and the books </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication</span><span class="font8"> give a more detailed explanation thereof. It is of the greatest importance to you that you learn these truths, that you may put yourself in line to receive the blessings which God through His organization will extend to all the obedient ones of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus Christ is the Head of Jehovah’s capital organization, and only those who put themselves under the power and control of that organization can get life everlasting. It is written (Acts 4:12): “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” The time of great climax has now arrived and God is affording men the opportunity to place themselves under His organization. How may one avail himself of that privilege? The man must first realize that he is a born sinner, that Jehovah God is the great Life-giver through Christ Jesus, that God has redeemed man through Christ Jesus and made Him Ruler of the world, and believing these things he must take his stand on the side of God and His kingdom by consecrating himself to do the will of God. Having taken these steps, then he must study God’s Word.and from it ascertain God’s</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font8">T MAY surprise some people to be told that what is now’ made out to be the “creed” of Fascism is the complete reverse of the creed w’hich animated the Fascists who marched on Rome. Everybody who knows anything about Italian Fascism knows this. Signor Grandi, the Italian ambassador in London, knows it. It is a positive fact that the original Fascists, the pre-March on Rome Fascists, Mussolini’s followers, were ultra-libertarians!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mussolini was almost an anarchist (he did, in fact, at one time organize the so-called “Red Week” in collaboration with the anarchist Malatesta) while he was leader of the Italian Fascists </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font8"> He became premier! In the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Popolo d’Italia</span><span class="font8"> (i.e., the official Fascist organ), April 7,1920, after the Fascist party had been in existence for a year, Mussolini wrote:</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">“I start from the individual and aim at the State. If the rebellion against the legal hour was the supreme attempt of revolt against the coercion of the State, a sunbeam of hope would filter into the spirits of us who are desperate individualists. Down -with the State in all its forms and incarnations! The bourgeois State as well as the socialist State—the State of yesterday, of to-day, and of tomorrow. For us, only one thing is left, the consoling religion of anarchy. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is what Mussolini, then Fascist leader, was preaching about the State, and State “coercion”, only two years before he became premier! Where does the “Corporate” State come in this? The truth about the Corporate State doctrine is, it was invented for Mussolini (probably by Jesuits) years after he became dictator, and it was created to justify his dictatorship, and to make the Italians fall in love with tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The demands of the Fascists were more extravagant than the demands of the Socialists in Italy. When bands of workmen started to seize the factories, Mussolini, the Fascist leader, applauded their actions. When a number of ex-soldiers, not Communists, started to seize the estates, Mussolini applauded their actions too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first occupation of the factories took place at Dalmine (Bergamo), on March 17, 1919. It started all the others. Two days later Mussolini wrote in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Popolo d’Italia:</span><span class="font8"> “To the workmen of Dalmine we send our salute and the expression of our fervent and disinterested sympathy for the noble battle fought.” On March 29 he motored to Dalmine with Cesare Rossi to congratulate the workmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Writing about the first occupation of lands, in the same paper, the official Fascist organ, remember, Mussolini wrote, March 25: “The peasants that rebel today in order to solve the land question must not meet with our hostility.” On June 10, he wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Either the blissful landowners will be expropriated or we will muster the masses of combatants against these obstacles and will overthrow them. We will carry on a devilish propaganda. ’ ’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>Mussolini’s “About Face”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Black, and dirty, and foul as Mussolini’s volte-face was, and so far has been proved to be, one has to read his program in order to realize the enormity of his betrayal of his Fascists, and to appreciate how easy it is for a person once established as a dictator (with the Jesuit machine behind him) to do anything even when it is the complete opposite of what he has preached, or reverse of the faith, or objects, or desires of his followers. The following was Mussolini’s program </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font8"> he became dictator, i.e., the program of the Italian Fascist party, published in 1919:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

Popular sovereignty exercised by means of universal, equal, and direct popular vote of all citizens of both sexes, with right to the people of initiative, of referendum, and veto. Reorganization, ex-novo, of the administrative bodies of the State. The function of the State to be limited to the civic and political direction of national life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(3) Abolition of the Senate and of every artificial and arbitrary limitation of popular sovereignty. Abolition of political police. Establishment of a municipal and national civic guard. Elective magistrates independent of executive power.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(4) Abolition of all caste-titles, of princes, dukes, marquis, “commendatori,” “cavalieri,” etc. Only titles of honor, those of talent and honesty in work.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7">(5) Abolition of compulsory conscription. General disarmament and veto of all nations forbidding the manufacture of armaments.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(6) Freedom of thought and of conscience, of religion, of association, of press, of propaganda, of individual and collective agitation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(7) System of education with both cultural and vocational schools open to all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(8) Maximum care and perfection of the social hygiene system.</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font7">(11) Eight hours’ work on a legal basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(12) Reorganization of production based on insurance principles and on direct participation of profits by the workers. All landed estates to be given over to the peasants. The management of transportation industries and of publie services to be entrusted to syndicates comprised of technical experts and workers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(13) Abolition of secret diplomacy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">(14) Open international policy dedicated to the solidarity and independence of peoples in the Confederation of States.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark181"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark182"></a>“Fascists” Cheated in a Big Way</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">It would be out of place here to discuss whether this program is good, bad, or indifferent. The point is, it was with this program that Mussolini got into power. The Fascists stood for (and the rank and file believed in it, you may be sure): no political police, no secret diplomacy, no compulsory conscription, freedom of speech, decentralization of executive magistrates, etc.!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You ought to appreciate now that Mussolini has cheated his “Fascists” in a big way. A man capable of doing what he has done is fit for any treachery, and any amount of it. It sticks out a mile that his regime is the greatest swindle in history. I have given this matter some thought and some study and I am firmly convinced that from the start of Fascism (and maybe long before then) Mussolini was secretly in league with “Rome”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Mussolini,” says Ludendorff, “is nothing more than an ambitious tool in the hands of Romish ecclesiastics”; and I concur with Ludendorff. Ludendorff is Germany’s Smuts. He is not an amateur in politics. He knows what he is talking about. The difference between Ludendorff (who has no axe to grind) and most other authorities on politics (who also lack his courage) is, he says what he thinks. The rest of them think it but don’t say it, and so leave the masses in ignorance and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mussolini gave the name of “Fascism” to the creed he promised. What I want to know is, and what you, dear reader, should want to know is: What name must we give to the creed he has fulfilled? It is not Conservatism, it is not Liberalism, it is not Socialism, it is not “Fascism”. No! It is Jesuitism.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark183"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark184"></a>The Original Fascist Program</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Read the Fascist program again: (1) It is not anti-Masonic; you may look but in vain for any reference to Masonry in it. Many active Masons were in the ranks as Fascists during the March on Rome. The Freemasons in Italy were a patriotic although anti-Papal body. (2) It is not pro-Church of Rome: one of its clauses is, “Suppression of Church revenues.” (3) It is not antiliberal; if anything, it is ultra-liberal. It proclaims “popular sovereignty”, “freedom of thought, of press, of propaganda,” and so on. (4) It is not, strictly speaking, anti-Socialist. It demands nationalization of credit, the abolition of stock exchanges, expropriation of estates, etc. Lastly, (5) the spirit of the Fascists was “Italy First”, i.e., with emphasis on the “Nation”, not the “State”, and with no reference at all to the “Church”. So much for the theory. Now for the practice.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>The “Revised” Program</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">(1) Before Mussolini was in power three years he launched an attack upon the Masons, including those in his party, sent many of them to jail, and suppressed Freemasonry by law. But he didn’t suppress, and he hasn’t suppressed, the Roman Catholic secret societies by law, the Italian equivalents of the Knights of Malta, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Knights of Columbus, etc. (2) In 1929, from the Italian treasury Mussolini gave a gift of nineteen million pounds to the Vatican. This was a part of the “Lateran Treaty”. (3) He murdered Amendola, the Liberal leader; treated liberalism as “subversion” (this is the very word used by a Fascist historian); and in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gerarchia</span><span class="font8"> magazine, 1925, Mussolini boasted that he had reduced democracy and liberalism to the state of “rotten corpses”. (4) He smashed every outward vestige of propaganda in favor of the ‘Socialist’ items in his program, irrespective of whether the agitation came from the Reds or from the Fascists. And he murdered Matteotti, the Socialist leader. Matteotti was an upright and a very popular figure. (5) Mussolini abolished the “Victor Emmanuel’s Day” celebrations. On the 20th of September, 1870, the Italian troops took possession of Rome. The Italian nation celebrated the day as a festival of national reunion, and, of course, as the anniversary of victory over the Papacy and Austria. It was Italy's “First of July” and “Battle of the Boyne” combined. This is where Fascism shows itself in its true colors. The idea of Italian patriotism’s “insulting” Roman popery was naturally disliked by Mussolini’s masters; so the festival was cut out of the Fascist calendar. The Vatican, not Italy, came “First”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a mistake to imagine that only plumbers and dockers and “Reds” of various hues are lying in Mussolini’s internment camps. During the War and later in 1925, General Bencivenga was secretary for Cadorna, commander-in-chief of the Italian army in the War. Mussolini interned Bencivenga in the island of Ustica, where the worst and most incorrigible criminals were lodged. It would have been more humane to have him shot, but to keep him living was perhaps the “better” method of sealing the lips and palsifying the hands of his friends.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>The Explanation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Now let me ask of you, What explanation can you offer for this total perversion of the Fascist policy and this attack upon Liberals, Patriots, Socialists, and Freemasons'? Surely this is a question of some importance. Well, then, answer it, you Tories, Liberals, and Socialists! This is the answer: There is only one political body in Europe, only one, not two, or three, or four, which is anti-Liberal, anti-Masonic, antiPatriot, anti-Socialist, anti-Communist, and anti-Jew, and that body is the Jesuit Society. “Fascism” (i.e., original Fascism) doesn’t rule in Italy today, any more than “Nazism” (or Brownshirtism) rules Germany. The Jesuits rule Italy, and their “creed” is now the orthodox Fascist creed in every European country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If Mussolini’s post-War record is hardly flattering to 11 Duce, his pre-War one is worse. The following are characteristic points of Mussolini pre-War biography:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">(1) His five months’ imprisonment, November 23, 1911, to March 12, 1912, for having incited the soldiers of the African war to desert.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(2) His expelling of Bissolati and Bonomi from the Socialist party he directed, because they had dared to congratulate the king for having escaped murder at the hands of an anarchist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(3) His denouncement before the High Court of Milan, April 1,1914, for “instigation of crime, and insult to the army”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">(4) The organization of the so-called “Red Week” in collaboration with the anarchist Malatesta, etc.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">The last myth about Mussolini that’s worth exploding is the one about the March on Rome. Contrary to the belief of almost every Fascist, Mussolini did not lead the March.

<p><span class="font8">The March on Rome was the work of the “Quadrumvirate”, De Bono, De Vecchi, Bianchi, and Balbo. De Bono was in command of operations; Bianchi did liaison staff work; Balbo commanded the marchers; and De Vecchi, along with Grandi, did the negotiating with Salandra (the prime minister) and the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mussolini watched events from Milan, a few hundred miles away from Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It was De Vecchi and Grandi in Rome who telephoned Mussolini at Milan telling him of Salandra’s first offer of ‘participation’ in the government. It was they who won from Salandra and the king the invitation to Mussolini to form a government. “On receipt of the official invitation,” says Ion S. Munro, “he (Mussolini) left at once for the capital.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How has this quadrumvirate fared? De Vecchi is still a minister. Bianchi is dead. De Bono was “removed” from his post as chief of police. Grandi was “sent abroad” to London. Balbo has been “exiled” to Tripoli.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark191"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>“La Bottega del Papa’<sup>9</sup></span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">It is not true that Mussolini against his will was forced to “bargain” with the pope. This is often said to justify Mussolini’s dealings with the Vatican. It is sheer, demonstrable nonsense. On the contrary, if Mussolini had put the pope in a boat and sent him to Tripoli, nobody in Italy would have bothered much. Before Mussolini’s advent to power the Church of Rome’s name in Italy was mud. Its prestige was low before the War; it was much worse after it. It was commonly called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“La bottega del papa’’,</span><span class="font8"> i.e., the pope’s shop, a reference to the “holy” relic racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What Mussolini did was, he pretended to quarrel with the pope, just as Hitler is pretending. Most people, including the then “Fascists”, thought that this was fine. But the net result of every “quarrel” was a further concession to the Vatican. In fact, Mussolini re-instated Popery. He raised the “Church” from one of odium, which it richly deserved, to an institution of authority. And when he had completed the job, the pope called him a “man sent by divine providence to save Italy”. As no pope yet has ever worried much about “patriotism”, substitute the word “Church” for “Italy” and you will have the pope’s real meaning. “Sent by divine providence to save the ‘Church’.” I am telling Jews and democrats who their enemy is. In the words of Gambetta I say, pointing to “Rome”: “There is your enemy.” If I were saying this to the Labor people in Spain, they would believe me. They know what “Rome” is, as the forefolks of Britain, Holland, Sweden, Switzerland, etc., knew, i.e., from personal experience, but the average person now doesn’t know a thing about it. And the moment one tries to speak to him about it, he thinks (or at least some of them do) that one is trying to turn him into what he calls a “hymn-singer”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>Mussolini and Freemasonry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Anti-Freemasonism was not a plank of the early Fascist program. Many Masons took part in the March on Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Freemasonry in Italy had old ties with Italian Nationalism dating back to Risorgimento days. They helped to make Italy a nation. And for this too, no doubt, they incurred the displeasure of the pope, because the papacy lost its dominions, the City of Rome, when Italy became a nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Masons were neither for nor against Fascism. They were neutral. There were two Masonic bodies in Italy, known by the name of the buildings they occupied, the “Giustiniani Palace Masons” and the “Piazza del Gesu Masons”, and actually the latter was, if anything, friendly towards Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why does the Church of Rome dislike the Freemasons? Not because they belong to a secret society. No. There are a number of Roman Catholic secret societies, The Knights of Malta, The Ancient Order of Hibernians, The Knights of Columbus, etc. The Roman Catholic church objects to Freemasonry because Masonic societies do not come under their priestly control, and because Masons deny the papal claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In August 1924, two years after Mussolini came to power, the attack on Freemasonry opened. During 1925 Mussolini was busy “purging” his party of Masons. They had been good enough to help Mussolini to power, but they were not the sort he wanted to help him to administer his “Fascist” state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the close of 1925 Freemasonry was suppressed by law. “It was a move,” says Ion S. Munro, “ which won him favor in the eyes of the Vatican.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The year 1929, i.e., </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">seven years</span><span class="font8"> after Mussolini’s elevation to the premiership, was perhaps the year when the Fascist terror reached its highest pitch. The “O.V.R.A.”, or secret police, was called into existence in 1929. To quote a 100-percent sympathetic historian of Fascism, in 1929: “Over 1,000 prisoners were sentenced, many of them receiving punishments of over ten years’ imprisonment.” In September 1929, Cesare Rossi was decoyed on to Italian soil at Lake Garda, after he had managed to leave Italy. He was arrested and sentenced to thirty years. Who is this Cesare Rossi? At one time he was secretary of the Italian Fascist party, and Mussolini’s closest companion! If Rossi was not prepared to “play ball” with the pope, and I suspect he wasn’t, the least Mussolini could do (at his masters’ bidding) was to shoot him or jail him. He jailed him plenty.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>The Vatican’s &quot;Profits”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">What is there of significance about this year 1929? After seven years of Mussolini’s rule one would have expected that the internal condition of the country would be quiet, stable, and nonrefractory. The Lateran Treaty was signed in June, 1929. This “Treaty” was the Vatican’s ‘profits’ from Fascism. It was Jesuitism putting the seal on its victory. The resistance to it was the last ‘big fling’ of the anti-Fascist forces in Italy. They lost, of course. But the next time they cross swords with Mussolini (and the general of the Jesuits) they shall win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty, the words “toleration of other religions” were cut out of the Italian Constitution. In theory Fascist Italy (unlike pre-Fascist Italy) does not admit religious tolerance. In practice it has to, so as not to arouse the antipathy of especially Britain and U.S.A. He gave the gift of £19,000,000 to the Vatican, already referred to. (I suspect this was the return of the monies Mussolini had received from “Rome”.) Above all, he reestablished the pope’s “temporal” sovereignty. Do you know that the Vatican was very much upset because it was not given a seat in the League of Nations ? If you didn’t know this before, then you know it now. By re-establishing the pope’s “temporal” sovereignty Mussolini raised the Church of Rome to the diplomatic status of a “State”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mussolini closed down the Y.M.C.A. He put the pope’s picture back into every State school classroom. He cut out the words “toleration of other religions” from the Italian Constitution. He suppressed the Freemasons. Finally, Fascism re-established the pope’s “temporal sovereignty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no liberty of speech anywhere in Italy outside of the confessional box; and this just about sums up the truth, and tells all there is to know about Fascism in Italy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>The Beneficiaries</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Some time ago knighthoods (“commenda”) were given to five leading foreign journalists in Rome, two of whom belong to British papers; an almost unheard-of thing in any other country. This gives one a good idea of what sort of “news” some readers must be getting from Italy. It is news of “ruptures” between Italy and Germany, “quarrels” of Mussolini and the pope, Roman Catholics “ill-treated” in Germany, Italy, and Austria, all to misinform and confuse the public.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark199"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark200"></a>Fascism Breeds Poverty</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Fascism has not been a godsend either to the workers or to the employers of Italy. In 1926 Italy had 78,000 unemployed; in 1933 the figure was 1,000,000. In the years 1930-32 Italy’s foreign trade shrank by 48 percent. One of Italy’s recent budgets showed a deficit of £66,000,000. The adverse trade balance was £50,000,000. There were more than 21,000 bankruptcies in Italy in 1932. In Great Britain, a more commercialize!! country, there were 4,645 bankruptcies in 1932, i.e., one-fifth of Italy’s figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The official comparison of real wages, that is, money wages in terms of food-purchasing power, are thus given in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Whittaker’s Almanack,</span><span class="font8"> on the authority of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry of Labour Gazette: </span><span class="font8">Great Britain 100; Italy 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Hessell Titlman, British journalist, who undertook a survey of conditions in Europe a year or two ago, says, and quite truly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Whether or not families forced to live on such a budget are ‘starving’, as one Italian working man assured me, there can be no question that the standard of living in Italy is one of the lowest, measured in material comfort, in all Europe.” (“Slump: A Study of Stricken Europe.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who, then, has benefited from Fascism? The pope, [Achille] Ambrose Ratti. And—Mussolini, starting earlier than Rosenberg, has bled his country white financing parties abroad to serve his war plans. Listen to this, from a pamphlet written in the summer of 1930 by Lauro De Bosis, an Italian, and secretly distributed in Italy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“For all the dissatisfied, Italy has a little money and a great deal of promises. In Albania, among Hitler’s men, among the people of the Austrian Heim-wehr, among the Macedonian Comitagi, and especially in Hungary, wherever there is an opportunity to agitate, to trouble peace, to put powder mines, there the dangerous shade of Mussolini can be discerned.’’</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark201"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark202"></a>The Mussolini Myth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">It is not true that Mussolini “saved” Italy from Bolshevism. This is a myth (like the myth that Hitler “saved” Germany from Communism, or that Mosley is “saving” Britain from Moscow) ; and the people who spread it are prevaricators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The danger of a Bolshevik revolution passed away with the failure of the occupation of the factories, and the victory of the Moderates </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Rtformisti)</span><span class="font8"> over the Extremists of the Socialist party on September 2, 1920. Mussolini himself said in his paper, November 30: “The Italian home situation improves every day.” In the first days of 1921, a year before he became premier, and almost three years before he declared his dictatorship, Mussolini wrote: “In Italy one cannot speak any more of any Bolshevik danger whatsoever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That’s clear enough, isn’t it ? Also the alleged economic paralysis caused by “Bolshevism” in the years 1919 and 1920, as the test of official figures reveals itself nonexistent:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(From the </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fellowship Forum)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE Papacy itself is the most autocratic institution in the records of the world. From its government every vestige of human rights is excluded. No Roman Catholic has any voice in the selection of the “sovereign pontiff” or of any bishop or priest whom the canon law requires him to obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the papal system the theory of “divine right to rule” rises to perfection. Pretensions of all other civil despots pale into democracy when compared with those of the popes. Not only does the Roman pontiff claim ‘divine right to rule’, but-he claims to rule as sole agent and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">alter ego</span><span class="font8"> of God Himself. In that role he arrogates to himself the unique attribute of infallibility. All governmental authority descends from him to the Hierarchy and clergy and monastic orders and the laity. All are his subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is no cardinal, patriarch, archbishop, bishop, abbot, monk, nun or Roman Catholic layman but by his appointment. There is no faith, theology nor canon law but by his decree. There is no province, diocese or parish, nor any school, college, seminary or university unless licensed directly or indirectly by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All power descends from his throne. The food and clothing and shelter, the community life, the property and income, the thought, the speech, the habits, and the business and civil and religious life of 300,000,000 Roman Catholics in every part of the world are under his strict regulation and authority. Such is the essence of the papal system. It is stamped indelibly on the government and people of lands dominated by the Roman Hierarchy.</span></p>

A great proportion of these are Roman Catholics, so correspondents report, and out of the funds which the boys send home a considerable proportion inevitably goes into the church exchequers. If the priest got the boy his job, and the boy sends the money to his mother, does anybody suppose the priest intends to be left high and dry? Not a bit of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font8">EFERRING to the proposed Roman Catholic Fascist dictatorship over the people of the United States, P. G. White, of Illinois, in a booklet entitled </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The United States Need Not Surrender,</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“When it was all over, he (the dictator) had saved the people from Communism on the left, but he had taken them straight over to Fascism on the right. And the middle classes, to whom he had come with false promises, found themselves thrust aside, forgotten and ignored. Thus was a Fascist, Roman Catholic dictatorship established in Italy, in Germany, and in Austria. In Italy and Austria the country was already majority Roman Catholic; in Germany the dictatorship was established over a predominantly Protestant nation. Roman Catholicism co-operates with Fascist dictatorships throughout the world. The two philosophies are identical in application: both rule by means of dictatorship imposed from above. The great danger in America today is that, in avoiding Communism on the left, we shall be led, willingly or unwillingly, to a Fascist dictatorship on the right. In this connection, the campaign of Father Coughlin, the radical radio priest of the Roman Catholic church, born in another country, foreigner by training, propagating a foreign philosophy taken from the encyclicals of the popes and expressed in the platform of the National Union for Social Justice, will be watched by informed Americans with great interest.”</span></p>

And so the work of turning the United States over to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, bag and baggage, goes merrily on. The Jesuits are onto their job. But the Masons; it is to laugh.

A Protestant would never do. Why? Simply because he lacks the training to qualify him to allot that huge sum of money so that most of it, by divers routes, ultimately reaches the coffers of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy at Vatican City. Is it any wonder that Cardinal Mundelein (Chicago) said that Franklin D. Roosevelt is “one who has shown more friendly sympathy to the ‘Church’ and its institutions than any occupant of the White House in half a century”?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“The old Protestant culture is about at the end of its rope. The first settlers of our country established this distinctly Protestant culture, being chiefly from Protestant countries, so that our history from the beginning of the republic has been predominantly non-Catholie. It has given the complexion to the country, entered our legislation, sociology and economics, is the basis of our commerce and industry and, in fact, has formed a great part of the American people. For 150 years the Protestant element was strongest, and we admit it. This Christian culture is a wave receding, and we Catholics are living in a most important day, with one culture vanishing, another gaining strength. Why can’t we raise a tidal wave that will bring Catholic culture into the United States? Why can’t we make the United States Catholic in legislation, Catholic in justice, aims and ideals? We are the greatest numerically in the country, strong and growing in the arts and education. We are now ready to expand.

<p><span class="font13">B</span><span class="font8">ECAUSE they know nothing about honest labor, and because they love to be in the public eye (like a cinder in that respect), and because there are no real Americans ‘suitable’ for the job, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed as labor arbitrators the following members of the Roman Catholic priesthood: Very Reverend Monsignor P. M. H. Wynhoven, of New Orleans, who forced a radio station in Louisiana to crowd Judge Rutherford off the air; Reverend Francis J. Haas, of Washington, D.C.; Reverend James F. Cunningham, C.S.P., of Los Angeles; Reverend Dr. John P. Boland of Buffalo, N. Y.; Archbishop Edward J. Hanna, of San Francisco; Reverend Frederic Seiden-burg, S.J., of Detroit; Reverend John O’Grady, of Washington, D.C.; Very Reverend John W. R. Maguire, C.S.V., of Chicago; and Right Reverend Monsignor John A. Ryan, of Washington, D.C. Six of the nine were made chairmen of the labor boards on which they serve. In every way in his pow’er Roosevelt is trying to turn America over, lock, stock and barrel, to the Vatican.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark218"></a>Unwitting Servants of the Papacy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font8">LL know that the press of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims for the pope the paternity of the New Deal. Mr. Coughlin declares that he read to Mr. Roosevelt the pope’s plans for just such a New Deal. The only thing that stopped the New Deal was the United States Constitution. The pope hopes to put that out of the way, and a great campaign to destroy the Constitution and do away with States’ rights is now under way, so that Papal Fascism in the United States may become a stark reality. Meantime there has been received in this office a copy of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentile Front,</span><span class="font8"> showing the strange cooperation with this scheme of very many able American Jews, among whom are listed Bernard M. Baruch, Donald R. Richberg, Professor Felix Frankfurter, Judge Samuel I. Rosenman, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., Henry Morgenthau, Jr., Professor Rex Tugwell, Mordecai Ezekiel, Edward A. Filene, Frances Perkins, Harold S. Ickes, Samuel Untermyer, Joseph B. Eastman, Samuel Diekstein, and many others. On the other side of the story is the fact that two of the United States Supreme Court justices, Louis D. Brandeis and Benjamin N. Cardozo, are said to be Jews, and their opinions helped to kill the New Deal. The probable fact is that the reason why there are so many Jews in prominent places in the national government and in the New York state government is that there are so many able Jews in New York city, which city is, in fact, the largest Jewish city in the world. The governor of New York state, Herbert H. Lehman, is a Jew, and nine of the ten New York state supreme court justices for Manhattan and The Bronx are Jews. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentile Front</span><span class="font8"> asserts that in the New Deal at Washington 85 percent of the advisory and official positions are held by Jews, and that of the Russian Communistic setup, composed of 554 members, all are Jews but less than 20. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentile Front</span><span class="font8"> seems to be Nazi propaganda. It maintains the so-called “Protocols of Zion” are of Jewish origin, despite the fact that this has been proved false wherever the courts have looked into it. Nothing could be more devilishly narrow-minded, more fiendish, more contemptible, than the so-called “New Germany” to which </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentile Front </span><span class="font8">looks up and upon which </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> looks down with loathing inexpressible. The Jews are money-lovers, granted; but they are not pigheaded wild beasts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE Jesuits crowed too soon when, in their magazine ridiculously called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">America,</span><span class="font8"> they said, two years ago: “The States no longer function as States. It does not seem probable that at any time in the future they will so function. The old Constitution, now no longer the supreme law, is largely an historical document.” The reason why the Jesuits said so was that they hoped it was so; but when the real Americans saw the Jesuit statement they hoped it was not so, and when the Supreme Court pitched the NRA into the ash can they knew it was not so, and for once the Jesuits had overshot their mark. In this life it is best not to get too fresh too soon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">W</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">illiam H. Anderson, former Anti-Saloon</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">League campaigner, in an address in Baltimore, said: “Postmaster General Farley said a few months ago that the only thing which stood in the way of his selection as president in 1940 was the fact that he is a Roman Catholic, and he added that, ‘If we continue to gain as we have done in the past year or so, even that will not stand in the way.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Obedience Lightens a Tax-Gatherer’s E irdens</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">F</span><span class="font8">EW innocent people are as unpopular as the tax-gatherer. A tax is a compulsory contribution to support a government, and nobody likes to be compelled to do anything. However people may wave flags and cheer soldiers on their way to the front, they never like to pay the tax bills. The fight over the soldiers’ bonus is a sample. The banks have a longing to absorb all that is coming to the soldiers in interest charges on loans which they are now making to them. They do not have a longing for increased taxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If anybody were to stand up on a rostrum and invite the people to come forward and contribute cash to buy bayonets wherewith to scatter the entrails of their fellow men over the landscape, nobody would come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If a radio plea were to go out for cash to buy shrapnel to blow human creatures to fragments, there would not enough money come in to load one gun a single time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nobody would think of reaching down in his pocket and stripping something off from his roll (if he has one, in these days) to enable his government to invest in poison gas wherewith to burn out the lungs of a fellow creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is even doubtful if anybody would come along and offer to help erect a battleship, or a submarine, or a cannon; though there might be a few who would invest in these things if they thought they would reap some personal benefit therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">International Murderers, Limited, Unlimited, Preferred and Common, Low-down and Contemptible, would have a hard time selling their wares if they waited for voluntary contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One-fourth of the wealth of the United States was squandered in the World War, with resultant benefits to the people of this fair land considerably less than could be nicely balanced upon the point of a cambric needle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As a result, when the increasing tax bills come in (about the time of year when the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has a consuming interest in the poor souls in purgatory, because they think that is the best time to gather in all the change possible) the people thank God for their harvests, because the president tells them to do so, but they do not thank Him for the tax-collectors. If the truth be known, they feel like setting the dogs on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">America points with pride to her leading citizens like Andrew Mellon, Dutch Schultz, Charles Schwab, John Dillinger and AI Capone, and does all possible to encourage the youth of the land to walk in their footsteps, and yet is obliged to note, with regret, that they have not shown that zeal in the payment of their income taxes which would set the best example to the rising generation.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark222"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark223"></a>And So One Comes to Matthew</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Some will feel grieved at this introduction of Matthew, or Levi, as he is sometimes called. It is just too bad, for Matthew. It is no fault of anybody now living that Matthew got into the tax-collection business. He just picked the wrong job; that is all. Nobody should go into the taxcollection business who has either a conscience or a tender heart, and it seems that Matthew had both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And, by the way, so had Zacchaeus. The account of the latter tax-collector says: “And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho. And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. And he sought to see Jesus, who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down, for today I must abide at thy house. And he made haste, and came down; and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner. And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor: and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forso-much as he also is a son of Abraham. For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.”—Luke 19:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Persons in the United States who know of taxcollectors who give half their income to the poor, or who restore fourfold (except to persons who have put up cash for the national committees of the political parties) are invited to send in the list. Lists may be written in letters an inch high on the back of a postage stamp of the kind on which Farley made a fortune.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark224"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark225"></a>Matthew Was Like Zacchaeus</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Matthew was like Zacchaeus. No matter what he did (and very likely, like Zacchaeus, he had done some things he ought not to have done), he was in a business where there then was, and still is, opportunity to graft, and he was unpopular. The only popular tax-collector of personal knowledge turned out to be a complete crook. He had a pleasant manner, a winning smile, and a duplicate set of tax books which cost his fellow citizens many thousands of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Jews as a people cannot be justly accused of eagerness to part with their money. When they paid their taxes for the support of the Roman government they certainly did not smile, and when they paid more than their just share they probably scowled and said things that made the tax-collector feel as mean as a priest feels when he accepts purgatory graft; maybe worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is of record that about the time of Jesus’ birth six thousand Pharisees in Herod’s realm refused to take the oath of allegiance to the Roman emperor, and it is conjectured that the principal reason for this was the “decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed”, mentioned in the first verse of the second chapter of Luke’s gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And so that brings one to the story of Matthew, which story Matthew himself was so good as to record at length, though with consummate modesty he omits to mention what others of the gospel writers disclosed, that the feast was held in his own home. The story runs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him, and it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”—Matthew 9:9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One can hardly fail to note the similarity between the two men, Zacchaeus and Matthew, their standing in the neighborhood and with the Pharisees, and Jesus’ words on the occasions of the feasts. In the one instance He was “come to seek and to save that which was lost”, and in the other He was “not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance”.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark226"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>Matthew Was a Suitable Instrument</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Matthew was a suitable instrument for Jehovah’s purposes. Jesus knew it, and all the efforts of the Pharisees to get Matthew in wrong with Jesus, or to get Jesus in wrong with the people, were just so much wasted breath. Neither one of these men was looking for popularity. What is popularity ? It is a breath. Here today, it is gone for ever tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus was all intent upon the vindication of His Father’s name, and entirely indifferent to popularity, as any son of Jehovah God might well be. To those who sought popularity Jesus said some of the sharpest things in all history. Listen to this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I receive not honour from men. But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?”—John 5:41-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It may as well be noted at this point that there is a difference between not seeking the honor of men and yet not being desirous of being unjustly dishonored by them. Jesus pointed this out when some asked Him the question: “Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.”—John 8:49,50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Both Jesus and Matthew were dishonored by the Pharisees the day that Jesus participated in the feast at Matthew’s home. But who are the honored ones now? and who are the dishonored ones? The tables are completely turned.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark228"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark229"></a>Which Would You Rather Be?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">Which would you rather be today: Matthew, who entertained Jesus at his home, and gave up his business, and became one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and one of the foundations of the New Jerusalem, or one of those Pharisees to whom (or at least to whose comrades) Jesus put the question, “How can ye escape the condemnation of Gehenna?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Pharisees, at best, have a very poor chance of ever obtaining life anywhere. Matthew, all know, from Jesus’ own words, made his calling and election sure, and there is every reason to believe that he is now upon his throne, with the Lord, for ever secure, for ever happy, busily engaged in his part of the vindication of Jehovah’s name, the friend of Jehovah the great Creator, the friend of Jesus, and the well-known friend of every other of the 144,000, as well as, without a doubt, of every one that shall ever get life at all. Who is there that will not know of Matthew and his work?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Matthew alone (chapter one) gives what is recorded of the birth of Jesus; he alone tells of the visit of the magi, and of the flight into Egypt and the return to Nazareth; he alone gives the whole of the Sermon on the Mount; he alone gives the explanation of the parable of the wheat and tares; he alone tells of the half shekel in the mouth of the fish; he alone tells of the unmerciful servant; he alone gives the parable of the eleventh hour in the vineyard; he alone gives the parable of the wedding garment; he alone gives Jesus’ denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees, the account of the wise and faithful servant and of the wise and foolish virgins, the parable of the talents, and the parable of the sheep and goats. In many other places in his story Matthew gives a more extended account than the other evangelists. No one in the church would part with what he has done, under any consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus summoned him Matthew was quick to give up his business and come. He was obedient, immediately, and unquestioningly so. Do you suppose he is glad now that he left that job of tax-collector? He had everything to gain by obedience. So have you.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark230"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark231"></a>Could Get Along Without You</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8">If you are a tax-collector, or have some job of spending money for some government instead of helping them get it together, has it ever occurred to you that the government you are serving could get along without you? And Jehovah’s government can get along without you, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And don’t imagine that those for whom the United States Government has done the most are the ones in greatest eagerness to help keep it up. The other day the news was published that nine days after President Roosevelt’s message asking for larger levies on gift taxes and inheritance taxes John D. Rockefeller, Jr., gave away $76,338,000 to various educational and scientific corporations. Apparently he would rather do anything else with his money than to give it to the people as a whole, that is, to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., late associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, set a splendid example to the wealthy men of America when at his death he left small sums to needy relatives, but the bulk of his fortune, something like $3,000,000, to the United States Government, that is, the people, to whom, so he said, he justly owed it after he had had the use of it for a lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the right attitude of all Jehovah’s witnesses toward the Government of Jehovah. It is worthy of their all of time, talent, money or whatever they may have; and they don’t have to die to give it; it can be given while they are yet alive, and even left in their own care, to be used as the great Governor shall direct. Many have put their all into a house-car, gone into the pioneer work of proclaiming the gospel from door to door, though sickly and nervous, and after a few years in the field look as though the only way they could be killed is with an axe. Matthew found the Lord a good friend, and learned a lot. And these pioneers have learned a lot, too.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">VERYTHING the Roman Hierarchy can do to keep Coughlin in the public eye is being done. The newspapers have columns and columns and columns, all bunk. Half the Roman church is alleged to be against Coughlin, and half for him; that is nothing but propaganda, the purest of the pure. The pope is for Coughlin, and Coughlin is for the pope. The others are merely whoopers-up, and at the right time will gracefully step over the line and admit that they are converted to Coughlin, converted to the pope, converted to Roman Catholicism, and urge everybody else to do the same, with the intent to throw the Catholic vote, at the last minute, just where it will be most effective. Everybody has noticed that Coughlin’s so-called sixteen points are entirely silent on the subject of free speech, freedom of the press and upholding the Constitution of the United States. This is exactly the papal position; it seeks destruction of all these. It is a pro-Fascist organization, therefore against liberty and against the people. The troops for the Fascist rush are manifestly the CCC boys.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Home Treatment of Hiccoughs and Burns</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-variant:small-caps;">G</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">uy R. Shearer, of California, tells of a treatment for hiccoughs that can be used by anyone, anywhere, at any time. “Breathe for several minutes in a paper sack fastened or held over the nose. This results in an excess of carbon dioxide accumulating in the air breathed. The carbon dioxide backs up into the lungs, reducing the vitality of the nerve centers that control the hiccoughs, so that they resume their normal function.” The foregoing remedy was discovered at the City Hospital, Los Angeles. Concerning the tannic acid treatment for burns, Mr. Shearer says: “Large city fire departments are now equipped with apparatus for spraying burned persons with tannic solution as soon as they are taken from burning buildings. The results are no less than astounding. Just a word about home applications of tannic acid. Tannic acid, as it is bought in the market, is a white powder, but is mixed with water when applied to burns. It must be freshly mixed, as it does not keep long when mixed with water. To apply, place gauze bandage over the burn, and soak bandage with the solution; it will turn a brown color after applied. If you have no tannic acid at hand, use some tea grounds out of the teapot. It makes a fair substitute. The Chinese have, for centuries, used tea grounds for burns.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font8">ays Elmer W. Dean, of New York: “I was under a doctor’s care off and on for over three years for stomach trouble, which the first doctor diagnosed as ulcers of the stomach. He tried every trick he knew and finally reduced me to a diet of peptonized milk, but to no avail. Then he began to hint of an operation, and I changed doctors. The second M.D. told me to have my teeth removed; so I had them all out, but still no improvement. Then I read several strong articles in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> about aluminum poisoning. I didn’t take much stock in it at first, but after a while I decided to see if there was any truth in it. We had a pretty nearly complete outfit of aluminumware (the peptonized milk was prepared in it) but we junked it and substituted stainless steel and enamelware. I began to improve, and today I can eat anything within reason with no discomfort whatever. I never have any trouble except When I eat away from home and inadvertently partake of something cooked in aluminum.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font8">ays S. A.

It is claimed that four-fifths of the people here have pyorrhea, and some in their twenties have false teeth: Aluminum poison is the answer to this. I have seen some pitiful sights. All the relief work was stopped in Idaho at the first of the year. In shacks that would not keep a horse warm I have seen a mother with two to eight children watching a lone aluminum pot boil with some beans or potatoes in it. Under the conditions it seemed to me that a dose of strychnine would have been more humane than that regular daily dose of poison. How I have hoped and prayed for Armageddon!”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark235"></a>On the War Path in New Hampshire</span></h3>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">rllHE Truth-Teller</span><span class="font8"> has an interesting and instructive letter from Mrs. Florence M. Dederick, of New Hampshire, known to our readers, in which she tells the story of her battle to prevent the vaccination of her daughter. She fails to see how an unvaccinated child can possibly “expose” an already vaccinated one if vaccination prevents smallpox. Mrs. Dederick acted as her own lawyer. When first in court she waived a hearing and appealed to the Superior Court; that resulted in a delay of five months. When her case was called suddenly, without giving her time to get her witnesses, she asked for a postponement; that gave her three more months. Being then ready for trial, and the State not being ready, she asked for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font8"> court order putting her child, in school. The court lost his head and indicated prejudgment and bias, so Mrs. Dederiek went home, refusing to be tried before him. They sent a deputy sheriff after her and she told him to go away; two more postponements followed, making a year and four months all together, when she received notice that the case had been dropped. Mrs. Dederick’s advice to those who wish to make a vaccination fight is: “First: Tell the local board or their agent, or write them, you are making legal tender of your child, unvaccinated, to the school board. Second: Don’t send an unvaccinated child to school. Make them accept the child unvaccinated first, and have it in writing. Have copies of any letters you write and send them registered with request for a return receipt. If it is not done in writing, have witnesses.” Mrs. Dederick has probably studied law, and is versatile and courageous. It is a very hard battle for most parents with small means to undertake.</span></p>
