<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">An Open Letter to The Associated Press</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge Rutherford points out the disadvantages of an organization claiming to tell the truth, and studiously neglecting to do so</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">October 24, 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. Lloyd Stratton, Executive Assistant, Associated Press, 383 Madison Ave., New York City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mr. A. R. Goux has called my attention to correspondence between himself, the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> and your office. I have before me the letter of the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> signed by Mr. Edwin L. James, addressed to Mr. Goux, bearing date of October 23, in which he quotes the following from Mr. Lloyd Stratton: “I am glad to reply to yours of October 21, by repeating that Judge Rutherford’s speech was not made at the request of The Associated Press.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your effort to evade the facts is manifest. By using the word “speech” you hope to be within the clear in denying that you requested me to express my views on flag saluting. By referring to my copy, which I furnished you and which I broadcast, you will see that I said this: “The Associated Press has requested me to express my view of the matter.” You certainly would not attempt to deny the absolute truth of that statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your office called my attention for the first time to the fact of the controversy at Lynn, Massachusetts, about the flag saluting. You requested me to furnish you a statement, asking me to dictate it over the telephone. This I declined to do. I then agreed to furnish you a written signed statement and you promised to have your reporter in my office the following morning at ten o’clock for the copy. You failed to keep that appointment. About seven o’clock that same evening you called my office and asked me again for the copy and again promised to send your reporter. And this you failed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As I was going away I sent the copy to the editor of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> and informed your office that your reporter could obtain a copy from him upon the condition that you would publish it exactly as made. I am informed that you received the copy the next morning but stated that you could not agree to publish it all as made and therefore the copy was returned to Mr. Woodworth of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A short time after that you called me by telephone at the radio station on Staten Island. </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">then informed you that I was going to broadcast my statement concerning flag saluting, that this broadcast would be Sunday morning October </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">6, </span><span class="font8">at ten o’clock, and that then you could have the statement as made. You inquired: “What stations will it be on?” My reply to that, this information would be furnished to you in ample time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The next day, Friday, October 4, a messenger from the office of the Peoples Pulpit Association delivered to the executive offices of The Associated Press a list of the stations over which the broadcast would be made. I am also advised that the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font8"> editor sent a list to one of your news editors showing over what stations the broadcast would be put, and this was in response to request that Mr. Woodworth had received from your Brooklyn representative, E. A. Lozier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On Sunday morning, October 6, about 8 o’clock you called my office and asked when you were going to get the copy of that speech. You were told by my secretary that it would be broadcast at 10 o’clock and you could have it immediately thereafter. You sent your messenger to 124 Columbia Heights between 10 and 11 o’clock on that same day and received a full text of the speech, which copy you afterwards mutilated to suit your own wishes, misrepresenting me in fact, and making me appear to say what I did not say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The above and foregoing facts you will not attempt to deny if you have any regard whatsoever for the truth. In view of these facts [and] your statement in the letter addressed to Mr. Edwin L. James of the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> it is patent on the face of it that you are trying to pass the buck and deny that you requested me to express my views and to deny that you had anything to do with my furnishing the copy. I have never said that I made the speech at your request, but I have said and repeat that The Associated Press requested me to express my view in the matter and I took occasion to broadcast because I knew by reason of my past experience with the press that The Associated Press would not publish the statement as I gave it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would have been just as easy for you to tell Mr. James of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8"> the truth as it would have been to make the statement as you have made it. It seems to be in keeping with the practice of your office to garble the truth when the truth would serve to a better purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let me remind you again that I told your office over the telephone that I was not asking anybody to publish my views, to which you agreed. I said, however, that since my views were asked I have no hesitancy in expressing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I think the Press, and a lot of other would-be loyal citizens of America, have made a mountain out of a mole-hill by magnifying the fact that an eight-year-old boy declined to salute the American flag. I have been interrupted by your office numerous times about this matter and I am very tired of it, and in view of your repeated calls and interruptions and failure to carry out what you agreed to do, I am sending a copy of this letter to the president of The Associated Press at Washington, Mr. Frank Noyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is a great pity that an institution such as yours claims to be would not be willing to tell the truth once in a while rather than willfully and deliberately misrepresent that which is furnished to you, and that at your request.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You knew that I stated positively in my statement that I am not a member of any cult, and that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a cult, and yet you deliberately inserted in your report three times the word “cult”, as applied to me, and quoted Jehovah’s witnesses to make it appear as ridiculous as you could.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am writing you at such length because I am trying to find some language to express my absolute contempt for a bunch of hypocritical men who claim to tell the truth, and who delight to resort to lies to shield another crowd of men who are foreigners to America and who are inimical to American institutions and who make a lot of fuss about the flag in order to hide their crooked ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let me say this once for all: I am not asking publicity by the press association, and if you don’t want my views published as I give them, then please don’t ask for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You might show a copy of this letter to Mr. Edwin James of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font8"> that he may know that you have little or no regard for the truth and that you like to mislead even your fellow members of the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Your association poses before the American people as the friend of America and the publisher of all news that is fit to publish, and yet you studiously avoid publishing any statement such as that made on the floor of the United States Senate by such men as Senator Schall, of Minnesota, calling attention to a combined foreign element that is trying to seize control of the American Government. You can spend a lot of time and energy in holding up to ridicule an eight-year-old boy and inoffensive people and make a great hullabaloo about the flag, and yet you sit idly by and close your ears and mouth and remain silent when it comes to saying anything about a foreign power or a combination of foreigners that are attempting to gain control of America and Hitlerize it. The time must come surely when the duplicity of the public press will be properly exposed before the American people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I quote from Senator Schall’s speech made in the Senate these words: “Fully 99 percent of all the statements issued by these Government press agencies are falsehoods. They are designed to deceive the people and make them believe their government is trying to help them, when just the opposite is the purpose of this maladministration of our affairs. Every day a dozen or more of these untrue statements are handed to the press and radio, printed, and broadcast as truth. Not even under the Soviet rule in Russia are so many barefaced untruths given out as Government facts. Our government has resolved itself into a propaganda bureau for disseminating falsehoods to its citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Associated Press is a part of this propaganda crowd, and the American people are beginning to learn that it does the bidding of a gang of selfish men who have no regard for the true principles of the American Government. If your association were 100-percent as patriotic as you claim to be you would be looking after American interests and not howling about an eight-year-old boy failing to salute the flag. It is about time that you are hiding your face with shame, if it is possible for you to have any shame. The time was when American newspapers sought to get the truth to the people. A few such editors are left, but there do not appear to be many of them amongst the Associated Press organization. This is a deplorable condition to be found in a country that for centuries has posed as the land of freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When I see such a studied effort to dodge the truth as the quotation in your letter mentioned here in the outset I am reminded of the words of Jesus when He spoke to the hypocritical Pharisees, the clergy of His day. He used these words: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his owm: for he is a liar, and the father of it.” (John 8:44) Jesus spoke with absolute authority, and He is authority therefore for the statement that the Devil is the father of liars and those who delight to lie show that they proceed from the Devil.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Further Expressions on Flag Saluting</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Christians and the Flag</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE following is an interesting and instructive letter by Reverend Louis L. Perkins, St. Paul’s Episcopal church, Kittanning, Pa., in the Kittanning </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Leader-Times,</span><span class="font8"> October 21, 1935 :</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Recently at a public school in Lynn, Massachusetts, a certain boy of 10 was dismissed from school and his parents were arrested because the boy refused on grounds of religious scruples to salute the flag of the United States according to a new State law of daily salute in all schools for all children of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The man of the street may laugh at such squabbles, and pour out still further contempt on the name of the Christian religion. But no serious-minded Christian can let such an incident go unchallenged. For such an incident bears on a very fundamental issue that has been more or less dormant between church and state ever since the Christian religion came into this world, 1900 years ago. The boy refused to salute the flag because he said to salute the flag was a pagan act and inconsistent with the earnest loyalty of a Christian man to Jesus Christ as our real Lord and Master. The flag stood for the country of the United States, and a salute to the flag was a pledge of allegiance inconsistent with a Christian’s supreme pledge of loyalty to Christ—the parents said in backing up the action of their son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Such an attitude is not a ridiculous one. For, think back over history for a few minutes to the days of the persecutions of the early Christians by the authorities of the Roman Empire. In those days the Roman authorities demanded a pledge of allegiance to the emperor as the supreme symbol of the state. This pledge, given by the sprinkling of some incense on a fire of coals before a statue of the emperor, was demanded of everybody. But the early Christians refused to do so. They said that a pledge to Caesar was inconsistent with and disloyal to their new-found allegiance to the Lord Christ. And these early Christians stuck to their principle in this matter through fire and death, till eventually under the emperor Constantine the status of the Christian religion as over against the state was duly recognized. The Christians won out and their point of view prevailed—the State granted to them a point of supreme loyalty to Christ first. The idea of the supremacy of the State over the Christian religion was defeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Down through the ages that principle between State and church, once established under the emperor Constantine, has come through a long and varied history. Sometimes there has been a tendency to reversion to the supremacy of the State over the church—as under Henry VIII in England in the sixteenth century, or as under Bismarck in Germany in the nineteenth century. And sometimes the tendency has swung the other way (which is wrong too), for the church to completely ignore man’s ordinary civil obligations to the country in which he may live. But, generally speaking, a just balance has been maintained, with the general assumption in mind that when it comes to a showdown the claims of God in the church really come first over the passing claims of man in the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But today and since the World War the swing has been back again toward the situation in early Roman days. Modem States have tended to ignore and submerge man’s supreme allegiance to God. Where Fascism and Communism have raised their heads in Russia and Italy and Germany and other countries the idea of the worship of the State to the banishment of the claims of the church has arisen. Since the war in many countries Caesar has tried to take all power to himself and to utterly ignore the things of God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In this turn of affairs our own country has not been immune. This school-salute-to-the-flag law in Massachusetts along with other extremist measures in the past few years are signs of the spread of the idea of the “totalitarian State” (just another word for our rendering unto Caesar everything, and to God only what is left over) to these United States of America. The protest therefore—ridiculous though it may seem —of that little boy and his parents in Lynn, Massachusetts, is to be sympathized with by all good Christian men and women who believe that our allegiance to God comes first in this life. And this protest ought to be sympathized with by all good Americans (whether Christians or not) who believe that our land is a country of freedom of conscience and liberal democracy for every citizen, and not a land of dictatorship and regimentation of anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Shame on Massachusetts, the cradle of democracy, and the place where Pilgrims first came in 1620 for the sake of freedom of religion under oppression of the State—shame on Massachusetts for such an unChristian and un-American incident!</span></p>

They should not be forced to do so, nor denied educational advantages for refusal—not in these United States. In Italy, Germany or Russia salutes may be important. Over here we are not regimented to that extent. Not yet. The obstinate’ children are placed in an impossible position by the school board demands. They are obliged to choose between the commands of their parents and the demands of the school. They are entitled to better treatment all around. They are entitled, among other things, for a chance to love the Stars- and Stripes of their own free will and accord. They should not be encouraged to believe that the flag symbolizes force and fear. What if they finally yield and give the salute in order to escape punishment? Can such a gesture mean anything?

<h5><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>American Legion Tricked into Flag Insult?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE youth drafted in 1917 or 1918 and sent to South Carolina or to France to peel potatoes was not necessarily a better American than a man too old to be drafted. If memory serves aright, only one Legionnaire in seven ever got as far as the trenches. To be thought of as specially patriotic suits many people because of what they gain in the way of a little ‘•honor”. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy caters to this vanity and had the use of the American Legion definitely in mind when it caused the selection of J. Ray Murphy, a Catholic, of Ida Grove, Iowa, as the Legion's national commander, and the ‘’Reverend Father” Thomas D. Kennedy, also a Catholic, as national chaplain. In opposition to the American rule and the American custom that the government is the appointed servant and not the boss of the people, the Hierarchy is now engaged in a nationwide campaign to jam a form of Hitlerism down the necks of all Americans. In this campaign to subvert all that the American flag stands for the Hierarchy is trying to use, and is to some extent using, the American Legion. It so used the Legionnaires at Secaucus, N. J., in causing the expulsion from school of two little girls, Alma and Vivian Hering, ages eleven and six, because they preferred to let the flag occupy its proper place (which it occupied for more than 150 years without Roman Catholic assistance or intervention). How can the American Legion claim to be a patriotic organization and justify its participation in a shameless attempt to deprive two little girls of an education because they put God above the flag ? Obviously these men have no proper appreciation of what the flag is supposed to represent. At the expulsion of the children from the Secaucus school, official representatives of the Legion ‘threatened violence to those who honestly tried to intervene to safeguard American ideals of liberty and justice. It is perfectly transparent that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy intends to try to use the American Legion in the same way the Storm Troopers were used in Germany. And after the Hierarchy has accomplished its objective not a Legionnaire's head will be safe on his shoulders unless he is a Romanist. The record of the American Legion at its conventions is not such as to reassure Americans who did not peel potatoes in South Carolina or in France that their interests are secure in the Legion’s hands. Why should the Legion allow itself to be tricked into denial of American principles and line up with the gang that is working to destroy everything the American flag has represented to Americans for a century and a half ? Is it eleven- and six-year-old God-fearing children that the American people need to fear, or the centuries-old sanctimonious frauds who have an unbroken record of torturing and murdering the brave and honest and Christlike in every land where they could gain power? With so much chicanery afoot, one wonders whether it is not a settled policy of the Ratti-Roosevelt administration to give the Legion its bonus a year from now, in good time to throw the whole weight of this extra-governmental organization to aid the purpose of the Roman Hierarchy to henceforth run America with a high hand, for the “pope”, and to make Hitlerism or Fascism the order of the day. If this is not an insult to the American flag and all it stands for, what is ?</span></p>

Jakob, superintendent of schools, Norwalk, Connecticut, confronted with the refusal of four school children to salute the flag, instead of expelling them from school, as was done by the muttonheads at Lynn, and instead of pounding them black and blue, as was done by the beast at Nemacolin, Pa., said sanely, “The Constitution of the United States is based upon freedom of religious worship. The youth, a fine student, is simply carrying out his religious convictions, to which we cannot object.” This, the true American spirit, is the exact opposite of the spirit which animates those that, like Pashby of Lynn, were “educated” under Roman teachers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">S</span><span class="font8">AYS Gerald W. Johnson, in the Baltimore </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Sun:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“In Massachusetts an eight-year-old boy has been expelled from school for refusing to obey a tyrannical, outrageous, anti-American law which compels school children to salute the flag at stated intervals. His father has brought suit to compel his reinstatement. Here is one whoop for the boy and his father. May they be successful in wiping this treasonable and disgraceful statute from the books. Treasonable? Of course it is. Not in the legal sense, to be sure, because ‘treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them or in adhering to their enemies’. And ‘enemies’ in this case means armed enemies. But morally this statute gives aid and comfort to everyone who hates the United States and all it stands for. Morally it gives aid and comfort to all the enemies of the republic. For the basic idea on which the republic is founded is the idea that the people are the creators and the government is their creature. They have the right to alter or abolish it whenever in their judgment it seems to be interfering with their lives, their liberties or their pursuit of happiness. Under no circumstances are they obligated to bow down to it or to regard it as a superior being. Therefore, its flag, if it stands for anything, stands for the dignity of free men, stands for the right of the individual to live his own life in his own way. The flag has no other excuse for existence, and anything that negatives that excuse reduces the flag to nothing but a piece of cloth. In brief, anything that sets the flag above the citizen, so far from being an honor to it, implicitly accuses the flag of being a fraud and a cheat, and is therefore the deadliest insult that can be heaped upon it. . , .”</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">CCORDING to some authorities the flag pledge is objectionable because not properly worded; it should be said as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Hail, flag, full of grace; the Lord be with thee. Blessed art thou, and blessed is the republic for which thou standest. Glory be to America and to Roosevelt and to Farley, graft without end. So be it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Further, this pledge should not be repeated just once a week. That is an insult to the flag. It should be repeated by school children and teachers (and politicians) before each lesson hour three times, and fifty times at the conclusion of the school work for the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to assist in these devotions, each devotee should be supplied with a beanery. A beanery is composed of fifty small beans, while between every five beans there is strung a nut, (Some call it a nuttery, or &quot;nutty” for short.) On each bean the flag oath should be repeated; and when a nut is reached the devotee should say fervently, “To hell with the pope.” At one end of the beanery should be suspended a swastika, which should be kissed when the beanery has been properly “said” from beginning to end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For those who like variety, the nuts may be accompanied with “Hail Coughlin”.</span></p>

Air. Davis should read up on these words “assurance” and “impudence”; for a doctor may have both and not know how to spell either one. Anyway, here is what he said: “Dear Aliss Estep: I have just read your lame excuse for action in school. If I were your father I would take you over my knee and give you a good spanking, until you were willing to apologize. You are a cheap advertiser, a fanatic more dangerous than a radical or a red. If I were on a commission to examine you I would send you to Dixmont, where you could tell your religion to people of your own mentality. You are not a good American citizen and should be ostracised by society for being a fanatic. Shame on you for creating such a disturbance in our public schools. Perhaps you should be pitied, but rest assured the school board will take care of your impudence, and then see what your God will do for you.” The doctor’s concluding statement puts the finger on the real point at issue, and shows exactly where he stands—with the Devil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“What Is Fascism?” </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By David Wilkie, Great Britain</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font6">HE Church of Rome is definitely not a <sup>11</sup> religious ’ ’ body such as, for example, the Baptists, the Congregational church, the Unitarian church, or the Salvation Army. It is a religio-political organization, as much political as religious. The pope regards religious belief merely as a means to the realization of world dominion, an “empire” ruled over by the Roman Society of Priests, of which he is the head. Of course, he is bound to pretend to his followers that he is acting only as their spiritual chief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jesuits have captured the Church of Rome; the pope, indeed, is their nominee. The Jesuit Order is the <sup>1</sup> ‘ political priesthood” (per </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">se)</span><span class="font6"> of the Church of Rome. Both the general of the Jesuits and the pope are capitalists, or rather financiers, of world-wide influence. It is the Jesuits who are the real managers, the organizers, and the financiers of Fascism throughout the world. They work behind the scenes, of course, using other people as their tools (and many as their dupes) as they have always done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AN ALL-TIME POLITICAL MACHINE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Think over this carefully. According to official Roman Catholic figures there are, roughly, 400 Jesuit piiests in Great Britain and about 2,880 in the United States. Ilas any political party in the country a larger staff of full-time organizers than this? These Jesuits know the innermost secrets of almost every I'oreign Office in Europe. Has any paity in the country a better intelligence service? In this country, too, they have their agents and spies, i.c., Roman Catholics, in the press, the police, the army, the civil service, in society, and in all political parties. They have tremendous funds at their command. What’s to stop the Jesuits from capturing political power in any country? They have the machine; all they need is a political “story’’ and a “party”. Fascism supplies both the story and the party. Its “creed” (promptly cast overboard by every Fascist leader the moment lie comes to power) is simply a salestale to put Fascism across a gullible public in order to establish, in the end, a Jesuit dictatorship. Every Fascist is merely a tool and a dupe of the Jesuits. The rank and file do not know this, but their leaders (who are “in the know”) do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Socialists have made the mistake of reasoning that a movement, in this case Fascism, which stands for ‘ ‘ private ownership ’ ’ must, necessarily, be ‘ ‘ capitalist ’'. Socialists have missed this fact: that “private ownership” existed before “capitalism ’ ’ was heard of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Church of Rome's ideas about property are not the same as “Capitalism’s”. Fascism wouldn’t be Roman Catholic if it were capitalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FASCISM AN INSTRUMENT OF ROME</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fascism is not an instrument of capitalism; it is an instrument of Rome. Its aim is not to “reinstate” capitalism, but to take advantage of the political and economic situation in its entirety to re-establish the political supremacy of the Vatican. This, to use Cardinal Bellarmine's words—the “pontifical supremacy'’, tempoial as well as spiritual, remember—is the “fundamental article” of the Roman Catholic religion. The aim of Fascism is to establish, by force, the Romish rule, and to continue it by force, with book-burnings, suppression of the press and of freedom of speech, and with the torture and terrorist methods of the Inquisition up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the course of its history the Jesuit Order has been expelled from the following countries and places (by Roman Catholics as well as Protestants), not for religious reasons, but on political grounds: [see page 106]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is worth recording that when Pope Clement suppressed the Jesuits on August 21, 1773 (they were “ie-established” by Pius VII, in 1814), part of his words were: “We have remarked to our deep regret that our admonitions to them (the Jesuits) to serve God and not to mix themselves up with other matters, especially secular and political, and many other practical measures, have been almost powerless and of no effect....”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LET THE SCOFFERS SCOFF</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If I regard the Jesuit Order as a menace (as I most certainly do), I can support my attitude, as the table [below] shows, by saying that this has been the experience of generations of governments and statesmen in every country in Europe. Let the scoffers scoff that off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Take away from the Communist party the Catholic-born element in Glasgow, Dundee, Newcastle, Liverpool, Bristol, and Cardiff, and it is a well-known fact that the Communist party in Britain would cease to exist. Take away the Scoto-Irish element in Scotland, and the Anglo-Irish element in England, in London and Liverpool particularly, and there would be no ‘ ‘ Communist Party of Great Britain ’ ’. Every member of the House of Commons </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">knows</span><span class="font6"> that the Catholic population of Britain is the spawning-ground for the Communist party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The truth about Communism and Fascism is that there is ample evidence to show that the Roman Catholic church has been, and is, the spawning-ground of both of them. (This is exactly what was ‘ ‘ arranged ’ ’ in Germany: the Roman Catholic Rhineland was the hotbed of ‘ ‘ Communism ’ and Roman Catholic Bavaria the homing-ground of “Nazism”.) The Communist party in Britain, and in most countries, is one half captured by the Jesuits, and the fake, promoted, systematic conflict of these two anti-democratic forces, ‘ ‘ Communism ’ ’ and ‘<sup>1</sup> Fascism ”, is a conspiracy to lead the public to accept “Fascism” as the alternative to “Communism”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TAMMANY IS A SAMPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Any man who ignores the existence of the Jesuit order is unfit to govern. They are the Grand Masters of Devilry behind Tammany Hall (the U.S.A. Roman Catholic graft institution called after “St. Tammany”); the Zinoviev Letter; the murders of President Duca of Rumania, Barthou, King Alexander of Yugoslavia, President Obregon of Mexico, Sir Henry Wilson; the “Holy Vehme”; Eugene Chen (really a Mr. Bernard Achem, a R.C. from Trinidad); the Moplah risings in India; Ivar Kreuger; the Zimmermann Note; Senor Gil Robles; Skoropadsky’s Ukrainian “Nationalist” movement; the “Protocols of Zion”; the German-Irish Society; Adolf Hitler; etc., etc., etc. The climax of their machinations during the last 100 years is, they have virtually recreated the “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire” in the heart of Europe—Fascist Austria, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Hungary. And these countries, as “swords of the Vatican”, are about to plunge Europe into war, to spread the power of the Jesuits over the rest of Europe by military force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FASCISM IN AUSTRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To get the exemplar of the Vienna massacre one has to turn to the history of the Albigensians in France, or the massacre of the Huguenots, begun on St. Bartholomew’s Day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The growing influeace of Admiral de Coligny filled Catherine de Medici with terror. An attempt to have him assassinated miscarried, so she ordered, purely as a ‘measure of public safety’, the murder of ail Protestant leaders in Paris. The provinces adopted the measure, and between August 24 and October 3 fifty thousand Protestants were put to death. For that Catherine received the congratulations of all the Roman Catholic States, and the pope celebrated the occasion by having a special medal struck and bonfires lighted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The late Dr. Dollfuss, dictator of Austria and a “zealous” Roman Catholic, was leader of the Austrian “Christian Socialists (i.e., Roman Catholic) Party”. His successor, Dr. Schusnigg, is the leader of the Austrian ‘ ‘ Clerical Volunteers ’ ’; he is another very “zealous” Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The massacre in Vienna was St. Bartholomew’s Day over again, with Austrian Social Democrats taking the place of French Huguenots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On one side were ranged the Social Democrats; and on the other, as Fascists in the army and in the Dollfuss front, the ‘ ‘ Holy Roman Catholics ’ ’, the minions of the pope. The result was the holocaust of St. Bartholomew’s Day over again: “Rationalism” instead of “Protestantism”; the slaughter of men, women, and children; cruel and ruthless—worthy of the superstition-sotted, confession-poisoned, priest-drenched dupes of the Haroun of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DOLLFUSS MASSACRE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The papal nuncio in Vienna and the Catholic bishops Gfollner and Waitz were pushing the Government (i.e., the Dollfuss regime) forward along the path of Fascism. Here was the right opportunity, they thought ... to transform Austria into a Catholic authoritarian State,” says Otto Bauer, the Austrian workers’ leader, in his pamphlet </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Austrian Democracy Under Fire,</span><span class="font6"> page 22. It was, in fact, the bishop of Linz and Mgr. Sibylla, the papal nuncio, who urged Dollfuss to begin the massacre, said Otto Bauer (see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Times</span><span class="font6"> February 18, 1934). The Roman Catholic “statesmen” in the pre-Dollfuss Government, Vaugoin, Bishop Seipel and Prince Starhcmberg, paved the way for Dollfuss’ “iron rule”, just as the succession of Roman Catholic chancellors in Germany, Wirth, Marx, Bruening, and Papen, prepared the way for Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Universe,</span><span class="font6"> Roman Catholic paper, April 6, stated: “The new Constitution (of Austria) now to be promulgated is based upon the conception of a Catholic Corporative State. ’ ’ The first article of the old Constitution laid it down that “Her laws originate from Almighty God”. In plain English, Austria’s laws will henceforth originate in the will of the pope, who is “God Almighty’s” interpreter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Everything Austrian in the future is to be worked in the interests of one man, Ambrose Ratti, a foreigner and a tyrant. That’s what the Fascist “patriots” have done for Austria!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As is to be expected, therefore, it was reported in the Austrian </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reichpost,</span><span class="font6"> March 23, 1934, that Bishop Innitzer had been made “leader” of the Youth Movement in Austria. And the Vienna correspondent of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">New Statesman and Nation</span><span class="font6"> stated, July 14: “Workers’ rights survive on paper, or rather as Catholic workers’ rights in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Einheitsgewerkschaftsbund,” </span><span class="font6">i.e., Unity Association League.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then came the murder of Dollfuss. And after Dollfuss, Dr. Schusnigg was appointed chancellor. Schusnigg is the leader of the “Ostmarkische Sturmscharen ”, the Clerical Volunteers! And Schusnigg has as his deputy Prince Starhemberg, another papist, who marched alongside Hitler at the time of Hitler’s 1923 Munich 'putsch’. Starhemberg is also the ‘‘friend” of Mussolini. Observe this chain of pals: Hitler, Starhemberg, Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who rules in Austria? The capitalists? Bunkum. The capitalists, like the workers, have the thumb on them. Austria’s laws ‘‘originate” from “Almighty God”. “Almighty God” rules in Austria: “His Excellency,” “His Eminence,” the pope. As a London </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span><span class="font6"> correspondent reported, Austria is now an “Autocratic Roman Catholic State”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FASCISM IN SPAIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are two Fascist parties in Spain. One is led by Gil Robles, and the other by Primo de Rivera, eldest son of the late monarchist-dictator of Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a pen portrait of Gil Robles in an article in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span><span class="font6"> (Britain) May 17, 1934, by Don Fernando de los Rios, late Spanish minister of education and foreign affairs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In the first speech of his electoral campaign last year, he (Gil Robles) spoke of the necessity of purging Spain of Jewish sympathizers ami freemasons. At a recent mass meeting of his supporters at the Escorial, where they took an oath of allegiance, they h&lt;d to repeat, hands lifted in the air, that ‘the leader can do no wrong’.’’ Just a political version, you see, of the “Papal Infallibility” doctrine—“The pope can make no mistake.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Spain the attachment of the Roman Catholic church to Fascism is open and unconcealed. It was reported in the Spanish press, April 1, 1934, that three Roman Catholic priests had been arrested for taking part at a Fascist meeting at Oviedo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Spanish Fascist movement is frankly one of “Catholic reaction” (to use Mr. Vernon Bartlett’s expression, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle,</span><span class="font6"> March 13, 1934) against the recent Spanish reforms, which drove out the Jesuits, prohibited priests from interfering in politics, and gave Spain a democratic constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other Fascist party in Spain, led by Primo de Riveta, calls itself “Falange Espanola”. That there is no breach between ‘ ‘ Nazism ’ ’ and ‘ ‘ Fascism ’ ’ is illustrated by the following from the Madrid correspondent of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Times:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“J.O.N.S., an incipient Nazi organization, has recently concluded an alliance with the Fascist group, Falange Espafiola, whose leading spirit is the young Marquis Primo de Rivera.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Incidentally, Primo de Rivera’s younger brother visited Sir Oswald Mosley’s Fascist headquarters at Chelsea, London, some time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The following is a report from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">News Chronicle</span><span class="font6"> of June 4, 1934. The headlines, crossheads, and bold type appeared in the report:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">FRUSTRATED BY PHONE ERROR</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SECRET FLAN REVEALED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nuncio Who Got Wrong Number</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">From our own Correspondent:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">MADRID, Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A telephone comedy of errors that has resulted in a diplomatic upheaval between Spain and the Vatican lias just been rerealcd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A few days ago, shortly before the Spanish foreign minister, Sefior pita Romero, was due to leave for Rome to negotiate the concordat with the pope. Monsignor Tedeschini, the papal nuncio in Madrid, rang up a secretary at the Vatican in order to instruct him secretly on how to deal with Spain's foreign minister when he arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By a curious coincidence the name of the Spanish attache at the Rome embassy is almost identical with that of the secretary at the Vatican whom the nuncio was ringing up, and by an error at the Rome telephone exchange the papal nuncio at Madrid was connected with the attache at the Spanish embassy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ASTONISHED DIPLOMAT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All unaware that he was talking to the wrong man, the papal nuncio gave the Spanish attache confidential instruction to extend to the Spanish foreign minister every hope of the early signature of the concordat, but to delay the actual signature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason, he confidently explained to the astonished attai-hd, was that he felt sure that Sefior Gil Robles, the Spanish Fascist and Catholic leader, would soon be in office and then the concordat could be arranged on terms more favorable to the [Roman] church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The attache hung up the receiver without revealing his identity and immediately rang up the Madrid foreign office and gave word for word the secret Instructions he had just involuntarily received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NUNCIO CONFRONTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The acting foreign minister, Sefior Rocha, then called on the nuncio, who blandly expressed his confidence that the concordat would soon be signed. Sefior Rocha cut him short by showing him the full text of the secret instructions that the nuncio had just phoned to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Despite his great diplomatic experience it was some time before Monsignor Tedeschini found his breath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He finally explained that he had acted under Sefior Gil Robles’ formal promise that he would soon be in power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This diplomatic comedy is much commented upon here and the Labor papers are demanding the withdrawal of the Spanish envoy in view of the Vatican’s duplicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This exposes the trickery the “Holy” Roman church is capable of; and it shows, too, quite unmistakably, what Fascism is m Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">[Continue:]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a special correspondent of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christian Science Monitor</span><span class="font5"> reported. July 24, 1934: “That Spain's problem is now definitely Vatican v ersus Labor is a conviction that is rapidly growing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rising in Asturias in October of last year was a fight between reformers and Jesuits for Oviedo city, the center of the Spanish armament industry. The Reformers were beaten, owing to the introduction against them of levies of Moors, and the treachery of certain Catalonian leaders. Since the Asturian rising the Spanish Fascists and the Roman Catholic-owned press have been loudly demanding a wholesale slaughter of the leading spirits of the rising. The Government, however, more wary than the fanatical Fascist-Clericals, has turned a deaf ear to these demands. The vigor of the Asturian defense, many of them miners, by the way, and the knowledge that what the Asturians stood for has many friends in Spain, and in Europe, has prevented the Government from committing further excesses which might inflame the Reformers, and tempt them to another rising which, if it did not succeed—and it </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">might</span><span class="font6"> (there are not enough Moorish janissaries to cover the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font6"> of Spain, and even if there were their employment on a national scale would in all probability defeat its object)—would at least do incalculable damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HONEST AND OVERZEALOUS REFORMERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Reformers made the mistake at the beginning of the revolution of being overzealous in the application of their democratic ideals. Without any apprenticeship in the new ideas, votes were granted to women, and the women, easily swayed in the confessional and still in fear of the priests, voted for the friends of the Clerics and against reform. Characteristically, no sooner did the reactionaries find themselves in legal control than they started to abuse their authority, to use all the forces of the state at their disposal to subdue and crush the opposition by force. It was this that caused the Asturian affair. Fortunately for the Reformers, stalemate has been reached, owing to the fact that they (i.e., the Reformers) have many sympathizers in the army and the police; otherwise there would have been no necessity to use Moors in Asturias. The reactionaries (Fascists) are straining every nerve to raise a dependable private army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Spain, where the “Holy” Inquisition came into being (the appellation ‘ ‘ Holy ’ ’ reminds one of another ‘ ‘ Holy ’ ’, which has not yet received pontifical blessing, however, the anti-Jew, Nazi “Holy Vehme” in Germany), is, no doubt, a fertile soil for anti-Semitism. Gil Robles ’ cry of ‘ ‘ Down with the Jews! ’ ’ and the overt Jesuit alliance with Gil Robles definitely identifies the Jesuits in Spain with anti-Semitism. For centuries Roman Catholics have hounded Jews with the cry of ‘ ‘ Christ Killers! ” When, or where, did a Jew ever prosper in a Roman Catholic country? It was a pope who compelled Jews to wear the so-called “Medal of Infamy”; and the establishment of the Inquisition (established to hunt, burn, and torture Jews in Spain') was sanctioned and confirmed by papal decrees, and the Constitution of the Inquisition was drawn up by a Dominican priest, Dominicans were the ‘ ‘ judges ’ ’ of this awful secret tribunal, and Dominican novitiates in many cases acted as the torturers. (It is significant that, during the reign of the ‘ ‘ Bloody Mary ’ ’ in England, the Dominican house was at Smithfield, where the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">autos-da-fe</span><span class="font6"> were held.) Within living memory Jews were massacred in Limerick, (R.C.) Ireland, on the charge, the timeworn one, of holding a “Black Mass”. One cannot conceive of such a thing's happening in Protestant England, or Scotland, or Wales. Indeed a “Black Mass” has no significance or meaning to anybody but a Roman Catholic. And in France, at the time of the Dreyfus affair, it was Papists and Jesuits, as is historically well known, who were ranged openly against Dreyfus. The defeat of the anti-Dreyfusites was followed immediately with legislation against Roman Catholicism—in which Jean Jaures, who was assassinated in 1914, took a leading part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ANTI-SEMITIC PROPAGANDA</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Fascists in Spain will make the most of anti-Semitism. Whether it will help them any, or much, is a moot point. Anyway, it will take more than ingenuity to prove that there is anything like a “Jewish menace” in Spain, where, until the revolution, the Jesuits were the big landowners and business monopolists. The only “menace” there is in Spain (and it is obvious to anybody who looks for one) is the menace of a corrupt, absolutist ‘ ‘ Church ’ ’, supported by secret orders, who brought Spain to decay and its people to depths of illiteracy —as they reduced Poland, too, to impoverishment and, finally, servitude.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark60">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One more quotation, from an article on Spain by a V. S. Prichett in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Fortnightly Review,</span><span class="font6"> July, 1935, a highly reputable British magazine: “The question is, What will Senor Gil Robles do? Before last October the answer was some kind of Fascism; now it is, Nothing this year. His strength is that he has the rich and powerful backing of the adaptable Jesuits . . . The Jesuits have already bought up many of the best provincial newspapers, and they are determined to redeem Spain from anti-Clericalism, Socialism, and indeed Liberal policy . . . for Spanish clericalism will put the clock back if it gets the chance. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FOR DIRTY WORK, CALL THE JESUITS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And again from a recent observer, a Leah Manning, an ex-M. P. for Islington, London, in her newly published book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What I Saw in Spain,</span><span class="font6"> calls Gil Robles’ party “a Vatican party”, and “a Jesuito-Fascist organization”. Yes, in Spain the Jesuito-Fascist alliance is stark and obvious. It is indeed not an “alliance”, for Gil Robles is a tool of the Jesuits, not an equal. And the same is true of every other Fascist boss in Europe (and candidate for the job), but in most cases the truth is hidden from public view by the Jesuits, the world’s masters in the art of ‘back stage’ politics, as well as the world’s champions in the art of ‘ gulling ’ the masses. To make the people of Italy believe, when it is expedient, that Mussolini is not a militarist, but a cooing dove, is surely child’s play to a gang of experts who have been making almost whole nations believe, for generations, that a bit of paste is the body of the Son of God. If they (i.e., the Jesuits) have not a correct appraisement of the gullibility of mankind, after a 1,000 years’ experience at the game, then who has? It is a historical truism, When you want dirty work done, call in the Jesuits. But (and since this is an article on Spain, the simile is becoming) the Jesuits, like the Moors who were invited to Spain, have the knack of pinching the prize which they have been called in only to safeguard. They got their postwar start in Italy, thanks to the—at least neutrality, of U.S.A., Britain, and France (and they got a start, too, in Poland), and now it won’t be their fault if they don’t soon own and control a half of the continent of Europe. But alas! and fortunately for others,- it is also a historical truism that the triumphs of the Jesuits are always short-lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are only two persons in Germany ‘ ‘ privileged ’ ’ to call themselves ‘ ‘ Leader ’ ’. One is Hitler, and the other is Baldur von Shirach, the leader of the Nazi Youth Movement. Both Hitler and Shirach are Roman Catholics. Goebbels, Roman Catholic, the minister of propaganda, the prime molder of Germany’s mind, was educated by the Jesuits. In 1923, when Hitler’s revolt m Bavaria failed, Goering fled to Rome. Later, in 1931, Goering was sent to Rome as Hitler’s envoy to the pope and Mussolini: “a mission,” says the German author of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Why Nazi?</span><span class="font6"> (a Nazi sympathizer), “which was highly important for the further progress of the National Socialist movement. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span><span class="font6"> Hitler says: ‘ ‘ After all, the only infallible touchstone for distinguishing right action from wrong is: visible success. ’ ’ This makes Al Capone a saint until he was pinched. This is the Jesuitical ‘ ‘ code ’ ’ of morality upon which Nazism, and Hitler’s philosophy, is based. This somewhat prepares one for the following observation by one of Hitler’s semi-admirers, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">An Eyewitness in Germany,</span><span class="font6"> page 78: “ Adolf Hitler has with profound insight made use of the Roman propaganda’s many centuries of experience, and National Socialism’s whole organization betrays the Papal Hierarchy as its model. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hitler is a Roman Catholic, like every other European ‘dictator’—the late Pilsudski, Mussolini, and Dollfuss. He acquired his anti-Semitism, so he says himself, from Lueger, a burgomaster of Vienna, a well-known anti-Semite preacher, and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">‘ ‘ devout ’ ’ Roman Catholic. In the story of the actual intrigues that made Hitler the chancellor of Germany there lies the truth about Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MADE CHANCELLOR BY PAPAL INTRIGUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and later ‘ ‘ constitutional ’ ’ dictator, purely and wholly by papist intrigue. Hitler was not made chancellor by popular vote or voice. He was called to the chancellorship by Hindenburg after von Papen had persuaded Hindenburg to dismiss Schleicher. This is well known. What is to be noted is that von Papen, like Hitler, is a Roman Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is amazing how this has been forgotten in the rush of events since. Nazism rules in Germany today, thanks to von Papen. Democracy has been trampled on, the Jews beaten, Karl Ernst, Strasser, and Schleicher murdered, thanks to von Papen, the Vatican’s ‘lay nuncio’ at Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As a matter of fact, von Papen, so-called “Nationalist”, and not Hitler, was Germany’s first Nazi dictatorl Von Papen was chancellor before Schleicher. He, too, was “invited” to the chancellorship by Paul Hindenburg, without either parliamentary or public support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yet this von Papen, whose party had won only 10 percent of the votes at the election, while he was chancellor in June, 1932, summarily “dismissed” and “forcibly removed” the Prussian cabinet led by the Labor ministers Braun and Severing, who had held office for ten years as heads of an efficient administration. This, a year before Hitler became chancellor, was the commencement of Nazism in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bruening was connected with the Catholic trade union movement. To use Walton Newbold’s words, he was “always cajoling the Social Democrats, more particularly their trade unions”. Elsewhere Newbold refers to “the Catholics of the German Centrum and their allies, the Social Democrats ’ ’. These quotations are from Newbold’s book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Democracy, Debts, and Disarmament.</span><span class="font6"> The papist chancellors Wirth, Marx, Bruening, and von Papen prepared Germany for Hitler; and the Social Democrats, stupidly enough, made themselves the “allies” of the Roman Catholic Centre Party whose vote later on made Hitler the ‘ ‘ constitutional ’ ’ dictator of Germany!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After being elevated to the chancellery, Hitler held a general election. He wanted to win two-thirds of the seats in the German Parliament in order to enable him to abolish it “constitutionally”, to vote itself out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ‘ ‘ ELECTION ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hitler obtained permission from Hindenburg to dissolve Parliament and to hold the election, but on condition that whatever the result the composition of the government was not to be changed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Can you beat that? Hitler was taking a chance to get supreme power, but he was not risking the loss of the power he already had!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No sooner had the “election” started than Goering got to work. He had newspapers suppressed for publishing a report that stock exchange prices had slumped. He prohibited the entire Social-Democrat (e.g., Labor) press from publishing a Social-Democrat manifesto!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this stage Goebbels was appointed to the newly created post of minister of propaganda. This gave Hitler control of broadcasting and cinemas, and of the press, through a system of censorship which Goebbels introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then six days before the date fixed for the election the Reichstag went up in flames. Does any common-sense person doubt for a moment that it was set on fire by Goering? The effect of the fire was stupendous; and Goering, Goebbels, and Hitler made the most of it. The Communists were accused of setting the Reichstag on fire, and the Socialists with “complicity ’ ’. Van der Lubbe was said to have confessed his crime and association with both Communists and Socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the strength of this imbecile’s ‘ ‘ confession ’ ’ the official press agency announced throughout the length and breadth of Germany: “Through this confession the united CommunistSocialist front has become a palpable fact.” In the course of investigation it was stated several weeks afterwards that the Socialists had been entirely cleared from the charge of conspiracy in the crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LABOR PRESS SQUELCHED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On the strength of the fire scare, the entire Labor press, consisting of more than two hundred daily newspapers, was suppressed until further notice. During the last few days of the election Nazi speakers stumped the country accusing the “Marxists” of being murderers and incendiaries. Murderers? It is only non-murderous Nazis who coin words, or names, like “The Night of the Long Knife”. Hitler stood forth as the “bulwark” against those “Reds” who had dared to put a match to Germany’s citadel of Democracy, the Reichstag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Still Hitler doubted the result. He wanted, understand, not merely a majority, but a two-thirds majority, the majority necessary for the temporary elimination of Parliament. Again Goering came to the rescue. Under cover of suppressing the “Red” danger, Goering obtained from Hindenburg a presidential decree which enabled him to establish an iron rule, first over Prussia, and then gradually to the other German states. Germany was put under “martial” Nazi law. Large internment camps were formed, and Communists, Socialists, Liberals, true Nationalists, intellectuals, state officials, etc., anybody and everybody suspected of anti-Nazism who could influence public opinion by pen, speech, or position, were thrown into them. The Labor branches throughout the country were kept in a riot of disorder by a series of raids carried out by Nazis who were practically free from official interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In spite of all this force, suppression, quackery, jailing, and raiding, Hitler did not receive an absolute majority. Out of 647 seats, he obtained only 288. Compared with the previous elections of November 6, 1932, the Nazis had gained 38 seats, the Nationalists 1, the Roman Catholic Centre Party </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4;</span><span class="font6"> the Socialists had lost 1 seat, and the Communists had lost 19. The Government Parties (e.g., Nationalists, 52, “Other Government Parties”, 9, and Nazis, 288) held a total of 349 out of 647 seats. What Hitler had wanted was a two-thirds majority to enable him “constitutionally” to eliminate Parliament. He failed to get this two-thirds majority. What happened next?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Reichstag met in the Kroll Opera House: Hitler introduced an “Empowering Bill” giving the Government complete and absolute power to rule without Parliamentary control. And the Roman Catholic Centre Party voted in favor of it! This gave Hitler his necessary “two-thirds” majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hitler became chancellor, thanks to the papist von Papen; and he became the “constitutional” dictator of Germany, thanks to the papist Centre Party.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MURDERS OF JUNE 30</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hitler’s next task was to remove from office in the party every sincere Nazi who could by his position or prestige influence policy, and who was not prepared to sell Germany, or betray it, to the general of the Jesuits. This was accomplished on June 30, when about 100 Brownshirt officers were massacred (by Blackshirts), and also a number of non-Nazi patriots were dealt with, such as General Duesterberg and General von Schleicher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">General Duesterberg, former deputy chief of the Steel Helmets, the German ex-Servicemen’s Association, was arrested on the night of June 30. (It was the practice of the Inquisition to make its arrests at nighttime.) He was first taken to Dachau concentration camp, and then to Colombia-Haus, Berlin. He was released on August 2, and said after his release: “I have not been shot, but I am a living corpse ’ ’ (see Manchester </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian,</span><span class="font6"> August 30, 1934).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FACTS OF THE JUNE 30 AND THE AUSTRIAN DEBACLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(a) Nazi “disorders” broke out in Austria just a few days before the murders took place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(b) The murders happened a few days after Hitler’s return from Venice, where he had been discussing Austria with Mussolini.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(c) Among those murdered was Herr Rudolf Mai, former leader of the Nazi Storm Troopers (Brownshirts) in Upper Austria; also it was reported in the press that “many leading members of the Austrian Nazi Legion in Germany are said to be missing since the Hitler ‘purge’ started on Saturday”.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Put two and two together now, and you have the truth about the ‘ ‘ Second Revolution ’ ’. The crime of Roehm, Heines, Ernst, Mai, etc., was that they believed in the Anschluss. They had preached it for years with Hitler: to them the “Third Reich” was the Anschluss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Roehm, Heines, Heydebreck, Ernest, and Mai, etc., had been living when the swastika went up in Vienna, they would have led the Brownshirts and the Austrian Nazi Legion in Germany into Austria. Mussolini’s meant nothing to them. They believed’ in ‘Germany First’ and the Anschluss. Of course, this would have upset the whole “Black” (Popish) plot and the alliance of Germany and Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LEADERS BUMPED OFF</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This was one of Hitler’s main planks: the union of Austria with Germany. But this did not suit Mussolini, a power in the “Black International”; so, at Venice, Hitler agreed to give up tire Anschluss idea, and instead to help Mussolini to “preserve” the “independence” of Austria. In other words, they would share Austria between them; but no Anschluss, because power might change hands in Germany. Knowing that this would create trouble in the Brownshirt ranks when it became known, Hitler “bumped” the Brownshirt leaders off before they had time to organize resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is surely perfectly obvious that these Brownshirt leaders were not expecting trouble. Roehm made the Brownshirt army. He was its organizer No. 1. Heines was a Ross-bach man, a leading Nazi terrorist. Men of this sort don’t wait to be slaughtered. They had met trouble before; but then they knew that it was coming to them. They weren’t killed for anything they had done, but for what it was expected they might do when they learned of Hitler’s “treason”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To General Dalcuge was given the task of “cleaning up” the entire Nazi Brown Army after the June executions. Ho stated afterwards that “several thousand” leaders and men had been removed or subjected to disciplinary action. Then in the next breath we were told by Hitler that Captain Roehm had “no following”. Then why were those “several thousand” cashiered or removed? The “purge” reached out over the whole of the Brownshirt organization. It altered its character completely. It left Popery in possession of “Nazism” and “on top” in Germany. Blackshirtism, Popish Fascism, rules Germany; Brownshirtism, or “true” Nazism, is finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The murder of General von Schleicher had nothing to do with the other murders. He was murdered, and his wife also, because dead men (and women) tell no tales. He knew the whole intrigue that made Hitler chancellor; he was regarded as the chief menace to the popish plot to rule Germany under the name of “Nazism”. As stated by “Artego” in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Referee</span><span class="font6"> (Britain), July 8:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In his conversations with Schleicher (when Roehm and Schleicher were conspiring to remove Bruening from the chancellorship) Roehm revealed to him certain secrets about the internal affairs of the National Socialist Party and about its leader. Altho’ Schleicher did not speak about those things confided to him, he allowed others to see that he was in possession of knowledge about the Nazi party- and about Hitler, the publication of which would have put Hitler in an unbearable position and ended his political career.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE POPE BEHIND THE SCENES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Broadcasting to Britishers on July 3, a Mr. Crossman, an eyewitness of the scenes during the Hitler murders, said that whenever he had spoken to the German people, from Munich to Berlin, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all,</span><span class="font6"> without exception, told him the same tiring, i.e., that “the pope was behind the whole of the trouble”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To bear witness that the Nazi party was on the wane when the conspiracy which made Hitler chancellor took place, listen to the following accounts of eyewitnesses, a Russian social democrat, a biographer of Nazism, and a French Marxian Communist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Kerensky, the famous Russian politician, and anti-Communist, says, page 321 of his book about Russia, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Crucifixion of Liberty:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I was in Germany myself in December 1932, duiing the chancellorship of General von Schleicher. The Nazi Influence was then plainly on the decline. In order to beat them finally it was only necessary to push the new chancellor's experiment to its. conclusion : in his Internal policy he had the support of the central elements of every class in Germany . . . Instead of doing everything to support Schleicher, however, Hngenberg and von Papen turned to Hitler and almost pushed him into power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The (anonymous) German author of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Why Nazi?</span><span class="font6"> says, pages 23, 89:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The intrigue which overthrew General von Schleicher and installed Hitler in his stead had been contrived, not by him, but by other forces . . . His (Hitler's) movement had undoubtedly begun to decline and was showing signs of internal disunion. Baron von Papen, whose mediation had brought about the change of Government, was (made) vice-chancellor ... He publicly described the Hitler experiment as a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">detour</span><span class="font5"> leading eventually to the ‘authoritative State’ which was his ideal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">LOST TWO MILLION VOTES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Henri Ernst, the author of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hitler over Europe,</span><span class="font6"> says, pages 12,13:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the end of 1932 it (Nazi party) lost 2 million votes and the Strasser group announced its secession. In January 1933 Schleicher was on the point of hitting the Hitler movement on the head and putting it under his own command ... In the middle of January a secret meeting was held between Hitler and von Papen at Cologne . . . the news of the meeting got into the papers a few days later ... At this meeting Hitler came to an agreement with von Papen. In this way the sudden fall of Schleicher and the sensational nomination of Hitler came about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This, from three sources, is the story briefly of how Nazism got into power. Hitler was not made chancellor as the result of a popular demand. Germany was not in wreck and ruin. He was not carried to the highest administrative post in the Reich on a swell of popularity for Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In his Merttens lecture, 1934, <sup>1</sup> ‘ The Roots of Violence, ’ ’ Mr. 8. K. Ratcliffe said, with perfect truthfulness:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The German people are profoundly anti-revolutionary. During the eight years marked at the end by her admission to the League of Nations, Germany had rebuilt her industries and her civic life, had overcome to a great extent the destructive influences in the national character, and by persistence in the policy of treaty fulfillment (afterwards so bitterly repudiated) had regained in great degree her international standing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There wasn’t an earthly chance of a Communist revolt. Nazism was a declining force. The German public had rejected the idea of violence. After thirteen x aars of turmoil, tolerance had triumphed, Germany was becoming Nationalist, progressive, and more thoroughly, and sensibly, democratic. Schleicher “was on the point of hitting the Nazi movement on the head ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY “SAVED” FOR THE JESUITS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Jesuits saw Germany, and their vision of the “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire”, slipping from their claws. “Down with Democracy! Down with Tolerance! Up Murder! Up Dictatorship!” Papen and Hitler “saved” Germany for the Jesuits, just as Mussolini “saved” Italy for the “Holy Church ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Fascism” (meaning “Nazism” too), wrote Ludendorff in his book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Coming War,</span><span class="font6"> “is a fighting instrument of the pope.” “Fascism is the offspring of the Jesuits.” “The ways of the Church of Rome and Fascism are identical. ” “ The Papacy and Fascism are inseparably united: together they constitute what is called ‘Rome’.” “What astonishes me is that the fact should have been overlooked that national socialism of the Fascist type merely means collectivism of the Romish brand. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thanks to the Jesuits, the old “Holy Roman (Catholic) Empire ’ ’ has virtually been revived in Central Europe. Thanks to the Dominicans (the “Inquisitor-General” is always a Dominican), the “Universal Inquisition”, known by the name of “Gestapo” in Germany and “Ovra” in Italy (i.e., the secret police), once more rules over Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and the Italian Peninsula. But it won’t be for long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It may surprise some people to be told that what is now made out to be the “creed” of Fascism is the complete reverse of the creed which animated the Fascists who marched on Rome. Everybody who knows anything about Italian Fascism knows this. Signor Grandi, the Italian ambassador in London, knows it. It is a positive fact that the original Fascists, the pre-Mareh on Rome Fascists, Mussolini’s followers, were ultra-libertarians!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mussolini was almost an anarchist (he did, in fact, at one time organize the so-called ' ‘ Red Week ’ ’ in collaboration with the anarchist Malatesta) while he was leader of the Italian Fascists </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font6"> he became premier! In the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Popolo d’Italia </span><span class="font6">(i.e., the official Fascist organ), April 7, 1920, after the Fascist party had been in existence for a year, Mussolini wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I start from the individual and aim at the State. If the rebellion against the legal hour was the supreme attempt of revolt against the coercion of the State, a sunbeam of hope would filter into the spirits of us who are desperate individualists. Down with the State in all its forms and incarnations! The bourgeois State as well as the socialist State—the State of yesterday, of to-day, and of to-morrow. For us, only one thing is left, the consoling religion of anarchy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is what Mussolini, then Fascist leader, was preaching about the State, and State ‘ ‘ coercion ’ only two years before he became premier! Where does the “Corporate” State come in this? The truth about the Corporate State doctrine is, it was invented for Mussolini (probably by Jesuits) years after he became dictator, and it was created to justify his dictatorship, and to make the Italians fall in love with tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The demands of the Fascists were more extravagant than the demands of the Socialists in Italy. When bands of workmen started to seize the factories, Mussolini, the Fascist leader, applauded their actions. When a number of ex-soldiers, not Communists, started to seize the estates, Mussolini applauded their actions too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The first occupation of the factories took place at Dalmine (Bergamo), on March 17, 1919. It started all the others. Two days later Mussolini wrote in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Popolo d’Italia:</span><span class="font6"> “To the workmen of Dalmine we send our salute and the expression of our fervent and disinterested sympathy for the noble battle fought. ’ ’ On March 29 he motored to Dalmine with Cesare Rossi to congratulate the workmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Writing about the first occupation of lands, in the same paper, the official Fascist organ, remember, Mussolini wrote, March 25: “ The peasants that rebel today in order to solve the land question must not meet with our hostility. ’ ’ On June 10, he wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Either the blissful landowners will be expropriated or we will muster the masses of combatants against these obstacles and will overthrow them. We will carry on a devilish propaganda.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MUSSOLINI’S “ABOUT FACE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Black, and dirty, and foul as Mussolini’s volte-face was, and so far has been proved to be, one has to read his program in order to realize the enormity of his betrayal of his Fascists, and to appreciate how easy it is for a person once established as a dictator (with the Jesuit machine behind him) to do anything even when it is the complete opposite of what he has preached, or reverse of the faith, or objects, or desires of his followers. The following was Mussolini’s program </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font6"> he became dictator, i.e., the program of the Italian Fascist paity, published in 1919:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(1) National Assembly, intended as the Italian Section of the International Assembly of all Peoples, in order to proceed with the radical transformation of the political and economic basis of Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(2) Proclamation of the Republic. Decentralization of administrative control. Administrative autonomy of regions and communes through their own legislative bodies. Popular sovereignty exercised by means of universal, equal, and direct popular vote of all citizens of both sexes, with right to the people of initiative, of referendum, and veto. Reorganization, ex novo, of the administrative bodies of the State. The function of the State to be limited to the civic and political direction of national life.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">(6) Freedom of thought and of conscience, of religion, of association, of press, of propaganda, of individual and collective agitation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(7) System of education with both cultural and vocational schools open to all.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">(12) Reorganization of production based on insurance principles and on direct participation of profits by the workers. All landed estates to be given over to the peasants. The management of transportation industries and of public services to be entrusted to syndicates comprised of technical experts and workers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(13) Abolition of secret diplomacy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(14) Open international policy dedicated to the solidarity and independence of peoples in the Confederation of States.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“fascists” cheated in a big way</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be out of place here to discuss whether this propram is good, bad, or indifferent. The point is, it was with this program that Mussolini got into power. The Fascists stood for (and the rank and file believed in it, you may be sure): no political police, no secret diplomacy, no compulsory conscription, freedom of speech, decentralization of executive magistrates, etc.!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">You ought to appreciate now that Mussolini has cheated his ■“Fascists” in a big way. A man capable of doing what he has done is fit for any treachery, and any amount of it. It sticks out a mile that his regime is the greatest swindle in history. I have given this matter some thought and some study and I am firmly convinced that from the start of Fascism (and maybe long before then) Mussolini was secretly in league with “Rome”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Mussolini,” says Ludendorff, “is nothing more than an ambitious tool in the hands of Romish ecclesiastics”; and I concur with Ludendorff. Ludendorff is Germany’s Smuts. He is not an amateur in politics. He knows what he is talking about. The difference between Ludendorff (who has no axe to grind) and most other authorities on politics (who also lack his courage) is, he says what he thinks. The rest of them think it but don’t say it, and so leave the masses in ignorance and confusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mussolini gave the name of “Fascism” to the creed he promised. What I want to know is, and what you, dear reader, should want to know is: What name must we give to the creed he has fulfilled? It is not Conservatism, it is not Liberalism, it is not Socialism, it is not “Fascism”. No! It is Jesuitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the original fascist program</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Read the Fascist program again: (1) It is not anti-Masonic; you may look but in vain for any reference to Masonry in it. Many active Masons were in the ranks as Fascists during the March on Rome. The Freemasons in Italy were a patriotic although anti-Papal body. (2) It is hot pro-Church of Rome: one of its clauses is, “Suppression of Church revenues.” (3) It is not anti-liberal; if anything, it is ultra-liberal. It proclaims ‘ ‘ popular sovereignty ”, “ freedom of thought, of press, of propaganda,” and so on. (4) It is not, strictly speaking, anti-Socialist. It demands nationalization of credit, the abolition of stock exchanges, expropriation of estates, etc. Lastly, (5) the spirit of the Fascists was “Italy First”, i.e., with emphasis on the “Nation”, not the “State”, and with no reference at all to the “Church”. So much for the theory. Now for the practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the “revised” program</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(1) Before Mussolini was in power three years he launched an attack upon the Masons, including those in his party, sent many of them to jail, and suppressed Freemasonry by law. But he didn’t suppress, and he hasn’t suppressed, the Roman Catholic secret societies by law, the Italian equivalents of the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kni</span><span class="font6">ghts of Malta, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Knights of Columbus, etc. (2) In 1929, from the Italian treasury Mussolini gave a gift of nineteen million pounds to the Vatican. This was a part of the “Lateran Treaty”. (3) He murdered Amendola, the Liberal leader; treated liberalism as “subversion” (tins is the very word used by a Fascist historian) ; and in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gerrachia</span><span class="font6"> magazine, 1925, Mussolini boasted that he had reduced democracy and liberalism to the state of “rotten corpses”. (4) He smashed every outward vestige of propaganda in favor of the ‘Socialist’ items in his program, irrespective of whether the agitation came from the Reds or from the Fascists. And he murdered Matteotti, the Socialist leader. Matteotti was an upright and a very popular figure. (5) Mussolini abolished the “Victor Emmanuel’s Day” celebrations. On the 20th of September, 1870, the Italian troops took possession of Rome. The Italian nation celebrated the day as a festival of national reunion, and, of course, as the anniversary of victory over the Papacy and Austria. It was Italy’s “First of July” and “Battle of the Boyne” combined. This is where Fascism shows itself in its true colors. The idea of Italian patriotism’s “insulting” Roman popery was naturally disliked by Mussolini’s masters; so the festival was cut out of the Fascist calendar. The Vatican, not Italy, came “First”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a mistake to imagine that only plumbers and dockers and ‘ ‘ Reds ’ ’ of various hues are lying in Mussolini's internment camps. During the War and later in 1925, General Ben-civenga was secretary for Cadorna, commander-in-ehief of the Italian army in the War. Mussolini interned Bencivenga in the island of Ustiea, where the worst and most incorrigible criminals were lodged. It -would have been more humane to have him shot, but to keep him living was perhaps the “better” method of sealing the lips and palsifying the hands of his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the explanation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now let me ask of you, What explanation can you offer </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">this total perversion of the Fascist policy and this attack upon Liberals, Patriots, Socialists, and Freemasons? Surely this is a question of some importance. Well, then, answer it,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> you </span><span class="font6">Tories, Liberals, and Socialists! This is the answer: There is only one political body in Europe, only one, not two, or three, or four, which is anti-Liberal, anti-Masonic, anti-Patriot, antiSocialist, anti-Communist, and anti-Jew, and that body is the Jesuit Society. “Fascism” (i.e., original Fascism) doesn’t rule in Italy today, any more than “Nazism” (or Brown-shirtism) rules Germany. The Jesuits rule Italy, and their ‘ ‘ creed ’ ’ is now the orthodox Fascist creed in every European country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If Mussolini’s post-War record is hardly flattering to II Duce, his pre-War one is worse. The following are characteristic points of Mussolini pre-War biography:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(1) His five months’ imprisonment, November 23, 1911, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">March 12, 1912, for having incited the soldiers of the African war to desert.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(2) His expelling of Bissolati and Bonomi from the Socialist party he directed, because they had dared to congratulate the king for having escaped murder at the hands of an anarchist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(3) His denouncement before the High Court of Milan, April 1, 1914, for ‘ ‘ instigation of crime, and insult to the army ’ ’.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(4) The organization of the so-called “Red Week” in collaboration with the anarchist Malatesta, etc.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The last myth about Mussolini that’s worth exploding is the one about the March on Rome. Contrary to the belief of almost every Fascist, Mussolini did not lead the March. He was in Milan all the time, and when it was safe to go to Rome he went in a Pullman sleeping car!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MARCH ON ROME</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The March on Rome was the work of the “Quadrumvirate”, De Bono, De Vecchi, Bianchi, and Balbo. De Bono was in command of operations; Bianchi did liaison staff work; Balbo commanded the marchers; and De Vecchi, along with Grandi, did the negotiating with Salandra (the prime minister) and the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mussolini watched events from Milan, a few hundred miles away from Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was De Vecchi and Grandi in Rome who telephoned Mussolini at Milan telling him of Salandra’s first offer of ‘participation ’ in the government. It was they who won from Salandra and the king the invitation to Mussolini to form a government. “On receipt of the official invitation,” says Ion S. Munro, “he (Mussolini) left at once for the capital.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How has this quadrumvirate fared? De Vecchi is still a minister. Bianchi is dead. De Bono was ‘ ‘ removed ’ ’ from his post as chief of police. Grandi was “sent abroad” to London. Balbo has been ‘ ‘ exiled ’ ’ to Tripoli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“LA BOTTEGA DEL PAPA”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not true that Mussolini against his will was forced to “bargain” with the pope. This is often said to justify Mussolini’s dealings with the Vatican. It is sheer, demonstrable nonsense. On the contrary, if Mussolini had put the pope in a boat and sent him to Tripoli, nobody in Italy would have bothered much. Before Mussolini’s advent to power the Church of Rome’s name in Italy was mud. Its prestige was low before the War; it was much worse after it. It was commonly called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘ ‘ La bottega del papa</span><span class="font6"> ’ ’. i.e., the pope’s shop, a reference to the ‘ ‘ holy ’ ’ relic racket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What Mussolini did was, he pretended to quarrel with the pope, just as Hitler is pretending. Most people, including the then “Fascists”, thought that this was fine. But the net result of every “quarrel” was a further concession to the Vatican. In fact, Mussolini re-instated Popery. He raised the “Church” from one of odium, which it richly deserved, to an institution of authority. And when he had completed the job, the pope called him a “man sent by divine providence to save Italy”. As no pope yet has ever worried much about “patriotism”, substitute the word “Church” for “Italy” and you will have the pope’s real meaning. “Sent by divine providence to save the ‘Church’.” I am telling Jews and democrats who their enemy is. In the words of Gambetta I say, pointing to ‘<sup>1</sup> Rome ’ ’: ‘ ‘ There is your enemy. ” If I were saying this to the Labor people in Spain, they would believe me. They know what “Rome” is, as the forefolks of Britain, Holland, Sweden,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Switzerland, etc., knew, i.e., from personal experience, but the average person now doesn’t know a thing about it. And the moment one tries to speak to him about it, he thinks (or at least some of them do) that one is trying to turn him into what he calls a “hymn-singer”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MUSSOLINI AND FREEMASONRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Anti-Freemasonism was not a plank of the early Fascist program. Many Masons took part in the March on Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Freemasonry in Italy had old ties with Italian Nationalism dating back to Risorgimento days. They helped to make Italy a nation. And for this too, no doubt, they incurred the displeasure of the pope, because the papacy lost its dominions, the City of Rome, when Italy became a nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Masons were neither for nor against Fascism. They were neutral. There were two Masonic bodies in Italy, known by the name of the buildings they occupied, the “Giustiniani Palace Masons ’ ’ and the ‘ ‘ Piazza del Gesu Masons ’ ’, and actually the latter was, if anything, friendly towards Mussolini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why does the Church of Rome dislike the Freemasons? Not because they belong to a secret society. No. There are a number of Roman Catholic secret societies, The Knights of Malta, The Ancient Order of Hibernians, The Knights of Columbus, etc. The Roman Catholic church objects to Freemasonry because Masonic societies do not come under their priestly control, and because Masons deny the papal claims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In August 1924, two years after Mussolini came to power, the attack on Freemasonry opened. During 1925 Mussolini was busy “purging” his party of Masons. They had been good enough to help Mussolini to power, but they were not the sort he wanted to help him to administer his “Fascist” state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the close of 1925 Freemasonry was suppressed by law. ‘ ‘ It was a move, ’ ’ says Ion S. Munro, ‘ ‘ which won him favor in the eyes of the Vatican. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The year 1929, i.e., </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">seven years</span><span class="font6"> after Mussolini’s elevation to the premiership, was perhaps the year when the Fascist terror reached its highest pitch. The “O.V.E.A. ”, or secret police, was called into existence in 1929. To quote a 100-percent sympathetic historian of Fascism, in 1929: ‘ ‘ Over 1,000 prisoners were sentenced, many of them receiving punishments of over ten years ’ imprisonment. ’ ’ In September 1929, Cesare Rossi was decoyed on to Italian soil at Lake Garda, after he had managed to leave Italy. He was arrested and sentenced to thirty years. Who is this Cesare Rossi? At one time he was secretary of the Italian Fascist party, and Mussolini’s closest companion! If Eossi was not prepared to “play ball” with the pope, and I suspect he wasn’t, the least Mussolini could do (at his masters’ bidding) was to shoot him or jail him. He jailed him plenty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE VATICAN’S “PROFITS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is there of significance about this year 1929? After seven years of Mussolini’s rule one would have expected that the internal condition of the country would be quiet, stable, and nonrefraetory. The Lateran Treaty was signed in June, 1929. This ‘ ‘ Treaty ’ ’ was the Vatican’s ‘ profits ’ from Fascism. It was Jesuitism putting the seal on its victory. The resistance to it was the last ‘big fling’ of the anti-Fascist forces in Italy. They lost, of course. But the next time they cross swords with Mussolini (and the general of the Jesuits) they shall win.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When Mussolini signed the Lateran Treaty, the words “toleration of other religions ’ ’ were cut out of the Italian Constitution. In theory Fascist Italy (unlike pre-Fascist Italy) does not admit religious tolerance. In practice it has to, so as not to arouse the antipathy of especially Britain and U.S.A. He gave the gift of £19,000,000 to the Vatican, already referred to. (I suspect this was the return of the monies Mussolini had received from “Rome”.) Above all, he re-established the pope’s “temporal” sovereignty. Do you know that the Vatican was very much upset because it was not given a seat in the League of Nations? If you didn’t know this before, then you know it now. By re-establishing the pope’s “temporal” sovereignty Mussolini raised the Church of Rome to the diplomatic status of a “State”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mussolini closed down the Y.M.C.A. He put the pope’s picture back into every State school classroom. He cut out the words “toleration of other religions” from the Italian Constitution. He suppressed the Freemasons. Finally, Fascism reestablished the pope’s “temporal sovereignty”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is no liberty of speech anywhere in Italy outside </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the confessional box; and this just about sums up the truth, and tells all there is to know about Fascism in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BENEFICIARIES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some time ago knighthoods (“commenda”) were given to five leading foreign journalists in Rome, two of whom belong to British papers; an almost unheard-of thing in any other country. This gives one a good idea of what sort of “news” some readers must be getting from Italy. It is news of ‘ ‘ ruptures” between Italy and Germany, “quarrels” of Mussolini and the pope, Eoman Catholics ‘ ‘ ill-treated ’ ’ in Germany, Italy, and Austria, all to misinform and confuse the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FASCISM BREEDS POVERTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Fascism has not been a godsend either to the workers or to the employers of Italy. In 1926 Italy had 78,000 unemployed; in 1933 the figure was 1,000,000. In the years 1930-32 Italy’s foreign trade shrank by 48 percent. One of Italy’s recent budgets showed a deficit of £66,000,000. The adverse trade balance was £50,000,000. There were more than 21,000 bankruptcies in Italy in 1932. In Great Britain, a more commercialized country, there were 4,645 bankruptcies in 1932, i.e., one-fifth of Italy’s figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The official comparison of real wages, that is, money wages in terms of food-purchasing power, are thus given in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Whittaker’s Almanack,</span><span class="font6"> on the authority of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry of Labour Gazette:</span><span class="font6"> Great Britain 100; Italy 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Hessell Titlman, British journalist, who undertook a survey of conditions in Europe a year or two ago, says, and quite truly:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Whether or not families forced to live on such a budget are ‘starving’, as one Italian working man assured me, there can </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">no que;tion that the standard of living in Italy is one of the lowest, measured in material comfort, in all Europe.” (“Slump: A Study of Stricken Europe.”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who, then, has benefited from Fascism? The pope, [Achille] Ambrose Eatti. And—Mussolini, starting earlier than Rosenberg, has bled his country white financing parties abroad to serve his war plans. Listen to this, from a pamphlet written in the summer of 1930 by Lauro De Bosis, an Italian, and secretly distributed in Italy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“For all the dissatisfied, Italy has a little money and a great deal of promises. In Albania, among Hitler’s men, among the people of the Austrian Hehnwehr, among the Macedonian Comitagi, and especially in Hungary, wherever there is an opportunity to agitate, to trouble peace, to put powder mines, there the dangerous shade of Mussolini can be discerned.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MUSSOLINI MYTH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is not true that Mussolini ‘ ‘ saved ’ ’ Italy from Bolshevism. This is a myth (like the myth that Hitler ‘ ‘ saved ’ ’ Germany from Communism, or that Mosley is “saving” Britain from Moscow); and the people who spread it are prevaricators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The danger of a Bolshevik revolution passed away with the failure of the occupation of the factories, and the victory of the Moderates </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Riformisti')</span><span class="font6"> over the Extremists of the Socialist party on September 2, 1920. Mussolini himself said in his paper, November 30: “ The Italian home situation improves every day.” In the first days of 1921, a year before he became premier, and almost three years before he declared his dictatorship, Mussolini wrote: “ In Italy one cannot speak any more of any Bolshevik danger whatsoever. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That’s clear enough, isn’t it? also the alleged economic paralysis caused by “Bolshevism” in the years 1919 and 1920, as the test of official figures reveals itself nonexistent:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Number of stock companies in Italy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Capital invested in the same (in millions)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Deposits in savings institutes and popular banks (in billions)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Revenue from income tax</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(in billions)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Number of persons transported by the railways (in millions)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Warning </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part 2)</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font16">W</span><span class="font8">HAT, then, is this abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet and also by Jesus? It is the League of Nations, which was brought into existence shortly following the World War and which is hailed by religionists as a substitute for God’s kingdom on earth which shall rule the nations of the world. The League of Nations is backed by the international bankers, professional politicians, and religionists. Says the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font8"> of March 8, 1934: “The League of Nations, backed by millions, is reaching out in an effort to control public opinion, and doing this through the schools, churches and other professional organizations.” From a published report by the Federation of Churches the following is quoted, to wit: “The supreme hope for the future is the League of Nations. The peace of the world and hope of humanity rests upon the proper functioning of the League of Nations.” Catholics, Protestants and Jewish religionists all support the League. In February, 1934, the League of Nations Association published a statement in which these words are used, that “the League of Nations is the only light in the world”. The Scriptures declare that the kingdom of God under Christ is the light of the world and the only hope of the world. The proof is conclusive, therefore, that the League of Nations is set up as a substitute for God's kingdom and hence stands now in the place or stead of the kingdom, where it ought not to stand. It is the product of Satan the Devil and is an abomination in the sight of God and works desolation to the people because its purpose is to turn humankind away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do you now see and recognize that the League of Nations is put forward as a substitute for God’s kingdom under Christ? Do you desire to be on the side of God and His righteous government? If so, then, says Jesus: “Flee now to the mountains,” that is, to the kingdom of God, by taking your stand wholly on the side of God and His kingdom. Jesus’ warning is given only to those who are in favor of God’s kingdom and who desire righteousness. Why should such persons now flee by taking their stand on the side of God and His kingdom? That question is answered in these words by Jesus (Matthew 24:21): “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.” That tribulation is the battle of Armageddon, which battle will completely wreck Satan’s world, and will be the end of all trouble on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To those who desire to be on the side of Jehovah now He says (Zephaniah 2:2,3): ‘Before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you, seek meekness and righteousness: it may be that you shall be hid in that day.’ Meekness means to learn the truth and thereby ascertain the will of God. Righteousness means to do what is right in the sight of God; and only those who learn the truth can know the way of righteousness. To aid you to gain this much needed knowledge Jehovah’s witnesses are now coming to you with books explaining the Bible and which enable you to find in the Bible all these truths. It is of greatest importance to you that you now take your stand on the. side of Jehovah and then study to show yourself approved unto God. This message of warning Jehovah’s witnesses are commanded to deliver to the people; and, to be sure, Satan and his agents try to prevent the people from hearing this warning. Therefore the opposition to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the Scriptures a “house” symbolically represents the church organizations, and the housetop pictures those in the high places in the organizations. Clothing represents that which identifies a person in the organization. There may be some honest preachers in the church organizations, and others holding high positions therein. To such Jesus gives the warning in these words (Matthew 24:17,18): “Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house; neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The “winter” time means the time of trouble at Armageddon, and Jesus warns those who want to be on God's side that they must not wait until Armageddon begins; hence He says (verse 20): “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The hour of decision has arrived, and every person who hears this warning from the Lord’s Word, and who then remains in Satan’s organization, will be destroyed at Armageddon. Those who flee to God’s kingdom, which is the only place of safety, and who then prove their faithfulness and integrity to God, may be carried through the time of trouble and be the first ones to receive the blessings of life and happiness on the earth. It is your privilege, therefore, to now take your stand on God’s side because that is the right side. He has prepared His place of refuge, which is His kingdom, and He affords you an opportunity to flee thereto.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“This evening a lecture entitled ‘Kingdom Blessings for the People’ was given in the compound of the Nixon Tea Rooms, Residency Road. This lecture was originally broadcast by arrangement with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, in America chiefly, the speaker being the Society’s president, Judge J. F. Rutherford. The manner of rendering the lecture is of interest. Electrical recording of the speech has been made and, by means of transcription machines for amplifying, it can be reproduced and heard in any part of the earth. Thus it is possible to hear Judge Rutherford speak, without his personally being present. This lecture is one of many others now available for such renderings. The work of the abovementioned Society at this time especially is to submit evidence as a testimony to the name of Jehovah God and that the Kingdom or Government which Christians have been taught to pray for will shortly be set up on earth, when obedience to the laws of Jehovah God will bring lasting peace, prosperity, life, health and happiness, to the people. As Jehovah’s witnesses those engaged upon this work call upon people of good will to heed these truths contained in the Bible and to take their stand for Jehovah God. Jehovah’s witnesses are not interested in proselytizing and getting membership for any religious society or church. The wickedness now prevalent, including corruption in commerce and politics, the hypocrisy in organized religion, especially in so-called ‘Christendom’, and other ills whereby Satan has caused God’s name to be blasphemed and the people to suffer’ through exploitation and oppression will soon be stopped by and through the righteous kingdom that Jehovah God will set up. These Biblical lectures and treatises are also in print. Books and booklets circulated to the extent of more than 160,000,000, in sixty languages, treat fully with the matter under consideration. Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in book-selling or commercial work, but offer the literature asking for a small contribution in return toward the cost of printing and delivering more books that others might learn of Jehovah’s gracious provision for mankind. The Society’s representatives while here in Nagpur will be willing to give these lectures to any society or organization in Nagpur free of charge provided the use of a favorable site is offered for the purpose.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">F</span><span class="font8">J. Cirves, Wisconsin, chides H. E. Howe, • editor of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Industrial and Engineering Chemistry,</span><span class="font8"> American Chemical Society, Mills Building, Washington, D.C., for defending aluminum as a metal fit to be used for the preparation of victuals, and then tells Mr. Howe something about his own magazine that ought to make him think. He says: “I read a treatise some time ago in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Industrial and Engineering Chemistry </span><span class="font8">News Edition concerning tests made on metals for a large butter churn. For aluminum in the tabulated results the butter tasted metallic. The butter produced in such an aluminum churn is not fit for humans or animals. In fact, such will even kill vegetation, according to work done at the University of Wisconsin on aluminum acid soils.

<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font8">HE Aluminum Company of America is alleged to have done one good thing. Ingot aluminum was selling at 23c per pound, but the aluminum trust, in order to meet copper competition, was making and selling transmission cable at 5^c per pound less than the ingot price. Then when the little fellows wanted to buy cables at the lower price, and melt the cables down so that they could work them up into household poisoning utensils, they found they could not buy at all unless they would guarantee that the cables would be used for cables and nothing else. It is believed by students that this saved many lives. Disheartened and disgusted, some of the cooking-utensil makers may have gone in for nonpoisonous materials and thus the number of wholesale poisonings and domestic tragedies often reported in these columns was reduced. Score one for the trust.</span></p>

While the church was in control there was no education for the Mexican people as a whole; now there are 20,380 schools, 45,878 teachers and 1,987,844 pupils.

On that basis, the company hopes, 8 percent or more will be paid forever and forever. A trusted official of the company went to buy a property for the company; he got it, in his own name, for $70,000. On the way back to the office he raised the price to $95,000 and shoved the $25,000 down in his jeans, there to stay. An average of $2,300 an acre was paid for land that was high at $300 an acre. A state senator owned it; that explains it all. No wonder the country is swallowed up in crime.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ubekt Det j ex, of Wisconsin, writes interestingly of the principal actors in the Italian-Ethiopian travesty:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Mussolini, of Italy, is from the home seat of the Roman Hierarchy, the pope even claiming to be vicegerent of Christ, and a fit subject to prove to all the world that so-called ‘Christianity’ is a fake. On the other side, the black-skinned man claims to be a direct lineage from King Solomon, son of David; yet Jehovah stated the kingdom would be taken from Solomon’s lineage for disobedience, and the title assumed by Haile Selassie, ‘King of Kings’ and ‘Lion of the tribe of Judah,’ applies to no man on earth. So both actors in this fight are not true and faithful witnesses to the only and omnipotent Creator of heaven and earth, Jehovah God, but both parties in the controversy may be under direct guidance of Gog, the spirit creature set by Satan to destroy every vestige and remembrance of Jesus, the Christ, from among the children of men on earth today. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Roman Cult in Complete Accord with Mussolini </span><span class="font8">THERE is complete accord between the pope and Mussolini in the campaign of murder which is annihilating Ethiopia. Cardinal Schuster, of Milan, speaking to the Fascists in that city, declared that Italy’s armies are opening “the doors of Ethiopia to the Catholic faith and the civilization of Rome”. He praised Fascism “as promising the national morality wished by the Catholic church” and rejoiced to see “on the fields of Ethiopia the standards of Italy carry to triumph the cross of Christ”. Also, he did not overlook the opportunity to bestow “peace for the fallen who died in the accomplishment of their duty”, which is the old gag, all over again, that those who die butchering their fellow men are sure of a place in heaven.</span></p>

The latest word from Berlin is that “Hitler will lead the party along the path of positive Christianity and not along the false path of anti-Christian doctrine”. This is an official statement from Hanns Kerri, head of the Reich church ministry, and followed a lengthy interview between Hitler and Count von Preysing, the Roman Catholic bishop of Berlin. What it means is that Hitler, having subjugated Germany, is now turning it over, lock, stock and barrel, to the Roman Catholic sect, the worst and meanest of all the sects.</span></p>
