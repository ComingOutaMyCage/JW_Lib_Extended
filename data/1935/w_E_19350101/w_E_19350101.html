<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark3"></a>JEHOVAH’S BATTLE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">“For Jehovah and for Gideon.”—Judg. 7:18, A.R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH engages in battle for his name’s sake. The battle that will completely vindicate his name will be the “battle of that great day of God Almighty”, fought at the place which he has chosen, and hence is called the ‘battle of Armageddon’. He assembles his own forces and maneuvers the enemy to come up against them for battle. The “King of eternity”, whose name alone is Jehovah, has made Christ Jesus his Chief Officer and Vindicator or Executioner of judgment and has sent him forth to engage the enemy in battle for the purpose of vindicating his great and holy name. The time has come for Jehovah by his strong “right arm”, Christ Jesus, to take possession of the earth, and relating to that time he caused his prophet in centuries past to write: “To Jehovah belongeth the earth, and the fulness thereof.” Then the prophet propounds the question: Who shall be in his holy organization and witness the triumph of the King? Jehovah causes the answer to be written: ‘The clean of hands, and the pure of heart . . . shall bear away the blessings from Jehovah and vindication from his delivering God.’ The time of the fulfilment of these prophetic utterances is after Jehovah has enthroned his beloved Son and sent him to the temple for judgment. Jehovah, the King of Eternity, causes announcement to be made at the temple, to wit, “Lift up, ye gates, your heads, and lift yourselves up, ye ancient doors, that the king of glory may come in. Who, then, is the king of glory? Jehovah (God) of hosts, he is the king of Glory.”—Ps. 24, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth. Pss.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> Thus the psalmist identifies the king of glory as “Jehovah of hosts”, meaning Jehovah of armies in battle array, “Jehovah, strong and mighty; Jehovah, mighty in battle.” Who composes this host of Jehovah? In' ancient times Jehovah’s chosen people, the Israelites under the leadership of the captain wholly devoted to God, stood as the representative of this host. Such is the simplest application. ‘The host,’ in the wider application, means the legions of spirit creatures invisible to human eyes. “Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name.” (Ex. 15:3, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.) </span><span class="font3">‘Appearing with his host’ means that the time for war has come and the great battle must be fought. (Eccl. 3:8) It is the time when Satan and his hordes of wickedness shall bite the dust. Due notice has been given to Satan and his organization, and they are told to prepare for war, and Satan knows that his time until the battle is short. In times past Jehovah foretold these days of preparation and of battle, and this he did in at least two different ways: (1) By the plain words of his prophets; and (2) by making prophetic pictures or dramas, in which creatures played their respective parts. We have the assurance from Jehovah that in his own due time he will make known the meaning of these prophecies and prophetic pictures, particularly to those who are devoted to him, and that just preceding and at the time of the battle. Because these things were written aforetime that the remnant should receive comfort and in patience continue their work in hope, we may be sure that it will please Jehovah to give the remnant some understanding of these prophecies and prophetic pictures now, just preceding the time when the great battle is to be fought.—Rom. 15: 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GIDEON AND HIS ARMY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>3</sup> Among the divinely made prophetic pictures that seem to begin to have fulfilment shortly before Armageddon is that of Gideon and his little army that put to flight and destroyed the Midianitcs and their allies, as described in chapters six to eight of the book of Judges. It is certain that the victory that was given to Gideon was the victory of Jehovah God and the record is made thereof in the Scriptures for the instruction, aid and comfort of the remnant at the present time. In all prophetic dramas and pictures Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the important ones, and m the pictures they are represented by some creature who may or may not be wholly devoted to Jehovah God. Sometimes one man plays a double role, but it is the truth taught by that part which God has him to do that is the matter of importance. Since the coming of Christ Jesus to the temple of Jehovah for judgment it has pleased the Host High to make it plainly to appear to his anointed ones on earth that the prophetic dramas enacted in ancient days, and recorded in the divine record, were so enacted and recorded to foreshadow Jehovah’s purpose; and the understanding of these things now brings great coinfort and hope to the anointed. It seems to be God’s time for his anointed remnant to have an understanding of these prophetic dramas recorded, including the book of Judges, and hence with confidence we examine the record thereof.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAYERS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>4</sup> The more prominent players in this prophetic drama are these: Joash, the father of Gideon, appears in the picture as representing Jehovah. This may at first seem strange, since Joash had an altar built to Baal and evidently had fallen away to Baal worship. But bear in mind that the man Joash is of no consequence as a man. The part he plays is important. He merely fills a place on the dramatic stage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>5</sup> Gideon the son of Joash represented Christ Jesus, the Son of Almighty God, whom Jehovah has appointed as vindicator of his name. In some parts of the drama Gideon represents the faithful anointed remnant, who are counted in by reason of being a part of The Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The people of Israel, being God’s covenant people, in which there was found a remnant of faithful ones, pictured as a whole the peoples of earth under the dominating power of Satan and out from which comes the faithful remnant that honors and serves Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>7</sup> The “three hundred” that engage with Gideon in the battle represent or picture the faithful remnant which God has selected and approved for his name who have proved their faithfulness and integrity towards Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>8</sup> The Midianites and their allies picture Satan’s organization, that is, ‘the seed of the Serpent,’ bent on the destruction of those who serve Jehovah God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>0</sup> Other players appear as the drama is unfolded, but neither the “great multitude” of Revelation seven nor the Jonadab company appear at any place in the prophetic drama.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> Vindication of Jehovah’s name is the fact of greatest importance that is foretold by this prophetic picture, the chief purpose of which is to establish before all creation that Jehovah is the supreme Almighty God. Jehovah of hosts engages the enemy in war for the execution of his judgment or vengeance and destroys the enemy for the purpose of proving the supremacy of Jehovah and placing his name in its proper place in the mind of all surviving creatures. Jehovah is the source of life, and those who live must know that he is God. Jehovah confers upon Christ Jesus the great honor of being his Vindicator or Executioner, and hence Gideon, who foreshadowed the Vindicator, is the foremost one that plays in this prophetic drama.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARING THE WAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>11</sup> The time must come and did come when Jehovah would turn his attention to the things pertaining to the earth and when his Messenger would go before him to prepare the way for the final conflict. From A.D. 1878 to 1918 Jehovah caused to be delivered the message of repentance and separation from worldly organizations preparatory for the coming judgment which must begin at the house of God. From 1918 onward preparation is made for the battle of Armageddon. It therefore appears that Gideon played a double role, foretelling certain events coming to pass from 1918 onward till Armageddon. Sometimes he pictures Christ Jesus alone, while at other times in the drama he pictures both Christ Jesus and the faithful remnant, and sometimes the remnant alone, who are shown by virtue of the fact of being in Christ and continuing faithful to the end. What follows hereinafter has to do with the divine record recorded at Judges chapters six to eight, which prophetic pictures open with these words: “And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.” —Judges 6:1.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>12</sup> Jehovah had chosen the Israelites as a people for himself, and here they picture the same ones as they did when in Egypt, to wit, the peoples of earth under the power of Satan and who shall be delivered. When Jehovah inaugurated his covenant with Israel he commanded them: “Thou shalt have no other gods before me.” (Ex. 20:3) Later, when they were oppressed by the enemy and cried unto God, he said to them: “I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell; but ye have not obeyed my voice.” (Judg. 6:10) The nation of Israel, of course, included Gideon’s father Joash, who had turned to Baal worship, and this Baal worship was the evil that they had done in the sight of the Lord. God had warned the Israelites of what should come upon them for their unfaithfulness, and now in full harmony with that warning he permitted the enemy, led by the Midianites, to oppress them. The destruction of the Israelites would not have settled the question at issue between Jehovah and Satan; but chastising the Israelites, and then raising up the faithful ones and delivering them and giving them the victory over the enemy, would be a vindication of Jehovah’s name, and this in the prophetic drama would foreshadow the final result.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>13</sup> The enemies whom God permitted to harass the Israelites were the Midianites and their allies. Midian was a son of Abraham by Keturah; his name means “contention” or “brawling”. (Gen. 25:2) The Rechabites, or ‘Jonadabs’, were descendants of Midian, but they were not included in the company of Midianites that oppressed Israel. (Ex. 2:16-21; Judg. 1:16; 4:11; Jer. 35: 6) This foreshadows the Jonadab or “sheep” class on earth at the time the judgment is proceeding. The merchantmen who sold Joseph into Egypt were Midianites. (Gen. 37:28,36) The Midianite elders joined the Moabites in hiring the prophet Balaam to curse Israel. (Num. 22:4-7) Balaam taught the Midianites to cast a stumbling block before Israel to entice them into the worshiping of Baal-pcor. (Num. 25:6-18) Thus it is seen that the Midianites were fleshly relatives of the Israelites, who had become wholly the seed of the Serpent and who were bent on doing injury to the Israelites. The Lord permitted the Midianites to oppress the Israelites for a period of seven years, which corresponds to the 7,000 years of man’s bondage to Satan and during the last thousand years of which period the obedient ones will be delivered and the enemy destroyed. The- yoke of the Midianites appears to have been broken in the springtime of the seventh year, at the grain-threshing time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>14</sup> Because of this persecution and oppression the Israelites endeavored to find a place of refuge in the mountains: “And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.” (Judg. 6:2) Undoubtedly the Israelites hid in the dens and there concealed their food to keep the enemy from stealing it. This illustrates how the mass of humankind has had to exist in fear of their oppressors, who have at all times been active agents of Satan the Devil to bring sorrow upon mankind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>15</sup> In </span><span class="font3">the springtime, when the crops of the Israelites were well on the way to gathering, the enemy came upon them to destroy their food supply: ‘ ‘ And </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font3">it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them.” (Judg. 6: 3) It is of interest here to note the description of the enemy, which will enable us to locate and identify the possible enemy at the present time. The Midianites were in the lead of this invading army and were accompanied by the Amalekites, who were the descendants of Esau (Edom) by the Canaanitish woman, the Hittite; hence these were second cousins of the Israelites. (Gen. 36: 2,10,12) Their rulers were the Agag-ites. Haman, who plotted the destruction of Mordecai and Esther, was of that despicable stock. (Esther </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">3:1) </span><span class="font3">God had pronounced a curse upon the Agagites because of their persecution of his chosen people when </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font3">their trek to Canaan. (Ex. 17:8-16; 1 Sam. 15:32,33) The “children of the east”, who also were members of the invading army, were Ishmaelites. (Judg. 8: 24) The mother of Ishmael was the Egyptian woman Hagar, and the father was Abraham. Ishmael married an Egyptian. (Gen. 16:3; 21:21) It was the Ishmaelite merchants that bought Joseph and carried him away into Egypt. This but illustrates the fact that one part of the human race that has become the seed of the Serpent has been used by the Devil to oppress and persecute those who have tried </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font3">serve Jehovah God. All are fleshly related to each other, and most of them have become the sons of the Devil by taking his side of the controversy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>10</sup> All of that motley and oppressive horde that came up against the Israelites were under the leadership of four sheiks, whose names were, to wit: “Oreb,” meaning ‘ ‘ raven ’ a bird of prey and which steals; “Zeeb,” meaning “wolf”, a wild and stealthy and murderous beast; “Zebah,” meaning ‘slaughterer’ or willful killer; and “Zalmunna”, meaning “defense has been denied”, that is, such men as stealthily take undue advantage of others and strike them in the dark without •warning and hence are like unto the copperhead snake. All of these instruments of the Devil, forming a part of the seed of the Serpent, are shown in the present day by the class of men who join together to persecute God’s anointed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>17</sup> Jehovah had duly warned the Israelites that their disobedience would be visited by calamities, and by God’s permitting this devilish horde to invade their land punishment for disobedience had come upon them. (Deut. 28: 33, 34) These facts illustrate how the human race has ever suffered at the hands of robbers, thieves, and murderers, who have preyed upon the defenseless and taken away the fruits of their labors, and how this punishment has come upon them at the instance of the Devil for the purpose of causing them to curse God. But the day of reckoning is near at hand, when all these oppressors must be brought to account. (Jas. 5:1-6) One class of persons of humankind bestow labor upon the earth, -which produces food and raiment and perhaps a place of domicile, while another class, who have produced nothing, reap the benefits or fruits of that labor. A change will come with the reign of Christ Jesus, when men shall build and inhabit their own homes and eat the fruit of their own vineyards.—Isa. 65: 21-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>18</sup> Jehovah had told the Israelites that if they persisted in their acts of disobedience they would suffer: “And ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.” (Lev. 26:16) This did not mean that God sent the enemies. The protection of the Israelites depended upon their obedience to God, and when they failed to obey he withdrew his protection and let the enemy proceed to punish them. The Devil had set a snare and taken the Israelites by playing upon the vanity of the leaders, and had induced them to practice the Devil religion called Baalism. Having entrapped the Israelites, then the Devil marched his roving band of plunderers into their land to take advantage of that people and with the purpose of causing them to curse Jehovah God. “And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.”—Judg. 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>19</sup> That wicked, invading army destroyed everything in the fertile valley of Sharon and then marched on to the commercial city of Gaza, taking or destroying everything that came in their way. The parallel of that invading army and its destruction is found at the present time when we mark that politics, big business, and false religion, called “Christianity”, control, rule and oppress the mass of the people. The Devil set a trap for the leaders of “Christendom” by playing upon their vanity, and he has induced them to adopt a practice of formalism called the “Christian religion” but which is in fact satanie worship. He has caused the people to fear men who as their leaders claim to have divine guidance in the administration of public affairs. The people, being blindly led by blind guides, fall into the snare of Satan. The plunderers rob them of their land and their homes and their property and the products of their labor. The Israelites had to make dens in which to hide their substance in order to eat. At the present time the people have had to provide hiding places for their little savings, and the ruling factors seek out their hiding place and take away their substance. The Israelites cried out because of their suffering, but how many of them looked confidently to Jehovah God? At the present time the peoples of earth cry out because of their suffering, but comparatively few look with confidence to Jehovah God and his King. The faithful remnant are the recipients of the truth in order that they might be permitted to go on with confidence in serving Jehovah and in assisting those who have turned their hearts toward God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> The roving enemy did not come into the land of Israel merely to feed themselves, but they came for the purpose of working complete destruction upon the Israelites. They brought with them their animals and their tents and set about to consume everything that the Israelites had, and then to have what they brought with them for their own use. “For they came up with their cattle, and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.” (Judg. 6:5) They compelled the Israelites to feed not only the sheiks, but all their servants and fighting men and all of their animals and all of their hangers-on, and thus they laid upon the Israelites heavy burdens of overhead expense. How like the present-day financial, political and ecclesiastical job-holders, all of whom insist on having their fat salaries regardless of the burdens that must be borne by those who produce the wealth of the land. The great burden of taxation is constantly increased for the purpose of operating useless schemes of government, and this has brought the people into poverty and distress. In addition to the administrative officials, and a very great multitude of assistants that must be supported in luxury, there is the commercial element holding great amounts of watered stocks and bonds for which they demand and receive usury and large dividends, which must be paid by the products of those who have labored. These parasites, together with their families, family servants, and hangers-on, must be fed at the public trough. The tidings that the day of reckoning is near at hand is indeed good news, and God’s faithful ones delight to exclaim, as he caused to be written long ago: ‘Thou shalt destroy them that destroy the earth. ’—Rev. 11:18.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3"><sup>21</sup> It was a sorry day for the Israelites when the enemy came up against them, even as it is now a sorry day throughout the earth for those who must ‘eat their bread in the sweat of their face’. “And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the Lord.” (Judg. 6:6) It needs no proof, as it is apparent to all, that the common people of every nation today are greatly impoverished because of the great oppressive crowd that represents the Devil, and in all the earth they are crying out because of this oppression. That description of the Israelites exactly fits the state in which the people rind themselves today throughout the earth. The Israelites cried out; and many today cry out because of their oppression and suffering, but few are they who hear the Word of God, learn the real cause of suffering, come near to his name and seek to do his will. The Devil has led the people into his snare in order to induce them to curse God, whereas in truth and in fact the Devil himself is to blame for the great suffering of humankind. (Rev. 12:12) The foolish people now sing hymns written without regard to divine truth, offer up their words of prayer, asking that God will send rain and other material blessings, but this same class wholly disregard what God's Word has said to them as to the cause of these troubles and what is his remedy. The Israelites called for God’s help, and Jehovah responded: “I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face.” (Hos. 5:15) At the same time the Israelites were crying to God they raised a great hue and cry against Gideon because he had destroyed the altar of Baal.—Judg. 6: 25-32.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>22</sup> It is even so today. Many people are crying out unto God by the words of their mouth, and are asking for material help, and yet they join in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, who have exposed the Devil and devil worship and pointed out to the people that the Devil is responsible for their troubles, and that their only hope of relief is through the kingdom of God, and that this relief will come to them by and through Jehovah’s great Vindicator, Christ Jesus, and in him alone they will find hope.—Matt. 12: 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> Other scriptures show that in the nation of Israel the masses had turned to Baal worship but that there was a remnant faithful and true to their covenant with Jehovah. The faithful ones would cry unto Jehovah in sincerity, while the other Israelites would be moved to cry out entirely for a selfish reason. “And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord because of the Midianites, that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage.” (Judg. 6:7,8) Undoubtedly God sent his prophet because some of the Israelites remained faithful to him and did not bow their knee to Baal. It is quite certain that Gideon was one of the faithful remnant of Israel, otherwise Jehovah would not have given him opportunity of special service. That unnamed prophet whom Jehovah directed to speak to Israel in God’s name must have been one of the faithful remnant. It was probably in the seventh year of their oppression that this prophet delivered the message of repentance and reformation. What that prophet of God did and said appears to foreshadow the work of the Elijah period of God’s people from 1878 to 1918. The Elijah work done within the borders of “Christendom” afforded an opiportunity for those of “Christendom” who were honest and sincere to separate themselves from the devil worship and service and turn wholly to the service of Jehovah and his King. It is therefore seen that the work from 1878 to 1918 was a work of preparing the way before Jehovah and preparing a people to receive the King when he should come to the temple.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>24</sup> By the mouth of his prophet Jehovah forcibly reminded the Israelites that, not any creature had brought them out of Egypt, but Jehovah God had brought them out of Egyptian bondage and had relieved them of their oppressors, and that they had not kept this in mind and had not obeyed Jehovah God. “And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave (you their land: and I said unto you, I am the Lord your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. ’ ’— Judg. 6:9,10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>23</sup> The conditions existing in Israel exactly foreshadow the conditions in which the so-called “Christian world” or “Christendom” finds itself today. Even professed Christians well know from the Scriptures that Jehovah rebuked the devil worshipers by -delivering his chosen people from Egypt. “Christendom” even claims that God delivered them from “heathendom”, and yet these same ones continue to worship that which is in opposition to Jehovah God, hence devil worship. All persons who have agreed to do the will of God know that he has spoken to them through Jesus Christ and the apostles and that these faithful and true witnesses testified that the Word of God is the truth and must be their proper guide. In the face of all of this evidence millions of persons in “Christendom” continue to fear men and to walk according to the teachings of men, and the result is that they have fallen into the snare of Satan, which the Devil has set for them. (Prov. 29:25) The witness work done by God’s people from 1878 to 1918 and which was foreshadowed by that of Elijah the prophet, and of the prophet John the Baptist, was a preparatory work foreshadowed also by the prophet whom Jehovah sent to the Israelites in Gideon’s time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Many persons who heard the message of warning and reformation during that period of time did turn away from organized “Christendom”, while many more have remained within the confines of “Christendom” utterly disregarding the Word of God. Many of those who were turned away from ‘ ‘ organized Christianity ’ ’, so called, came away in a half-hearted manner and have continued to fear men, and hence they have feared devils or false gods. Had the professed Christians trusted wholly in the Lord God and, as directed by God’s Word, disregarded the teachings of men, they would have kept themselves out of Satan’s snare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE ANGEL</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>20</sup> Following the delivery of the message to the Israelites by his prophet Jehovah sent his angel, not to the Israelites, but to Gideon, because Gideon was of the faithful remnant: “And there came an angel of the Lord, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. ”—Judg. 6:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>27</sup> This exactly corresponds to the coming of Jehovah’s great Angel or Messenger of the covenant to the temple in 1918, coming as he did at the conclusion of the preparatory work which preceded, and at the time of his coming he was accompanied by his host of holy angels. (Mal. 3:1; Matt. 25:31) Jehovah, by sending his angel to Gideon, there marked the beginning of the preparation for the execution of his judgment or vengeance against the Midianites and others who constituted Satan’s seed on the earth. That corresponds exactly with 1918, which marks the time when, as it is written, “thy wrath is come” against the enemy, and the beginning of preparation for the execution of judgment or the vengeance of our God against Satan and his horde for the purpose of vindicating God’s name. (Rev. 11: IS) It marks the beginning of the time when God gathers unto himstlf his faithful ones at the temple: “For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.” (Isa. 63:4) The great Vindicator appeared at the temple to deal with those whom he would associate with himself in the vindication of Jehovah’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>28</sup> Joash was the father of Gideon. The name Joash means “Jehovah-fired”, and suggests that Jehovah is a consuming fire against the enemies. (Deut. 4:24; Zeph. 3:8; Mal. 3:2; Heb. 12:29) Joash was a son of Abiezer, whose name means “father of help”, and who was a son of Manasseh, whose name means “causing to forget (afflictions) ” and who was Joseph’s firstborn son. The name Abiezrite points to Jehovah as the helper. (Pss. 121:1,2; 124:8; 146:5) It is exceedingly happifying to note how Jehovah God arranged the small details in the prophetic drama for the aid of his faithful ones in these latter days. These things greatly comfort the remnant; manifestly that is why Jehovah permits them to see and understand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>29</sup> Joash had built an altar to Baal, and beside it a “grove”, or wooden image, in utter violation and disregard of the Word of God, and thus Joash had marred his own good name. The fact that the divine record names Joash and his son Gideon at this point discloses these two pertinent facts, to wit: (1) That the father of the Greater Gideon, Christ Jesus, is Jehovah God; and (2) that the earthly fathers of the remnant now on earth, who are sons of God and hence a part of the Greater Gideon, were Baal (or Devil) worshipers, even though prominent in the affairs of “Christendom” and professing to be Christians. Thus we see that Joash at this point played two parts in the prophetic drama. Subsequently Joash is found supporting the side of his son Gideon and arguing against Baal and against those who supported Baal, and that further supports the conclusion that Joash pictured Jehovah God. (See verses 30,31.) It must not be concluded that because a creature plays a part in a prophetic drama representing Jehovah God he necessarily is at all times on God’s side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>30</sup> Gideon was of the same tribe as Elisha. (1 Ki. 19:16) Gideon’s name means “tree feller”, that is, “warrior who throws down living creatures pictured by trees.” In this he represented Christ Jesus, the Vindicator of Jehovah, who wars against and throws down the creatures that oppose Jehovah God and reproach his holy name. The remnant appears in this part of the Gideon picture by reason of being in Christ Jesus. The Greater Gideon appeared at the temple of Jehovah in 1918 for judgment and the execution thereof, and this work will culminate in the destruction of Satan and his organization, and the faithful followers of Christ Jesus will be associated with him therein. God’s prophet Isaiah surely has reference to the Greater Gideon (the “tree feller” or warrior) in the day of God’s vengeance when he says: “And the Lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him, according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.” (Isa. 10:26,33) “How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!” (Isa. 14:12) At the hand of the Greater Gideon Satan’s organization shall become a desolation. “How is the hammer [Satan’s tool] of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!” (Jer. 50:23) “All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.”—Ps. 75:10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>31</sup> When the angel of the Lord went to visit Gideon he sat under an oak tree, and near by was Gideon “beating out wheat”. (Z?.P.) Thus the time or season of the year is fixed, and corresponds to the time of year when Boaz redeemed Naomi and bought Ruth for his wife. (Ruth 2:23; 3:1,2) Gideon’s beating out the grain in the threshing time suggests the action that is to be taken against the enemy by Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah sends forth as his instrument to beat Satan’s organization to pieces. “Behold, I will make [for] thee [those faithful to Jehovah] a new sharp threshing instrument [sledge, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Roth.]</span><span class="font3"> having teeth [to cut and tear] : thou shalt thresh the mountains [that is, the divisions of Satan’s organization], and beat them small, and shalt make the hills [highest places thereof] as chaff. Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord [Jehovah, who made Christ Jesus to be the threshing instrument], and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.” —Isa. 41:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>32</sup> To those who are with Christ Jesus in the war against the enemy (Rev. 17:14) Jehovah says: “Arise, and thresh, 0 daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. ’ ’—Mic. 4:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>33</sup> Gideon had to thresh the grain in secret at the winepress. The time for treading grapes had not come. But the fact that Gideon was threshing ‘ ‘ in the winepress” (R.V.) suggests that it was the time for the enemy to be crushed, foreshadowing the due time when Satan and his organization will bo crushed in Jehovah’s great winepress. To prevent the Midianites from stealing his food Gideon was working in secret and hiding the food. That corresponded to the time when Satan was cast out of heaven and began the persecution of God’s remnant on earth and when God’s organization, pictured by his woman, “fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God. ’ ’ (Rev. 12:6,14) The angel of the Lord appeared in human organism, and when he approached Gideon he was not recognized as Jehovah’s messenger: “And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.” (Judg. 6:12) Gideon and all the remnant of Israel were then in fear, because the enemy had come up to take away their substance. Correspondingly about 1919 the followers of Christ Jesus on earth were going about the land in quietness because of fear that the enemy might attack them. It was in that year that a convention of consecrated ones assembled at Cedar Point, Ohio, and there it was made known to them, by the grace of the Lord, that the work done by the fearless Elisha foreshadowed work yet to be done on the earth, and that these faithful ones must go forward in a fearless manner and do the work that God had put in their hands and do it to his glory. It now appears certain that Jehovah through the Lord Jesus directed the publication at that time in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> of the articles “Blessed Are the Fearless”.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>34</sup> The fact that the angel appeared to and addressed Gideon is proof that Gideon was of the remnant of Israel and that he had refused to bow down to Baal, lie was faithful to God, and hence God chose him for a certain work. For the same reason Jehu was chosen to do a work of execution. (1 Ki. 19:16) Gideon had previously shown himself to be against the Midianites. Likewise in 1919 those who were at that time trusting in Christ Jesus, and who formed by his appointment the “faithful and wise servant” class, had previously done valiant service in the name of the Lord and were ready and willing to go forward at any time and anywhere when they were certain of the will of God concerning them. Gideon at this point of the dramatic picture more particularly represents the faithful remnant, for the reason that they, and not Christ Jesus, needed to be assured that Jehovah was with them. To Gideon the angel said: “The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.” And now the faithful ones on earth gathered unto the Lord have from him this message: “I am with you, saith Jehovah.” (Hag. 1:13; 2:4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.)</span><span class="font3"> These are men of valor by reason of being with Christ Jesus and marching under his leadership.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>35</sup> The response of Gideon to the angel shows that he had a desire for the vindication of Jehovah’s name but he desired further evidence from the Lord that he might be sure to go in the right way: “And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? but now the Lord hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. ’ ’—Judg. 6:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>36</sup> The consecrated assembled at Cedar Point in 1919 were uncertain as to what, was in store for them and what they should do, but with the faint hope that there was something to do. That was just at the turning point of the Elijah to the Elisha work. Those there assembled were like Elisha when he stood by the waters of the Jordan and cried out: “Where is the Lord God of Elijah?” (2 Ki. 2:14) The words of Gideon addressed to the angel showed that he there pictured those of the consecrated whose heart devotion was and is wholly to Jehovah. These faithful ones did not then understand God’s purpose as they now understand it. At that time they did not see that Jehovah had permitted Satan and his organization to remain until his due time to manifest his power against the enemy and until he first had caused his own mighty name to be declared in all the earth. (Ex. 9:16) It was some time after 1919 that they received such knowledge. As Gideon appeared to be discouraged, so the consecrated in 1919 felt that God was angry with them, but they did not understand just why. (Isa. 12:1) Now the perilous days have come and the battle of the great day of God Almighty draws near, and Jehovah permits his people to look back over the way he has led and see some of the marvelous provisions he has made for them. They can see now how he used them to fulfil prophetic pictures, and this strengthens their hope.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>37</sup> Jehovah’s vindicator, the Greater Gideon, had taken his place in the temple of God, and upon him God looks with approval and delight: “And the Lord looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shaft save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?” (Judg. 6:14) Both Christ Jesus and the remnant are here pictured. Gideon represented particularly the mighty Officer of Jehovah, Christ Jesus; and as to the remnant, Gideon’s natural weakness pictured that these are not strong in themselves, but because of their faith and devotion to Jehovah they are “strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might”. (Eph. 6:10) God’s time for action had arrived and he said to Gideon: “Go in this thy might.” The time had arrived to begin preparations for the great battle that was to follow. This foreshadows that the time had arrived for the beginning of preparation for the battle of Armageddon and that those devoted to Jehovah receive the command to go forth in the strength of the Lord and declare the day of the vengeance of our God. This they began to do after 1922. They have appreciated the fact that they are sent forth by the Lord and in his strength. Gideon was not one self-appointed or self-commissioned to go, nor was he commissioned by men. Likewise Christ Jesus took not this honor to himself, but Jehovah God bestowed the honor upon him and appointed him to the high position of Vindicator. (Heb. 5: 4) None of those in the Lord’s organization can be self-appointed. They are there by the grace of God. It required some time after 1919 for the consecrated to get their bearings and to get into the swing of the work which the Lord had appointed them to do. In 1922 there was again an assembly of these faithful ones at Cedar Point, and then they learned that the Lord Jesus was at the temple of Jehovah, and in the language of Isaiah the Lord again propounded the question: “Who will go for us?” And the faithful in response cried out with joy: “Here am I; send me.” And the Lord said, “Go.”—Isa. 6:8,9.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>88</sup>Now in this day Jehovah’s witnesses well know that they are not sent forth by man nor has any man or men the right or authority to commission them to preach the message of God's kingdom, and for this reason they do not ask or apply for human authorization. They have heard the command of the Lord, and they go in obedience to that commandment. Like the apostles they say: ‘We should serve God and not men.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>89</sup> Gideon did not think too highly of himself, and this is shown by the words addressed to the angel: “Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor [the poorest, R.V.] in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.” (Judg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">6:15) </span><span class="font3">Gideon had brothers, but he counted himself as the least among these. (Judg. 8:18,19) Before him there had been no judge of Israel from the tribe of Manasseh. Six other judges had preceded Gideon as judges of Israel, and now he was to be the seventh. Gideon, thus exhibiting meekness and lowliness of heart, again pictures the Lord Jesus Christ and those who are his true and faithful followers, aud this harmonizes with the inspired words written in the Scriptures: “But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence. ” (1 Cor. 1:27-29) Any man who thinks too highly of himself or regards himself as important in God’s organization never stands the test that comes upon him. He must fully appreciate the fact that he goes forth in the strength of the Lord and that in his own strength he can do nothing. It is by the grace of God and in the strength of Christ Jesus that Jehovah’s witnesses now can accomplish God’s purpose toward them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>38</sup> Being an obscure man and appreciating the difficulty of his obtaining followers in Israel that would go into the war with him, Gideon exhibited doubt and hesitated to attempt the work of delivering Israel. He knew that he would have a real fight and that his supporters must be real men. Gideon did not realize at the time that it was Jehovah’s angel that was speaking with him, and it certainly appears that within himself he felt wholly inadequate to undertake the deliverance of Israel from the enemy. “And the Lord said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.” (Judg. 6:16) Gideon needed faith and strength, and in this he pictured God’s faithful remnant, who trust not in themselves but who trust in the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>39</sup> God there gave assurance to Gideon that Gideon was in the favor of Jehovah, and likewise now he gives assurance to his people in Christ Jesus that by his grace they may accomplish the work which the Lord has committed into their hands. Jehovah had to strengthen the faith of Moses and to prepare him for his work by giving him like assurance. (Ex. 3:12) Call to mind now the work of God’s people from 1919 to 1922 and their attitude during that period of time. They had to be repeatedly assured that the Lord God would be with them to do the work foreshadowed by Elisha, and the Lord God furnished this assurance. During that period of time there was much ‘prophesying’ or preaching, and such was needful to strengthen the faith of God’s people and to get them ready to go into the field and to begin the active campaign. This stirring up of their pure minds was after the manner of Ezekiel’s prophesying to the valley of dry bones before God’s spirit was infused into those bones. (Ezek. 37:1-10) The period of time from 1919 to 1922 was largely occupied in the study of God’s Word and the organization preparatory for the work that has followed since.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>42</sup> Gideon had no desire to be guided by the mere words of man, and in this he showed that he represented those of the Lord’s children who trust in the Lord and who lean not to their own understanding. Not knowing that he -was addressing the angel, but thinking he was addressing a man, Gideon asked for more proof: “And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.”—Judg. 6:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>43</sup> It had probably percolated into Gideon’s mind that this man represented the Lord, but he wanted the proof that the message was from Jehovah. By 1922 the faithful ones marching toward the kingdom realized that in times past they had relied too much on a man. They had been told that they must not publish anything except what that man had previously written and published, and, wanting to be obedient, they had made little progress. But by the time of the 1922 assembly above mentioned the faithful ones were awakened to the fact that the word of a man who had died was not for them a sufficient guide and now they must take themselves more particularly to the Woid of God and follow that. They wanted to find a sign or proof. In this they were foreshadowed in the course which Gideon took. That does not mean that they were showing a feigned humility by refusing service that had been put right in their hands, but they wanted to be sure that they were going as the Lord had directed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>44</sup> Gideon would apply a test, that he might be further assured, and hence he addressed the messenger who sat under the tree before him: “Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.”—Judg. 6:18,19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>45</sup> Gideon in thus addressing the messenger was asking an act of friendship on the part of his visitor that he might be sure he was being directed in the right way. Gideon opened the door by making ready a meal, and in preparing that meal considerable time was required. This reminds us of the time when Jesus appeared at the temple and addressed his faithful ones: “Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.” (Rev. 3:20) Jesus then gave the signal, and his faithful followers awakened and busied themselves and opened the door and vigorous activity began.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>46</sup> Having prepared a meal Gideon brought his gift unto the waiting messenger: “And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so.” (Judg. 6:20) The angel chose an unused rock and directed Gideon to place the food there, and thus the angel of the Lord indicated that the offering of the remnant, whom Gideon here represented, must be clean and must come through a channel approved of the Lord, that is to say, through God’s organization and in his appointed way. This suggests that the work the Lord is doing in the earth by his witnesses, foreshadowed by Elisha, is being done according to his will and every one who is really devoted to the Lord is anxious to follow organization instructions or directions. Those who are not willing thus to do give strong evidence that they are not of the temple class.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>*</sup> It pleases Jehovah God for his servants to convince themselves from his Word that they are in the right way: “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” (1 Thess. 5:21) Gideon was permitted the time necessary to prepare his gift that he might convince himself that he was going in the right way, and now the Lord would give him the full assurance: “Then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight.”—Judg. 6:21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>48</sup> Here was the conclusive and overwhelming proof that this messenger had been sent by Jehovah God. Gideon had not looked for such a marked evidence, but now he was convinced that Jehovah had visited his people and that he would deliver them in due time, and in his own good way. Likewise, God’s people occupied the period of time from 1919 to 1922 in preparing and bringing forth their gifts of unselfish devotion and service to the Lord, searching the Scriptures that they might be sure that they were taking the right course. Then in 1922 they received greater evidence than they had expected. The Lord brought them to a knowledge and understanding that Christ Jesus was at the temple and that he had given them a ‘.‘Thus saith Jehovah” that God had visited his people and was gathering them unto himself for the specific purpose of advertising the King and his kingdom and magnifying the name of Jehovah. The Lord showed his approval of his people at that time by pouring out his spirit upon them and sending them forth in the joy of the Lord to participate in the vindication of his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>49</sup> Gideon learned that he had been entertaining the angel of the Lord, and that filled him with fear: “And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord, Gideon said, Alas, 0 Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face.” (Judg. 6:22) Isaiah records his vision of the Lord at his temple, and when he had the vision he cried out with fear that he would die, for, as he said, “mine eyes have seen the King: the Lord of hosts.” (Isa. 6:5) Since 1922 God’s faithful remnant have learned and more fully appreciated what is the proper fear of Jehovah. They have seen that the Lord Jesus Christ is at the temple of Jehovah God, and God’s purposes have been revealed to them as never before revealed to men on earth. They see the Almighty and his forces moving on to Armageddon, and have learned that they are no longer to fear men or devils, but that their fear should be of Jehovah. “Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.” (Isa. 8:13) The faithful remnant are not eyeservants nor man-pleasers, but with fear and trembling and with singleness of motive and heart devotion they proceed with diligence to do the work committed to their hands.—Col. 3: 22, 23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3"><sup>50</sup> God was preparing Gideon for a great work, which work lay just before him. That experience of Gideon up to the point here described was a prophetic picture foreshadowing God’s people under Christ being prepared for the day of battle. Now it seems to please the Lord to reveal to his faithful remnant the meaning of the Gideon prophetic drama. Now the remnant see that long centuries ago the Almighty God purposed to vindicate his name, reputation and fame by the execution of his judgment upon his defamers, and to do so at the greatest battle of all time. It pleased him to make a picture, and to record the same, that the remnant on earth at the end of the world, by gaining a knowledge and understanding thereof, might have full assurance of faith in him and in his King, to the end that they might be comforted while patiently pursuing their duties of service amidst a wicked and perverse generation. The reality is always greater than the picture. In the prophetic picture Jehovah sent his angel to Gideon that Gideon might be prepared and strengthened for the fight. Now just preceding the battle of the great day of God Almighty he sends his mighty Angel and Executioner, Christ Jesus, together with his host of holy angels, to fulfil that prophetic picture made long ago. Before Jehovah performs this mighty act at Armageddon he reveals to his faithful remnant that which is about to come to pass, in order that they might be strengthened in the Lord and in the power of his might. The testimony of Jesus Christ now committed to the remnant must be delivered, and to do so means a fight, and the angels of the Lord are sent forth to protect the remnant while preparation for the great battle proceeds. The remnant move forward with fear and trembling lest they should fail to avail themselves of every opportunity for understanding God’s purposes and hence fail to perform the service committed to them. It is the battle of Jehovah that is approaching, and Jehovah is the sanctuary of his people. It behooves the anointed, therefore, to carefully consider the Gideon picture as it continues to unfold to their view. Is the great fight near?</span></p></li></ul>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6"><a name="bookmark5"></a>&quot;PHYSICIANS OF NO VALUE”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8">I</span><span class="font3">T IS true that honesty, integrity, morality and chastity should be followed by all honest persons; but that of itself cannot save anyone. In this the clergy have misled the people. After a man has done all he can, he cannot save himself. The clergy have not told the people that there is no other way under heaven whereby man can be saved except by faith in the great ransom sacrifice and by full obedience to God’s Word. On the contrary, they have told the people that if they would join the church and support it, and refrain from stealing, breaking Sunday laws, and like crimes and misdemeanors, such alone would bring them eternal blessings. They have further taught and yet teach that the clergy alone can know the proper course to take, and are therefore the only ones that are competent to interpret the Scriptures and advise the people. Note how well they were foreshadowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Three men who came as comforters to the greatly afflicted Job he called “physicians of no value”. They burdened him with their chatter. One of the three “comforters”, Zophar the Naamathite, said to Job: “Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection ? For he know-cth vain men: he secth wickedness also: will he not then consider it ? For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass’s co2. If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; if iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear.”—Job 11: 7,11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are sarcasm and expressed disgust in the reply of Job, even as other honest men have expressed themselves concerning the bombastic speech of the clergy. “And Job answered and said, No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who callcth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.” (Job 12:1-4) Then, directing his words to the three frauds who had come with a pretense of giving him aid and comfort, Job said: “What ye know, the same do I know also; I am not inferior unto you. Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians [D.D.’s] of no value. 0 that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom. Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? Will ye accept his person ? will ye contend for God ? Is it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him ?”—Job 13: 2-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here, in their attempt to cause Job to denounce God, appears conclusive proof that the three professed friends of Job did not represent God, but represented the Devil. On at least two occasions God had said of Job that he was “a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil”. (Job 1: 8; 2: 3) It was while in this condition before God that calamities had come upon Job. In the face of God’s plain declaration that Job was upright, these three frauds repeatedly denoi’nced Job as a willfully wicked man. But now Job tells them that they had come as physicians to heal and comfort him, but that they were, instead, forgers of lies and physicians (doctors of divinity, D.D.’s) of no value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The purpose of Satan was to have these three men continue to torment Job with their speech, expecting that thereby he could compel Job to curse God. Amidst the fiery darts that continued to fall from their contaminated lips and strike against him, Job in his integrity cried out: “Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand? Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him; but I will maintain mine own ways [not the ways of the clergy] before him.” (Job 13:14,15) Then Job further shows his faith in God and his belief that God would make provision for his salvation. He said: “He also shall be my salvation; for an hypocrite shall not come before him. Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. Behold now, I have ordered my cause: </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font3">know that I shall be justified. Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.”—Job 13:16-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil’s organization, and particularly the “shining lights” therein, hold forth the doctrine that they are more holy than others, and that if other men would become like unto them they could save themselves. This very same thing appears in the debate between Job and the three frauds. Job points out to them that all men are born alike, and that none are pure, even if they do everything within their power to be pure. Therefore these three men were not competent to judge him. For the same reason the clergy are not competent to judge the people. “Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee? Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean ? not one. ’ ’—Job 14:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil’s organization on earth has for centuries taught the people the God-dishonoring doctrine of eternal torment. They have told the people that every man has an “undieable” soul; that God has prepared </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">great lake of fire and brimstone, which they call hell; that he will consign all the wicked to that place, where they w’ill suffer forever, without any hope of relief. God used Job to utter a prophecy in utter contradiction of these false teachings of the clergy and to show that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font3"> (Hebrew), called “hell”, or the grave, is not a place of conscious torment, and further to prophesy concerning the resurrection of man. ‘ ‘ 0 that thou wouldest hide me in the grave [s7;coZ], that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.”—Job 14:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This statement of Job was in direct contradiction of Satan’s first lie. (Gen. 3: 4, 5) Had every man an immortal soul, then it could not die; nor could it be awakened out of death and live again. Satan was angry because Job uttered this prophecy of truth concerning the resurrection of the dead, and he moved his agent, Eliphaz, to speak in response to Job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good? Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty. Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; yea, thine own lips testify against thee. Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills? Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself? What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us? With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.”—Job 15:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That speech is like unto the argument that the clergy have long used and continue to use against the humble and honest men who seek to learn and to express the truth of God’s Word. They claim that the clergy class is the repository of all wisdom; that the “grayheaded” sages, whom they call “fathers” in the church, are the only ones that should attempt to tell of a future life. They even go to the point of persecuting the humble men and women who try to study and publish the Word of God, which is the truth. Many a member of a church has been told by his pastor: ‘You had better not read any books or study for yourself. Leave all that to us preachers. We are the guardians of your soul, and your only teachers.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then Eliphaz, representing the enemy, makes another attempt to cause Job to turn away from God by inducing him to believe that God would have no confidence in him. He goes to the extent of saying that God has no confidence in the holy angels of heaven, and therefore would not have any confidence in filthy man, even though he sought God in God's appointed way. At the same time Eliphaz arrogates to himself all the wisdom from above, exactly as the clergy do today. “Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight: how much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water? I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare; which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it: unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.’’—Job 15:15-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then Eliphaz proceeds to remind Job that he is wicked and that he must suffer the fate of the wicked. Job was not moved from his position of integrity by the bombastic words of his critics. “Then Job answered and said, I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are ye all. Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answer-est? I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief. Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged; and though I forbear, what am I eased ? But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.’’—Job 16:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In their regular turn Eliphaz, Bildad and Zophar continued to reproach Job and to remind him that God had visited him with these great calamities because of his willful wickedness. Throughout the debate those three men repeatedly attempted to show Job that he will never be justified before God. Amidst it all Job insisted that his suffering was not because of his personal wickedness. He knew that he loved God and had done his best to serve him so far as he knew. He maintained his integrity in holding fast faith in God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this part of the prophetic picture two things are emphasized, to wit: (1) That the three men who professed to be friends of Job represent the organization of Satan the enemy, and that their claim to represent God always corresponds to that of the members of the Devil’s organization who claim to represent God, and that these all bring reproaches upon God; and (2) that amidst all the misrepresentation of God throughout the ages God has brought some honest men through the warfare and enabled them to maintain their confidence and faith in him. Let every person of fair mind new consider how the facts fit the picture, and what opportunity is held forth to suffering humanity by the doctrines of the ecclesiastical systems. That all humankind, like Job, is full of putrid sores, no man can honestly attempt to gainsay. What, then, is contained in the doctrines of the ecclesiastical teachers that could comfort man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Catholic wing says: ‘If you join our church and follow the advice of the fathers of our church, when you die you will go to heaven. Otherwise you will go to purgatory; and if we are not able to get you out upon sufficient consideration, then you will spend eternity roasting in fire and brimstone.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Protestant wing says: ‘We represent God; and if you would be saved, you must join our church and follow the advice of our teachers or fathers of the church: otherwise you will spend your eternity in torment. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Other branches of the Devil’s organization, the purpose of which is to turn men away from God, teach men that there is no means of salvation by faith and obedience, but that man is a creature of evolution and will continue by his own efforts to increase in righteousness until he gets his great desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These ecclesiastical leaders claim to be the sole interpreters of the Scriptures; and in putting forth their false doctrines they are supported by the commercial and political elements of the world. Satan is the god thereof. There is no part of the so-called “organized Christianity” that tells the people anything about God’s purpose of redemption through the blood of Christ, resurrection from death, and the giving of eternal life to the obedient ones on earth. The doctrines held forth by these ecclesiastical systems, and concurred in by their allies, not only fail to bring consolation to suffering humanity but tend to drive and do drive multitudes of people away from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The ecclesiastical systems speak of Jesus and call him the Redeemer, but their words are merely words of mockery, even as were the words of the three supposed friends of Job. The most that is said concerning Christ Jesus is that it is well to study his life as an example, and that his life was given to men for an example that men might attain unto a high character that would warrant their own salvation. A great majority of these ecclesiastical leaders deny that Jesus was any more than an ordinary, sinful man. They openly deny the value of his sacrifice and repudiate the saving power of his blood. Today there is no ecclesiastical system under the sun that is teaching that the blood of Jesus was shed to provide the purchase price of man from death; that all men are born sinners, and that only through the blood of Christ can salvation come; and that in due time God will grant life to the obedient men on earth by resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All these religious systems pose as God’s representatives, but, in fact, are members of Satan’s organization and are therefore frauds and “forgers of lies” and doctors of divinity with no value. All the systems of “Christendom” repudiate the kingdom of God on earth as a means of bringing peace, prosperity, and life, and instead adopt the Devil’s makeshift, the League of Nations, and hail it as the savior of mankind. Amidst it all a few men outside the religious systems maintain their integrity with God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The proof is therefore conclusive that in the picture the three professed friends of Job, who came as “physicians”, foreshadow the visible part of Satan’s organization, otherwise called “Christendom”, acting through its representatives and which Satan uses for the purpose of turning men away from Jehovah God. The speech of the three men, who posed as Job’s friends, did no honor to Jehovah, but rather cast reproach upon his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FAITHFULNESS BRINGS JEHOVAH’S APPROVAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother in Zion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It rejoices my heart to tell you how much we appreciate the privilege of service, to know that we are in this great fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We know the battle is raging between the two kingdoms; the armies are gathering around, and the food that is coming from the Lord’s table at this time will help us to gird on the armor and to sing the praises of Jehovah God and make mention that his name is exalted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Wish I could tell you how much I enjoy the work, but words cannot express the joy we receive in telling the message of the kingdom to the poor people. We can say the joy of the .Lord is our strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When we go into the camp of the enemy with the PTM your fearlessness to proclaim the message gives us courage to press the battle to the gate. We know the battle is the Lord’s, and his arm is not shortened, but has come with myriads of angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brother Rutherford, I try to bear in mind that our faithfulness to Jehovah in keeping his commandments calls forth his delight and approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">My prayer for you and all the dear brethren is that we may take a firm stand as did the three Hebrews, determined to do the Lord’s will at any cost. May the Lord continue to bless you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With much love, in which Brother Draper joins,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At the campaign in Plainfield and Maplewood, Sunday, October 14, 212 workers in the New Jersey division assembled for service at 8: 00 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Before being dispatched to our respective duties in the field it was our privilege to listen to the reading of Part 2 of the article ‘ ‘ The Crucible ’ ’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It would be difficult to properly express the feeling of joy and thankfulness of those present as we listened to those words of comfort and encouragement. In such a setting it was really thrilling. A few hours later 12 were imprisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jehovah’s witnesses of the New Jersey division assure you that by the Lord’s assisting grace they will continue to press the battle to the gate. We are truly thankful for the many privileges of service, and we appreciate more and moie that our giatitude to the Lord for all the many blessings bestowed upon us is best expressed by continuing faithful in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They send their love, and wish you to know that they are grateful for the legal services that the Lord lias so graciously provided in the many skirmishes with the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Enclosed is copy of statement regarding an incident that occurred Sunday evening that will probably interest you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">May Jehovah continue to strengthen you as you endeavor to honor and magnify his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With best wishes and regards,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Your brother in his service,</span></p>
