<p><span class="font4">THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH is the only true God, is from everlasting to everlasting, the Maker of heaven and earth and the Giver of life to his creatures; that the Logos was the beginning of his creation and his active agent in the creation of all things; that the Logos is now the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, clothed with all power in heaven and earth, and the Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT GOD created the earth for man, created perfect man for the earth and placed him upon it; that man wilfully disobeyed God’s law and was sentenced to death; that by reason of Adam’s wrong act all men are born sinners and without the right to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JESUS was made human, and the man Jesus suffered death in order to produce the ransom or redemptive price for all mankind; that God raised up Jesus divine and exalted him to heaven above every creature and above every name and clothed him with all power and authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT JEHOVAH'S ORGANIZATION is called Zion, and that Christ Jesus is the Chief Officer thereof and is the rightful King of the world; that the anointed and faithful followers of Christ Jesus are children of Zion, members of Jehovah’s organization, and are his witnesses whose duty and privilege it is to testify to the supremacy of Jehovah, declare his purposes toward mankind as expressed in the Bible, and to bear the fruits of the kingdom before all who will hear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE WORLD has ended, and the Lord Jesus Christ has been placed by Jehovah upon his throne of authority, has ousted Satan from heaven and is proceeding to the establishment of God’s kingdom on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THAT THE RELIEF and blessings of the peoples of earth can come only by and through Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ which has now begun; that the Lord’s next great act is the destruction of Satan’s organization and the establishment of righteousness in the earth, and that under the kingdom all those who will obey its righteous laws shall be restored and live on earth forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH’S witnesses assembled in convention at Washington, D.C., May 31 to June 3 inclusive. About twenty thousand interested ones attended, among whom were a large number of Jonadabs who symbolized their consecration by water immersion. The spirit of unity was manifest by all as never before at a like convention. The peak of attendance was reached on Sunday, June 2. Not only did the great audience fill all available space in the auditorium, on every floor, but great crowds were in the parks near by, where voice amplifiers were installed so all could easily hear. The public address on that occasion was broadcast throughout North America and South America, Europe, and many places in Asia and Africa and the islands of the sea. Cable reports from these various countries since disclose a clear reception and much enthusiasm, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font4">space being so limited, a detailed report of the convention will be published in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> magazine Number 413. Those desiring extra copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> publishing the report should write the office at 117 Adams St., Brooklyn, N.

<p><span class="font4">This period of unitedly giving testimony to the name of Jehovah, the Unselfish One, begins Saturday, August 3, and ends Sunday, August 11. During these nine days all those on the side of Jehovah will have a special season of showing forth the same spirit of unselfishness as Jehovah has displayed in giving us his life-giving and life-sustaining fruit, the kingdom</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark10"></a>JOYFUL SONGS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">“TAou </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.”—Ps. 32:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(continuation of habakkuk’s prophecy)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PART 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH will make an end to the wicked and to all wickedness now in the earth, by the exercise of his power. By no other means will the enemy be made to submit. “Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.” (Ps. 66:3) There are, comparatively, only a few people on the earth that believe that Jehovah is all-powerful. They do not know that ‘all power be-longeth unto Jehovah’. (Ps. 62:11) At Armageddon all will be forced to know of his unlimited power. Necessarily the vindication of Jehovah’s name involves an exhibition of unlimited power; and thus he will teach all creation that he is the Most High, besides whom there is none. “Behold, God exalteth by his power; who teacheth like him?” (Job 36:22) Salvation is given to man, not because of the inherent good qualities of man, but Jehovah has provided salvation for man for His own name’s sake, “that he might make his mighty power to be known.” (Ps. 106:8) Satan matches his power against that of Jehovah, and therefore Satan and all of his followers must be destroyed. Armageddon, which is the battle of the great day of God Almighty,, is fixed and will accomplish Satan’s destruction and the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Let all those who have foolishly contended that Armageddon will be a mild affair, and all those who have likewise held that it will be merely a conflict between the masses of men against the classes, and all those who have ignorantly claimed that Armageddon is already past, take note of what Jehovah, by the mouth of his prophet Habakkuk, has said. The pause at this point in the prophecy is exceedingly appropriate that meditation may be given to those things which we have learned. Also in considering what follows in the prophecy it is appropriate that the musicians now put on the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">forte: ‘</span><span class="font5"> make the song loud and strong.’ Let all who love Jehovah now loudly sing: “0 God, who is like unto thee!” (Ps. 71:19) “Among the gods there is none like unto thee, 0 Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works. All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, 0 Lord; and shall glorify thy name. For thou art great, and doest wondrous things; thou art God alone. ’ ’—Ps. 86: 8-10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>2</sup> Habakkuk had a vision of the universal war and of the exhibition of Jehovah’s great power, and, after the brief pause, with greater force he sang: “Thon didst cleave the earth with rivers.” (Ilab. 3:9) “Into rivers thou splittest the earth.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser) </span><span class="font5">“With rivers thou dost cleave open the land.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Has Jehovah the ability to do these things literally? The “wiseacres” of this world will answer, No. The account of the great deluge should teach them better; but they refuse to learn, hence are willingly ignorant. (2 Pet. 3:5) In the past Jehovah God has done such things literally, and at Armageddon he will do them again, even on a far greater scale. “He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he over-turneth the mountains by the roots. He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing. He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.” (Job 28: 9-11) “He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.” (Ps. 78: 15,16) “lie opened the rock, and the waters gushed out: they ran in the dry places like a river.” (Ps. 105:41) “And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.”(Isa. 48:21) These things were written aforetime for the benefit of the remnant, and foreshadowed even greater things that shall shortly come to pass.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>3</sup> In the “last days” of Satan’s wicked reign there has been and is a famine, particularly in “Christendom”, for the hearing of the Word of God, and Jehovah has opened up channels for his Word of truth and caused it to flow as waters on this closed organization amongst men; and thus notice and warning have been served upon Satan’s earthly ruling groups and those under them. Among these are found some people, of good will called “Jonadabs”, and these have been reached by the refreshing waters of truth</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">and thereby have been divided or separated from Satan’s organization. Jehovah’s anointed ones, who during the stress of persecution have stood firmly and faithfully on God’s side, have been privileged to carry some of these waters of truth to the thirsty ones. The worldly-wise, selfish clergy and their cruel and stubborn allies have refused the waters that have been brought to them in peace. Therefore Armageddon is next in order for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘At Armageddon the splitting or cleavage of the literal earth will cause the worldly-wise and their cruel allies to go literally blind and frantic with fear and rage, and those conspirators under Gog that now make war upon Jehovah’s witnesses will then fight among themselves, as did the Midianites and their allies when Gideon gave the alarm. (Judg. 7:22) Such fighting among themselves was also foretold by the circumstances recorded concerning Mount Seir, Moab and Ammon’s attacking the Israelites and then fighting amongst themselves. (2 Chron. 20:22, 23) In the mighty and spectacular conflict at Armageddon the literal earth will be split with rivers flowing out from such cleavages or open places, and the peoples will be divided and split away from one another and will blindly fight one another, and, above all, the armies under Christ will smite the enemy to death, including both the visible and invisible hosts thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>B</sup> Who shall behold the marvelous exhibition of Jehovah’s power at Armageddon ? Says the prophet Ha-bakkuk: “The mountains saw thee, and they trembled; the overflowing of the water passed by; the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high.” (3:10) The lofty and exalted government rulers of earthly institutions will see that it is Jehovah God against whom they have arrayed themselves in battle, and that now their end is come. This conclusion is fully supported by the prophecy of Isaiah 40:5: “And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.<sup>,J</sup> It is at that time that the whole earth shall be filled with a knowledge of the glory (weight, power and name) of the Lord God. (Hab. 2:14) The nation of Israel was symbolically represented by a mountain, and when that nation became unfaithful to God he commanded his prophet to say: ‘ ‘ Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of [unfaithful] Israel, and prophesy against them, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God; . . . Behold I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places. . . . And ye shall know that I am the Lord.” (Ezek. 6:2,3,7) Those prophetic words now apply to unfaithful “Christendom”, which was foreshadowed by unfaithful Israel. The people of the nations will see and shall greatly fear.— Rev. 1:7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>6</sup> Shall the inhabitants of the earth tremble at the manifestation of Jehovah’s power? Habakkuk sang: “And they trembled [and were afraid, ZLV.]”; thus foreshadowing that the rulers of the earth will tremble greatly. The plain meaning here according to the Hebrew is that they twisted, whirled or writhed in pain as a woman in travail. This is supported by the inspired statement of the apostle: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.” (1 Thess. 5:3) It will be far worse with them than when mount Zion travailed and was in pain at the birth of the New Nation. (Isa. 66: 7, 8) The mighty men of the earth who now rule in Satan’s visible organization will not then feel brave and boastful, nor will they think themselves secure, as they now feel they are in their entrenched position. When they come to know that it is the power of Jehovah that is being manifested against all of those who oppose him, they shall shake and tremble with great fear and trepidation. ‘ ‘ For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, Surely in that day [of Gog’s invasion] there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel [‘Christendom’ and all other parts of Satan’s organization]; . . . and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains [high ruling powers] shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. ’ ’—Ezek. 38:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>7</sup> Seeing what soon shall follow, let the faithful remnant now with patience wait upon the Lord and implicitly trust in him, and, instead of being discouraged because of persecution, continue to sing with increased fervor. Habakkuk’s song says: “The overflowing of the water passed by”; “the tempest of waters passed by” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.);</span><span class="font5"> “a downpour of waters hath passed along.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> These different translations help to clarify the matter. Thus is foretold of the overflowing and victorious armies of Jehovah under the leadership of Christ Jesus that flow by and overflow and destroy the enemy. “So shall they fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Jehovah driveth.” (Isa. 59:19, A.ZLV'.) “Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which, as a tempest of hail, and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand. In that day shall the Lord of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate. Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place. ” (Isa. 28: 2, 5, 6,17) “And the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his am, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones. For through the voice of the Lord shall the As-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Syrian [Satan’s world power] be beaten down, which smote with a rod. ’ ’—Isa. 30: 30, 31.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>8</sup> Habakkuk sings: ‘ ‘ The deep uttered his voice, and lifted up his hands on high. ’ ’ The Hebrew word for “deep” here contains the thought of a “roaring” abyss of waters. The picture is one of roaring and high waves, denoting either very high winds or undersea earthquakes causing a tidal wave. The deepest part of the ocean yet ascertained is near the Philippine Islands, and that vicinity is noted for tidal waves and great storms. Such a thing on a far more tremendous scale must come to pass at Armageddon, and such would cause the deepest part of the sea to be greatly disturbed. This would indicate that the people who are most completely alienated from God by reason of the influence of the Devil will at Armageddon be terribly shaken. ‘ ‘ The waters saw thee, 0 God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid; the depths also were troubled. The clouds poured out water; the skies sent out a sound; thine arrows also went abroad.”— Ps. 77:16,17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">’“The ships of Tarshish,” operated by modern Tyre and Zidon, will not then be able to weather such stormy seas. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication,</span><span class="font5"> Book Two, page 52, and authorities there cited.) “Thus saith the Lord God to Tyrus, Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ? Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure. For thus saith the Lord God, When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee [modern Tyre; commercialism], and great waters shall cover thee.” (Ezek. 26:15,18,19) “Thy rowers have brought thee into great waters; the east wind hath broken thee [Tyre; Big Business] in the midst of the seas. Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin. ’ ’ —Ezek. 27: 26, 27.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> The power of Jehovah knows no limitation. “Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.” (Ps. 135:6) In the midst of all that storm, earthquake, trembling of tumult, God’s faithful remnant will be safe, and Jehovah will preserve them from it all. “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.” (Ps. 46:1-3) Such assurance from the Lord brings comfort and hope to the remnant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>11</sup> As Habakkuk had a vision, so he continued a song of the awesome demonstration of Jehovah’s power at Armageddon. ‘ ‘ The sun and moon stood still in their habitation; at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.” (Hab. 3:11) The earth existed for a long period of time before God brought forth the sun to give light by day, and the moon for light at nighttime. (Gen. 1:16) It is within his power to take away the sun and the moon as he may will, and thus deprive the earth of its light in the daytime as well as at the nighttime. That would cause pitch-darkness to envelop the whole earth, both in the eastern and in the western hemisphere, at the same time, and surely then would come to pass and be fulfilled the prophecy, to wit, “I [Jehovah] . . . create darkness.” (Isa. 45: 7) In the time of old God caused Moses to stretch forth his hand toward heaven and there immediately followed thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days, even a darkness which might be felt, but during which darkness God’s chosen people had light. (Ex. 10:21-23) That record foretells the greater darkness that shall come over all the earth at Armageddon. “Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof, shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. ’ ’—Isa. 13: 9-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>12</sup> As that darkness approaches, there will be multitudes assembled “in the valley”, where they will be thrashed to a finish. “Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision. The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.” (Joel 3:14,15) Jehovah’s mighty army will cause the enemy to quake and tremble in the darkness. “The earth shall quake before them [the army of Jehovah]; the heavens shall tremble; the sun and the moon shall be dark, and stars shall withdraw their shining. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.”—Joel 2:10, 31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>13</sup> At Armageddon the forces of Jehovah will not need to depend upon the light of the sun or of the moon or of the stars. At that time Jehovah can, and, it seems certain, will, produce other lights of such brilliancy as will make even the sun seem dark in comparison. Imagine what will be the effect upon the earthly hosts of Satan under such conditions!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>14</sup> In this connection the words of the prayer-song of Habakkuk throw light upon the matter, to wit: “At the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.” (Hab. 3:11) Jehovah’s “bow” there will be fully uncovered (verse 9), and the flying of his arrows from the twanging bow will give light. This same part of the text is rendered by another translator thus: “Sun, moon have stood still on high; like light thine arrows speed along, like brightness is the flash of thy spear.</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">’’(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, at the light of thine arrows as they went, at the shining of thy glittering spear.’’ (A.R.V.) The language of the text so rendered is symbolic of war equipment. Arrows and spear, speeding with glittering light, would suggest shooting lights of fire or flames of fire, such as lightning or liquid fire, and every one of them making a center hit against the enemy organization. Probably the Devil has some knowledge of Jehovah’s making and using liquid fire, and he has put like thoughts into the minds of some of his military men on earth and caused them to produce liquid fire for war purposes. During the World War Britain produced a military machine that would throw liquid fire for a considerable distance and wipe out a company of soldiers. Whatsoever the satanic organization brings forth in the earth will not stand before the onward march of Jehovah’s host. Now Jehovah’s witnesses march forward in the light of Jehovah’s flashing truth, which illuminates them in this dark world. At Armageddon the forces of Christ Jesus, the great Warrior, will be equipped with missiles that will shed light wheresoever they fly, and thus provide light when it is wanted and leave the enemy in darkness at other times. For long centuries Jehovah has held his peace and permitted the enemy to continue to reproach his holy name and to persecute his faithful witnesses, but the time is near when he will act, taking the offensive. He has said to those who love and serve him: ‘Wait ye upon me; for my determination is to rise up to the prey and pour out my indignation, and all of my fierce anger, the fire of my jealousy, upon the earth. ’—Zeph. 3: 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The vision Habakkuk saw concerning Armageddon revealed Jehovah’s victorious and irresistible force marching against the enemy and smiting the enemy upon every side. It so thrilled Habakkuk that he sang, at Habakkuk 3:12: “ Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen [nations, R.V.] in anger.” As the modern Habakkuk, the remnant, by faith see the victorious march of Jehovah they are filled with joy and lift their voices in songs of praise. In this text “the land” signifies the place of the habitation of the enemy, and that wicked organization’s being earthwide means that Jehovah’s “arrows” under Christ will march throughout the entire earth. This was foreshadowed in times past, as stated by the psalmist: “O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness. Selah.” (Ps. 68:7) The meaning of the Hebrew word for “indignation” is as though one foamed at the mouth with great anger. That would indicate fires and burning anger, before which nothing could stand. “Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. The Lord is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him. ’ ’—Nah. 1: 6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>16</sup> With the execution of Jehovah’s indignation at Armageddon no one and no power will be able to stand, and concerning this it is written: “But the Lord is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting King; at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.” (Jer. 10:10) But with the early coming of this terrible visitation upon the enemies of Jehovah let none of the faithful remnant be at all dismayed or even disturbed, but let all who trust fully in Jehovah continue to sing of his power and his loving-kindness. For the comfort of his faithful children Jehovah now says: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast. For, behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.”—Isa. 26: 20, 21.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>17</sup> Here again we are reminded that the battle is not ours, but that it is the fight of Jehovah and he will do the destroying through Christ Jesus. “Thou [Jehovah] didst thresh the nations.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> Now the Devil and his agents, “the beast” and “the false prophet”, gather all the nations against Zion, which is Jehovah’s organization; and for the comfort and strength of the remnant now on earth Jehovah says: “Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion. But they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his counsel; for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor. Arise, and thresh, 0 daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn iron [as though Zion were a treading ox], and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. ” —Ilic. 4:11-13,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>18</sup> The most terrible beating the Devil’s crowd will then receive at the hands of Jehovah’s organization, at the hand of the Lord: “Behold, I will make thee [for thee] a new sharp threshing instrument [sled] having teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the hills as chaff. ’ ’— Isa. 41:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>10</sup> This corresponds with the treading of the winepress of God’s wrath, as described in Revelation 14: 17-20. These texts show that it is the purpose of Jehovah to give terrible punishment to the forces of wickedness and thus make an end of them for ever, and they will never rise up again. (Nah. 1: 9) The meaning of these prophecies is now revealed to those who faithfully serve Jehovah, that they may not faint amidst persecution, nor even slack their hand, but that they may go joyfully on declaring the message of God and his kingdom.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> Jehovah is always consistent, and therefore he could not save and give life to any man that would refuse to trust in him and do his best to maintain his integrity toward God. The boastful challenge which Satan flung into Jehovah’s face was that none of the human race would remain faithful and true to Him when put to the test. Some people will be faithful and true to Jehovah under the most trying circumstances, and in their behalf Jehovah will exercise his power in the great battle. Concerning that salvation Habakkuk’s vision led him to sing: “Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.” (Hab. 3:13) Only because the salvation of the people is related to the honor of Jehovah’s name does he save them. Such as fully trust in Jehovah cry unto him: “Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.” (Ps. 54:1) “Salvation” here does not mean to take the one thus crying away from the earth into heaven, but it means their preservation alive upon the earth in the face of the murderous attempt of Satan and his agents to stamp out them and their work. This is another proof that some of the remnant will pass alive through Armageddon, when the nations shall be destroyed. God’s promise to the “Jonadabs” is that if they will seek meekness and righteousness they may be saved in like manner. The conclusion of those who trust in Jehovah is expressed in these words: “Therefore I will look unto the Lord; I will wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me.” (Mic. 7:7) “By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea.” (Ps. 65:5) This would indicate that when Gog’s forces are threatening to overwhelm Jehovah’s people they will stand their ground and wholly trust in Jehovah, and maintain their integrity toward him, and that God will bring them through the great battle conditions. The anointed of Jehovah are those commissioned to represent God’s kingdom on the earth at the present time, and Jehovah fights “for the salvation of thine anointed”, that is, for their preservation. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(E.R.V.)</span><span class="font5"> According to another rendering of the text God will go forth “to the assistance of thy anointed”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Looser)</span><span class="font5"> This is in answer to the prayer of the anointed as expressed by the psalmist: “This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.” (Ps. 118: 24, 25) “Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God.” (Ps. 20: 6,7) The remnant now on earth are God’s people anointed with his spirit, even as their King the Head, Christ Jesus, is anointed. (1 John 2:20,27; Joel 2:28,29) Christ Jesus is Jehovah’s “right arm”, anointed to bring salvation to the anointed remnant at Armageddon. Only the anointed who are in the company of Christ are with him, and all the nations that profess to be followers of Christ will be on the other side in the great war. The time has come for him to tell his faithful remnant, and to these Christ Jesus says: “For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed [anointed remnant] is come. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold [but all nations against]; therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me [the anointed followers of Christ]; and my fury, it upheld me. ’ ’—Isa. 63: 4, 5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>21</sup> The head of the totally depraved crowd of wicked ones is Satan the Devil. At the time of his rebellion God said that in his own due time he would cause the head of Satan the wicked one to be bruised or crushed. “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. ’ ’—Gen. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>22</sup> Habakkuk had a vision of the actual bruising of the Devil’s head, and he sings out to the praise of Jehovah: “Thou didst wound the head out of the house of the wicked, [and] destroy the foundation with the high-towering walls.” (Leaser) “Thou hast crushed the head out of the house of the lawless one, baring the foundation up to the neck.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> Satan is the head of the lawless house or organization, the earthly foundation of which house rests upon the combined elements of politics, commerce and religion, including the “man of sin” or “son of perdition”. (Dan. 2; 40-43) “The neck” is next to the head, and therefore would seem to picture Gog, Satan’s chief officer, who is next to the Devil himself and who will be destroyed at Armageddon; and then shall come to pass the complete fulfillment of Genesis 3:15. “And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. ’ ’—Rom. 16: 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>23</sup> The foregoing is fully supported by the following: “The Lord [Jehovah] at thy right hand [Christ] shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge among the heathen [nations], he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.” (Ps. 110:5,6) That which in miniature applied to ancient Egypt will at Armageddon fully apply to Satan’s organization; as it is written: “Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength; thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.” (Ps. 74:13,14) Leviathan’s neck is strong, but the Lord will break it completely. (Job 41:22) For many years Satan has been known and identified as the wicked one and the overhead of wickedness. Now Jehovah has uncovered and revealed to those who trust fully in him, and has identified, the entire house of the wicked from the very foundation to the top or “the neck” of the thing. Although these truths are widely proclaimed among the people by Jehovah’s witnesses, only a very small number receive the same or give to such truths any degree of serious consideration. Therefore all must know at Armageddon what is the wicked organization, and that the Devil is the head of it; and Jehovah will make this known by tearing down and completely demolishing the house or organization from cellar to attic, and thus he will lay bare the entire organization of the enemy, bringing it into complete disgrace and thereby removing doubts from all creation as to what constitutes the wicked organization in the universe.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>24</sup> At this point in the prophecy of Habakkuk occurs the word “Selah” again. This marks another pause in the prayer-song.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>25</sup> The prophet had visualized a complete destruction of the enemy, and so terrible was the appearance that he stood speechless and therefore paused for meditation. The description of the battle of the great day of God Almighty, as given by The Revelation and by the prophet Zechariah, and other prophecies, indicates that this will be the order of the fight: The earthly part of Satan’s organization will first be destroyed; then the forces of Jehovah under Christ Jesus will attack the “land of Magog”, the citadel of the wicked spirit crowd, and will completely destroy the wicked there; Satan will behold all of this, and then Christ Jesus will lay hold upon that old Serpent, Satan, Dragon or Devil, and put him completely out of the way. Those who behold the fulfillment of the great prophetic vision will be so moved by the terrible sight that necessarily they will pause and wonder with awe and fearfulness and admiration and will meditate upon the exhibition of the great power of Jehovah God. At the end of this pause the prophet Habakkuk seems to begin to recount some of the terrible things he has just visualized. Then the prophetic song is raised again with even greater force to the praise of Jehovah, and some of the details of the battle are recounted, to wit: “Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages; they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me; their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.” (Hab. 3:14) “Thou didst strike through with his own spears the chiefs of his villages.” (Leeser) The word “villages” here used means “chieftains” or heads of an organization. This is borne out by other renderings of the text, to wit: “Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors” (R.V.); “the head of his chiefs [leaders, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin].” (Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> “Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Douay)</span><span class="font5"> There are various divisions and subdivisions in Satan’s organization, over which there is a chief one or head, and this is well illustrated by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, with its chieftain dwelling near Rome, at Vatican City. This organization, like other parts of the Satanic crowd, has subchiefs in the various parts of the earth. All parts of Satan’s organization, and particularly these chieftains, seek the destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses now. In due time Jehovah disarms them and uses their own weapons to inflict punishment upon them. Jesus has said that the acts of these wicked persecutors of Jehovah’s witnesses constitute a record of testimony which shall be found to be against them. (Mark 13:9) As the forces of the enemy against Gideon fought one another, so the heads of the various divisions or “villages” of Satan’s organization under Gog and Satan will fight against one another. It is not at all improbable that these chieftains will hold different views as to how the fight shall be carried on and this will lead them to engage in fighting one another. The word “villages” or chieftains includes those who decide matters. All such, that is, the chieftains or judges, who make decisions, are in the conspiracy against Jehovah’s anointed ones. They include big clergy, who decide to induce the strong-arm squad to go out and arrest Jehovah’s witnesses; and also include the magistrates, who sit on the court benches and under the influence of the chieftains decide against Jehovah’s witnesses and thus participate in carrying out the conspiracy against the Lord and his anointed. Refer now to the facts as they exist in Plainfield, New Jersey, and like places, and there we have an example of the heads of the small divisions of Satan’s organization. According to the vision, and according to the facts that will come to pass at Armageddon, Jehovah will spare none of the enemy, be they great or small, but each and every one will get a just recompense. (Ezek. 9: 5, 6) The curse descends upon their own heads. They have cooked up wicked schemes against the witnesses of Jehovah, and their wicked imaginations will come down on their own skulls. The faithful remnant will see this and rejoice as they mark the progressive steps of the great war, and they will sing loudly the praises of Jehovah’s holy name.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> The police, the clergy and all of the conspirators of New Jersey have been informed by statements in their own publications that Jehovah’s witnesses are engaged in the worship of Almighty God, and this information has only served to make the conspirators foam at the mouth with greater anger. These conspirators now see the unity of Jehovah’s witnesses, not only in New Jersey, but in every part of the earth; and this is proved by the fact that the conspirators in the various parts of the earth communicate with one another concerning Jehovah’s witnesses, and how they may act against them. The conspirators attempt to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses, and concerning this says the prophet: “They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me.” They “rushed out furiously to scatter me”. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> “They storm along to scatter me.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.)</span><span class="font5"> The enemy concludes that the scattering of Jehovah’s witnesses would prove their undoing and would thus stop their work of giving testimony of truth to the people. Therefore the enemy or conspirators rush to the work of persecuting the Lord’s anointed. The remnant come to know that the grand rush of the enemy is futile, because God is their shield. Jehovah’s battle lines remain firm and unbroken, and Jehovah turns the enemy’s weapons against their own heads at Armageddon and scatters them. The remnant will see this and sing louder the praise of Jehovah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>27</sup> The clergy are the principal ones that hatch up schemes looking to the persecution and destruction of Jehovah’s witnesses, and this they do secretly, like all workers of wicked conspiracies. Says the prophet: ‘ ‘ Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly. ’ ’ (Hab. 3:14) At the regular meetings of the ministerial alliance these conspirators hatch open the scheme to have the police arrest and imprison Jehovah’s witnesses, while the clergy remain out of sight and pose as great, good and sanctimonious. Arriving at a conclusion of a scheme to carry on their wicked work against the Lord’s anointed, these clergymen figuratively slap each other on the back and let out a guffaw, and thus rejoice that they will “devour the poor’’. “Their exultant thought is in very deed to devour the oppressed one in a secret place.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font5">“The poor” are the Lord’s anointed ones, that is to say, the remnant. These have been brought into the secret place of the Lord. (Ps. 91:1) The ‘secrecy’ here clearly seems to mean secrecy on the part of the enemy to keep secret from others what they are doing and thereby disguise their movement and keep honest people in ignorance of what is really being attempted against God’s people. In Germany they induce the political rulers to take violent action against Jehovah’s witnesses upon the excuse that the safety of the state demands it, when in truth and in fact not one of Jehovah’s witnesses has ever raised or ever will raise a hand against the state. In Quebec the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses is carried on, and the excuse or attempted justification is that these witnesses are seditionists and action against them is necessary in order to prevent seditious riots. In New Jersey and other like places the clergy induce the political and commercial crowd to take action against Jehovah’s witnesses upon the ground that such anointed ones of the Lord are commercial agents engaging in a commercial business and in competition with the commerce of the land. They insist that Jehovah’s witnesses cannot go about and preach the gospel unless they first ask for and receive a permit from the police, when in truth and in fact the police would not grant a permit if asked, and it is certain that Jehovah’s witnesses will not ask for a permit to do what Jehovah God has commanded them to do. Those in the wicked conspiracy against the people of God secretly arrange to carry out their plans, and, like their father the Devil, they employ deceit and fraud and lies in their efforts to hide from others their wicked motive and purpose. The words of the psalmist describe the action and motives of the wicked clergy and their eoconspirators. ‘ ‘ He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages; in the secret places doth he murder the innocent; his eyes are privily set against the poor. He lieth in wait secretly, as a lion in his den; he lieth in wait to catch the poor; he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net. He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones. He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten; he hideth his face; he will never see it. ’ ’—Ps. 10: 8-11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>28</sup> The sons of Satan wearing the clerical garb attempt to camouflage their action, and thus they take crafty counsel against the anointed of God. “They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.”—Ps. 83: 3-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>20</sup> They proceed upon the theory that God will give no aid to those who go about with books containing information about the Bible and God’s kingdom. But the time draws near when there shall be a sudden outbreak of the battle of Armageddon, and this will bring these conspirators to painfully know that Jehovah is with his faithful witnesses and that these wicked conspirators cannot get away with their camouflaged murderous deeds. Jehovah has an intelligence office with which the “wiseacres” of Satan’s crowd cannot compete and there is no possible way for them to outwit the Lord. Jehovah is never taken unawares. He knows of every secret movement of the wicked crowd. He knows what the enemy is doing, and he bids his faithful ones to be patient and wait upon him until his due time comes to act. These things Jehovah now reveals for the manifest purpose of giving comfort and hope to those of the anointed, against whom the enemy is making war. These faithful ones seeing in advance what God will do to their persecutors, they rejoice to go on in their work and not slack their hand in the slightest.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>30</sup> Continuing to recount the deeds of the Lord against the enemy, the remnant sing: “Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the heap </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin:</span><span class="font5"> mud] of great waters.” (Hab. 3:15) The seas of the enemy cannot retard the onward march of Jehovah’s victorious warriors. ‘ ‘ The Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.” (Ps. 93:4) Although Satan and his crowd have misused the natural seas, and although that wicked one, who has alienated the symbolic seas from God, claims them for himself, neither belong to Satan. “The sea is his [Jehovah’s], and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land.” (Ps. 95: 5) The sea does not belong to Big Business. At Armageddon Jehovah can and will walk through the seas according to his will, and nothing can prevent him. Even now Jehovah will have his witness work done to completeness, according to his will, and all opposition thereto shall not succeed. Jehovah has given to the people whom he has selected for his name a message, and he will see to it that they deliver it. “I am the Lord thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The Lord of hosts is his name. And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art my people. ’ ’—Isa. 51:15,16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>31</sup> Habakkuk began his song with the words: “O Lord, I have heard”; and after receiving the vision of the universal war he says: “When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble; when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops. ’ ’ (Hab. 3:16) The vision greatly shook and disturbed Habakkuk. The vision of Armageddon now had by the remnant, as revealed to them by the Lord, is awesome and terrible, and they cannot tell it out to others except by the grace of God. It is a declaration of the vengeance of Jehovah, and not of any man. When they tell the message to the enemy, they receive harsh reproofs and abuse at the hands of the enemy. The anointed now tremble, not, however, because of what the enemy does or threatens to do, but because of the fearful prospect that is just before of what God is going to do upon the earth at Armageddon. Some will say, as they have heretofore said, The world has enough of trouble without reminding the people of what is coming. But the faithful, on the contrary, have no hesitation in declaring Jehovah’s vengeance on Satan’s organization, and this they do with boldness and gladness of heart. The remnant now observe the stubbornness of men of this wicked world in resisting the message from Jehovah, and they observe the terrible execution of his judgments that will fall upon these stubborn ones. It requires a heart and mind strong of faith in Jehovah to not shrink back from the terrible and fearful days that are just ahead, but Jehovah, by filling his people with r. knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, gives them strength to continue boldly declaring his name and his kingdom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>32</sup> Habakkuk trembled and said: “Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble.” (A.E.P.) In times past some of the consecrated have said: “ I shall be glad to die and'eseape the time of trouble.” But the faithful remnant have no such desire now. None of them are heard now to say that they want to die and go to heaven before Armageddon. The desire of the remnant is that they may live and see Jehovah execute his judgment upon the enemy in vindication of his holy name, regardless of how terrible that may be. It is Jehovah’s fight, and the remnant know that he is right. Now they rest in faith and “sing aloud upon their beds” of ease. (Ps. 149:5) While they tremble for what they see coming upon the peoples of the earth, the remnant know that their own safety is in the mighty hand of God, and there they will rest. Habakkuk trembled because of the frightful destruction that will result to the people “when he cometh up unto the people”; “when he who should invade with his troops should come up against the people.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.,</span><span class="font5"> margin) Manifestly this means, when Gog begins his assault, Jehovah will invade Gog’s forces and will cut the enemy’s forces to pieces. (Mic. 5:1,2; Hab. 3:16, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> Gog’s assault must and will fail completely, and that will mark the fulfillment of the prayer-song of Habakkuk, which song the remnant now sings. The remnant continue to sing, waiting with patience for the coming of the day when God shall completely wreck the enemy organization in the universal war.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CONFIDENCE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>33</sup> At this point in the prophetic song there looms before the vision of the prophet a great calamity, but in the face of this approaching disastrous famine he expresses his full confidence. Likewise the remnant today, whom the prophet Habakkuk foreshadowed, confidently rely upon Jehovah. Having a vision of an unhappy condition, the prophet says: “Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.” (3:17) Does this apply to the remnant ? or what is the meaning thereof?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>34</sup> The fig tree is symbolic of sweetness and good fruit. “My sweetness and my good fruit.” (Judg. 9: 11) To Jehovah’s faithful remnant the symbolic fig tree has already blossomed, and the remnant are enjoying the sweetness of the fruit of the kingdom. They are now in the “holy land”, “their own land,” in the happy condition of the Lord in the secret place and under the fig tree. (Zech. 3:10) The “true vine” is Christ Jesus, who has come and has gathered his faithful unto the temple, and there the remnant are rejoicing because of the returned Bridegroom and the Lord Jesus is drinking the wine new with them. The remnant as branches of the true vine are holding forth the fruit of the vine to the praise of Jehovah. The olive is a symbol of fatness, prosperity, enlightenment, peace and unity of the remnant with Christ Jesus. (Ps. 133:1-3; Judg. 9: 9) “The labour of the olive shall fail [shall lie, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin].”</span><span class="font5"> To the remnant this does not apply, because Jehovah’s servant is ‘like a green and fruitful olive tree in God’s house’. (Ps. 52:8) The “two [symbolic] olive trees” stand beside Jehovah’s lamp. The remnant are illuminated and are constantly being fed upon the blessed things revealed to them by reason of the illumination of God’s Word. (Zech. 4:3,11,12; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation,</span><span class="font5"> page 65) “The fields yield no food.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> On the contrary, the remnant now receive “meat in due season” in abundance, which is furnished them by Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">(Pss. 104:27; 145:15) Zion’s children are being taught by Jehovah their Father, and they are fed upon the finest of wheat. (Ps. 147:14) The work of the remnant in the field increases to the praise of Jehovah. “From the fold the flocks are cut off.’’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> As to the remnant the reverse is the truth. They are brought into the flock of God, into the temple of Jehovah, and he, the great Shepherd, and Christ Jesus, “the good Shepherd,” now abundantly provide food for that flock. (Ezek. 34:11-16) “There shall be no herd [of plowing oxen] in the stalls.” “And there are no herds in the stalls.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser) As </span><span class="font5">to the remnant, now they are restored to the Lord and brought into the temple, and are going forth at the command of the Lord to bring the fruit of the kingdom to the people. There are “herds” in the stall of the Lord. “And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit; and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.” (Ezek. 36:11) “Herds” in this text has the meaning of beasts of burden. At the present day Jehovah’s witnesses have many beasts of burden to help them carry on the Lord’s work, such as the radio, transcription machines, phonographs, books, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> sound cars, and so forth. There never has been such an active witness to the Lord’s name as at the present time. Jehovah says to his faithful people through his prophet Isaiah: “And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. And [the plains of] Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.” (Isa. 65: 9, 10) All the facts show that this part of the prophecy, at Habakkuk 3:17, does not apply to the faithful remnant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>85</sup> There is another class of people now on earth, a people of good will toward God, growing up in the stalls. (Mal. 4: 2) These are having a part in bearing the burden by carrying to the people and proclaiming the message of the kingdom. These “Jonadabs” refuse to don the vestments of Satan’s crowd, and hence they are not cut off from the stalls, but are in the favor of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>36</sup> The conditions that actually exist today within the ranks of God’s people show that the foregoing verse seventeen of Habakkuk’s prophecy, describing a condition of great famine, cannot apply to God’s people. This conclusion is further supported by the words of verse eighteen of the prophecy. The famine condition described in verse seventeen must apply to someone; but there is no famine now amongst God’s people for the hearing of his Word and proclaiming his message, but exactly the opposite condition exists. The prophet Habakkuk said that, regardless of this calamitous condition, he would rejoice; and even so now the joy of the remnant daily increases. Then what is the proper application of verse seventeen? The answer is plain when we see that exactly the condition there described by the prophet Habakkuk exists today in the land of unfaithful “Christendom”. Like Israel, “Christendom” claims to serve God. In 1918 the Lord came to his temple, the kingdom having been set up. ‘ ‘ Christendom, ’ ’ instead of receiving the King, rejected God’s provision and turned to that abominable thing, the League of Nations, and set it up instead of the kingdom. Since 1918 “Christendom” is in this condition of famine. Particularly since 1928, when the seventh vial was poured out, and when the declaration was proclaimed at the Detroit convention against Satan and in favor of Jehovah, and was widely published throughout the earth; and from that time onward the deplorable condition described in Habakkuk 3:17 has been upon “Christendom”, and from which she can never recover. Shortly following that declaration in 1928 the great economic depression came upon “Christendom”, and is still on. Symbolically and literally famine and pestilence now affect “Christendom”, and daily the conditions described grow worse. “Christendom” is now completely cut off from the favors of Jehovah, as the description in verse seventeen above plainly sets forth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>37</sup> In spite of all this miserable condition now existing, Habakkuk looks upon it and says: “Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[Hebrew:</span><span class="font5"> I will jump for joy, exult] in the God of my salvation.” (Verse 18) The world-wide depression affects Jehovah’s witnesses somewhat, in this, that they are compelled to practice the strictest economy in order to provide the things decent for themselves, but they are not so much concerned about temporal blessings. They are seeking first the kingdom of God, and according to his precious promise the things needful for them he supplies. The Scriptures’ being fully supported by the physical facts, including the present-day miserable conditions of “Christendom”, is further proof to the remnant that Armageddon is near at hand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> The Lord at his temple has enlightened the remnant, and they rejoice and sing: “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.” (Isa. 61:10) Here at the temple the Lord has enlightened his people and made them strong and bold to go forth as his witnesses and declare the message of the kingdom. The call for workers in the field has not fallen off, but, on the contrary, the response has been the greater and the witness work has continued to increase. The continuous movement forward of Jehovah’s little band of witnesses, and their continuous feeding upon the precious food which Jehovah has provided for their spiritual well-being, causes them to shout and jump for joy. They have come fully to realize the words of Nehemiah, “The joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Neh. 8:10) The giving of the witness has caused some to grumble and complain, but the effect upon the remnant has been to increase their joy. Many of Jehovah’s witnesses now find that they must live in housecars or tents and get their daily food by strenuous efforts, but these things do not dampen their zeal and joy. The persecution of the enemy increases, but this does not stop them from rejoicing. On the contrary, they continue to “joy in the God of my salvation”. They see and know that the day of the vindication of Jehovah is at hand and therefore the time of their deliverance draws near. They see that now the words of Jesus apply to them: “And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.” (Luke 21:28) The remnant know that they are on the side of Jehovah and that he is their God. “He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto God the Lord belong the issues from death.” (Ps. 68:20) The deliverance and salvation of the remnant will come fully at Armageddon, and to that happy time the remnant now look forward with great rejoicing, because the name of Jehovah is involved and will there be vindicated. To share in the vindication of his name, and not in earthly comforts, is the cause of their rejoicing. They sing: ‘Jehovah is “the God of my salvation”.’ “God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.” —Ps. 73:26.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>38</sup> Terrific pressure is now being put upon Jehovah’s witnesses to make them yield to the enemy. Laws are being enacted to compel these faithful ones of the Lord to cease their work and yield to Satan’s crowd; but instead, the modern-day Habakkuk class sings: “The Lord God is my strength and he will make my feet like hinds’ feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.”—Hab. 3; 19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>40</sup> David uttered a like song when Jehovah delivered him from the hand of the enemy. (Ps. 18: 31-46; 2 Sam. 22:1, 32-35) The Lord’s people are here likened unto the hind, the feet of which are swift and sure. “He maketh my feet fleet as those of the hinds.” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Leeser)</span><span class="font5"> The remnant are swift to elude the multitude of the enemies, and fleet and sure of foot to hasten to the great Rock of their salvation and climb up high to safety and to there hide themselves in places inaccessible to their pursuers. Jehovah keeps the faithful ones informed in advance, and they are prompt to move as he directs them. Like the timid hind, they keep away from the hounds that pursue, and as faithful servants of God they avoid the haunts of worldly men, for they are not of this world. (Job 39:1) They continue to sing: “Jehovah . . . will make me to walk upon my high places.” (A.R.V.) Israel turned to Satan’s worship in the high places. (1 Ki. 3: 2) Jehovah’s faithful remnant worship God upon the true and approved high places, far above and hence safe from the enemy. Let the remnant be assured that as long as they keep in these heights of service and devotion they are on The Rock and are safe under the protection of the Most High. (Ps. 18:2) From these high places the remnant will witness the battle of the great day of God Almighty and will see Jehovah win. The high places of the enemy Jehovah will completely tread down.—Amos 4:13; Mie. 1:3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>41</sup> This song-prayer is dedicated to the “chief musician ’ ’. According to Psalm 68: 24, 25 this prayersong is accompanied by stringed musical instruments. “For the Chief Musician, on my stringed instruments.” (A.R.V.) “On my double harp.”</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Roth.) </span><span class="font5">The chief musician was an overseer. (Psalm 4, title, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> In this prayer-song of the remnant the chief singer would represent Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Messenger at the temple, who oversees and directs the temple singers. Thus Jehovah inspired Habakkuk to dedicate the prayer-song to the great Vindicator of Jehovah’s name; which fact implies that the remnant, who are the feet members of the Vindicator, must take their signals from him and sing. They are now singing a stanza of the new song.—Rev. 14:1-3; Ps. 33: 3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>42</sup> The time is near when the peoples of earth, who have heard the sound of the voice of Jehovah’s witnesses proclaiming his name and his kingdom, will know that Jehovah sent these singers amongst them: “And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do them not. And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. ’ ’—Ezek. 33: 32, 33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>43</sup> Again the loving-kindness of our God is made known to his people, and this by the revelation to them of the prophecy of Habakkuk. That prophet of olden days saw some undergoing great persecution and suffering indignities at the hands of others, and he cried unto God to know the reason why. For some time the modern Habakkuk, which is the remnant, have been suffering great indignities at the hands of Satan’s organization, and these have wondered why; and beholding the increasing iniquity and the continuous defamation of God’s name, they have cried unto the Lord. As Habakkuk inquired of God for the reason, likewise the remnant now stand on the watch, seeking to know from the Lord the reason why such things have come to pass. Now they have learned that Jehovah God permits the enemy to continue to persecute the remnant in order that the remnant may have an opportunity to maintain their integrity toward God and in order that the acts of the enemies may be testimony against themselves. Then Jehovah shows his people that soon he will march through the land and destroy the enemy forces and completely vindicate his own great name. The vision of that battle at Armageddon is given to Habakkuk, and the remnant now are permitted by faith to see something of the manner in which it will be conducted. It will be far too stupendous, awe-inspiring and overwhelming for any human language to now describe it. The remnant by faith see what is coming within a short time, and knowing that it means Jehovah’s vindication and their own deliverance, they break forth in song.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">** True to the prophecy of the Lord, the day is here for the final test, and Satan’s hordes are bent on forcing all who serve God to become unfaithful, fall away and die. The enemy is certain to fail in his efforts. Those who love and serve Jehovah do not now lean to their own understanding, but they are trusting in the Lord; and, true to his promise, he is guiding them in the way they should go. The prayer of the inspired apostle is answered in this day, and the faithful are now “filled with the knowledge of his [Jehovah’s] will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding”, and thus they are made strong. The remnant have learned the purpose of Jehovah and his will concerning them, and they fully appreciate that the hour for the crucial test is here. Therefore let the remnant in Germany, Quebec, New Jersey, and any other place on the earth, and regardless of all manner of persecution, stand firm and rely confidently upon Jehovah. The enemy is vicious, cruel and desperately bent upon the destruction of God’s faithful ones. The persecution of the faithful will increase from now on until the great war. We should expect nothing else nor desire anything save what Jehovah permits. While within themselves the remnant are without strength to withstand the enemy, let each one remember that “the eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy them. Happy art thou, 0 Israel [Jehovah’s chosen people] : who is like unto thee, 0 people saved by the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. ’ ’—Deut. 33: 27, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>45</sup> What more could we ask or desire than to be in the fight on the side of Jehovah? We know he is going to win and to deliver those who are faithful to him. The Lord is in his holy temple; the remnant are gathered unto him at Armageddon; the war is at hand, and the persecution will continue upon Jehovah’s witnesses; but they will fear neither man nor devil, regardless of all the vicious laws now existing or being enacted and enforced against the anointed of the Lord, and, regardless of all the cruel persecution and reproaches that come upon them, none of the remnant will quake or fear now, nor will they slack their hand in the work to announce the kingdom. This is a most blessed fight, and blessed is he that hath a part therein and remains true and faithful to the Most High. Since first we knew the Lord we have had a desire to dwell in his house for ever. We now gathered into the temple, that desire to remain for ever with the Lord has been greatly increased. Let every one of the remnant therefore remain firm and steadfast in the Lord, who has provided and will continue to graciously provide in these days of distress meat for their strength, comfort and hope, guaranteeing salvation unto all those who love and serve him. Let all such now together lift up the head and join their voices together in singing: “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple. For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion; in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.”— Ps. 27:1-6.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark12"></a>LETTERS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">JEHOVAH DOES ALL THINGS WELL</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah is great in the midst of his people and greatly to be praised. Everyone who participated in lifting the banner of His name at the Washington convention can attest to that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The spirit of the Lord was manifest throughout the entire assembly, but was most evident on Sunday, June 2, when on that memorable occasion the message &quot;Government”, given to the ends of the earth by Brother Butherford, from the Washington Auditorium, thrilled the heart of everyone who earnestly prays for God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Washington, in addition to the 22,000 at the Auditorium, and the entire residential area covered by WOL, there were also three points in the city of Washington proper, and forty other places surrounding Washington, at which sound cars picked up and rebroadcast the speech to over 120,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Later reports were verified that congressmen, cabinet members, ambassadors, and all official Washington heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In consideration of the fact that this picture was reproduced in nearly every capital and large center in the world, without doubt the largest listening audience ever to hear a message, heard the testimony that Jehovah’s kingdom under Christ will now replace all others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In proof that this message was from the Lord, he arranged the atmospheric conditions to cause the clearest broadcasting hour in radio history for reception throughout the earth from 3 to 4 p.m. Eastern Standard time, for that great proclamation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to this speech nearly ten thousand announcements had been made by sound cars, pointing to the big event of the assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the field report attached, 175,000 radio folders were placed in Baltimore and 250,000 in territory surrounding Washington, advertising the public address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After the Washington newspapers had broken their contracts, and refused to publish this speech, seventy-five thousand special letters were distributed in one hour throughout the city, as per the attached, informing the people of what had taken place, and that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> would bring them the printed message in a special edition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Five hundred and twenty-five pioneer trailers and house-cars were encamped in near-by Virginia a short distance from the Auditorium. A repair shop, manned by the willing hands of the Lord’s people, repaired over seventy cars and sent everyone away in time to have part in the service and return to their homes at the conclusion of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A terminal was also provided for all sound cars to be inside and protect the equipment, from which point the cars left each morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Wonderful weather was provided for the whole occasion by the Lord, which enabled 8,390 witnesses to place 210,196 books and booklets among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over ten thousand rooms were supplied for housing 20,000 delegates. Of these only 600 were in hotels; all the rest lodged in private homes. This has left a lasting impression upon the householders of Washington. At the first service meeting after the convention, at the local headquarters, the throng of newcomers was so great that every available space was used on the ground floor to accommodate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many of these have subscribed for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Age</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower,</span><span class="font4"> and the keynote of the convention concerning the companions of Jehovah’s witnesses has already found a ready response here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was a thrilling picture to behold the 840 of good will, who were immersed Saturday afternoon at the Takoma Park pool, but it was learned this is only a part of those who desire to go on record as standing for the Lord and his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After Brother Rutherford’s talk on Monday afternoon, regarding the hierarchy’s domination of the public press, and they clearly saw the two forces coming together, one for the Lord, and the other against the kingdom, many more stated their intention of being identified on the Lord’s side. So, after the witnesses trek home, it is reasonable to believe that they will have a joyful work before them in providing service for these new ones to join the army of those who praise Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the Lord’s grace, the cafeteria supplied the immediate needs of all, which enabled the publishers to use as much time as possible in the field service and meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The book, territory, pioneer and other departments all worked in unity to supply the workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Over 1500 pioneers were cared for with facilities as to board and lodging, all of which the Lord provided, that there should be nothing lacking among those who serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The whole staff, and particularly those of Washington, join in expressing appreciation for the privilege of having all the Bethelites in their homes, that they might share all things with the family of God. This includes the pioneers, regional directors, and those of foreign lands, all of whom were provided for as directed by Brother Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is noteworthy that thousands phoned, wrote, and called in person at the Society’s Washington office requesting copies of the speech ‘ ‘ Government ’ ’ immediately after the convention, and that the Washington radio station, WOL, immediately requested a renewal of its contract that it may continue broadcasting the Watch Tower programs. This was due to the great interest manifested by inquiries to that station relative to the speech on the subject &quot;Government”, which inquiries proved to be only the beginning. This office has been literally showered with requests for copies of this great message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On Tuesday trailers, autos, busses, and trains carried a joyous throng back to their territories, with the many thousands expressing their determination to carry on for Jehovah and for Christ’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brethren at the factory supplied the equipment in fine style. The publishers in the field and at the convention headquarters faithfully stuck to their assigned places and gave splendid co-operation toward a smooth-running organization befitting the Lord’s army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I count it the greatest privilege to serve our God and our King, and fight shoulder to shoulder in the ranks with them and with you. For this I give thanks to the One who does all things well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Greetings and kind wishes that He will bless Brother Rutherford and all of you forever to honor his name, which alone is Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your fellow servant to the King Eternal,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">“ONLY THE TRUTH GIVES STRENGTH”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I must not take much of your time. I know you are a very busy man; but I have many times, while busy with so many duties as a poor farmer’s wife, thought I must just write a line to say how much every day I thank God for your great courage in giving poor suffering humanity the truth of God’s Word. How I look forward to each new book and booklet and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower!</span><span class="font4"> New truth keeps coming out all the time. How comforting! How cheering! Only the truth gives strength and builds up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How we do praise God that this wonderful truth has been revealed to us. Nothing else matters. We have learned to pray only for our daily bread as far as material things go; their food of God’s Word is far more important, and we are full of thankfulness for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have a small, cheap radio, and I didn’t expect for a minute we should be able to get your message this a.m., “Universal War Near,’’ from Salt Lake City, KSL, as Salt Lake has been fairly good early in the morning but fades away around nine o’clock. To our surprise this morning your lecture started coming in clear as a bell, never missed a word, and continued to do so right up to 11:30; and I was one who stood up with you and said, “Aye! ” And oh, what a message! How glad to have received it, and what strength and courage it gave us! and it surely would appear it was by special power of the Lord it came to us. I’m sending to Toronto for 50c worth of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">G.A.</span><span class="font4"> with this lecture in printed form to give to the people of this community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Again God bless you.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LIGHT UNFOLDING BEAUTIFULLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I cannot refrain longer from expressing my thanks for the many benefits bestowed upon us pioneers and for the wonderful equipment and co-operation of all at Bethel. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book, Jehovah,</span><span class="font4"> convention allowance and, best of all, the recent </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtowers</span><span class="font4"> on Gideon are all so helpful and delightful. One feels like doing as Gideon did when he heard the dream: he worshiped God; and so do we as we see the light unfold so beautifully from the temple. “Praise ye Jehovah.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A fellow witness,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mrs. Wood Toulson, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Pioneer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">INCOMPARABLE SOURCE OF INSPIRATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brother Rutherford :</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is my privilege to report to you the attendance at our Monday evening study. This averaged 10 during February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The members of the Bethel family here find the careful and reverent study of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> a source of inspiration not comparable with anything else. We are now studying the articles entitled “Jehovah’s Battle’’ and are delighted to note how beautifully the pictures therein given harmonize with truths before seen. The consideration of these prophetic truths has blessed and continues to bless and strengthen our faith and increase our ability to praise and serve Jehovah. We appreciate with all our understanding the great goodness of our loving and wise Father, and desire only that we may have the privilege of serving him and praising him for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With grateful thanks, I am</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your fellow worker,</span></p>
