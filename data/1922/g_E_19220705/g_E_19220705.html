<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">German Financial Conditions </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By Robert </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">f.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Grosseii (u. s. Treasury)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">T^HE Governments of Europe have not only </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&amp;&nbsp;. -A- </span><span class="font10">been wrenched in some respects from their p old moorings by the war, but the peoples them-| selves have passed through a like experience, in f some countries to a greater, in others to a lesser, degree. Social unrest is widespread, and while </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;&nbsp;j</span><span class="font10"> the hideous specter of Bolshevism has faded fe- &quot;somewhat, it is questionable whether it is not h merely in a state of temporary quiescence. Indated, and hence depreciated, currencies coup&gt; led with general unemployment due largely to ?; depression in international trade have resulted in creating much dissatisfact’on with conditions | as they now exist. It is believed by some of the f best minds of the world that a new understand-<sup>:</sup>sr ing must be reached between nations that will put a damper, on military expenditures and stimulate international trade. The depressed . conditions in trade — which are world-wide — “ are due primarily to the exhaustion of buying i power, without which trade cannot thrive. And A a factor of prime importance, and incident to » the exhaustion of buying power, is the break-j^ down of foreign exchange, so that the regular ’■ medium, or vehicle, by which nations traded 1 with each other is to a certain extent useless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EUROPE DISRUPTED</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The scars of Europe and the disrupted relationships, economic and otherwise, which the World War brought about, and the far-reaching shock of which has prostrated the nations, can be healed and adjusted only by the milk of human kindness—a sincere feeling of good will and active desire for cooperation. President Harding in the opening address of the Conference on Limitation of Armament on November 12, 1921, struck this chord when he stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Gentlemen of the Conference, the United States wel-^nes you with unselfish hands. We harbor no fears; we have no sordid ends to serve; we suspect no enemy; we contemplate or apprehend no conquest. Content with what we have, we seek nothing which is anotbr’s. We only wish to do with you that finer, nobler thh.g which no nation can do alone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a well-established statement of political economy that the welfare of any one country concerns the destiny of all other countries; and until an active spirit of cooperation has been aroused and put into effect, there cannot be expected an improvement in the affairs of the world. Especially is this true in this day of the world’s history, when the nations have been so thoroughly linked together in a community of interests by the telegraph, radio, cable, telephone, railway and steamship lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CHAOS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A significant statement appeared in the Chicago </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font10"> under date of November 29, 1921, as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In Europe is economic and financial chaos. Unless something is promptly done to avert this disaster which approaches with constantly increasing rapidity, it will spread from one country to another, until we are involved in the maelstrom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Where suspicions are harbored there can be little or no cooperation; and it is true with na-' tions, as with individuals, that where a nation is in a defensive attitude it is laying itself open to many troubles and often discerns specters which do not exist. It is feared that it is only “the leaves which are for the healing of the nations” [Revelation 22: 2] which will be*effective in remedying the sick condition in which Europe now finds herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch</span><span class="font10"> the following </span><span class="font9">statement </span><span class="font10">appeared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The disruption of economic Europe ordered by the conference of Versailles, which treated central Europe as a patchwork of political pawn, disregarding its eco-</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19220705_files/g_E_19220705-4.png" alt="" style="width:24pt;height:32pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">nomic unity and necessities, has defied all political or military efforts to remedy it. It has been a ease of ‘all the king’s horses and all the king’s men’ being unable ‘to set </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Humpty Dumpty up again.’ As</span><span class="font8"> America's onetime leading financier once said: ’You can’t unscramble eggs’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been estimated that two days’ work a week is sufficient to supply the needs of the people of the United States at the present time. This being true, the remaining four work days of our factories should be devoted to production for foreign business, were it not for the fact that our foreign trade has been largely suspended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The German Foreign Minister recently said that the more Germany works, the more other nations must cease working ; and the statement was of sufficient importance to cause the rest of the world to pause and think. He also stated that in Great Britain and the United States, the two greatest industrial nations, there were, in the one three million, and in the other six million workers out of employment, while in Germany there are less idle than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SALE OF GERMAN CREDIT</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Germany has no money with which to satisfy </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">Reparation demands, and in order to meet </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">first payments she was obliged to sell her credit. It appears that the low-water point has been reached, as evidenced by the low price of the mark—descending to about a third of a cent. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">payment </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">one billion gold marks ($238,200,000, in United States money) on Reparations </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">account was </span><span class="font10">done only by drawing heavily upon </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">Reichsbank (Bank of the Empire). As a factor in this payment, a large amount of the silver, which the bank has held in a special account since the demonetization of silver in Ger</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">many, </span><span class="font10">was used to establish credit balances in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">New </span><span class="font10">York, where it brought about 50,000,000 gold marks ($11,910,000), and also it was necessary to draw upon the gold reserve of the hank to the amount of almost 68,000,000 gold marks. This reduced the holdings of the Reichsbank so that the reserve stood on August 31, 1921, at 1^023,708,000 gold marks ($243,847,245.60). This drawing upon the resources of the Reichsbank Was necessary, in spite of the fact that the Government had been makingevery effort to increase its stock of gold for some time before the payments became due, by buying through the Reichsbank and the postoffices, gold coin and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">gold by weight at special prices, corresponding roughly to the value of the paper mark in wor^ markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In addition to the payment of one billion gold^* marks as indicated above, Germany has up to i April 30, 1921, made payments on Reparations ' account amounting to 4,554,792,000 gold marks. This covers the period November 11, 1918, to April 30, 1921, and is divided as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GERMAN BUDGET</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One of the perplexing problems before the German Government is that of increasing taxes in order to meet ordinary Government expend-. itures and payments on Reparations account. In' July, 1921, Dr. Wirth, the Chancellor,'put be-’ fore the Reichstag the Government’s proposals for certain taxes to meet ordinary Government expenditures. Estimates for the year were increased since the budget was first presented. German Government expenditures estimates for the fiscal year 1921 were as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup> .</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">This does not include, however, the amount ? of two billion gold marks due this year, nor the equivalent of twenty-six percent of the export ’ trade, two sums which will total, it lias been . estimated, 42,000,000,000 to 53,000,000,000 paper ' marks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i The amount of available revenues with which ' the Government will have to meet expenditures ‘ has been placed at 58,959,000,000 marks, which : leaves a deficit of 49,180,000,000 marks, not including the amount of two billion gold marks and the twenty-six percent trade tax. The deficit in the budget is being taken care of by discounting Treasury bills through the Reichs-bank. On May 31, 1921, the floating debt was j 199,000,000,000 marks, and the funded debt was 78,350,000,000 on the same date, making the total debt of Germany to be 277,350,000,000 marks (about 69 billion dollars).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PUMPING THE WELL DRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The .only way Germany can satisfy the Repa-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>s</sup> .rations </span><span class="font10">demands is by intensive production, but v; for this she lacks raw material, which has to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' be </span><span class="font10">purchased in foreign lands. For these needs </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">she </span><span class="font10">lacks the ability to pay, except in credits, ' which sometimes cannot be accepted because of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">risk involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font10">order to lighten the load that Germany has to carry with respect to meeting payments in -~—gold, France has entered into an agreement with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Germany </span><span class="font10">covering a period of five years. This ■ agreement covers the delivery of manufactured goods to the amount of seven billion gold marks ($1,667,400,000). The amount delivered by Ger</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">many will </span><span class="font10">depend upon the wishes of theFrench, as the agreement does not require them to order goods from Germany. Up to 1926 the Germans </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' will </span><span class="font10">be credited by the Reparations Commission with at least thirty-five percent of the goods de- livered each year, provided that the amount to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">credited in any year does not exceed one billion gold marks. From 1926 to 1936 the amount credited each year is not to exceed the amount </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">. of </span><span class="font10">Reparations payments due France. These </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">deliveries of goods for the payment of Repara</span><span class="font10">tions debt will greatly simplify the task before the leaders of Germany. With respect to the delivery of goods the question now is, not how much Germany can pay but how much the Allies can afford to accept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The London </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Chronicle</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> states that,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In France, the Government has estimated a budget deficit in 1922 of 1,625,000,000 francs, and France relies largely on German reparations payments to make good this huge deficit. If the German mark becomes practically worthless, then the value of the German indemnity payments would disappear. The possibility of French bankruptcy might then loom on the horizon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Already France has floated some large loans, the funds of which were for the restoration of the devastated regions. These loans were based on German Reparations payments. Should such Reparations payments fail to materialize it is easy to foresee where France financially would face disaster, as the gross debt is already at </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">ruinous figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The French Government contemplated an expenditure for the year 1921 amounting to 42,412,000,000 francs, as contrasted with receipts of 23,312,000,000 francs, thus having a deficit of about 19,000,000,000 francs to be procured by the flotation of loans. Of this deficit about 16,000,000,000 francs were regarded as eventually recoverable from Germany under the terms of the peace treaty. During the first half of the year 1921 the total public debt of France rose from 245,000,000,000 francs to 264,000,000,000 francs (approximately $52,000,000,000, computed at the standard value of the gold franc).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REVENGE VS. COMMON SENSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Philadelphia </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Public Ledger,</span><span class="font10"> in making some terse remarks concerning the growing tangle that has enmeshed France and England states the following: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“At Versailles France wanted revenge and reparations. England was fearful of a policy of revenge. It might bring new wars. Clemenceau wanted both revenge and reparations, to eat the German cake and have it. He had his way at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“France backed Poland against Russia—and heaven knows Poland needed backing. England was of the opinion that Poland had loosed the red avalanche on herself by letting her white eagles soar toward Moscow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Then came Upper Silesia. France standing with Poland, while England was disposed to see reason in some of the German claims. When Germany stubbornly failed to do anything about reparations, the French were ready to march on Berlin, if need be; but the Eng-*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">fish held back. There were other balances than trade balances in the back of the British mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It was and is the same in the Near East, where England, guarding the Suez gate and fearful of a Mohammedan mixed politico-holy war, has wished the Greeks Godspeed in their attempts to chase the Turk back into his deep Asiatic homelands. France has leaned Turk-ward, has made the treaty of Angora, is getting out of Cilicia, and is burning incense to the beard of Mohammed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“England is fearful of a, dominant France on the continent. Right now France is dominant there. Whether it numbers 600,000 or 800,000, the French army is the best and biggest military machine in the •world today.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The maintenance of such a large military force means large expenditures, which with the obligations growing out of . the public debt, together with those funds being devoted to restoration work, makes the current budget far exceed the receipts, a condition of things that cannot long continue. To bridge the chasm between expenditures and receipts most of the European countries have been keeping the &quot;printing presses going printing fiat money, with the result that with the exception of Switzerland Europe today is deluged with a sea of paper money. A day of reckoning must come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Recent accounts in the papers describing the mobbing of leading hotels in Vienna, in which the people took nearly everything they could lay their hands on, read strangely like the description of disorder as given in the following paragraph of similar happenings in the year 1793 in France:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FIAT MONEY AND PILLAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The washerwomen of Paris, finding soap so dear that they could hardly purchase it, insisted that all merchants who were endeavoring to save something of their little property by refusing to sell their goods for the wretched currency with which France was flooded, should be punished with death; the women of the markets and the hangers-on of the Jacobin Club called loudly for a law To equalize the value of paper money and silver coin.’ It was also demanded that a tax be laid especially on the rich, to the amount of four hundred million francs, to buy bread. Marat declared loudly that the people, by hanging shopkeepers and plundering stores, could easily remove the trouble. The result was that on the 28th of February, 1793, at eight o’clock in the evening, a mob of men and women disguised began plundering the stores and shops of Paris. At first they demanded only bread; soon they insisted on coffee and rice and sugar; at last they seized everything on which</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">they could lay their hands—cloth, clothing, groceries, -and luxuries of every kind. Two hundred such places were plundered. This was endured for six hours and — finally order was restored only by a grant of seven mil-* lion francs to buy off the mob.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■»</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At last the amount of paper money outstand- .. ing was 40,000,000,000 assignats, by which time it had sunk so low in value that no effort was ever made to redeem it. It was simply abandoned as worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Part of the depreciation of the mark is attributed by officials of the German Government ■ to speculation in exchange, and it is planned to introduce as one of its new tax measures a bill </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">t </span><span class="font10">taxing every exchange transaction. The decline in the foreign exchange value of the mark has ■ made the whole German population want to pos- -sess goods rather than marks. According to 1 cable dispatches retailers’ stocks have been al- ; most completely exhausted by the excited buying. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Foreign trade figures for September show that the unfavorable balance in Germany’s foreign commerce increased during the summer of 1921. For the five months, May to September, -inclusive, the adverse trade balance was 9,147,000,000 paper marks. One reason that the value . ?. of the import trade exceeds that of the export trade is the disparity between German prices and those of the rest of the world. The Germans ' are selling cheap and buying dear, and the dif- . ference between prices at home expressed in -terms of marks increased during the summer ■; and fall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In order to augment the domestic stocks of grain Germany made heavy importations of grain in August, amounting to nearly fifteen million bushels of wheat. When the inflated &lt;&nbsp;mark met the unusual volume of foreign bills ‘ the mark naturally fell. With the fall of the : mark imports were checked, exports increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CREDIT AND TRADE LANGUISHING</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Negotiations of the Government to raise </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a ; </span><span class="font10">loan to meet Reparations payments have been under way with German Industrials, but so far have' not been effective, while the effort to raise; ; a loan in London has failed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the second week in November, 1921, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the . <sub>; </sub></span><span class="font10">Reparations Commission went to Berlin to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font10">vestigate the situation there at first </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hand.The </span><span class="font10">outcome of the visit was a telegram sent to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Ber- ' </span><span class="font10">lin on December 2, 1921, urgently </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">requesting .&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the German Government to give its full attention to the steps immediately necessary to in-*^sure payments of the January and February installments due on Reparations account. The telegram emphasized the fact that the Reparations Commission is persuaded that the difficulties encountered by the German Government—difficulties Avhich are closely connected with the fall of mark exchange—are of a financial rather than an economic character and are in a great measure due to the failure of the German Government to balance its budget.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the case of Germany it is difficult to estimate the total amount of Government expendi-’ tures. No budget was voted by the Reichstag - for 1921-1922, and the Government continues to cover the difference between receipts and expenditures by discounting Treasury bills with the Reichsbank. For the first six months of the fiscal year, beginning April 1, 1921, the difference between income and outgo has amounted to 44,000,000,000 marks; and, in a recent speech before the Reichstag, Hermes, the Minister of Finance, estimated that before the year was over the deficit would reach 110,000,000,000 marks (approximately $27,000,000,000, if based on the value of the gold mark).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Developments are making it clear that the economic recovery of Europe awaits the restoration of foreign trade; and the improvement of foreign trade involves two factors—a rectification of currency and exchange conditions between countries, and improvements in budgetary condtions. The Financial Conference held at Brussels reached the conclusion that foreign exchange stabilization and rectification must be considered almost out of the question in the absence of better budget arrangements. The conclusions then reached (in the autumn of 1920) are even more pertinent at the present time. During the year a large amount of national revenue in most countries has continued to be devoted to the development of armaments, thereby preventing the various governments from restoring their budgets to equilibrium and compelling them to rely largely upon short-term borrowing in the effort to meet current expenditures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In view of these conditions it can readily be seen that an effective reduction in naval outlay, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font10">carried through to success, would result in a marked betterment at the present time, while a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">^reduction </span><span class="font10">in military outlay would probably</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">furnish in some countries an even more </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">impor</span><span class="font10">tant means of balancing their budgets.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AN UNSPEAKABLE CATASTROPHE IMPENDING</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As to Great Britain’s attitude on reparations and the present condition of the German Government the following from a recent speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The collapse of Germany, if that were unfortunately to be caused by any action on the part of the Allies, would be a misfortune, not only for Germany, but for Europe and for the world. What are we suffering from today? Among other things, perhaps, and more than any other things, we are suffering because there are so many derelict countries in Europe, at the present time. Austria and Russia, which used to be our customers, are no longer able to purchase our goods; and to that cause you can attribute a certain amount of the unemployment and depression which exist among us at the present time. But suppose you added to those countries a broken Germany. The catastrophe would be unspeakable. It would be disaster not only from the economic point of view, but no man could foretell what its reverberations would be in the political sphere. What then if we were to put pressure upon Germany? Well, she might be able to pay or she might not; and that is the question, the immediate question, which has got to be inquired into.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But, if concessions are to be made, there are some things which first ought to be observed. Germany, as a whole, is saying that she cannot pay Reparations which she is under obligations to perform, but she is doing several things which act against the possibility of her meeting her obligations. Let me take one or two examples. She is subsidizing the price of bread in Germany. That is done at the expense of the taxpayer. It makes a deficit in the revenue of the State, but its effect in Germany itself is this: The industrialist employer is able to buy his labor at a cheaper wage because of the subsidy to bread which is given by the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“In another direction also she subsidizes the employer. The railways which are operated by the State are run at a loss. I think in the last quarter it amounted to something like 15,000,000 pounds sterling. That creates another tap in the State’s budget, and it enables the industrialist to get his goods carried at a cheaper rate than he ought to obtain. Coal is being sold today in Germany at about half the price which is paid for coal anywhere else in the world. That is another form of State subsidy; and therefore while the German State . itself is paying ont money from the pockets of the taxpayers, there are certain individuals at least in Germany who are growing wealthier by reason of the. subsidies which are granted by the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“If we are to forego our just rights in relation to German Reparations, even for a period, which I do not think we ought to decide to do, but if we are, one </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">thing</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Is plain: Germany must get rid of those subsidies in order to put herself in a position to perform her proper obligations to the people to whom she is indebted. One more thing, she must make her taxation yield revenue which will meet her expenditure; within some period to be fixed she must cease to print paper marks in order to meet Jier deficit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">German inventive genius is now at work trying to solve some of the perplexing problems that have arisen as a result of the loss by Germany of some of what was once valuable territory in that it produced those </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">commodities </span><span class="font10">which ministered to her industrial life, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">some of the problems seem to be on a fair ways toward solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The German character in endowed with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">spirit of perseverance and is possessed of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font10">amount of egotism that is monumental; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font10">whether or not the nation will be able to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">carry </span><span class="font10">the burdens and meet the problems that now confront it is problematical.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Business Situation</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">TT </span><span class="font10">IS a well-known fact that periods of depression and stagnation have followed the great wars of the last' century, owing to the disorganization of the affairs of the various nations, made complex through the ever-increasing community of interest between them and accelerated by the growth of knowledge and communication in these last days. It is not a surprise that a normal setback should take place today, as after the wars of 1812 and 1861.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, the situation today is not only much more'complex, but beyond normal. The situation is appallingly abnormal and commands attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Europe is virtually bankrupt through the multiplied debts of previous conflicts, especially the last; and the value of money is so far out of proportion to that of the United States that to deal with us requires much advancement of credit on our part until they are better off financially, the scaling down of wages in this country to compare with those of Europe (an impossible task) or by raising the tariff rate sufficiently to cover the difference between the ratio of wages and the medium of exchange (and this is possible although suicidal for America so far as exporting her goods is concerned). Manufacturers must close down until this is righted if for no other reason; and this moans starvation, famine, suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">On the other hand we have the capitalists of America and Great Britain conspiring to crush labor and to place the workmen on the plane of slaves, thus causing much discontent and slowing down of effort as well as obstinate eva</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">sion </span><span class="font10">of work.</span></p>

The chief reason for this is the capitalization of property and inventions beyond their U real value.

But there are' no less than three different ‘ methods to evade it: (1) By issuing stock for -overvalued property, (2) by stock dividends ( where an equivalent value in property has not ’ been accumulated and (3) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font10">consolidations </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">un</span><span class="font10">der statutes whereby good-will is capitalized. i The common method is to issue the stock in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ex- ' </span><span class="font10">cess of the value of the property and by agreement to contribute a percentage equal to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">excess valuation back into the treasury, to be ■ sold at the price the market will bring.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The soothing, palliative doctrine of optimism x was injected into the minds of men to blind ' them to the result of policies and practices giv-‘ ing them a shallow exuberance of feeling, en-r- thusiasm, and hope as a substitute for the sound , logic of cold facts. Urlder its delusive sway the course followed is not considered so long as everybody is bubbling over with optimism. This theory has exploded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BAD PROSPECTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To build a foundation for future prosperity for all men, society must be lifted up to a condition of faith in God and man, present capitalized indebtedness must be scaled down and thereby interest reduced (the boon of the nonproductive and the burden of the productive), to a point comparing with the real value of the property represented. This will in turn prepare the way for the laboring man to share in the benefits of the labor-saving machinery by the reduction of the number of hours worked. Much of the European indebtedness must be cancelled in order that foreign credit may rise, and likewise the rate of exchange. To do all this would mean a great loss to those in power and control. To change a religious fanatic is impossible. Certainly the prospect for the immediate future in business is gloomy when the false spirit of optimism is ignored and reason is cop-suited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Is it not possible that these conditions are those described by the prophet Zechariah (8: 10) when he said that ‘^before those days there was neither hire for man, nor for beast,” and by the prophet Isaiah (35: 8) who declared that “the wayfaring man ceaseth,” as a prelude to the clash of forces ending the present age and introducing the new? Can we not picture in our minds the exercise of the power among those in control in the dispensing of the few jobs remaining for the benefit of their allies as is indicated in the thirteenth chapter of Revelation ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">j. 1' AM employed as a movie operator: and it X has just come to my attention that my employer, who is a Catholic, has been inserting a ' ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small advertisement in a small public-school</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper which states that this slip and 5 cents</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* will admit one to a show on Saturday afternoon. * Regular admission for children is eleven cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Saturday feature picture was very favor-G. able to the Catholic faith, extolling the virtues * of the priests, and showing great reverence for them.

<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">B</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">enjamin Franklin, in his “Autobiography,” writing of his ancestors, has this to say: </span><span class="font8">“This obscure family of ours was early in the Reformation, and continued Protestants through the reign of Queen Mary, when they were sometimes in danger of trouble, on account of their zeal against popery. They had got an English Bibl^ and to conceal and secure it, it was fastened open with tapes under and within the cover of a joint-stool. When my great-great-grandfather read it to his family, he turned up the joint-stool upon his knees, turning over the leaves then under the tapes. One of the children stood at the door to give notice if he saw the apparitor coming, who was an officer of the spiritual court. In that case the stool was turned down again upon its feet, when the Bible remained concealed under it as before.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THREE PROVISIONS FOR LIBERTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many such occurrences were doubtless fresh in the memory of our forefathers who wrote the Constitution of the United States; and they, realizing that the spirit of intolerance would live on, embodied in that Constitution the following clause:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press; </span><span class="font8">or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our forefathers here in Virginia, realizing the wisdom of this, and knowing themselves of the intolerance which preceded the birth of our nation, embodied in the Constitution of this state, on June 13, 1776, a like clause, and this clause was again stamped with approval in 1902. The exact wording of this passage in the Virginia Constitution reads:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“That religion, or the duty which we owe our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and, therefore, all men are equally entitled to free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience; and that it is a mutual duty of all to practice Christian forbearance, love and charity towards each other.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is yet one other Constitution to which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">wish to refer. I have not a copy handy, therefore, I cannot quote; but I can state with certainty that one clause of this Constitution binds those who are under it to support the United States Constitution. The Constitution to which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">have reference is that of the American Legion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Two things cause me to recall the' incident which I shall relate: (1).It is the second anniversary of my life in the truth; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) the </span><span class="font10">reading of Franklin’s “Autobiography,” quoted ' above, coupled with the fact that these same city . officials of Roanoke are up for reelection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">VIOLATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All Bible Students will recall, how, in spite of National and State Constitutions, they were . compelled for a period of years to keep their ' “Scripture Studies” under a “joint-stool.” This, however, was only a part of the religious in- ' tolerance of our city which led to the following &quot;&nbsp;unlawful act, perpetrated under disguise of “law and order.” Bible Students know, too, that nothing ever “happens,” to Bible Students, and . they will understand why such things occur. \</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. A. H. Macmillan, of Nova Scotia, was scheduled to deliver the lecture, “Millions Now •' Living Will Never Die,” at the National Business College, Roanoke, Virginia, United States of America. The meeting had been well advertised and quite a crowd turned out to hear him. “Then,” if I may borrow a phrase much in i use that day, “the fun began.” Before Mr. Mac- ’ milhin could enter the hall, he was grrested by an officer. This officer had no warrant; but Mr. Macmillan went quietly with him anyway, not desiring to violate the law in the slightest de- . gree. He was carried to the jail and locked up, though no charge was made against him, and ' though he repeatedly inquired to know the charge. He was held for several hours and then released to catch a train for New York; but no &nbsp;&nbsp;“</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark28"><span class="font10">warrant was ever issued, nor a charge of any</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark29"><span class="font10">kind lodged against him. After he had been</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark30"><span class="font10">taken to the jail, the contents of his suit-case</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font10">were emptied upon the floor in an endeavor to find “something,” I know not what. The address ' , that Mr. Macmillan was to deliver was made at the same hall on the following Sunday by another speaker. True, Mr. Macmillan might have gotten redress to some extent in the courts; but . for some reason that his persecutors perhaps cannot yet understand, he did not resort to such methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I think, however, that I could enlighten them on the subject; for instance, when Peter, coming to the Lord’s defense after Judas had be- d trayed Him, cut off the ear of one of the enemy, the Lord reproved him, saying, “Put up again ■ &gt;&nbsp;thy sword into his place: for all they that take</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x J </span><span class="font10">the sword shall perish with the sword.” (Matthew 26: 52) Again, &quot;And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">a»</span><span class="font10"> testimony against them.” (Luke 9:5) There are-many other instances alsoj which Mr. Macmillan perhaps thought of</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">; for</span><span class="font10"> the conditions in Christ’s day were very much the same as today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SHEEHAN OF THE LEGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mr. Macmillan was arrested on complaint of one Timothy Sheehan, a Norfolk and Western Railway machinist, whose brother I understand is. City Councilman Sheehan. Timothy Sheehan was also a member of the American Legion; and the “fun” was pulled off, it is alleged, in the name of the Legion. There are five members of our Council, three of whom are, the Mayor, W. W. Boxley (who gave the orders in the case of the arrest of Mr. Macmillan); R. H. Angell; and Sheehan, whose initials I do not know. I had never known the Mayor to act on his own initiative before; so when he made this move at the request of the Legion without even consulting Mr. Angell, he must have felt quite shaky. Whenever there is a speech to be made or anything of importance to be done, it is usually done by Mr. Angell, who acts as his logos, so to speak; and anyone may see that in this case he violated two Constitutions, while the Legion participants violated three. We see also that they were the real violators of the law.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">■ The writer was not then a member of International Bible Students Association, I date my age from that day. I had felt sometime that there was a Protestant-Catholic combine in the politics of our city; and when the Mayor acted thus, I knew instinctively that there was merit in the thing he was fighting. Therefore I-immediately set out to find what I could concerning the matter—I was then an infidel product of the churches. Their different creeds and doctrines were such a jumbled, tangled web that I had long since thrown them over along with the Bible. I saw, too, that none of the men with whom I came in contact- believed the things taught; but as stated, I realized that here indeed must be something meritorious, so . I procured the Seven Volumes of “Scripture Studies,” and as would be the case with almost all rational-minded people, I found that here was truth! Here was Bible harmony! The Bible became a new book to me, and ever since, I have been daily feasting on its wonders ;_and since readjusting my telescope, I accept it all— from the first line of. Genesis One to the first line of Apocalypse Twenty-Three.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Now, what does all this show to us? To me, it illustrates two things very positively: (1) It </span><span class="font9">illustrates </span><span class="font10">the fact that nothing ever “happens” to the I,ord’s people, and that religious intolerance has the same effect today, that it had in Reformation days; (2) it illustrates the fact that right on up to the time when the Stone, mentioned in Daniel 2: 34, shall have finished its crushing work, zealous Bible Students are </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">going to</span><span class="font10"> study and expound the Scriptures, while the liberty haters and religions bigots are going to try to prevent it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This article would not be complete, did I not compliment you on your articles, “Go To Church, Thou Fool,” which tille, I understand was taken from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Banner-Herald</span><span class="font10"> of Athens, Georgia, and was a slogan adopted by ten- of the principal churches of that city. This reminds me that even as far back as Franklin’s day the “Protestants” had begun to slip back into the outstretched arms of the mother, church; for, while Franklin advised his daugh- ■' ter to go to church, I fed certain that it was simply because there was no I. B. S. A. class for her to attend. Here is what he said to her: “I do not mean to say that you should despise sermons of preachers you do not like; for the discourse is often very much better than the man, as sweet and clear waters come through very dirty earth.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.'</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">e. Sherman Rogers, in an interview to the Boston </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font10"> favors land grants in lieu of a borius to soldiers. The idea is not new; and, I believe, veterans of the Mexican War were given such grants when they applied for them. Where is this land to be found, and what will be its value? As long ago as 1876, in our Western States land was being taken that would blow away as soon as the bunch grass on the surface was destroyed, and crops were taken off that did not pay for the threshing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Allowing that the young Veterans secure land, how are they to work it? Most of them are unmarried and have little or no money; and the greater number are from the cities, and have no training to qualify them to follow an occupation that requires a knowledge of soils, crops, and business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A kinsman of mine, who went to a farm in Ohio after the Civil War, thought that after the crop was planted he would be able to sit in the shade arid watch it grow. When he found that the work was then but just begun, he returned to his job in the Navy Yard, sadder and wiser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A very hard-headed Scotch farmer, for whom I worked years ago, declared that if he got fifty cents a day for his labor he was doing well. He had 160 acres of good prairie land with a house on it, a team, two cows, pigs, and hens. With ■ a wife to help run the place, he was able to work J seventy acres. Anyone that has had to do with / a farm will tell you that a single man cannot , run one alone, even though he may have a team and other stock; and that the more stock he has, ' the less farm work of other kinds he will be able to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To give the land to the Veterans will be to give the land over to speculators, who would be able to buy it from needy holders, who would not be able to work it and, in many cases, would not be able to reach the place of its location. The,banks will not advance money on the security of unimproved land; and most of the grants would lie like our railway grants, a hindrance to the development of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The young single man that tries to farm it alone will find himself in as bad a fix as the widow with five or six young children, the only difference being that he can, if he will, dispose of his encumbrances to the butcher. The single man who has found himself tied to a cow, and a bunch of chickens that had to be fed regularly, ' will understand what it means, and will most, emphatically say: Don’t.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">How About It, Mr. Ratti ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By L. D. Barnes</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It seems rather strange to one not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">so initiated </span><span class="font10">that a fellow making such claims would have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">specialize on knowing “what not to do.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Some </span><span class="font10">exhibition of power that would distinguish </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">worthy successor of St. Peter, or the “Vicar of Christ,” would be more in order. Peter just would not stay in prison. He could not be kept there because the angel of the Lord turned </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him </span><span class="font10">out. Jesus insisted on going about and doing good. Evidently there is a “nigger in the woodpile” because a “Rector of the World” should be a citizen of the world, and able to command that world’s respect through good and unselfish deeds performed for its lasting welfare.&quot;Nearly 2,000 years”—less 517 years—of this “RectoP’ and “Vicar” business should begin to show up on the credit side of the world’s ledger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We humbly suggest that, in this hour of the world’s sorest need, the pope divest himself of empty and meaningless titles and lay aside </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">musty robes and gowns and pompous claims of the darker past, or else produce the goods. The world is weary of this mountebank acting and this Santa Claus deception! Put up, or </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">shut up!</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">HE following from the pen of Arthur Brisbane, one of the great syndicate writers, and from his oft and friendly references to the Church of Rome, evidently himself a Catholic, deserves notice:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Cardinal Eatti becomes pope under the title Pius XI. His photograph shows a strong, thoughtful face, with a high forehead, a most serious expression. Upon him falls a burden that the popes have carried for centuries, almost 2,000 years. Their influence reaches into every corner of the earth, into ice houses in the North, and huts on the equator. They must understand not one nation but the whole world. And above all they must know what </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">not</span><span class="font8"> to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The photographs of plain Mr. Ratti do indeed show a very good face. But the photograph of “Pius XI” in medieval robes shows a frightened, cringing individual. The same face is hardly recognizable. Evidently the feeling of being crowned “Vicar of Christ,” “Successor of St. Peter,” and “Rector of the World,” etc., etc., ad i</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">nfini</span><span class="font10">tum, was not accompanied with the confidence and inherent and inerrant powers that should go along with the exalted “office.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Busy Bee </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Joseph Greig</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font18">T</span><span class="font10">HE most careful art of the engraver, when viewed under the microscope, reveals but scratchwork, while nature has engraven upon every grain of sand the most beautiful crystals of which the mind could conceive. This thought of the crudity of human workmanship and the economy and beauty of God’s workmanship was forced home upon the writer by reading the following article on “How Bees Keep Warm,” taken from the Philadelphia </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Public Ledger'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Next time you feel chilly try to warm yourself by shivering. That is the way bees do it. Bees are coldblooded animals. Nevertheless, they must keep reasonably warm in winter, lest they freeze. The hive is usually out of doors; it contains no heating plant, so the bees are obliged to furnished their own heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“It is an old story that the worker bee literally works herself to death. In the summer time, when there is a plentiful supply of nectar to be gathered from flowers, ' she toils so hard that an insurance company would not guarantee her life for more than six weeks. In winter, under favorable conditions, she may live six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But during a very cold winter bees have to work so hard to keep warm that by the time summer arrives • they are unable to perform properly the arduous tasks incidental to building up the colony to its full numerical strength. And they die off faster than their places are taken by newborn members of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“When, as winter comes on, the temperature gets down to a certain point the bees gather into a spherical cluster in the hive, those on the outside forming a sort of shell, with their heads toward the centre. The shell may consist of several layers of bees, which move actively about, fanning with their wings and agitating their bodies with a kind of shivering—the object of this performance being to keep the cluster warm. Incidentally the shell serves as a heat-insulator. The bees inside remain quiet, except for occasional shifting of position. With the help of proper aparatus, the amount of energy developed by a man, or a dog, or a horse, can be determined by measuring the heat given off by the body. All of the energy produced by the burning of food as fuel in the body eventually appears in the form of heat, . which is reckoned in terms of calories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Thus the heat (or energy) output of an average man actively engaged at hard work during the day is about 4000 calories in twenty-four hours. The daily output of a lumberman toiling arduously in Northern woods in the winter-time might be as great as 7000 calories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The bees have got even the lumberman 'beat.’ Two scientists, R. D. Milner and George S. Demuth (the latter a bee expert), tried the thing out recently with a' colony of 9635 bees, duly counted. They found that the energy production of each bee was much greater, relative to weight, than even that of the lumberman; and it was maintained not merely for a short time, but</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">through the whole twenty-four hours and the whole winter.”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EFFICIENCY AND FIDELITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Such exactness and a rangement as noted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the foregoing should eidist our deepest trust </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in ' </span><span class="font10">the primal work of the Logos throughout all </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the • </span><span class="font10">vast expanse of nature. Moreover, such faithfulness in the minute things of the lower orders, must likewise draw out the finer responses of all intelligent beings unto praise and love. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The story is told of an atheist who while crossing a pumpkin patch stumbled and fell hard to the ground. Arising in anger he cursdd the Maker of such handiwork, saying: “If I </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font10">God I’d never put vines on the ground for people to fall over. Now look at that big tree with little acorns on. Why didn’t the Originator put the pumpkins up there and the acorns on the ground ?” Meanwhile the speaker had approached the tree, hat off. Hardly were the words out of his mouth when an acorn fell sharply on </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font10">bald head. Crying out with pain the atheist exclaimed: “I’m glad that wasn’t a pumpkin!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Surely it is folly to try to improve on nature.<sup>; </sup>Throughout all eternity the eye will never tire of examining the wealth yet hidden in nature’s laboratory. Indeed, the trouble has never been with the paradise of God, but rather in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the - •_ </span><span class="font10">“prodigaling” of the human heart from the great Father love. Soon this barrenness of soul is to feel its native hunger ;man will return to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">Giver of every good and perfect gift. Witness then the flux of blessings world-wide in harmony with every divine tenderness and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">grace. </span><span class="font10">All hail such a reconciling prospect and such </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a ~ </span><span class="font10">giving-up of self upon Jehovah’s footstool!</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As mentioned heretofore in some of our articles in The Golden Age, this joy and oneness can be experienced now rather than be postponed to a distant time when force will decide the issue. Furthermore, while knowledge </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">has &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">much to do with our focus on things of the kingdom, nevertheless, love must take the initiative and soften us to warmth like the busy bees by cuddling up to the Center of all attraction, the true God of love and of all comfort, the compas-' si onate One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Therefore let us become bees of this hive during the long cold spell of sin’s winter, ready at the signs of spring to gather more honey from the blooms of the incoming Golden Age. Let lis determine at once to erect as many barriers f6 temptation as possibly, making the tongue an</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">In a remote period all the matter which now makes up our sun. and planets was in a nebulous condition. A nebula is an immense mass of intensely hot material in a gaseous state. The nebulous mass, as it gradually and slowly concentrated, drew together into a more dense condition and gradually set up into a spiral motion ; the greater mass of the formation concentrating at the center. As this rotative motion continued through untold periods of time the -central part gradually condensed into a large spherical body, while lesser portions of the gaseous masses which surrounded the central portion also condensed into smaller and independent bodies, these bodies continuing to revolve around the main central body and held at their respective distances by the balance of two opposite forces, namely, the inward attraction of the main central body and the opposite centrifugal force of the smaller bodies. These smaller bodies, being less in mass, naturally cooled down comparatively rapidly on account of being separated from the main central mass. The smaller bodies thus separated from the main mass formed the planets and their satellites, while the large central body formed the sun. It is from this period that we will follow in a very brief way the various further stages of development of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the mass of the hot gases which constituted the early condition of the earth were all the ele-' meats of which the earth and the atmosphere are composed. But all the material and every substance were then in the gaseous state. There are three states in which matter exists, viz-: gaseous, liquid and solid. There is another.theoretical or fourth state known as the “electronic state” of matter, 1 he absolute, common or fundamental state of all substance. Thus in the process of cooling from the gaseous to the liquid and from the liquid to the solid state, the less volatile and heavier gases passed downward through the liquid into the solid state, forming the basic, igneous rock — granite, basalt, etc., the bottom of the crust of the earth. Following this came other materials of a more volatile nature depositing themselves in various layers or strata one over the other, in the upper </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">which were the various mineral deposits. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CLOUDY CANOPY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Just before the later p'recipitations, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">when the </span><span class="font10">minerals and water were held off as gases, they must have constituted an impenetrable canopy extending for miles around the earth in every direction. The motion of the earth on its axis would extend to these gases surrounding it, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">the effect would be to concentrate them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font10">particularly over the earth’s equator in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ring</span><span class="font10">like formauons. As the earth cooled, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font10">would cool and thus be resolved from </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">gases into </span><span class="font10">liquids and solids, the weightier minerals </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">gravi-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">tating in strata toward the bottom. The earth at this period probably resembled the present appearance of Saturn with his “rings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To account for our moon we may assume that in the breaking up of the nebula a comparatively small mass condensed and cooled separately, so close to the earth that the attraction of the earth was greater than that of the sun. But instead of starting on an independent orbit around the sun, it started around the earth, held in its path by the balance of the attractive force from the earth and the repelling centrifugal force of the moon, just as the earth and other planets are guided in their orbits by a similar balance of forces between them and the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FALL</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> OF THE CANOPY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the cooling process of the earth advanced, ' the detached and distant rings would gradually acquire a different rotative motion from that of the earth and thus gravitate closer and closer, and as they approached her, would spread out like a great canopy, but would not be permitted to fall because of the circumambient air or atmosphere, which acted as a sort of pneumatic expanse, preventing the direct precipitation. One</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">after another these descending rings would . spread out above the atmosphere and go in the direction of the two poles, where there would be the least resistance because farthest from the . equator, where the centrifugal force is the greatest. The breaking down of these rings, long periods apart, furnished numerous deluges and'piled strata upon strata over the earth’s ■ &nbsp;. surface. The waters rushing over the earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot; \ would distribute variously the sand and mud </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;"><sub>L</sub></span><span class="font10"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and minerals, the strongly mineralized water</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">*7^ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">thus covering the entire surface of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. These great deluges of water and minerals ■ followed each other perhaps thousands of years apart. The deluge of Noah’s day was the last, * it being of pure water only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some scientists claim that the earth has still</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">F. ' The period of the earth’s development in r. . which the early deluges took place is known as the Azoic or lifeless period. During this period </span><span class="font17">Mt'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">as the earth’s surface was cooling, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and under </span><span class="font10">constant increasing pressure of the deposits precipitated the crust buckled or wrinkled. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">depressions became the ocean beds, and the up- , heavals the mountain ranges. The waters </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">gath</span><span class="font10">ered together into the seas and oceans, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">upheaved land began slowly to drain off in pre- <sup>1 </sup>paration for vegetation. This draining </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">must . </span><span class="font10">have required a long time. As. further precipitations of great masses of water and minerals i took place, great gullies were washed between the mountains. As the draining </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">progressed ’■ </span><span class="font10">land began to appear; and the atmosphere, heavily charged, with carbon was very favorable . for the development of plant life, -which then began to flourish exceedingly. The earth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">still </span><span class="font10">had considerable heat in its crust, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">oceans were warm and highly carboniferous, and the air was surcharged with carbon to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">extent that breathing animals </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">could not then </span><span class="font10">exist. This was extremely favorable </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to gigantic </span><span class="font10">growths of vegetation. Plants </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that now grow </span><span class="font10">only a few inches or a few feet high, even at the equator, then attained a growth of forty </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to ■ </span><span class="font10">eighty feet and sometimes two </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or three feet in . </span><span class="font10">diameter, as is demonstrated by fossil </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">remains. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FORMATION OF COAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At this period our coal beds were formed. \ The giant vegetative growth of plants -and i mosses had a great affinity for carbonic acid ■ gas, and stored up within themselves the carbon , which formed the coal. While thus preparing our present coal deposits, the atmosphere was being purified for the animal life of a later epoch. The vegetation presumably passed into . a condition -resembling our peat beds. These vast peat-bogs and moss beds in turn were covered over by sand, clay, etc., coming under great : pressure as they were washed over from results of further upheavals and depressions of the ! earth’s surface, by tidal waves and by other de- . scending “rings” of water from above the at- : mosphere.. This procedure must have been oft repeated; for we find coal beds one above an-. , other with various strata of clay, sand, and. ' limestone, between. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As the denser and more opaque materials ; were precipitated, the expanse covering the J earth became more transparent; and the. sun be- i gan to be slightly visible through the heavy banks of fog and the still carbon-laden atmos-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BBOOKLTM, N.I,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">phere, the influence of the sun being necessary to prepare for higher forms of plant and animal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During this period the cretaceous organisms </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">the sea formed beds of limestone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REPTILES AND ANIMALS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">Reptilian period also began about this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">time. </span><span class="font10">The warm oceans of the earth began to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">swarm </span><span class="font10">with living creatures, from the jelly fish to the whale. Reptiles living partly in water and partly on land belong to this period, during which the present continents and islands were gradually rising and again subsiding, at one time deluged by larger or smaller “rings” coming down and at another washed by tidal waves, thus accounting for shell fish, etc., found in the highest mountains. Swarms of untellable trillions of little creatures lived, and dying dropped </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font10">little shells forming in all parts of the</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Iridiagnosis</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> AM </span><span class="font10">here in America on a visit and to introduce a new improved diagnosis and a new method of healing, to do my bit in ameliorating the great distress upon the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The diagnosis is built on the saying of an old philosopher: “The exterior is the interior.” In other words from the exterior of a man his inner being, his disposition, his character and his physical health can be discerned. Knowledge and judgment of human nature and character play a most important part in every department of our social life, and should therefore be taught as one of the chief studies in our schools. How much advantage could be gained and how many disappointments in life could be avoided, if discernment of human nature and character were in the possession of the majority, or at least could be found in all who are serving the people as leaders and as teachers! Then, as Frederick the Great complained, there would not be so many people in the wrong place </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and</span><span class="font10">'missing their calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The eye trained in this science notices at once the characteristic variety of human beings in their form of body, in their walk, in their contour, in their voice, and in their look. As the form of the sky. the earth, and all that surround us speak to us with noiseless eloquence, so also with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">human being. The crowning</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">earth immense beds of limestone, composed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">al</span><span class="font10">most exclusively of conglomerate shells. These beds of limestone are sometimes called “shellfish cemeteries.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The great prehistoric animals of which traces and remains are now found in various parts of the earth, belong to this period. These monsters lived on the rank vegetation and attained enor- • mous sizes, some of them over eighty feet long. Skeletons representing some of these great animals can be seen in museums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Gradually the carbon-laden atmosphere became more pure and vegetation less rank, and the higher order of animals came into existence, the heavy-boned sloth and mammoth giving way to the less bony varieties common today. Vegetation developed varieties of higher orders such -as herbs, vegetables, fruits, etc. Thus gradually and finally earth was prepared for the coming of the highest of all earthly creatures, the human race.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">N </span><span class="font10">THE November 9th issue of The Golden . Age favorable mention is made of the Ensign remedies (Battle Creek, Michigan).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been my privilege to have a number of years of remarkable experience with these preparations, and I can testify to their effici</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Twenty years ago I became deeply interested in physical culture and dietetics. Ten years later I became interested in biochemistry. During these twenty years I have come in contact, time and again, with every system of disease treatment offered to the public. It is my honest conviction, based upon experience and observation, that the Ensign System of Biochemistry is the most efficient and economical means that can </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">employed to correct almost all abnormal men</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tal </span><span class="font10">and physical conditions. More than that, it will enable anyone to become absolutely free </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">to remain independent of doctors who employ drugs, medicines, vaccines, serums, and surgical operations for diseased conditions, It will be difficult for most people to place much credence in this statement; so I desire in a succeeding article to give histories of typical chron</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ic and </span><span class="font10">acute conditions, showing how great is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the scope and power of these remarkable pre-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">^parations, and also to show the cost of cure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Ensign remedies are strictly biochemio—• </span><span class="font10">that is, they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font10">prepared </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in accordance with </span><span class="font10">the laws that govern the chemistry of life. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font10">are neither drugs nor medicines, except in the sense of being corrective. They are physiological foods. By this is meant that they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">are dupli</span><span class="font10">cations of the finished materials that compose the cells and tissues and glandular products of the body in health. It is this feature that distinguishes biochemic preparations from all drug and medical preparations. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The food we eat is crude, unfinished material. To be of use in the body it must be converted into finished materials such as are required to produce healthy cells and tissues and glandular products. These finished materials are manufactured in the “mills and factories” of the body. If, for any reason, the body’s “mills and factories” fail to manufacture standard materials, the cells and tissues and glandular products will be imperfectly formed, and a state of disease created. Nearly all sickness and disease, and physical and mental imperfection, are due to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">failure of the body’s “mills and factories” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">manufacture standard products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The only way that such conditions ever can ba corrected is to supply the body again with the elements in which it is deficient —- not in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">the GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">crude form as found in food and in drugs and medicines, but in the finished form as found af</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ter </span><span class="font10">haying passed through a perfect functioning digestive and assimilative apparatus and set of glands. Nature, with and without the assistance </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">dietary, hydrotherapic, osteopathic, and chiropractic methods, etc., often accomplishes this; but frequently the recovery is unnaturally slow, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">in not a few instances the trouble cannot be corrected. Biochemic preparations, being duplications of the finished materials that compose the cells and tissues and glandular products of a healthy body, supplement nature by furnishing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">finished materials that nature cannot prepare from the food, and, in so doing, prevent sickness and disease which could not otherwise </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">prevented, and correct physical and mental conditions impossible to be corrected by any other method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">As a preventative of disease I have found biochemic preparations unequalled. In the treatment of sickness and disease they insure a far more rapid recovery than is possible by the mere use of any drugless method. They cure frith ease the majority of cases which refuse to yield to drugless treatments. More than this, they will assist anyone—even the artist’s model jmd the physical culturist—in coming closer to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">point of physical exercises and dietary methods.

<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">N</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ew Yobk City,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> in </span><span class="font10">common with several other places ’in the world, has a Hall of 'ame, in which memorials are kept of men and women who have done or are supposed to have done something for the betterment of the human race. The Hall is located at New York University.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">.Among the Americans that have been awarded tablets in the Hall are: Daniel Boone, the great pioneer; Mark Twain, who has written an imperishable record of the civilizations of America and Europe; Frances E. Willard, who difl more than any other one person to bring about prohibition of the liquor traffic in the United States, and who, before her death, announced herself a Socialist; Patrick Henry, who .preferred death to passing through another era like that of the Tumulty-Wilson reign; Roger Williams, who was chased out of Massachusetts by the Puritans because he was a real Christian, and who thereupon founded the State of Rho.de Island; James Fenimore Cooper, who preserved a readable record of the North American Indians; Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">good physician, a good teacher of literature and a fair poet. Andrew Jackson, who stood for the rights of the plain people and against the .rising power of the financial interests of his time; and Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury, who placed the United .States upon its feet financially and was afterward slain in a duel with Aaron Burr, printer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The men and the women who made these choices did very well, about as well, we think, as anybody could have done with the material at hand. They seem to have tried to pick out really meritorious persons among the myriads that in the-United States have had their little day of fame. They will be criticized for their omissions, but additions can always be made.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> AME </span><span class="font10">is a great thing. Back in the days of the Assyrian and Babylonian monarchies </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the rulers </span><span class="font10">built tablets upon which they recited </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">almost inconceivable atrocities they had committed, such as piling in a single pile the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">living </span><span class="font10">bodies of thousands of captives, and set</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ting fire </span><span class="font10">to the pile, and putting out the eyes of other captives and leading </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">still others away by </span><span class="font10">chains passed through rings in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">their lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few centuries later, in the days </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of Julius </span><span class="font10">Caesar, the Assyrian and Babylonian </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">varieties </span><span class="font10">of fame were no longer admired; and so </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font10">have Caesar boasting alternately </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of his con</span><span class="font10">quests of peoples whose sole offense was that they desired to retain their liberties, and not </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font10">swallowed up by the Roman Empire, and then of his magnanimity toward the vanquished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only a little while back, the famous men of the earth have been butchers. Indeed, the righthand man of the ancient </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Babylonian monarchs </span><span class="font10">was the butcher. He butchered </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the animals </span><span class="font10">roasted in the barbecue, and he did </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">what legal </span><span class="font10">butchering of prisoners the king felt like </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">having </span><span class="font10">done. And butchers, those who have slain </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">most of their fellow men, caused the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">greatest </span><span class="font10">miseries, the most broken hearts, the most ruined homes, the most devastated fields, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">most blind, insane, armless </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">legless </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">cripples, </span><span class="font10">have been the most famous, as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the statues wit</span><span class="font10">ness in every city </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Financiers have seldom been famous. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">They </span><span class="font10">have rarely sought the interests of their fellow men, except to seize those interests for themselves. Exceptions are Peter Cooper, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">founder </span><span class="font10">of the Cooper Institute; George Peabody, founder of the Peabody Institute; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Benjamin </span><span class="font10">Franklin, the printer and philosopher.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Tp </span><span class="font10">AME in one country means little in another, and especially little if the language of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">two countries is different. To a German Goethe is the greatest author. The average American vaguely thinks that the word Goethe probably describes some variety of cheese or sausage. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To </span><span class="font10">a Spaniard Cervantes is the greatest author. The American thinks that this has a grand sound, and that it probably fits some general or politician of whose achievements otherwise he is a little uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The fame of modern generals is the same </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font10">that of modern politicians.

<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>About Santa Claus </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Gerald Barry</span></h2>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">HE name </span><span class="font10">&quot;Santa Claus” is an American corruption of the Dutch form “San Nicolaas” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">'(St. </span><span class="font10">Nicholas), whose festival used to be ob</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">served </span><span class="font10">on December 6th. From early times feasts were held in this saint’s honor in England and Germany, though subsequently they became confounded with the Christmas festivities. As many are not aware of the origin of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">custom the following extract from the “Encyclopedia Britannica” may be of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Nicholas, St., bishop of Myra, in Lycia, a saint honored by the Greeks and the Latins on the sixth of December. His cult is as celebrated as his history is obscure. All the accounts that have come down to ns are of a purely legendary character, and it is impossible to find any single incident confirmed historically. The main facts of his life are usually given as follows: He was bishop of Myra in the time of the emperor Diocletian, was persecuted, tortured for the faith, was kept in prison until the more tolerant reign of Constantine, and was present at the council of Nicea. It should be observed that this last circumstance is ignored by all the historians, and<sup>1</sup> that St. Athanasius, who knew all the notable bishops of the period, never mentions Nicholas, bishop of Myra. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“There are nearly 400 churches in England dedicated to St. Nicholas. He is the patron saint of Russia; the special protector of children, scholars, merchants, and sailors, and is invoked by travellers against robbers. . . . A legend of his surreptitious bestowal of dowries upon the three daughters of an impoverished citizen who, unable to procure fit marriages for them, was on the point of giving them up to a life of shame, is said to have originated the old custom of giving presents in secret on the Eve of St. Nicholas, subsequently transferred to Christmas Day. Hence the association of Christmas with 'Santa Claus,’ an American corruption of the Dutch form 'San Nicolaas,’ the custom being brought to America by the early Dutch colonists.”—“Encyclopaedia Britannica,” Vol. 19, page 648.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The question may be asked: Is it wise to encourage the “Santa Claus” custom, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or should</span><span class="font10">..Y children be told the plain facts of the matterfcik'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To those who love honesty and truth, thefu-*' is but one answer to this question: Such </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">arte </span><span class="font10">bound to discourage everything akin </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to false- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">7~ </span><span class="font10">hood and deception. It would be better </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">every</span><span class="font10">way to point children and all to the real </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">spirit * </span><span class="font10">of Christmas — that it celebrates in a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">general </span><span class="font10">way the great gift which God provided for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the ... </span><span class="font10">salvation of our race; namely, the, gift of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s ' </span><span class="font10">dear Son, who was born into the world As </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the . </span><span class="font10">Babe of Bethlehem. (Luke 2:10-12). </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">On tjiis </span><span class="font10">point Pastor Russell has well said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Although we cannot agree that this (December 25th) is the proper day for celebrating the birth of our dear- • . Redeemer, but must insist that it was about October 1st, nevertheless since he did not intimate his desire that we ■ -should celebrate his birthday it is quite immaterial upon what day that event, of so great importance to all, is celebrated. Upon this day, so generally celebrated, we ’■ may properly enough join with all whose hearts are in ' the attitude of love and appreciation toward God and toward the Savior. The habit of giving little remembrances one to another at this time of year seems to us especially'appropriate. God is the great giver of every good and perfect gift. He is continually giving and we are continually receiving from Him; but amongst all' • His gifts the one of greatest importance to us is the gift of His Son to be our Redeemer. While, therefore, ‘ thanking the Lord for this great gift and for the great . ■ plan which centered in it, it is appropriate that we &nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">cultivate in our hearts the spirit of liberality, generosity, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">...according to our conditions and circumstances..... ? We recommend that every little gift on this occasion &quot;&nbsp;should, as far as possible, represent or be accompanied ' by some little remembrancer of the great gift—some- ■ thing to draw the mind of the recipient to the fact that the great gift of God in Christ is and should be in the ~ minds of all who give or who receive the trifling exchanges of the season.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower,</span><span class="font8"> -1903, page 457.-</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Let US be Just to All </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Prof. John T. Read</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b. Editob: Believing that you would not willingly deviate from the high standard of “Fact, Hope and Conviction” which you have set in The Golden Age, I venture to call your attention to an article appearing in the issue of March first which does not seem to measure up </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font10">that standard. I refer to the article on Christian Science by O. L. Rosenkrans, Jr. You may be aware that my wife is a Christian Scientist —in fact, has been an earnest member of that faith for nearly twenty years, and is, I believe, recognized among them as a capable exponent </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">their doctrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I mention this fact because I think it gives me </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">advantage of knowing pretty thoroughly the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">effects </span><span class="font10">of Christian Science upon the character </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">lives of its adherents; and I feel constrained to say that I think that Mr. Rosenkrans </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font10">not been quite fair in some of his statements. For instance, his very marked insinuation that these people are lacking in moral character </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">that they can ‘lull their conscience to rest </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">find justification for selfish and suppressed instincts” (see page 247) is quite without foundation, as my experience and observation has proven them to be conscientious and morally sound. His statement that “there is no moral obligation involved” is certainly misleading and would cast a slur upon great numbers of honest ' and upright men and women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">My wife has naturally played a large part </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the training of our three sons, and I must say that I can find no fault with the moral standard to which she is teaching them to conform.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">T HAVE </span><span class="font10">been thinking upon the statement of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A Mr. H. E. </span><span class="font10">Branch in The Golden Age that “price is not value,” and pondering in connection with it the pointed queries of Florence L. Robinson as to “what is a labor unit.” Then, too, I have “been thinking of Senator La Follette’s speech in which he denied that the deflation which the country has been suffering is a natural phenomenon, but insists that it was artificially produced by thg powers that </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">control the </span><span class="font10">credit of the nation, the Federal Reserve Sys</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Frankly, I am puzzled in attempting to draw </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font10">idea of where any of us can find a base for valuation. Not many years ago it was commonly said that value could not be legislated into anything, but nowadays it is beginning to look as if legislation is the real foundation of valuation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The railroads, byjiermission of law, are regulating the value of transportation. The labor unions have to some extent based the value of labor upon the hour. But all values are measured by the dollar, and the banks are permitted</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">to inflate or deflate the circulation of the dollai and thus to control its value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Constitution gives Congress the poweixtol jj coin money and to regulate the value thereof. Congress has coined the money, but has never so much as attempted to regulate its value, except through the banks. If its value was'regu-lated by some intelligent and really patriotic *. men, with an attitude towards the whole people differing from </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font10"> attitude which has been char- J acteristic of the Federal Reserve System, it ■ would seem that this value would be like the transportation rates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A given amount of money would then always buy a given number of bushels of wheat, pairs of shoes, hours of work, tons of steel, acres of land, etc. But all these things would have to be placed in grades of classes, in the same manner -. that freight is classified in the schedules. It is legislation that has made the yard the measure -for cloth and the bushel for wheat; and I suggest that it may be the province of legislation- -to make the dollar really stand for something in the way of value, which at present it can , hardly be said to do, in*any accurate sense.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">lady speaks of “mineral salts in their natural L &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or organic form”. These mineral salts are not</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' organic but inorganic, just as water is inorganic; and both are used just as they are taken ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the body. They are with the organic con</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">of these minerals”, whereas nuts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as a class .are </span><span class="font10">deficient in salts, and so it is well to eat com-' mon salt with them, which aids in their digestibility. Arid she leaves out meats, which run high in salts, as well as other food-principles. She says that “there is really no difference between whole-wheat flour and true Graham flour”. There is a difference, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">it is this: </span><span class="font10">Graham flour is the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">ivhole</span><span class="font10"> wheat grains ground up into flour. Whole-wheat flour has the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">outer </span><span class="font10">bran coat and the germ removed, and will </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">keep, </span><span class="font10">because the germ is taken out. Graham </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">flour will </span><span class="font10">not keep very long; for the germ, which is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">left </span><span class="font10">in, provides excellent food for maggots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In reference to Beri-beri, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">think you will </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">find </span><span class="font10">that the Japanese army was the afflicted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">army </span><span class="font10">about which there was so much comment; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font10">their diet was principally polished rice. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">When' </span><span class="font10">they substituted unpolished </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rice </span><span class="font10">for the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">polish</span><span class="font10">ed, the difficulty subsided.

Today, - virtually the will of all humanity is under Sat </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">tan’s spell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan has been sometimes misrepresented L </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">misunderstood. His purpose with'humanity </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">\ is not </span><span class="font10">entirely wanton, malicious destruction, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">but partly a </span><span class="font10">constructive program, whereby hur manity may achieve its own salvation </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">by its own</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">efforts,</span><span class="font10"> ignoring Jehovah. It is well written (Volume VII, &quot;Studies in the Scriptures,” page </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">304 </span><span class="font10">of the cloth edition and page 152 of the magazine edition) that the gospel of Satan is calculated to promote a fraternal spirit among men, a degree of material welfare that will ”iake </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">this </span><span class="font10">world such </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">comfortable and congenial hab</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">itat </span><span class="font10">that the absence of Christ will not be felt and God will not be needed. It endeavors to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">make </span><span class="font10">them so satisfied with this life that they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">shall </span><span class="font10">be totally indifferent to the life hereafter. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">gospel of Satan is one of works, whereas God tells us, “By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">God.”—Ephesians 2: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Satan’s plan is to foster certain beneficent impulses and to induce humanity to center its </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">hopes </span><span class="font10">on material welfare in this present world, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font10">which he is the presiding genius. Hence </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font10">poses as a healer and physician for all the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ills to </span><span class="font10">which flesh is heir; but his system is an </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">uns</span><span class="font10">table one, containing within itself self-destructive elements.

<p><span class="font10">The Bible is a book which was constructed most sagaciously. The more it is studied, the more' of a marvel it becomes. Every part exactly serves its intended purpose. Even the meter is adapted to convey specific impressions. If an argument is presented, you are confounded by the irrefutable logic; if a warning is conveyed, the words are pregnant with portent. If there is a triumphant assertion of Jehovah’s power, they ring with exultation; if a rebuke of sin, you are made to feel how disgusting </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">contemptible sin is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">BIBLE WRITTEN FOR MAN'S MENTALITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Many people fail to appreciate the fact that the Bible is composed to fit human mentality. , The Almighty needs not to praise Himself, nor to gloat over the helplessness of the poor worms, His creatures. He fs not writing to Himself but to us; so He adapts His ideas to our feeble understandings, as we write Mother Goose jingles for very young children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In our arrogance and ignorant presumption we criticize the Almighty because His ideas are not up-to-date according to our most advanced theories. But He wrote for all times; and the marvelous feature of His book is that its text is adapted to the understanding of all times. What was written over two thousand years ago was not obsolete in the Reformation, and is not now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The symbolic pictures of Revelation made </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">powerful appeal to a people whose ideas of natural law were rudimentary. What a striking picture is that of the King of kings galloping out from the vault of the firmament, followed by the white hosts of heaven! It is like a piean of victory, conveying the sense of the onrush of irresistible might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The beauty of the language of the Scriptures grows on one. Nowhere else is there anything comparable to the ringing sentences of God’s Word. One peculiar feature of the Book is that if you read it, you involuntarily believe. Your reason may reject it as nonsense; all your pet theories and preconceptions may be upset; but in spite of yourself you will believe, and tremble. Maybe you will shove the Book aside, de-</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">dare not, not if you still cling to “the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh and the pride of life.” The Master said: “The darkness hateth the light, and they that are in darkness come not to the light, lest the light make manifest their -darkness.” There is a rebuke on every page of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">REAL GOODNESS STILL IMPOSSIBLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We realize that it is impossible for anyone to really be good in “this present evil world.” Mrs. Eddy claimed that sin is non-existent, and pretended to prove it by Holy Writ. Mrs. Eddy was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">dupe of Satan, and her inspiration was not divine truth, but the author of all lies. The Bible which she falsely quotes is a witness against her. We are all sinners; the best we can do is to try. The message to the world is for repentance. The gospel message, with its sacrifice unto death, is for the church only. To follow in Christ’s footsteps is to invite the special enmity of the ruler of this world. It is equivalent to temporal suicide. The disciples were not promised an earthly reward, excepting as part of their reward was to rule and judge the world during the Millennium,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THE RANSOM THE TOUCHSTONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When the Snake draws you, you may know that it is the Snake. Any doctrine based on the devil’s first lie, “Ye shall not surely die,” is of the Snake. Anyone that denies the resurrection in the flesh is of the Snake; likewise anyone that ignores the fundamental importance of our Master’s sacrifice of His human life to ransom the life forfeited for Adam’s seed by Adam’s sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Our Master is Alpha and Omega, the first and the last. As the Word of God He created the universe; Himself being the first and last direct creation of God. He is “the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers: all things were created by him and for him.”—Colossians 1:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">He healed the infirmities of humanity not by “psychic power,”but by yielding up to othersHis cwn vitality. He was the second perfect human being, as Adam was the first. Adam did not yield his health to others; so it took him 930 years to die, after he received sentence. But</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jesus’ sacrifice lasted during the three andoae^:; half years of his ministry. He was thirty-threiq' and one-half years old when He died, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">th&amp;’ </span><span class="font10">average human life is about thirty-three </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">andr </span><span class="font10">one-half years. Jesus’ method of healing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wack </span><span class="font10">the reverse of “psychic law.” He possessed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">nai-<sub>( </sub></span><span class="font10">raculous powers, but used them sparingly, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and* </span><span class="font10">only for specific purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'j</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DIVINE LAW STILL REVERSED</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In this world, which is under the curse, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">law of Gqd is reversed; therefore to live </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">un</span><span class="font10">selfishly is to suffer depletion of health </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and vi</span><span class="font10">tality. Whether intentionally or not, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the good </span><span class="font10">and unselfish people surrender their strength toy the hard and selfish. Unselfishness in this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">world </span><span class="font10">spells weakness and failure; selfishness </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">M. </span><span class="font10">strength and is the road to success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Master and His disciples deliberately-made themselves living sacrifices; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">whoever, </span><span class="font10">even commences to obey divine law, violates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the-, </span><span class="font10">laws of Satan, and is punished therefor. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">This, </span><span class="font10">is a mystery which few are able to comprehend^ and so the majority of professed Christians </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font10">come unconscious hypocrites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span></p>

Indeed, they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">justify* </span><span class="font10">their conduct by the law which, under present conditions, pervades all life, saying, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“The big’ </span><span class="font10">eat the small; the small eat the little; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the* </span><span class="font10">little eat mud.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only during Christian ages has the world? come to understand dimly that the divine </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">law </span><span class="font10">of the universe is the reverse of the laws </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">here</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">governing nature.

<p><span class="font10">In our day many professing Christians </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">con-<sup></sup></span><span class="font10">fuse the holy spirit with “psychic law.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">What </span><span class="font10">they recognize as “psychic law” and of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">devil </span><span class="font10">in others, in themselves they suppose to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be -the </span><span class="font10">holy spirit and divine.

The distances <sub>s</sub> - between star and star, planet and planet, ex-■ ' pressed in thousands of trillions of miles, are ‘ incomprehensible to the human mind. The huI ■ man understanding is incapable of conceiving - ‘ the number and arrangement of the celestial ( bodies, and can only exclaim in wonder and amazement, as did David the Psalmist: 'When I consider thy heavens; the work of thy fingers, y the moon and the stars which thou hast ordain-t • ed, what is man that thou art mindful of him<sup>1</sup>?” Mr. Serviss lays it down as a fact that all of &quot;&nbsp;these stars, suns, planets and planetary sys-terns are subject to law and principle, and be. hind all law and principle we discern a thinking, ; willing being, the Creator. Even to suppose that the laws and principles which guide and control f ' the different planets, suns, and systems of planets and suns in their rotation and on their orf bits are the product of evolution is both absurd and preposterous. The planet Earth, the most ? - important unit in the universe to the average y man, is just a speck in the scheme of things ■_ universal, and according to Mr. Serviss is sonie-C <sup>v</sup> thing like 360,000 trillions of miles from the &lt;&nbsp;celestial centre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">y It will be recognized that the Earth, in com-i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inon with all the rest of the planets, is subject</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">All down through the history of the world there stand out, above the general mass of mankind, men of giant intellect who </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have endeavor</span><span class="font10">ed to fathom such mysteries as the universe </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">y its origin, life and death, human destiny, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">questions of similar character. These philoso- ' phers, while not having the truth, speculated and .theorized as to what was the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">truth. Their </span><span class="font10">theories and speculations today are taught </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">as * </span><span class="font10">truth, even though facts demonstrated in a thou- . sand ways have shown them false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One great difficulty in the past has </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">been that </span><span class="font10">, S these philosophers have tried to dissociate </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i~. </span><span class="font10">Earth and man the inhabiter. That cannot </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10">done. The business of the scientist is<sub>t</sub> to search , out and discover the established natural laws . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">and principles and the manner of their operation, and then harness them to do his bidding. The funniest thing in the world about this is the fact that so many of these scientists who </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">have ? </span><span class="font10">such a large measure of intelligence as to disover these laws and principles and the manner of their operation and then set them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to work, </span><span class="font10">have somehow got it into their heads that their ' forefathers were monkeys playing cocoanut catch. You know a monkey could not figure ■ ’ out such things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But about the laws and principles and the ’ y&lt; forces and powers resulting from the active -operation of law and principle, which man, the mighty atom, has discovered and harnessed -to ~ do his bidding: “Man, who has harnessed Ni- <sub>s </sub>agara and liquefied the air, stands at the sea- ’ side, bridle in hand, ready to ensnare the tides, and banish manual labor from the world.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The very worst feature of the whole situation y is the fact that these established </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">natural laws,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">634</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">principles, forces, and powers are being systematically used by man for the one purpose of destruction. It is true that everybody looks for </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">reconstruction period ahead; but to think that for thousands of years the human race has been using- whatever knowledge it could acquire for the purpose of destruction is disheartening; and, as has been already shown, this present generation has at its disposal the sum of all the knowledge and experience of 6,000 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It does not require a very shrewd observer to discern the fact that “the next war” so much talked about will be so terrible and conditions generally so indescribable, that “except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved.”(Matthew 24:22) Twenty years more of this sort of thing would see the earth desolate and empty, with not even a memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Let us suppose now, that this present condition of things keeps up for twenty years more. Famines and pestilences everywhere, crime increasing, labor and capital a seething pot, dirty politics, profiteering and grabbing galore, and such a condition as this in all civilized countries. Add to this the greed of nations for more territory, every nation of any consequence building up its agressive forces of armies and navies, while the agents meet at the peace table and the disarmament conference, and the military forces, left behind, take no chances, but prepare for “the next war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To the sum of all this add the prevalence of tuberculosis, insanity, venereal disease, one-half of our young folk, boys and girls, attending the free clinics. Foot this all up, and multiply the . grand total by the hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness lurking in the breast of the dissatisfied labor element, in the breasts of men in the bread-line—men who went over the top in France now going over the bottom at home, waiting their turn for a hand-out. There you have a mild-view of the situation—of “civilization.”</span></p>

From here the inhabiters go to purgatory fof about a thousand years; and when they get kicked out of purgatory, they roast and toast, boil and blister, stew and frizzle in hell fire forever and ever and then some! The brains of the human family are in such a pitiable condition that it is a wonder that half of them have enough sense left to feed themselves!</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">W</span><span class="font10">HY do we speak of the “Golden” Age?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Why apply this adjective to the period to which mankind looks forward with desire and the expectation that in it all man’s golden dreams shall become actual facts? Is it because we have become so accustomed to the “Gold Standard* that all our ideals are or are to be measured, by it? Of course not. Then do we use the term unconsciously, without thinking? As individuals is gold our highest standard of value? &lt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">■' Usually any period of prosperity is thought ■ of and spoken of as a “Golden Age”; but really he only Golden Age this earth has ever seen 'was a short one enjoyed by just two human lieings. They were Adam and Eve in their primeval innocence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Perhaps gold was unknown then. Gold is not absolutely necessary to a golden age. Gold is, or was until recently, the most precious of metals, the most ductile, malleable, and submissive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Submission to the great Jehovah is the first requisite of the Golden Age. It will open the way to many golden hours and golden opportunities. Gold can be refined to perfection—fitting symbol of things divine. Job uses it as an emblem of purity, and Job will be an authority in that Golden Age; for he will be there. “When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.” (Job 2^: 10) There will then be a higher standard than the “Gold Standard.” The life of a human being will be the new standard of value.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">(Isaiah 13:12) and a man will not be judged' fellowship throughout eternity with the great</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">“wise” by his success in his accumulations of “gold.”—Job 20:12-20, 28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font10">kind of wisdom that will obtain in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Golden </span><span class="font10">-Age, Job advises us, cannot be bought for gold, but will be very necessary. “The fear</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">[reverence] of the Lord, that is wisdom.”—</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Job </span><span class="font10">28:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So we have come to name that time a golden age in which those noblest, highest of all ideals and aspirations that ever animated the human heart will be in process of attainment. In process, we say, for man is always happy when he hopes, and what he hopes he both desires and expects. That will be a resurrection, restitutionage. A fitting emblem might then be green in color. Gold is bright yellow, lustrous, solid sunlight, if you will. Hammered thin, it is green: in the light. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Some day those hopes will be attained, the striving ended. The time will come when the Mediator Christ and His work for man shall fully have been completed—not merely a ransom paid, but the ransomed perfectly redeemed, * a full deliverance from sin and death effected, and every human being a human son of God and worthy of the name—ready now and fit to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Father of all.—Matthew 24:14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then the real age of gold begins. Perfect purity, perfect light (knowledge), perfect wisdom, perfect submission to the rule divine—-God’s Golden Age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">J</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">EHOVAH </span><span class="font10">employs two ways of impressing </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">lesson of the exceeding sinfulness of sin upon men and angels.' To men he permits the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">actual </span><span class="font10">experiences of sin and death. To angels </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font10">permits the observation of the same phenom</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ena. “For I </span><span class="font10">think that God hath set forth us </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">apostles last, as it were appointed to death; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">for we </span><span class="font10">are made a spectacle unto angels and to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">world, and to men.”—1 Corinthians 4: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">St. Paul </span><span class="font10">is here making a special and a limit</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font10">application of this lesson of observation to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">himself </span><span class="font10">and his peculiar situation. But it has a larsrer and more general application, if we look </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">at the </span><span class="font10">marginal reading, i. e., theatre, a public show or spectacle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Shakespeare gives this thought full expression when he says: “All the world’s a stage, and men and women are but actors.” And that is just what our earth is, a great theatrical world of condemned criminals, proving by their actual </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">experiences </span><span class="font10">the exceeding sinfulness of sin and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">its result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In this great theatre all the actors die upon the stage—for six thousand years. Then begin the seventh thousand years of resurrection and “restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.”—Acts 3:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Here is the tragedy of eternity, and the drama of divine love of all the ages that are to be. Jehovah, in His divine wisdom, is having this tragedy of death and the drama of love in two acts, woven into one grand spectacle, over a period of seven thousand years. It can never be acted again; for there is but one only begotten Son Christ Jesus, and there will never be another Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">God wants no machine-made men or women or angels. Good and evil are eternal principles; but Jehovah, the God of the Bible, is a God of ’ love and goodness, and will create no world that will remain half good and half evil. The evil must perish, and the good alone will survive. That is why Satan was cast out of heaven, and*</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">It is on this earth of ours that the battle be-</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">i '</span><span class="font10"> tween good and evil will be fought out; and this battle and4ts results will be heralded as a vivid, never-to-be-forgotten lesson of observation to all creatures in all the worlds of God’s creation. While the making of this earth as the scene of this battle has caused great suffering, pain and death, yet it has brought great honor to this .world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is out of this world that Jehovah has chosen the New Creation of divine sons who will all be partakers of Jehovah’s nature. And it is - these divine sons, the 144,000 who are to carry to all worlds this lesson which they have witnessed and in which they have been actors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• Is it reasonable to suppose that Jehovah is</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">concerned only about our little world? Is. it-jg reasonable to suppose that He will put </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">all </span><span class="font10">worlds through the same sufferings, sorrow,. ; pain, and death for thousands of years that pur:<sup>7 </sup>little world has gone through? Such a plan would necessitate the making and the_ dying of millions of Christs and the perinitting of millions of Satans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah seeks free-will worship, voluntary service. Nothing less would please Him or be acceptable to Him from any creature or 'from any world. If He can obtain this from any crea- ’ ture or from any world by the use of this»lesson of observation, is it not a grand stroke of divine economy and wisdom? So this little earth will be a standing, living, eternal witness to all the . worlds of the justice, love, power and wisdom &quot;&nbsp;of Jehovah as revealed in His great plan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">of the Colonial cause and most of us have in memory his burning words: “Give me liberty or give me death.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">No thwi th standing the fact that man is more or less a free moral agent in that he possesses a will which he may direct for good or for evil, yet man is not free in the true sense of the term. Physically and mentally he is in bondage under the great curse of sin and death. This is an unnatural state or condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\ '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Physical freedom alone means little. Liberty. of mind to “roam abroad and trace creation’s wonders o’er” is more to be prized. Freedom of intellect to reason from the standpoint of a perfect man is the greatest freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the statement that men were created equal I must agree; but with the thought </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font10">there is now any physical or mental equality I must emphatically disagree. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">We see about us </span><span class="font10">various grades of intelligence ranging from the feeble-minded and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">insane to the broadly </span><span class="font10">cultured minds of college </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">graduates of various </span><span class="font10">degrees.

<p><span class="font10">That this pictures a condition beyond </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">human': </span><span class="font10">power to remedy all must admit. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">That only, </span><span class="font10">complete physical and mental equality can bring <sub>r</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font10">happiness and full satisfaction each should be able to realize from experience. Thus the ques-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">tion arises: How did man lose his freedom, and will it ever be regained?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first man, Adam, possessed liberty and freedom. He was a perfect creature. He had the power to propagate a perfect race of free and equal human.beings; but before exercising his divinely given power he forfeited his life, his liberty and his freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">For failure to obey the just laws of his Maker ' Adam was placed under the curse of death. His captor, Satan, has deluded Adam’s posterity with the false idea that through human power complete liberty and freedom can be restored to the human race. But still the statement of the Psalmist holds true: “None can by any means redeem his brother nor give to God a ransom for him.”—Psalm 49: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Through Christ alone, the Super-Champion for life and liberty, will the original and niuch-to-be-deSired condition be restored. He it was who counted not His life dear unto Him. He willingly sacrificed it that mankind might possess life, liberty and happiness in greater abundance. To Him humanity’s rights to life and liberty have been entrusted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This Being, the divine Christ, is soon to restore these forfeited rights to humankind. From this we see the supreme court of divinity to be the greatest judiciary. The courts of man may pass a sentence of condemnation on an individual supposedly designed to protect society, but this same court does not have power nor wisdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">sufficient to cause the sentence to ultimately work out a blessing to the unfortunate one on whom sentence is passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Thus divine wisdom excels human wisdom, and God’s ways are not man’s ways. It is by the exercise of these attributes that God purposes</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">to be just and yet be the justifier of the many. <sub>; </sub>The divine sentence was justly passed; but di- =,-5 vine wisdom has devised its removal; and when ' mankind have restored to them their original _ liberty and freedom of mind and of body which V father Adam enjoyed, they will know how t® ’ - -X rightly appreciate what they possess. They will J: think twice, yea, a hundred times, before they ‘ v forfeit their life and liberty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- X</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I have sought to picture before the vision of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">the reader an idea of ideal liberty trusting that, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iA</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">coupled with that intense desire for happiness latent or budding in the heart of every individ-. • A; ual, the idea may engrave itself deeper than the -memory of a passing vision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 v</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If I have deepened an appreciation of and ' admiration for equality and freedom, then </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I ' </span><span class="font10">have administered a balm of comfort and hope. My object is to water with the truth the germ of <sup>:</sup> X hope, trusting that it may develop and grow into :A a living reality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I champion the cause of Christ Jesus, the &gt;fs King of Liberty—the Victor over death and the grave.

What had happened ? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..........</span></p>

Father and mother are in the kitchen, talking over matters. “Well, our home will have to go; that is all I can see. We have paid more than half; but Mr. Flynn has closed down on us, and since I was laid off we have'had enough to do to buy bread and butter for us all,” turning around to mother: “Do you know that I have been . out of work for six months'? What is to be done?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Mother leans her head on the table. Her whole frame shakes with heavy sobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The noise in the streets denotes that school is out. Presently in flock five children, all with the same cry on their lips: “I’m hungry, I’m hungry.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Faith, who was sitting on her mother’s4knee, looked up into her eyes, which were overflowing with tears of love and joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Mother,” said the child in a subdued whisper, “this isn’t our house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Yes, dear, it is. Our loving Redeemer provided this for me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“But—we were never rich,” replied </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the child, </span><span class="font10">glancing around the comfortable home. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">“And,” </span><span class="font10">a cold fear stealing into her beautiful eyes, “where is Father?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;String 3: </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the abrahamic promise</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* <sup>92</sup>Some time after Adam and Eve were driven </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' frbm </span><span class="font10">Eden children were born to them, who </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">grew </span><span class="font10">to the estate of manhood and womanhood </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">• and </span><span class="font10">they in turn had children. Cain obtained </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">■ his wife </span><span class="font10">by marrying his sister. Thus the peo-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">pies </span><span class="font10">of earth gradually increased. They all ‘ wandered about in the earth, earning their </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">bread </span><span class="font10">in the sweat of their face. Some of these children were bad and some were good. God </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">showed </span><span class="font10">His favor to the good, as </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font10">always . favors those who are good. Satan exercised his • wicked influence amongst the people and most </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">them turned to evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ ®<sup>3</sup>Noah was a good man, and he and the mem- hers of his family served the Lord Jehovah. ■ Sixteen hundred years and more passed from </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">’ the </span><span class="font10">time of the judgment in Eden (during which ' time the people became very wicked) and there </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">' was </span><span class="font10">great violence in the earth. God purposed </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">’ to </span><span class="font10">destroy all the wicked of earth; so He direefed Noah to build an ark and to take into the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">- ark </span><span class="font10">the members of his family; and this done, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">great flood of waters came upon the earth and all living creatures were destroyed except those </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font10">the ark. There were only eight persons left on the earth after the flood. (Genesis 7:21-23; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font10">Peter 3: 20) Noah and his sons begat children <sub>:</sub> and the peoples of earth again increased. ' Amongst them were some good and some bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Amongst those who tried to do the will of God ‘ was a man named Abram, which name was later changed to Abraham. He is spoken of in the Scriptures as the friend of God. Abraham’s wife was named Sarah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' . “When Abraham was- seventy-five years of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Age, </span><span class="font10">Jehovah said to him: “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">thee: </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">will make of thee a great nation, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font10">I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing; and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.” (Genesis 12:1-3) Abraham with his wife and others </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">left </span><span class="font10">Haran for the land of Canaan. When they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font10">reached a point in that land known as Sichem, the Lord appeared unto him and said: “Unto thy seed will I give this land.” Abraham build-ed an altar there, and the place has since been known as Bethel, which means the house of God. Afterward Abraham dwelt in the plains of Mamre, which is just above the present site of Hebron in the southern part of Palestine. While, there, God made a covenant with him, saying, “Unto thy seed have </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10">given this land, from </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font10">river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates.”—Genesis 15:18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ination of carbon, and economy of gas. It is an oil to be mixed with the gasoline and lubricated valves and firing chamber independent from the lubricating system of the engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Immediate results are noticeable but we fear that this product will in the end injure the motor with its constant </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our suspicion is due to the fact that this being a product of such good results it seems to be unknown in U. 3. where all motorists would receive same with open arms. We believe that such product would be widely advertised, with exhaustive tests conducted by motoring associations, but we haw not seen mentioned the “miracle oil” in any of the motoring papers and magazines of the U. S. which we regularly read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore we would greatly appreciate your informing ua sincerely what are your ideas about “miracle oil” in the certainty that any information you may furnish us will be held absolutely confidential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This “miracle oil” is manufactured by the G. G. Desmond Mfg. Co. of 346 Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn, N. Y.</span></p>
