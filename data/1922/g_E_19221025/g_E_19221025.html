<p><span class="font12">The March of Civilization </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By D. H. Copeland</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">T WAS a dream. It was in the year of our Lord one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two ; I was lying almost asleep in my room, looking none too clearly, it must be admitted, at the opposite wall, whim the prospect changed. I seemed to be standing by the side of a wide road—a road which stretched endlessly in either direction. It was worn by the feet of countless people, and in the immediate vicinity was deserted. When I looked behind me the prospect seemed vague and distorted. It was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font8">though a mist swayed and danced, through ‘ which shadowy figures showed clearly for a moment, then became part of a confused kalei-- doscope that fdled the road from side to side </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font8">far as the eye could see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">f Apparently I could see much farther than Ordinarily would be the case. There seemed to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">immense breaks in the view, as though whole sections of a picture had been removed, leaving One with a confused idea of the whole, but with no information about vital parts of it. There - was vast disproportion in many of the things that went to make up the picture, if picture it was. Many things that were really of little importance in emphasizing the pattern, or theme </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font8">“motif” of the picture, were relatively tremendous in comparison with other things vast-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A”<sup>x</sup>ly more in need of emphasis. I turned from E contemplation of that part of the road with a feeling of uneasiness, as of something vast and terrifying hidden in the disquieting haze.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I looked in the other direction, and saw the road obscured by a mist of much greater den-i.t sity. Nebulous shapes writhed in the gloom; L, and close to where I stood hovered a dense black cloud, from which came a low hoarse rum-L bling and muttering. Behind the cloud the sun was shining; and occasionally a brilliant shaft t of light pierced the gloom, showing up for a py moment scenes so sharply defined that they L gave the impression of being painted on the cloud. These scenes were all of violence and disorder, yet there was nothing of definiteness to them. As ice disintegrates and dissolves under the warm sun, so these scenes changed form and shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Gradually there stole into my consciousness the fact of movement close at hand. Shadowy forms pressed close around me, marching in ranks down the road before me. They came from the direction of the dark cloud, passed the point where I stood, and went on into the haze beyond. A dim figure stood beside me. It was that of a tall man, hooded and cloaked, with his face hidden in a fold of his mantle. Somehow his presence felt comforting. I felt that here was one that perhaps could help me understand the peculiarities of the scene before me. As I looked he grew more distinct. Slowly he raised his head until I could see his face— calm, strong, with clear-cut features and piercing eyes. 1 looked into his eyes and felt strengthened and comforted. The sensation of fear subsided; I felt refreshed and confident. I asked the man who he was, and what was the place in which I stood. He answered in a voice low, clear and distinct:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“I am Truth* said he, “and we stand beside the road of life. Before us lies the future; behind us the past. The point where we stand is the present.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“But what is this sound as of companies of people marching down the road?” I asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“That is the march of civilization,” he replied, “and the reason for your presence here is that yo i may learn something of the progress of man. As I stand beside you here, you will quickly pick up the true concept and meaning of what goes on around you. Look first into the past.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I looked again into the hazy distances which had first greeted my eyes. This time my visioa seemed much clearer. A peculiar quality of refraction that had made many things disproportionate cleared away, and the relationships between the various parts of the picture grew harmonious. The gaps filled in; and the entire theme became less chaotic, more understandable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Truth explained to me that what I saw were the events of history assuming their proper value with regard to man’s progress; and I was amazed to see how many great names, which before seemed to shine luminously in the great ensemble, became dull and tarnished, while some vanished completely, to be replaced by the names of humble ones of whom I knew not. Many events, also, that had apparently been epoch-making in their day became quite insignificant when compared with minor happenings which at the time had received no notice from those who record the history of earth’s great ones. I marveled much at this. Far in the distance appeared a small rounded hill, which seamed to lie to one side of the great road which wound around its base. Beyond the hill I did not seem to care to look; for something which was happening there arrested my attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Up its side wound a narrow path, rocky and besetwiththorns. Along the path toiled a figure that sent a thrill of pity through my heart. It was the figure of a Man, a Man bowed with grief, a Man crowned with thorns, a Man carrying a huge cross of wood upon His shoulder. Slowly He reached the crest of the hill. Shadowy forms darted upon Him. I heard the sound of hammers beating upon the heads of great spikes. The cross was erected, and the Man hung upon it. I heard the voice of the mob execrating the Man. The sound,passed me like the stir of wind over a cornfield, leaving a sense of utter desolation and loneliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The voice of Truth murmured in my ear: “The Man of Sorrows,” and I knew it was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">picture of the Great Tragedy, the senseless people murdering the Just One who had come </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">save them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My eyes traveled to and fro along the great road, and I saw that it was crowded with people. Fast they hurried along, swinging in endless procession past the place where I stood. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">noticed, too, that near where I stood, a huge gate spanned the road, and in its brazen archway was carved the one word, “Death”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Out of the past, through the present, into the portals of death—that was the March of Civili-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">zation! And I thought of the later words </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">o9 </span><span class="font8">that pathetic figure hanging upon the cross,' </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">*1 </span><span class="font8">am he that liveth and was dead; and behold </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">am alive for evermore.” He had passed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font8">the portal of death, but had conquered </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">death it- </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">'vl-self; and because He had overcome </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>f</sup>hcre was </span><span class="font8">,’A' hope for the thousands that every year </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">passed </span><span class="font8">from the present into the past, through </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font8">dread gateway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Turn your eyes now unto the present,” </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">said . </span><span class="font8">Truth; “for it is here you shall learn </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">life’s </span><span class="font8">greatest lesson, and see the victory of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">civiliza-</span><span class="font8">tion. For thousands of years men </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">have set </span><span class="font8">their hearts on reaching ultimate perfection, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be- ‘ </span><span class="font8">lieving that man—-the greatest of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the animals, ' ? </span><span class="font8">endowed with a knowledge which increases </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">eve-</span><span class="font8">ry day, endowed with a wisdom </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and under- •_* </span><span class="font8">standing today greater than that of any </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">previ- ~ j </span><span class="font8">ous age—is just about to solve the final </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">mys- </span><span class="font8">‘ 'i teries of life and, supreme amongst all </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">created • </span><span class="font8">things, rise triumphant over destiny and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">fate. </span><span class="font8">Come, look at the triumph of man!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">looked at the great wide road </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">before me </span><span class="font8">as it is today Before me passed the tremen-dous panorama of human progress. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Countless </span><span class="font8">thousands seemed to be rushing by, heedless </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of -• </span><span class="font8">everything in their anxiety to reach that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">grim , </span><span class="font8">portal of Death. And yet, as they </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">approach it, <sup>f</sup>'<sup>B </sup></span><span class="font8">their faces assumed expressions of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">terror. </span><span class="font8">They struggled madly against the phalanx </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that &quot;&nbsp;” </span><span class="font8">inexorably pressed them on, into, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">through </span><span class="font8">the gate. Madly they screamed for help; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font8">held out appealing hands to each other, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">emp-</span><span class="font8">tied their pockets of gold and jewels in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">an „ </span><span class="font8">endeavor to find some way of avoiding </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the dread </span><span class="font8">gate; but to no avail. One by one they.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font8">swept through, and their places instantly </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">taken </span><span class="font8">by others in the mad rush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the past the throng seemed to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">move slowly, </span><span class="font8">but now they rushed with ever </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">accelerating </span><span class="font8">speed into the maw of Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As my vision cleared I noticed that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">there </span><span class="font8">.J was some semblance of order in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">movement. </span><span class="font8">It seemed to be divided into groups </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or regi-</span><span class="font8">merits, one might say, each regiment with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">its &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">ij.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">officers urging and goading the rank </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and file &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">j</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">along the road. Even as I looked there stag- | i gered past me </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">ghastly throng with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">staring </span><span class="font8">eyes and terror-haunted faces. Many bore gaping wounds, or had countenances </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">twisted </span><span class="font8">and wracked with pain. At their head </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a grim </span><span class="font8">figure marched, carrying a banner on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">which</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19221025_files/g_E_19221025-5.png" alt="" style="width:35pt;height:501pt;">
<p><span class="font4">Ik</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Was inscribed, “The Suicides of 1922,”; and I turned sick with horror as the awful ranks swept by. Thousand of suicides, and number</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ed </span><span class="font8">amongst them, hundreds of children! Think </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">it—that our search for happiness and ultimate perfection should reap, as one small part </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">its dreadful harvest, a crop such as this!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Behind came a huge army numbering millions, the “Army of Drug Addicts.” Capering, gesticulating, laughing madly, many with the fixed grin of insanity, some wildly joyous, some rushing ahead to join the ranks of the suicides, they swept by in numbers that made my head reel. There seemed no end to their multitude; and when I thought that the end had surely been reached, thousands more of new recruits &quot;were swept into their ranks by a swarm of hangers-on and petty officers that hung around the flanks of the marching host. I noticed that there seemed to be thousands of these creatures continually goading and exciting them along the way. Many bore the appearance of respectable physicians; many were apparently of the higher strata of society, whilst vast numbers were of the commoner sort; but all were actuated by the same insane desire to add more and more to their army. What a travesty on civilization that one of its products should be such a horrible array!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Next, in my dream I saw the shattered “Army of Accidents.” Maimed, blinded, with twisted, broken limbs, rushed onward this “Army of Accidents of 1922.” I saw them plainly and the manner of their deaths. Thousands had been killed by railroad trains, thousands more by automobiles. Mines, quarries, factories—all had taken their toll. This army numbered hundreds of thousands, hurled unexpectedly into the grave by the mad onrush of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next came the “Army of Tortured Children”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—the maimed, dwarfed and stunted forms of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">those of tender years forced to work long hours under unsanitary conditions in the factories of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">rich; the poor, wasted bodies of the little</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">B </span><span class="font8">ones who lack proper food and pleasant sur-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">p &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">roundings, fresh air and sunshine; the thou-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">l' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bands born into the world mentally ruined and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">physically unsound as a result of the beastly lust and degrading practices of their progen-j itors; afflicted before birth with unmentionable in diseases which our civilization condones and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">L xb tolerates! What a valuable acquisition to the </span><span class="font8">so-called human race is a civilization that permits such things to continue!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again the scene changed. There came an army of women, the fallen women of our streets, the victims of the lusts and unclean desires of a rotten manhood. By thousands they swept by, to the accompaniment of blasts of discordant jazz music, shrieks of simulated merriment, and the groans of tortured spirits. Many broke from the ranks and rushed rapidly ahead to join the army of drug addicts or the thousands of suicides, so as to be thus much the sooner through the great gateway. And who can blame them for seeking such surcease from so damnable an existence? '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Around the flanks of this vast multitude hung groups of men with lustful eyes; men with sensual mouths. Many clutched cowering girls of tender years whom they dragged and pushed into the ranks by thousands as they passed. Surely God takes particular notice of a civilization which encourages such crimes and outrages; and be assured that He has adequate vengeance planned to recompense the evil of it!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again a huge band of men pressed down the road; hard-faced men; men with shifty eyes; men who cursed God, and reviled the Savior who had died for them; men who planned craftily and schemed how to defraud their neighbor or how by violence to acquire his goods or his prestige.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The gunman, the yeggman, the confidence man, the crooked lawyer, the dishonest judge, the ward politician—all were there. “Birds of a feather flock together.” By thousands they slouched along, watching each other with wary glances, distrusting the intentions of their nearest neighbor; for in the “Army of Crooks of 1922” honor is a thing of the past!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There came a pause, and I heard the measured tread of another huge host. First came the blare of trumpets and the stirring music of military bands. Behind, with solemn mien and sanctimonious countenance, came the ranks of the “Super-Holy,” the bogus representatives of the Prince of Peace. I noticed that as they marched one hand was held before the eyes so that they would not be disturbed in their pious meditations by the sight of the millions in hopeless misery who preceded them down the road. The other arm was held out from the side, with the cupped hand palm </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">up. They carried a </span><span class="font8">motto, “Give, Give.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Truly it was an array charming to the eye, clad in glittering vestments resplendent wuth gold and jewels, which flashed in the light of thousands of candles carried in their ranks. At the head of their group was borne conspicuously a large Book, called the Bible. It was heavily barred, locked, sealed, and swathed in gay wrappings. Upon the Bible was seated </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">life-size figure of an ape, cast in solid gold and richly jewelled. At intervals the group chanted words which were unintelligible to me, but which Truth explained were in honor of the great ape which sat on the Bible, before which they continually made obeisance. I asked him why the ape was so venerated; and Truth replied that it was their common ancestor, or so they believed, and that they had placed it on the Bible so as to give it an air of sanctity. The idea seemingly was to cover up a system of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ape </span><span class="font8">worship with the cloak of Christianity, so as not to offend the more delicate consciences of some of the people by being too openly </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">heathen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the end of this section of the procession marched a group of three people, called Potentates. One, who by his vestments was high in authority in the ranks of the super-holy, carried a number of masks, or false faces, which he put on at intervals as they talked together, so that it was very difficult actually to know what he really did look like. The second was gaily bedizened in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">uniform of rich colors; and across his bosom stretched a string of medals, while at his side hung a great sword. The third wore black clothes of a sober cut, and was of a very hypocritical cast of countenance while in his right hand he carried a small cage containing a figure which Truth told me represented the common people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Occasionally the one carrying the cage would gaze earnestly into it, talking sweetly the while, and dropping small bird-seeds to the figure inside. Quite often, however, he would insert his thumb and forefinger between the bars and seizing the figure, would violently squeeze it, despite its pitiful cries and groans. After each of these pinchings the poor creature would dash madly around inside the cage until, the cage being set down on the ground and the procession halted, the three potentates would gather around and in turn address the manikin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First he who squeezed it would mouth many phrases replete with promises of wonderful</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">things that were about to come to pass. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font8">this did not have the desired quieting effect, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">super-holy potentate would gaze into the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">cage, </span><span class="font8">after first donning </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">mask suitable to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the oc</span><span class="font8">casion, and would mutter incantations, at </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">same time throwing dust into the eyes </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of the- </span><span class="font8">-h imprisoned creature. Should this not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">prove </span><span class="font8">effective, the third figure would draw the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">great </span><span class="font8">j|^j| sword and utter terrible threats, while </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">other two searched diligently through </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">certain </span><span class="font8">documents that they carried for this </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">purpose— &quot;&nbsp;111 </span><span class="font8">the one through the book of the law, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">other through the Word of God (which </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">seenp &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">ingly was invoked only on such occasions), </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">statements written </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">by men </span><span class="font8">of old to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">support </span><span class="font8">and justify the threats of the swordbearer; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and , </span><span class="font8">anything which was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">not found to be justifiable </span><span class="font8">-’'■JS by those two books was speedily made so </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font8">writing into the books statements which </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font8">be so interpreted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I was greatly interested by these </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">things* </span><span class="font8">because this was what Truth told me was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">crowning glory of civilization; and truly it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">a wondrous spectacle!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Behind this group of three came the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">multi</span><span class="font8">tude whose measured tramping </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I had heard. </span><span class="font8">Regiment by regiment they passed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">before me* </span><span class="font8">the “Trained Killers of Men”. Million </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font8">million they strode along, each man with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">slaugh</span><span class="font8">ter weapons in his hand and, swinging at </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font8">belt, a large bottle. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">observed that every </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">little </span><span class="font8">while the men took a drink from the bottle, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">that after the drink looks of doubt and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sus</span><span class="font8">picion would clear from their faces, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">they </span><span class="font8">would step out at a much livelier pace than before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I asked Truth what the bottle contained; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">he told me that it was a mixture of false </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">reli</span><span class="font8">gion which acted as a conscience opiate, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a con</span><span class="font8">coction of degenerate public sentiment </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">which </span><span class="font8">aroused evil passions, and a misconceived </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">par </span><span class="font8">triotism which made homicide justifiable. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font8">seemed to be days before this vast army </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">had </span><span class="font8">passed on its way to the gate of Death; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font8">I noticed something rather peculiar in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font8">meanor of the last ranks that passed me. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Scores </span><span class="font8">of them seemed to be pouring the contents </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">o£ </span><span class="font8">their bottles upon the ground and casting </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">away </span><span class="font8">their weapons.

<p><span class="font8">L’ potentates marching unconsciously at the head of the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">JgL It was from these groups that the mutterings and growlings had emanated which had seemed to come from the dark cloud. I pondered what B ' might be the meaning thereof. Even as I wondered, Truth took me by the arm and pointed</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4">If</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">right into the blackest part of the cloud. A ray </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">brilliant light shot through it from the effulgence behind; and in blazing letters of fire ? the words appeared, “Behold, I come quickly.” And my heart quickly responded: “Even so, ! come, Lord Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' Again the scene faded, the sounds of March-'■ ing feet grew fainter and fainter. The groans and sighs of tortured souls, products of our wonderful civilization, died away; and a great peace fell upon my spirit, whilst through my ' _ mind rang the clarion notes of God’s Word: </span><span class="font6">“And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; </span><span class="font8">- and there </span><span class="font6">shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor </span><span class="font8">crying, </span><span class="font6">neither shall there be any more pain: for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">» former </span><span class="font6">things are passed away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“When these things begin to come to pass, then </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">look </span><span class="font6">up, and lift up your heads: for your redemption </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">draweth </span><span class="font6">nigh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1 I turned my eyes again to the hill in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>1</sup> distances of the past. Again I saw the cross ' of sacrifice, and its pitiful burden. Even as I • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked, a shaft' of light struck full upon it; it</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quivered and dissolved, and in its place stood</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> a </span><span class="font8">gleaming fifrnro with outstretched arms, gaz</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font8">earnestly down the road of life to where I stood. The glorious figure moved swiftly along toward me, passed me, and on into the dark cloud of the future; and as He passed I heard the sound of heavenly music. The words of the song were sweet and comforting; for they told of the victory of the Lamb who had overcome the world, and who would soon bring peace to a weary earth. “For nothing shall hurt nor destroy in all my holy kingdom, saith the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I turned to my guide; and he, too, pointed toward the future. Swiftly he moved toward it; and as he left me he spoke for the last time: “Soon I shall return. Out of these dark clouds shall come Truth, and with him will come the conquering Lamb, and this great road shall be purged of its sorrowing bands; its gate of Death shall be torn down; and joy and happiness shall be found thereon, for ever and ever.” • • •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Perhaps it was all a dream; it may have been nothing but imagination. I think, however, that if we honestly face the facts of the case as we know them, we shall see that our modern civilization is at best a rotten thing, and that this poor sad world needs reconstruction very badly. Thank God that it is “even at the door,” and that soon He will replace this colossal failure with something which will bring true peace and prosperity to everyone who is prepared to cooperate with His righteous law. May it indeed be soon!</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font8">This being a fact, what are the working peo-pie to do during the remainder of the time? There is but one answer and that is: They must be in idleness, enforced idleness.

<p><span class="font8">The writer has never been a spendthrift, but a victim of what the world calls hard luck, including much enforced idleness due to the above cause; and he ventures to say that any man in his line of employment who undertakes to live a strictly honest and honorable life, devotedly striving to serve the Lord and to observe the Golden Rule in the full and complete sense of the word will find himself up against difficulties at every turn.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>“Merrie England” in 1922</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N FEW parts of the world are there as many public welfare plans in operation to help relieve the suffering of the poor as in England. Through the determined efforts of the British Labor Party for decades past, pensions were arranged for the old, cheap insurance for the injured, and doles for the out-of-works. If the management of things were in the hands of working people, these schemes for human betterment would make for the good of all concerned; but the British Government, being no exception to the rule, is run by the rich for their own benefit, and aims to do just enough for the poor as will keep them from open revolt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The doles, or weekly allowances paid to the unemployed, are handed out under the supervision of wealthy magnates or their representatives ; but on one of the London Poor Boards is a man of the people, George Lansbury. Every British institution or department of any importance must of necessity be headed by some person of title, to give it the proper distinction; and at the head of the system of doles is a member of the “nobility.” Mr. Lansbury has seen at first-hand the operation of the doles, and he writes about it in the London </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Sir Alfred Mond and his band of well-paid officials are getting on very nicely with the task of driving the working class deeper and deeper into the pit of destitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The unemployed, the widows and orphans, the aged, the sick, and the infirm are going to have hell during the next few years if this Minister has his way. In an almost imperceptible manner his department is slowly but surely breaking down all the good work which Labor has done during the past thirty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is no longer a question of a humane administration of the Poor Laws. In scores of places what small vestiges of humanity existed have been swept away. In others, the Minister of Health is using all his powers to smother and completely destroy any small privileges the poor enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In Newcastle, after persistent badgering, the Guardians have decided that twenty shillings ($4.48) a week is enough for a man, wife, and family to starve on; and this iniquitous scale will soon operate wherever outdoor relief is being given, unless organized Labor wakes up and says it shall not be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the most barefaced, brazen manner Mond and his officials have repudiated all the talk about looking after heroes. He now declares that the nation, which provides fortunes for millionaires who can spend money like water on all kinds of ostentatious pomp and show, cannot afford to maintain the men who fought and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bled for it. It is pitiable to read letters which come</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">never attended a college, But have tried to learn something each day, Knowledge thusly acquired does not make me get tired,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And I think it’s the most modern way. For the world’s moving forward so swiftly, That things yesteryear which seemed true, Are brightened in lustre so quickly, The light fairly dazzles my view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Excuse me again; I will just drift into rhyme,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And I’m sure it’s high time, To say what I want, But it seems that I eawnt—</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But, laying good English aside, in true American style I must say I surely do get my money’s worth from reading your Fact, Hope and Conviction Journal. For these nice words about your publication, though true, can you spend some of your valuable time to answer something for the benefit of many fellows? These are good reg’lar fellows, who are being invited, coaxed, enticed and cajoled into “joining” at least one of the various modern social clubs masquerading as churches or sects for religious instruction, which to my observation j simply means, “Sign on the dotted line your ' donation for This, That, and Thus, Far, Near,</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Do you think—with all seriousness—that St. Peter, or whoever guards the pearly gates, will honor the O. K. of these Reverends? Anyway, I don’t think that I would like to go to heaven if it is to be filled with ministers (and of course I reckon they will all be there, since they assume a monoply on the place); for I might get to walking backwards from seeing their collars that way. I don’t think I would like to go to hell either, if it as hot as the D. D.’s say it is; and they must know, or they would hardly tell of the horrible place and scare some people so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These United States seem pretty good to me; and if the hypocrites, profiteers, unhappy and unhealthy people, jails, asylums, fertilizer factories and crowded subways were changed to their opposites, and if men could work for work’s sake and for their ideals, not as slaves but free, it would be fine to live here for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can experience the joy of being a man today, with blessings not known of in bygone days; I am the age considered “legal” from the standard of the only nation to date that God ever called His “peculiar treasure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can experience the joy of possessing a phys-cal make-up that knows little pain, due to favorable traits of heredity and proper training in childhood.</span></p>

I know the inner happiness of standing for the rmht when right fails, temporarily, to carry the point at issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can experience the joy of recording human speech as fast as it is spoken; which brings varied subjects to my attention in the best of phrase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can experience the joy of placing words on paper with my nimble fingers by a typewriter at a speed of over a word a second. I can experience the joy of producing music, creating such a combination of vibrations upon my violin that will cause the index of my hearers’ sentient beings or souls, viz., the countenance, to register at my will bravado, fear, mirth or sadness, or other emotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can look with some degree of familiarity upon the starry heavens at night and recognize by name the various suns as in their accurate procession they exhibit their radiance to this and other planets and mark time for us so minutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I can experience the joys of philanthropy and helpfulness, it not being necessary to use all my money or strength to care for my own self.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I arise by music of a victrola instead of an alarm clock; 1 can go to sleep likewise, or listening to an opera, produced miles away, by means of my radio set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I try to practise<sup>1</sup> the Golden Rule throughout^ tin* day. This endeavor begets many smiles and kind deeds, of which I get a goodly share in return, lint 1 do not do any favor for return; therefore I never suffer disappointment.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Modern Printing-Press </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By w. w. Kessler</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font8">VER since his creation, man has sought to make records of his activities for the benefit of succeeding generations; first upon stone, and later upon skins and parchments. Contrast the laborious efforts of scribes to reproduce a volume with the manner in which books are produced today. Contrast the process employed by Gutenberg with the first printingpress, which resembled a wine-press, with that of today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Improvement in the printing-press was very slow from its invention in the fifteenth century until about 1825, when Frederick Koenig, a German machinist residing in London, invented a workable cylinder machine. This was a great step forward from the wine-press method, but much improvement could still be made. The feeder in placing a sheet of paper for printing had no guides, but must judge the correct position with his eye. A helper was required to pull the sheet from the type form below. Later, by means of grippers which held the sheet to the cylinder until the impression was taken, more speed was attained. Still later, some one conceived the idea that stripper fingers close to the cylinder would deliver the printed sheet after the impression was made. Thus, step by step, came what is known today as a two-revolution-cylinder press; the first revolution being the impression revolution, the second the delivery revolution. During the delivery revolution the type form and ink table return to the fountain for ink, while the cylinder delivers the printed sheet. This type of press is used in book work where good, clear printing is required on fine paper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Agility is required on the part of the feeder to keep the sheets coming down at regular intervals. Recently a machine has been perfected to relieve the feeder of this tedious task. It is known as the “automatic suction feeder.” The paper lias only to be placed at the front of the machine in a straight pile. The machine lifts tin<sup>1</sup> pile as it feeds the paper in. The sheets are combed taut at the two rear corners by means of marble like stones encased in a bearing container. At the same time that the i combing is being done, air is forced between I</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19221025_files/g_E_19221025-9.png" alt="" style="width:22pt;height:628pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">the sheets from the sides of the pile to separate </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">them. </span><span class="font8">This operation continues until the suction mouth is caused to come down on the sheet </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">lifts one sheet, holding it about two inches above the pile. Instantly another air-pipe, but this time a blower, is moved forward and down, finding its place directly under the raised sheet on top of the pile. It is so timed that immediately it finds its place where it holds the sheet on the top of the pile at the same time sending a stream of air under the raised sheet, forming </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">thus a </span><span class="font8">cushion of air. The sheet thus held is not given time to settle down again and feel </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font8">home on that pile, but is ready for its jour</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ney through </span><span class="font8">the press. Three forwarding suction mouths now gently pick up the front of the sheet and advance it to the tapes which </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">move </span><span class="font8">it downward to the cylinder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It may be interesting to know that, apparently, this wonderful machine has “brains.” </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Should two </span><span class="font8">sheets start forward the machine </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">finds it out </span><span class="font8">by means of calipers located along the forwarding tapes. By means of cam and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rods the </span><span class="font8">air and power are shut off, auto</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">matically </span><span class="font8">stopping the press. If no sheet is delivered, the same result obtains. Again, a sheet failing to come straight will produce the same </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">effect. The </span><span class="font8">perfect sheet travels down until it strikes the drop-guides above the cylinder. To insure the proper position sidewise for print</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ing, a </span><span class="font8">roller device draws it over against the side-guide. The grippers then carry the sheet </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="font8">the cylinder down to the type for the impression. The impression completed, the cylinder brings the sheet around; the grippers release it, while tiny shoo-fly fingers raise it up on the stripper fingers, which strip it from the cylinder and guide it forward to the tapes. The tapes in turn carry it to the end of the machine, where it is piled and jogged straight. As the sheets continue to be delivered, the pile thus formed is lowered automatically on a platform to the floor. As the sheets are being delivered they pass over a gas flame which removes the static electricity, allowing the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sheets </span><span class="font8">to pile evenly. The same process is repeated when the sheet is printed on the reverse side. They are now ready for the folding machine and the book bindery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sir Rowland Hill, as early as 1835, had suggested the possibilities of a press which should print both sides at once from a roll of paper. In England, the idea had long been made practical use of in the printing of cotton cloth from engraved cylinders. It remained for Richard M. Hoe, of New York, in 1846 to carry out the idea by perfecting his invention for holding type on a revolving cylinder. This laid the foundation for modern newspaper and magazine rotary web presses. Invention added to invention has given us the web perfecting rotary press. From large rolls of paper, this machine prints both sides of the sheet as it passes through, gathering, folding, and stitching the magazine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The double octuple is the largest press, composed of two separate and complete machines, each fed with four, four-page-wide rolls of paper, the gathering and folding apparatus being located in the center of the machine. Each half of the double octuple has nine pairs of cylinders, arranged with their axles parallel, in four tiers of two pairs each, with an additional pair in the lower tier. It prints both sides of four webs of paper at once. The full capacity of a double octuple, when printing all black, is three hundred thousand four-page, six-page and eightpage newspapers, or one hundred fifty thousand ten-page to sixteen-page papers per hour. Eighteen-page and twenty-page papers are turned out at the rate of 112,500 per hour; twenty-page to thirty-two-page papers at the rate of 75,000 per hour. The double octuple under discussion is forty-eight feet long and nineteen and a half feet high, and is composed of 65,000 parts. The weight is 350,000 pounds. It uses eighteen tons of paper per hour, while its cylinders at normal speed make 300 revolutions per minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A large New York newspaper recently added to their plant the invention of a Chicago man which makes possible a continuous run of the presses without the necessity of stopping to paste the end of one roll of paper to the next one. The speed is slackened only when the flying splice is being made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">PYw realize the importance of the printing industry. In the United States at present, printing ranks sixth among the important industries with an invested capital of $1,191, 505, 247 and affording employment to over 287,278 persons, to whom is paid annually in wages the sum of $331, 519,423. The number of printing and publishing establishments is 32,476. The cost of materials used is $571,510,277. The value of the finished products is $1,699,789,229.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The value added by manufacture is $1,128,278, 952.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An infidel a short time ago asked why, if God is in charge of affairs, did He allow the devil to use the printing-press to propagate his lies? Why allow the great interests who control everything to control also the press and use it to lull an unsuspecting public to sleep by keeping from them the facts? My brother, every-</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HAT part of the American public that are making the conditions in the country today are optimists; and to them, prosperity is in sight. They decry anarchy and bolshevism; yet they are actively engaged in creating conditions that can produce nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From a statement in a daily paper of twenty years ago, we learned that there were 40,000 vacant tenements in the city of Berlin, which in part accounts for the fact that German labor at the time was worth but fifty cents a day. In the large cities of America today, there are scarcely a dozen vacant houses. The real estate agencies get none of the renting business now, and it is no use to go to them for tenements or houses to hire. There are no rental cards in the windows, as formerly; and if you want a place, you must trust to friends or look in the daily papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everybody is boosting rents; and when you read of a place to rent, you will know that the rent has been raised to a point that a tenant cannot pay, and that he has been ordered to move. In my neighborhood, a house has just been completed which before the war would have cost $7,000, but which cost $16,000 to build. For the two lower flats, the owner is asking $65 each; and for four attic rooms $45 each. A nearby tenement formerly rented for $18. They are now asking $45 for it. Another place has a rental of $40; the roof leaks, some of the ceilings are down, and there is water in the cellar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everybody is grabbing while the grabbing is good, and their own welfare comes before any thought of others. The cost of shelter more than offsets the reduced cost of living, and even that is again advancing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Boston Harbor recently two ShippingBoard vessels were burned to get the old metal which the hulls contained. The vessels contain- -ed hundreds of cords of wood; and while thousands who are out of work would have been glad for a chance to separate the wood and the iron, if they were given the w’ood, they were • not given a chance.

<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Tax Levying by the Executive</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">MONG the powers of Congress stipulated by the Constitution is the following: “The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congress</span><span class="font8"> shall have power: 1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises....” Nowhere does the venerable basic law suggest that the laying of duties, imposts and excises shall be done by the executive branch of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Yet the Sixty-seventh Congress has reposed in the hands of the President the power to raise and lower duties; in other words, to make such changes in taxation as he pleases. It is much the same power as might be arranged for by allowing the President to change at will the income tax, or any other of the federal schemes, such as the tax on soda water, automobiles, cigars, perfumes, mo vie tickets and bank checks, for screwing enough money out of the people to help pay the cost of the recent Wall-Street war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When something unconstitutional is to be put over, a good excuse (alias, a reason) is placed in the foreground for the common people to look at, while the politicians do the real business behind the shrubbery. In this case a “flexible tariff” was “urged as an essential means of meeting fluctuating world trade conditions.” Other suitable “reasons” were advanced, as popular attention might wander from the foreground and try to peer into the things forbidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The President, of course, was pleased with any small addition to the executive power and wrote to Senator McCumber:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“How deeply I am interested in the provision for flexibility in the tariff bill. ... It has seemed to me that the varying conditions in the world and the unusual conditions following the World War make it extremely essential that we have this means of adapting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font6">tariffs to meet the new conditions. . . . Congress in providing for flexibility must bestow some </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">exceptional powers upon the President. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is well known to the informed that a tariff law is not a public-spirited method for securing proper protection for home industries, as the people are made to believe; but that it is a scheme used by big business to obtain exceptionally favorable conditions for certain industries and worse ones for others. The businesses for which a protective tariff is made by the subservient politicians are those in which big business has much money invested. The goods disfavored with a low tariff are, wherever possi&lt; ble, those made by parties whom big businesj wishes to put out of business. Politicians nevei say what they intend to do, nor tell what they are really up to, but always something else that will appear well to the common people—thfl voters. Then while the populace is gazing mentally at the seemingly good work being done, they have their pockets picked by the political tools of Wall Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is the regular tariff scheme; and when in the formative stage, as when the tariff law was being framed, it produced unwonted activity in the lobbies at Washington, which represent big business and tell the politicians what to do. Never was there such a good chance —except during the war—for laying the legal foundation for an immense theft from the common people, as when the recent tariff bill was being worked over into a law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An ordinary tariff, with its provisions favorable to the favored, is an exceptionally good money-getting means, but it is nothing beside the new kind of tariff. Under a flexible tariff, when the tack industry, for example, needs more money and is unable to get it through the usual trade methods, the lobbyists representing tacks can explain to the executive branch of the government the danger of ruinar tion to the tack industry from foreign competition. The President thereupon exercises some of the “exceptional powers” and proclaims </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">raise in the duties on imported tacks. Or if there is a new company in the pin business with a non-Wall-Street personnel, the pin lobby proves to the President that the pin industry abroad is operating at such high cost as to warrant a much lower duty on pins. Some more “exceptional power” is drawn on; the tariff on pins is lowered; and the disfavored crowd are forced to the wall, so that they have to go out of business or sell out to the pin trust. Then foreign competition in pins becomes acute, and up goes the duty on pins — this time permanently. The possibilities for profit in a flexible tariff are not only endless, but the best yet— for big business. Now, nothing is certain for the business man not in some “well-recognized” trust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The President was appreciative of his new powers, but the men in Congress that actually cared a little for the common people were </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">not 45</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">bo</span><span class="font8"> well pleased, said:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Senator Walsh from Montana</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The pending proposition would be an abandonment of the functions of Congress into the hands of the Executive. . . . Perhaps Congress had better take the advice given, delegate the taxing powers to the President, and go home. . . . Within fifty percent limitation the President under this proposition will be vested with the power to change the tax laws of the country. . . . Outside of the shameful confession made by Congress in surrendering its power, this is very dangerous to the American people to put in the hands of. the Executive this great power of taxation. . . . When you confer on the President the power to levy taxes in secrecy and behind closed doors, as you do in this instance, you put in his hand a tremendous power that may be used for the political advantage of himself or his party, or both. This power not only can be used to make, but it can be used to destroy. Are you going to organize </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> machine that will wrest the control of elections from the people until it becomes so great that a revolution will be necessary to tear it down?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Senator Reed, a friend of the people, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“For hundreds of years, under our Anglo-Saxon form of government, the power to levy taxes and to create revenues has been the great lever employed by the friends of free government to preserve the rights of the people. The action of this body is the reversal of all the traditions and of all the principles of the British and American Governments with reference to the raising of revenues. It is an invasion of the greatest right reserved to the people for their protection. We are breaking down the greatest safeguard there is in our Government. We are traitorously assassinating the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">great principle which has been ingrained in Anglo-Saxon government and liberty. I say traitorously doing :• it; for the man or the body that, by subterfuge and a technicality, will defeat or undermine a great principle of government is guilty of a traitorous-and-Wfaiaed mous act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The most dangerous man in public life is not he who ■ . boldly defies the Constitution; he is not the man who ■ i on a soapbox inveighs against human government or • harangues the mob under the red flag. But when men . sit in a great legislative body and professing friendship , <sub>r </sub>for the Constitution, yet devise a means by which they can technically avoid it if possible, and can accomplish the overthrow of its principle by a sttibtcrfugc, those are the enemies to be feared. That kind of statesman is a , real enemy to his country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If a politician is chosen by the rich and associates with the wealthy, it would be unreasonable to expect him not to favor that class. However estimable he may be in character, however blameless in record, he cannot, but unconsciously side with his friends. It is common report throughout the state of Ohio that five months before the Republican Presidential nominating Convention the officials of a certain great oil group met in an Ohio city and decided that the man to be actually nominated for the Presidency should be the one who was after-wro'd elected President.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The European Situation (Ify </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">a high official in one of New York’s largest banks)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8"> HAVE received the following from one of my personal correspondents in England, which I send to you for your general informa</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">tion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You ask me about political and economic conditions in Europe. It seems to me that the economic question has overshadowed the political considerations, as most of the European Continental Governments are pretty near bankruptcy’ and are struggling against the inevitable necessity of wiping out the greater part of their bad debts, as well as confessing frankly their inability to pay what they owe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In business circles any ray of light in the prevailing darkness is welcomed as a sign that we have reached the bottom. I am afraid, however, that the bottom has fallen out of Europe altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The European workman and agriculturist has from inherited tradition been a hard-working and saving individual. and has slowly created the capital that has been instrumental in developing the New World to what it is today. This fountain of capital is now completely dried up. In five years of madness the savings: of a century have disappeared in smoke; and when the European workman finds that owing to the absence of a stable currency it is useless to economize and save; the very foundations of social peace will be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This is the reason for the general feeling of insecurity and depression that hangs like a leaden cloud over the people of Europe. It is gaining weight in France and Italy; and here in England the condition of labor and commerce is such that they cannot possibly go on paying the enormous taxes much longer. Over £&lt;■&gt;0 millions of taxes were in arrears on last year’s taxes, and more still will be unpaid this year. The picture is not a pleasant one to paint, but I believe you have already seen it the same as I do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It may be that my correspondent takes too pessimistic a view of the situation. At any rate, it is the expression of an intelligent man who is on the spot and in a position to get </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">good view of conditions.</span></p>

The following answer in a measure explains. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I think </span><span class="font8">it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">sufficient interest to publish, but </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">know </span><span class="font8">of no other paper than yours that dares </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to tell </span><span class="font8">the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The begging sheet is headed: National Good Will Elections, conducted by American Committee for Devastated France, etc., 16 E. 39th </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">St., </span><span class="font8">New York. My reply was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Good-Will Committee:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Good friends and fellow citizens: Has it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ever </span><span class="font8">occurred to you that America is being </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">robbed </span><span class="font8">by the most consummate set of ‘Highbinders’ that ever put anything across an en-&gt; lightened, civilized nation, and that nation with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">heart as big as the largest planet?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Has it ever occurred to you that today the press is subsidized by the same interests that put the world into the recent holocaust, bond-enslaved its inhabitants for interminable centuries to come, passed the most iniquitous law (espionage) ever tolerated by a free people, conceal the truth from the public today, distort news, defeat and withhold facts, but allow lies to remain?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record</span><span class="font8"> of May 26, 1921, page 1818, reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In March, 1915, the J. P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship-building and powder interests, and other subsidiary organizations got together twelve men high up in the newspaper world, and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and a sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Who Got America into the War ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">F</span><span class="font8">ROM the same </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Record,</span><span class="font8"> page 1819, we quote . the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“M. Gabriel Hanoteaux, formerly Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of France in his ‘Histoire de </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">la </span><span class="font6">Guerre,’ 1914, book No. 107, page 54, states in effect </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font6">France was ready to make peace in the latter part </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the year 1914, but was dissuaded from doing so by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">three </span><span class="font6">Americans: namely, Robert Bacon, of the finan</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">cial </span><span class="font6">house of J. P. Morgan &amp;&nbsp;Co., fiscal agents </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font6">the British Government; Myron T. Herrick; and William G. Sharp; and that these men represented to French officials that if France would continue the war these three men would organize a propaganda to put the United States into the war on the side of the Allies, and M. Hanoteaux further stated that the sum of money which was provided to goad the United States into the war was too large even for American comprehension.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Where, let me ask, is your sense of humor? What is your estimation of the intelligence of America when, after reading the above, you write: “The fatherless children and the widowed mothers of France are still in a pitiable condition”? Then the audacious, grotesque, incongruous act of placing as president one Myron T. Herrick, one of the three Americans responsible for the horrible condition of these poor people, to be president of the committee for their relief! Why does not this monstrosity who caused the troubles of these poor people get them out?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why should you continue to beg for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">French, who repudiate their great debt owed this country, who repeatedly in their papers hold America and Americans up to scorn ? </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Why </span><span class="font8">should these ingrates, the French, be </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">taken </span><span class="font8">care of, and our own soldiers who saved </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">their </span><span class="font8">lives be permitted to continue to walk </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">our </span><span class="font8">streets, clothesless, penniless, foodless, homeless, jobless, and despised, and prevented from obtaining a bonus by the very ones who forced them into the war, or into prison cells; by the very ones who now refuse to permit our President to grant general amnesty to these political prisoners, causing their families, their innocent wives and little children to suffer unfold agony, poverty and disgrace—and what for? Just because, as M. Hanoteaux’s history shows, the interests and the international bankers threw the world into the recent war for the express purpose of bond-enslaving the world; and they got what they w’ent after!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Daugherty Case</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">N THE </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record,</span><span class="font8"> page 8170, May 24, 1922, Senator Caraway said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Everyone knows how I came into this case. It is not worth while possibly to relate it again. But in the interest of honest history, although the record is clear, I am going to write it again. I was criticizing the President of the United States for refusing to see a lot </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">little children who had come a thousand miles to beg for mercy for their fathers; the President had that day seen two variety actresses, the tallest man in the world and the shortest man. He had seen every kind and variety of man; he was at the time setting out to play a game of golf with his close friend; and everybody knows who he is. He would not see the children. I incidentally said that I presumed if these children had money instead of merely hope, so that they could have employed an influential pardon attorney as the present Attorney General was before he was appointed as Attorney General and could have paid $25,()()() they would have been able to see the President. The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Watson] thereupon rose, and with some heat said that the Attor'icy General had had nothing to do with getting Morse’s pardon. I asked him how he knew; and he said that the Aitorncy General had told him so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The President was just setting out to a game, of golf, and therefore had no time to see these little folks. They had nothing but time, Mr. President; and therefore they were willing to wait until the President should have finished his amusements and come back to his place of business. But they were denied an opportunity to see him; and wandering around in this presumably Christian city on Sunday, they chanced upon a church —a Baptist church—and wanted to go in because services were being held. The usher, I am informed, asked them in; but the policeman, I presume acting under the orders of the people of authority, denied them the right to go in. The President of the United States was in the church worshiping, and these poor little outcasts were told that they must not go in. They were finally taken into some room and heard a lecture on being good to animals, when they had come thousands of miles, some of them, with a prayer on their lips to ask the President to be good to their fathers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The fathers of these little fellows were convicted of violations of the espionage act. I do not know that the fathers ought to have been pardoned; but I know that, unless Jesus Christ was wrong, the children ought to have been received, because somewhere in His Book He said: 'Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.’ But, of course, the present President has revised the text, so that a prayer must have stricken from it the name of Jesus Christ, and children are not to enter church if the President is there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I would like to give you the life history of a few of these little fellows. One of them comes from within fifteen miles of where I live. I knew his father well. He was about as inoffensive a man as I ever knew. He belonged to the ne’er-do-well class, and that is about all that could be said against him. He had conscientious scruples against wearing his country’s uniform in war. He thought that the Bible meant what it said when it commanded, 'Thou shalt not kill’; and he would not go. He has a boy whose name is James. I read from the News that James is twelve. His mother died a year after his father, J. M. Danley, a tenant farmer living near Paragould, Arkansas, was sent to prison for</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">violation of the espionage act. He went to live with another family, and until he joined the child crusaders worked in the cotton fields from ten to twelve hours-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a' &quot;1 </span><span class="font6">day. His sisters May, eighteen, and Irene, fifteen, are with other families and also work in the fields. His -youngest sister Elva, four, is with May. He came morp ’ than a thousand miles from a little, humble home to ask the great President of the United States to grant his father a pardon. He was refused an audience with the President. Then he tried to go to church, and he ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">was refused admission to church because the President of the United States was there.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Another: Three-year-old Helen was born after her daddy. William Madison Hicks, went to prison. He is a grandson of Elias Hicks, who founded the Hicksite •' order of the Friends church, and has never seen his little girl, except when at Leavenworth, on the prison i movie screen was flashed a picture of children parading. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among them was his little girl bearing a banner which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">read : T have never seen my daddy.’ Now he teaches in prison, and the courses he gives are credited toward </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a . </span><span class="font6">degree in Kansas State University. But, as he gets no money for the work, his wife and three children— &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Robert, ten, Rose, eight, and Helen—have been driven from their home in Guthrie, Oklahoma, by poverty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“These are two; there are others, but I wiU not cum- ■ ber the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font6"> by reading them. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I want to pause here long enough to say that I believe the present President is the most gracious man . 4 in manner I ever knew. It is a delight to see him; ’ : ■ and if he ever missed an opportunity to have his pic- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ture taken, except with these little children, I never &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">heard of it. I may say that the President, according : to local newspapers, has been generous with his time; and here is a list of the people he recently took time to see:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">American National Banker’s Association &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Associated Advertising Clubs of America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">National Maritime League</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">United States Cotton Association Motion Pictures Producers’ Association Ophthalmologists’ Association Daughters of American Revolution American Press Association &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“He had time to see David Wark Griffith, Lillian Gish and Dorothy Gish, Freckles Barry, Babe Ruth, and the tallest man in the world, whose name nobody remembers; the midgets, Lillian Russell, and many others. He had time to see all of those; but when » &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">lot of little children weary with thousands of miles of ' . traveling, and with hope in their hearts, because, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">had read these rumors about the President being </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">full . </span><span class="font6">of mercy, came to see him, they were denied an </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">oppor- -</span><span class="font6">tunity of seeing him. It may be that is the thing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">tha [ </span><span class="font6">President ought to have done; I do not know.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">And now, good people of the Good-Will Com- ; mittee, does it seem the proper thing to place</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19221025_files/g_E_19221025-11.png" alt="" style="width:27pt;height:138pt;">

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">on your </span><span class="font8">committee Myron </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">T. </span><span class="font8">Herrick, the man, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font8">practically one of the three men, responsible </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">both the orphans of France and the orphans </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">America, the widows of France and the wid</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ows </span><span class="font8">of America? W'e ask in all fairness: What </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font8">he ever done for the widows and orphans </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">America?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Granting that these men deserved to be in prison, yet why should their innocent wives and children be permitted to continue to suffer while you give your aid to these French widows and orphans?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' We have investigated these &quot;&nbsp;cases and find those in prison are there as a consequence of the most damnable law (English Espionage) ever placed upon a free people! A law that was absolutely unconstitutional was forced upon America through the propaganda of the aforementioned people—of whom Myron T. Herrick was one. Were justice meted out, these propagandists and the thieving profiteers who passed it should be thrust into the prison cells from which these innocent people should be liberat</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ed. </span><span class="font8">The United States is the only country that has not liberated its political prisoners! Many of these people were placed in prison because they simply stated: “It was the rich man’s war”; and they told the truth; it is so recorded </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">our </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now when our Senators have called attention to the facts about the liberation of Morse, who by refusing to permit five cent blocks of ice to be sold in New York City caused, it was said, .fifty deaths a week, our so-called public press denounces said Senators and champions Daugherty. Why? They refuse to print the truth, or Daugherty would not last over night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And who owns these papers? The same people that propaganded America into the war so the interests could make their untold millions. Senator Watson stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“I wonder how many of our people know that the London editor and millionaire . . . Lord Northcliffe, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">owns </span><span class="font6">twenty-eight leading daily papers in the United States and is now controlling the policy of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post!</span><span class="font6"> So far as our foreign relations are concerned we have again become British Colonies. . . . Of course ’Woodrow Wilson began it when he embraced Smut’s elaborate plan for Great Britain’s control of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">world—under the deceptive </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">name of </span><span class="font6">League of Nations, and the conceited Wilson was made to believe </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that he was the </span><span class="font6">author. He was taken to London, put </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to bed in the </span><span class="font6">king’s palace, flatteringly told that he </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was the biggest man that ever led a queen </span><span class="font6">to dinner, and handsomely made a fool of generally. The poor old snob fell for it. But President Harding is following in Wilson’s footsteps. His Four Power Pact is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">bastard League of Nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What we need in America is a few American papers that will tell the American people the truth ; papers that are not owned or controlled by the English or by International Bankers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">An American paper would tell the people that on page 8284, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record,</span><span class="font8"> May 2o, 1922, Senator Watson stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“No Army surgeon ever came from Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">see Morse. A specimen was sent from Atlanta to these Army doctors; in Georgia a specimen of water from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">patient suffering from Bright’s disease could easily have been obtained and sent to these surgeons in Washington. They never went to Atlanta. They never saw Morse. 'They saw the specimen Fielder sent. Where did Fielder get it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And yet the papers print a statement purporting to come from Daugherty fooling the innocent public into believing that these surgeons went to Atlanta and made an exhaustive examination. The truth half told is a lie; and so the American public is being lied to in this case. If the people were told the truth, as printed in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record,</span><span class="font8"> Daugherty would be obliged to resign immediately. But never mind, the people will know the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The American press withholds the fact brought out in the* </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Record</span><span class="font8"> that Morse was got out through the greatest fraud ever put across a civilized nation, and that nation the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The press should print “Attorney General Daugherty—The Morse Case,” page 8719, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cory-gressional Record,</span><span class="font8"> June 2, 1922. Then every red-blooded man in America should demand that President Harding without further fooling dismiss Daugherty. The press should print, from the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record,</span><span class="font8"> May 24, 1922, pages 8166 to and including 8171; and if they are not afraid to let the public know the facts therein given they will save the President from dismissing Daugherty; for an incensed public will'do it for him and they do not need to join or belong to the Ku Klux Klan to give them the courage to do the act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the press of America would print what Senator Watson placed in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Congressional Record,</span><span class="font8"> page 8720, June 2, 1922, as follows, what do you think would be the answer of the American Public?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Mr. President, the newspapers inform us that the </span><span class="font6">noble efforts of Republican Congressmen Johnson and Woodruff to get an investigation of the Department of Justice have been choked down in the other House. That is another of the blunders Mr. Daugherty is making. The American people admire a man who will face his enemies and who, if he has to go down will go down fighting, like the sailor on the battleship and the soldier on the battle-line. They do not love a man who skulks, who slinks away, who will not face his enemies, who will not answer material charges when made by persons responsible as they have been made here on the floor of the Senate by representatives of great sovereign States.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">“Mr. Daugherty has been charged again and again with having falsified as to the Morse case and his connection with it; and he does not answer because he cannot. He has been charged with having ordered the release of the British ship J. M. Young, which came into New York Harbor with a cargo of liquor, in violation of the Federal statutes. It has been charged that T. B. Fielder, the unspeakably corrupt crook, came to Washington City and prevailed upon the Attorney General to telegraph to New York to have the proceedings dismissed and the liquor restored to those who had it in charge. He has been specifically charged with having ordered the release of $200,000 worth of wine seized in up-State New York.

<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>The Force of Youth in Ireland</span></h2>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">CCORDING to one of the foremost living Irishmen, Sir Horace Plunkett, one of the chief factors in the ever-boiling Irish situation, one that makes for continuance of unrest and of blind resistance, is the bottled-up youth of Ireland resisting real or imagined British pressure. In the last few years some twenty thousand young men who in ordinary times would have found vent for their powers in the diffused field of the world to which they would have emigrated, have been obliged to remain on the sland. The total number of ambitious, resistful, and courageous young men is estimated at a hundred thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fatal error of British policy was to think that with military force it could suppress the effervescent power of youth. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The harder the </span><span class="font8">pressure the greater the resistance, it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was dis</span><span class="font8">covered. These young men imagine that the Empire brought to bear its military forces, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">that they have successfully withstood the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">might </span><span class="font8">of Britain. The youthful mind rims on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a single </span><span class="font8">track, and Irish youth will probably have to wait for the supernatural power of the worldwide kingdom of God before it will submit to authority from without. We have great respect for the sincerity of the Irish people in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">matters on </span><span class="font8">which they </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">are convinced; and we look for </span><span class="font8">passionate support </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of the coming administra</span><span class="font8">tion of earth’s affairs on the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">part of a people </span><span class="font8">that will then have a chance, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">unfettered by self</span><span class="font8">ish outside interests.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">W</span><span class="font8">~ E HAVE become so accustomed to things . as they are that we do not always recog-&amp; nize the many absurdities and wrongs of our ppresent arrangements. However, it needs little </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font8"> </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">insigh</span><span class="font8">t to observe the giant figure of big busi-V ness with the dollar sign as a scepter marshals' </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font8">the civil powers, the press, and the pulpit, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">fight his battles and do his bidding. It is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8"> sickening indeed to see the game for material possessions as played by big business today, i, Human hearts become pawns, and the welfare </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">« of </span><span class="font8">whole races of peoples means nothing; for p. gold is trump and the only recognized rule of £ the game is: “Business is business.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Witness the comedy at Genoa. I say comedy, p- but history will write it tragedy. First, Fal-staff comes out with a number of high-sound-f' ing principles; but just before the curtain goes down, the only thing recognizable is a general j- scramble for the oil-fields of southern Russia. ’ ' Oh, and to think those wicked Russians would ' dare to question the sacredness of the fetish of j* modern business and the corner-stone of our ? so-called civilization, “Private Property!” We are still a long way from the Biblical condition | when a man’s life shall be more precious than the gold of Ophir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is the case of Semenoff, a Russian general who, taking advantage of the general sit' nation in Siberia, carried on a looting and . slaughtering campaign, ostensibly fighting against the Soviet government of Russia. But behold the magic of the modern Lamp of Alad-- din, a money-controlled press! You would hard-</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">£ ly </span><span class="font8">trust your eyes; but under a few treatments i by this handmaiden of big business, this brutal leader of half-civilized Cossacks becomes a holy ' ’ crusader in the cause of private property against the infidel Russians who naively consider that such things as oil, etc., belong to the -- people as a whole, just as some simple-minded \ Bible students today feel that salvation belongs i </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">humanity as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">F The climax of this ludicrous bit of acting &gt;&nbsp;came just the other day when Semenoff, simple&gt; minded enough to believe all that paid editorial </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font8"> writers had said about him, comes to these | shores expecting a welcome similar to the one k, given Foch, Joffre, and others. Poor benighted fool, he was in for a rude awakening. His ride ► of triumph was in a police wagon, and New</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">York gave </span><span class="font8">him the liberty of one of its jails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And what do you suppose was the crime thai called for such punishment? Surely our government had just awakened to the fact that the blood of innocent babies and the honor of ravished women cried to heaven for a redress of some kind. Guess again, my good reader. The thing that landed our hero in jail was an alleged theft of $500 from an American firm doing business in Siberia. Think of it, but do not smile; for $500 is $500, and a human life is, after all, only a human life and cannot be deposited in a private bank account. If the angels have any sense of humor, and I believe they have, they must have many a quiet chuckle at the absurdities of humans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is a multitude of laws governing everything, from spitting on the sidewalk to the amount of alcohol permissible in your daily beverage. Yet a few financiers can with impunity order a lockout burdening the hearts of mothers, taking the food out the mouths of already underfed babes, and in general robbing thousands of homes of the joys of living, and still be within the law. Let us see: Who was it that mentioned “straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It surely borders on the ridiculous when, during the recent World War, church organizations solemnly debated whether under the circumstances it would not be right to knit for the boys on Sunday, never once raising the question as to the right or the wrong of the war itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We may be evoluting, but most of us fail to see it. And still we feel, with the friends of Job, that we are the people and that w’isdom shall die with us. As fast as our would-be reformers point to anything that is considered harmful to society, we meet in solemn conclave and pass a law to prevent it. And as laws multiply, lawbreakers multiply, until the thing becomes so complex that you have to hire a lawyer to find out whether you are a good citizen or whether you ought to brush up on your one-hundred percent Americanism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So far, so good; but when one family gobbles up the oil supply of the country, indirectly making life harder for millions of people, there is no law to prevent it; and it becomes heresy even to question the propriety of it. Yes, and more: The men who put these things over on the public get their pictures into our popular magazines and become examples for the youth of the country to follow. Yes; and you and I love to have it so because we hold the foolish idea that some day we may have a chance at the oil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">From our ears down we work for a mere living; but from our ears up we imagine ourselves to be in turn Carnegie, Rockefeller, or Harding. When the masses begin to recognize that there are giants in our days, and that equal opportunity is a myth, the pillars of our present evil world will crumble and completely wreck a social order that was conceived in blood and born in injustice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would be interesting to note here the origin of our modern idea of private property, and to recall how that twenty centuries ago there were God-given laws in vogue among the people of Israel, such as the Jubilee </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">arrange-</span><span class="font8">ment, etc., to check the very evils that are prov-ing the undoing of our present social order </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or, </span><span class="font8">‘J more properly, disorder.

<p><span class="font8">As little Marie remarked to her nurse </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font8">day: “Nurse, you heard me pray to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God to </span><span class="font8">make me a better girl”; and after the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">nurse </span><span class="font8">answered, “Yes,” little Marie exclaimed: “Well, 4 he ain't done it!” That is all we can say </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">present institutions. God has not made </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">them </span><span class="font8">better. At least not yet, not just yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A Freak Bill </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a. l.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Geyer</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE Pittsburgh </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette-Times,</span><span class="font8"> referring to the bill recently before the Massachusetts legislature which would compel all residents of the state to attend church services, makes several statements that are right to the point: That the enactment would not promote morality, would tend to lower moral standards, would increase contempt for the law, would not stand the constitutional test and, if it did, would be none the less indefensible, and that, although foredoomed to defeat it was all the more curious that the Bay State lawmakers gave the bill serious consideration through public hearings. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Gozette-Times</span><span class="font8"> proceeds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It would be a very good thing were our people irresistibly drawn to church for worship, but it would be a very bad thing were citizens compelled to attend services against their will. That they would not submit need not be considered. But if it were possible to compel them to go, who should decide where? First it would be necessary to abolish all denominational and sectarian lines. There could be only one church and that would become in effect a state church. The separation of church and state is a cardinal principle of the American democracy. The church people themselves would be the first to rebel against a compulsory attendance law and rightly so; for such a law inevitably would destroy their liberty of choice as to place and form of their worshiping. Beyond all that, however, a grave evil would be the creation of legions of hypocrites which would swiftly destroy all the moral standards that lie at the base of a sound social order.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Who is back of this serious consideration </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font8">Catholic Massachusetts, the home </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of Cardinal </span><span class="font8">(Prince) O’Connell of Papal hierarchy </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">fame in </span><span class="font8">the U.

There is the National Catholic </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Wel</span><span class="font8">fare Council and also an organization </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">called </span><span class="font8">the Federal Council of the Church </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of Christ in • </span><span class="font8">America, a Protestant organization without </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">“Protest,” which no doubt would like to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font8">every one attend church on Sunday </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">whether </span><span class="font8">people wanted to or not; for would not that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">help for—the collection plate?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Priest Phelan, in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Western Watchman</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> of </span><span class="font8">St. Louis, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“ The ideal condition, and the condition that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus </span><span class="font6">Christ has given us as a model to go by, is a free church, a church free to make known the whole counsel of God, and not an absolutely free state, but a state that stands by the church and enforces her ordinances. We would not like that, even we Catholics. We would not like to have a policeman visit us on Sunday evening and say, 'You were not at Mass this morning; come with me; I will put you in jail.’ You would not like that, but I would like it very much. I hope to God the day may come when every Catholic who won’t go to Mam? on Sunday will be handed behind the bars before sundown. Unworthy, degraded Catholics who trample on the law of the church and on the law of God, and claim the right to do it because of their liberty, should be punished.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In view of the above statement which </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">made in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Western Watchman</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> dated April 16,1916, Priest Phelan if he were not dead And </span><span class="font8">were aware of the proposed law in Massachusetts, would no doubt do some lobbying in behalf of its passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The following appeal is taken from the Union Council, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Knights of Columbia Neivs</span><span class="font8"> of Syra-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">• ’cuse, N. Y.:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">^‘We need new members, because every organism needs growth, new parts to replace those wearing out, decaying, useless. Men die who are members of the K. of C. They must be replaced to keep the strength of .numbers and the present degrees of activity undiminished. Men resign or are suspended from the order. They must be replaced exactly as those who die must be replaced. So far as the order is concerned, the resigned or suspended- member is dead. Etc., etc., etc. Fraternally yours, John G. Coyle, M.D., State Deputy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course if they are good Knights of Columbus they will go to church and help others go to church and not to (Priest Phelan’s) jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Constitution of the United States says: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pope Pius IX, said: “Liberty of conscience </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">a most pestiferous error.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wendell Phillips, American statesman, said: “If there is anything in the universe that cannot stand discussion, let it crack.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Note: This is just what is happening to the nominal church today, its walls are cracking and the people who have been in bondage are coming out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pope Pius IX: “It is an error to believe that every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">U. </span><span class="font8">S. said: “We exact full religious toleration and the complete separation of church and state. ’ ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Cardinal O’Connell’s Boston </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Pilot</span><span class="font8"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“No good government can exist without religion, and there can be no religion without an Inquisition, which is wisely designed for the promotion and protection of the true faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>!</sup> The people are leaving the churches—Bab</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ylon, </span><span class="font8">both Catholic and Protestant—and especially is this true of the Roman Catholic </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Church. In the </span><span class="font8">Pittsburgh district during the past year, over 6000 Lithuanians have left </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">their church, to say nothing of the Polish and </span><span class="font8">Russian. Also the English-speaking just recently for the first time in the history of the R. C. Church in the Western Pennsylvania held revival services at the Harris Theatre for two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Finished Mystery,” pages 42, 43, says, commenting on Uevelation 2: 22, 23, as follows: “Behold, 1 will cast her into a bed [not a bed of ease, but a bed of pain. There where she sinned she shall suffer] and them that commit adultery with her [All the powers that receive her legates or that maintain representatives at the Vatican. Knowing her character, they are equally guilty.] into great tribulation [They are getting some now, and will get more soon.] except they repent of her deeds [This teaches that the present situation in Europe is the direct result of the teachings of the Roman Catholic church.] And I will kill her children [Both Romanists and Protestants now freely own the relationship of mother (Papacy) and daughters (Protestant churches), the former continually styling herself the Holy Mother Church, and the latter, with pleased complacency, endorsing the idea.] with death [they shall be as though they had not been.—Obadiah 16].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This blessing for the common people is near at hand when the system of big business, big church and big politics shall forever be swept from the earth and Christ’s kingdom shall be established on this earth. Then the people will say: “And it shall come to pass . . . that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it [not unto the Vatican]. And many people shall go and say [not some policeman or Priest Phelan or Cardinal O’Connell], Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob [with the aid of Christ and not leaning on a policeman or a clergyman]! And he [Christ] will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion [Christ and the faithful 144,000 partakers of the divine nature—spiritual phase of the kingdom] shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem [from the princes Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc., the earthly phase of God’s kingdom].”—Isaiah 2:2,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instead of Cardinal O ’Connell, Priest Phelan, Pope Pius, it will be plain Mr. O’Connell, etc., and they will </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">get</span><span class="font8"> the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, not the word of the devil from Rome*</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Religious Hall of Fame</span></h2>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE several-million-dollar partly built and never-to-be-completed Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York contains a row of carved wooden statues, constituting an ecclesiastical conception of a “Christian” Hall of Fame. Each century is represented by a statue; and the medley of good and bad, faithful and faithless, genuine and apostate, is an interesting exhibit of how the natural mind works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The first and second centuries are well represented by St. Paul and Justin Martyr, who were true Christians then, but today would be jailed by the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The third century has Clement of Alexandria, who, as the Boston </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Transcript</span><span class="font8"> says, “first brought Greek culture to bear upon the exposition of the Christian faith”—-in other words standardized for church members the teachings of the pagan Plato that man is inherently immortal. Plato also taught that the ideal republic should be based on slave-labor, and that the most ferocious young men should have unrestricted license among women, to keep up the supply of warlike youth for consumption by the war god—but this is not mentioned in the Hall of Fame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Great Apostasy</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">THANASIUS, of Alexandria, stands for the best the bishops can show for the fourth century. He is known as “the father of orthodoxy.” He helped the bishops of that century to destroy the holy primitive church with the fire and sword of the Roman government and to deliver what was left, bound hand and foot—and gagged—into the power of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fifth century has St. Augustine. He laid the foundation for the papal empire by substituting for the original Christian requirement of a changed life, the novel one that membership in the Roman Catholic Church was essential for salvation, to which not even Episcopalian ecclesiastics would assent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Saint Benedict represents the sixth century. “The Americana” says that he engaged in the useful occupation of withdrawing at the age of fourteen to a cavern situated in the desert of Subiaca, forty miles from Rome, from which hole-in-the-ground he organized the order of Benedictine monks, one of the leaders of the brood against whose laziness, beggary and looseness Protestantism revolted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The seventh century is graced by </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Gregory </span><span class="font8">the Great, who in the accepted </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">papal fashion </span><span class="font8">“displayed great zeal for the conversion </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">heretics.&quot; As recited in the Seventh </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume of </span><span class="font8">“Studies in the Scriptures” (page 33), </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“When </span><span class="font8">Phocas murdered Emperor Maurice and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">aS</span><span class="font8">cended the throne, Gregory wrote, ‘The </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Al</span><span class="font8">mighty lias chosen you and put you on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">throne.

After the manner of the devout members of the big politics of that day Godfrey ‘ “declined the kingly title, contenting himself with that of duke and guardian of the holy sepulchre.” He was buried in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which of itself is enough to endear him to other Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. The twelfth century is adorned by “Saint” Bernard, of Burgundy, now France. In the folfollowing from “The Americana” there may be recalled the brutality of the Crusades, the ' unhallowed union of church and state, and the devastation of liberty and of true Christianity by the papal empire: “He promoted the crusade of 114G. . . . Innocent II owed to him the possession of the right of investiture in Germany. . . . He was at the same time the umpire of princes and bishops. . . . He did much to confirm the power and influence of the Church in the Middle Ages.” Enough said!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Italy is again honored by the selection of one of its sons for the Religious Hall of Fame of the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, corner of Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, Manhattan, New York City, by the choice of “Saint” Francis of Assisi to represent the thirteenth <sup>!</sup> century. To quote again from “The Americana,” about this “saint”: “His zeal for church [buildings] restoration grew in intensity; he obtained the necessary means by begging, he himself laboring at the buildings with his own hands.” No branch of the Romish system ever distinguished itself more for ferocity against true Christians than the various orders of monks and friars, and“Saint”Francis founded the Franciscan monks, with the help of his friend “Saint” Dominic, founder of the cruel persecutors, the Dominican monks. In the church which Saint Paul knew, the rule was that “if any would not work, neither should he eat” (2 Thessalonians 3: 10), hut this counterfeit “saint&quot; founded a new order of Christians for whom the rule was “dependence on the alms of the faithful.” That Reverend Francis was not unaquainted with spiritualistic influences is manifest from the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The visions and miracles reported of Francis are </span><span class="font6">bewildering in their number and character. . . . His ecstasies were frequent; and while on Mount Alverno he received on his person what are known as the stigmata, namely, bleeding wounds on the hands, feet and side, corresponding to the marks on the crucified body of the Savior.” He also “preached to the birds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is such as this man that the twentieth-century Episcopalians desire to honor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dawn of the Reformation</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8"> TRUE saint of God is selected for the fourteenth century — John Wycliffe, of England. He was hated and persecuted by the ecclesiastics of the then Episcopalian Church and the Romish Church, but died in time to escape the martyrdom inflicted at their hands upon scores of his followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Council of Constance (May 5, 1415) condemned his doctrines, and in 1428 his remains were dug up and burned; the ashes were cast iuto the adjoining Swift, which as Wordsworth poetically remarked, conveyed them through the Avon and the Severn into the sea. and thus disseminated them over the world. Hia doctrines, carried into Bohemia, originated the Hussite movement. The New Testament was published about 1378, and the entire Old Testament was completed shortly before his death.”—“The Finished Mystery,” page 46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Wycliffe was called “The Morning Star of the Reformation,” and was “the angel of [divine messenger to] the church in Sardis,” or the fifth age of the Christian church.—Rev. 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The best the Episcopalian ecclesiastics could do for the fifteenth century post in the Religious Hall of Fame was the noted Roman Catholic discoverer, Christopher Columbus, whose fame, however, lies in entirely different fields than religion. In his day big business was excited over the possibilities of immense wealth to be gained by a new route to the Indies, to take the place of the ancient one shut off by Mohammedan encroachments. Columbus had the big idea then entirely heretical, that the earth was round, and that by sailing due west from Spain he might open up the hoped-foj trade route. For his novel and dangerous here sies he was rounded up by the church and bare ly escaped burning at the stake. It is recorded of him that he inaugurated the “Christianizing” of American natives, i. e., so efficiently, bloodily and treacherously pursued by Pizarro in Peru and Cortez in Mexico, in which the sword and the stake go hand in hand with the cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“He collected gold from the natives,” relates “The Americana,” “which was not done without violence and some cruelty. ... In order to supply the deficiency </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">laborers he distributed the land and the inhabitants, subjecting the latter to the arbitrary will of their mas</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ters, </span><span class="font6">and thus laying the foundation of that system of slavery which has lasted down to our time. . . . [His followers] alienated the minds of the natives by their cruel treatment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Columbus was a consistent supporter of the papal empire, which endears him to the hearts of the “catholic” Episcopalians. In his honor is named what is commonly regarded as a branch of the Jesuits, known as “The Knights of Columbus?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thomas- Cranmer was chosen for the sixteenth century. He was made archbishop of Canterbury and prepared the treatise on “Divorce” for King Henry VIII, on the basis of which the king’s marriage with Catherine was declared invalid—though Episcopalians nowadays do not follow that treatise. Cranmer became chaplain to Henry and helped declare him head of the Church of England, an honor to which the members of that Church consider both Henry and Christ entitled—a curious admixture of church and state. On Henry’s death he further exemplified his participation in what the regular reformers termed “spiritual adultery”—in plain language, union of church and state — by becoming one of the co-regents to govern England for the minor Edward VI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“He proceeded to model the Church of England according to the notions of Zwinglius, rather than those of Luther. By his instrumentality the liturgy [of the church] was drawn up and established </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">by act of Parliament,</span><span class="font6"> and articles of religion were compiled the validity of which was </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">enforced by royal authority,</span><span class="font6"> and for which infallibility was claimed.”—“The Americana.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the papist Mary became queen, Cranmer was arrested, imprisoned and tried before a papal commissioner “on the charges of blasphemy, perjury, incontinence and heresy,” and in fear of death recanted. Being nevertheless condemned to the stake, he retracted his recantation, was hurried to the stake, and there “kept his right hand, with which he had signed his recantation, extended in the flames, that it might be consumed before the rest of his body, exclaiming from time to time, ‘That unworthy hand!’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE DECEPTION OF EVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In pursuance of his fiendish purposes, Satan devised the seduction of mother Eve. Through the subtlety of deception he sought to inveigle </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">woman into violation of the divine com</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">mand </span><span class="font8">so that through her the man might </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">, led into rebellion against the Most High. Lucifer contrived to ensnare Adam along what </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font8">correctly reasoned to be the line of least resistance and the one most conducive to the successful accomplishment of his wicked designs; malignancy characterized his stratagem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The forbidden tree occupied a prominent place in the Garden of Eden; towards it the curious gaze of Adam and his beautiful companion was frequently directed. Observing this one day, while Eve was viewing the prohibited fruit, Satan exerted his power upon a serpent —the most sagacious of the lower creation. He caused it to approach the tree and, under the vision of the woman, probably to partake of the fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus, by his actions, which spoke louder than words, did the serpent address “the mother of all living.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The woman saw that the serpent did not die; she remembered that Adam had informed her that the Lord God had said that if she or her husband ate of the fruit, death would surely follow. Eve was unable to harmonize the matter; to her mind it seemed as if there was a discrepancy. She did not seek the counsel of God nor that of her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Slowly but surely, as she meditated upon the matter, her faith and confidence in God became undermined. Her mind worked rapidly; error followed error in quick succession in her reasonings ; the evil train of thought, once started, <sup>i</sup> &quot;led her further and further away </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">from the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Truth was being lost. Rebellious thoughts against the divine restriction obtained power in her mind. She concluded that God was withholding from her something to which she had</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ST</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">right; she became persuaded that her knowledge would be immensely increased if </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">she ate </span><span class="font8">even so little as one meal of the forbidden </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">fruit; a </span><span class="font8">conviction that death would not result </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">became </span><span class="font8">firmly enthroned in her mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE FALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The desire to taste the fruit grew in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">her </span><span class="font8">heart to such an extent that eventually it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font8">came irresistible. Reaching forth her hand </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Eve </span><span class="font8">took and ate. It was delicious to the palate. Just as she had expected, she did not die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hastening to her husband she informed him of all that had occurred. The woman invited Adam to have some of the fruit; he took it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">ate. Herein lies an important distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Eve </span><span class="font8">was deceived; Adam was not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">deceived. </span><span class="font8">This was Paul’s contention, as will be seen from his argument in 1 Timothy 2:14. Hence Adam’s transgression was willful, the full penalty </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">the divine law being thereby incurred. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">That </span><span class="font8">punishment was death. Adam probably knew that Eve, whom he had learned to love dearly, would surely die in accordance with the warning of Jehovah and despite the subtle declaration of the adversary to the contrary, through the action of the serpent. Adam, too, failed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">obtain the counsel of God, his Father; he </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">did </span><span class="font8">not even try to reason the matter out. Had he done so he would, in consequence of his knowledge of the Omnipotent Being, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">have decided </span><span class="font8">that this wise and loving God of his would see that he should not suffer any permanent loss if, notwithstanding this sore trial, he maintained his obedience. It did not seem to dawn upon him that God was fully competent to keep </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Eve </span><span class="font8">from going into death, on the ground that she was not fully responsible for her act, or to resurrect her from the dead, after she had learned her lesson to the full, or to supply him with another companion, if that would have been best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It would appear that Adam hastily </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">decided </span><span class="font8">to share his wife’s disobedience in order that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font8">might die with her; to this end he acquiesced in her suggestion and ate of the fruit. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">His </span><span class="font8">action was practically suicidal.—Genesis 3:</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PENALTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Adam’s conduct subsequent to his transgression shows what grave injury was wrought upon his morality by his willful disobedience. In their shame he and his wife tried at first to hide themselves from the presence of the Supreme Being.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The curse was then pronounced; the divine punishment upon the first man was reiterated by God; a vague promise was given, implying </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">future restoration, in the intimation that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent’s head; Adam and Eve were expelled from their Edenic home. No longer had they access to the life-sustaining trees of the garden; they were banished to the inhospitable wilderness without, which was still unsubdued, so that the sentence of death might go into effect through the operation of natural laws and in accordance with the decree of the Most High.—Gen. 3: 7-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How long these two beautiful creatures enjoyed the bliss and happiness of their Paradisaic perfection may not be positively known. Various suggestions have been offered as to its duration, but mere speculation is useless. Nevertheless, it is proper to mention that there is prophetic evidence, which need not here be discussed, that Adam may have lived in Eden for a pwiod of about two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Outside of Eden, amidst imperfect surroundings, the constitution of the first man struggl'd against hostile nature for over nine hundred years. The fight from the beginning was hopeless. As God had foretold, Adam succumbed after living for nine hundred and thirty years; he paid in full the penalty of death. His </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">posterity,</span><span class="font8"> through circumstances of birth and environment, have been compelled to discharge that same debt punctiliously.—Genesis 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ADAMIC SIN, SUFFERING AND DEATH</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It should be noted that our first parents did not exercise their powers of procreation till some time subsequent to their expulsion from the garden. Hence their posterity were all born under the condemnation which came upon Adam; mankind became the inheritors of Adamic sin. .suffering and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In harmony with this we read in the Scripture of Truth: “There is none righteous, no, not one.”—Romans 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All have sinned and come short of the glory </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">God.”—Romans 3:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”—Romans 5; 12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">“The wages of sin is death.”—Romans 6:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope.”—Romans 8: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All in Adam die.”—1 Corinthians 15:22. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All the wicked will he destroy.”—Psalm 145:20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“All are of the dust and all turn to dust again.”—Ecclesiastes 3: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Six thousand years have now elapsed since the far-reaching and tragic events enacted in Eden. With increased momentum, as age has succeeded age, the race has plunged deeper and deeper into the quicksand of suffering, sorrow, sin and death. Today the great crisis of crises has been reached; the world at last has arrived at its extremity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE ORIGINAL DIVINE PURPOSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptural revelation concerning the origin of the human race has now been perused. It has been observed that happiness, mental moral and physical perfection, life-sustaining food and an eternal home on this planet, have been forfeited for mankind, through the disobedience of Adam, who in his innocency was an image and likeness of his Creator; and that degradation, ruin, desolation and death, in which every descendant of Adam has been involved, have been a natural sequence to the reign of sin and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How do these facts, which are of eminent importance ami which consequently have been considered in detail herein, assist in the understanding of the philosophy of restitution? The ensuing remarks will render the answer to this query apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Biblical statements, to which we have heretofore referred, are devoid of equivocation. It is distinctly indicated in the Scriptural presentation of the matter, that, as far as mankind is concerned generically, it was the will of J.he Creator that this planet should be peopled by a race of human beings, the offspring of Adam and Eve and the possessors of mental, moral and physical perfection.—Genesis 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The inference is also clear that it was- the divine intention that this perfect race, conditional upon the continuity of their, individual obedience, should live for ever on the earth, which in the process of time, as the race increased numerically, would have been gradually subdued and brought to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">state of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">natural </span><span class="font8">perfection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The conception of the Lord God Almighty </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">vouchsafed in </span><span class="font8">the Word of God is exalted </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font8">highest degree.

<p><span class="font8">Multiplex statements of similar character might be quoted; the ones already mentioned will suffice for the present purpose. Indeed, the truths therein expressed are so self-evident that an individual who fails to discern them is what the Scriptures fitly term a fool; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font8">is, one who does not properly exercise his reasoning faculties, which are foremost among </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">many precious endowments bestowed by God upon man.—Psalm 53:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">logical conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It follows, then, that if the original purpose of the everlasting God, with whom none is comparable, is not accomplished in the populating of this earth with a race of perfect human </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font8">ings, the posterity of Adam and Eve; and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">if, </span><span class="font8">through necessity, the destruction of the planet is decreed by the Almighty, then it will mean that Lucifer, a finite creature, has proved to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">master of the Infinite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That such a contingency can ever arise is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">un</span><span class="font8">thinkable; its possibility no logical mind </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font8">admit. Manifestly, it would be absurd to contend that any creature can ever thwart Jehovah —the invincible, insuperable God, whose glory no human language can adequately express. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The child of God may, therefore, rest assured that all the purposes of the Most High shall </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">accomplished ultimately. No one — neither angel nor man — can successfully oppose </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">will of the Creator. God has permitted Satan ■ and his minions to interfere with His designs to a limited extent, because, in His omniscience, He foreknew that through the permission </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">evil there would evolve a lesson which would prove of lasting benefit, not only to mankind, but also to all created intelligences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah permitted evil to exist as an active principle for a definite period of time, determining to overrule its effects for good. It </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font8">made possible the exaltation of Jesus to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">divine nature. The glorification of the church of God and the establishment of the human race in a higher degree of earthly perfection than would have been possible had evil not</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">been permitted will be other astounding results. Mankind individually shall have learned, in the school of bitter experience, the undesirability of sin and the eternal advantage of righteousness—a fitting preparation for the everlasting future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It should be clear then, that in order that the original purpose of the Lord God Almighty affecting the human family may be accomplished, a restitution of all things, as foretold by all God’s holy prophets since the world began, is a necessity. To this end it was requisite that God should provide a means whereby, if so desired, each member of the posterity of Adam might be enabled to return to the perfection and majesty of manhood lost to the race in the person of the first man when because of his sin he was sentenced to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE EARTH ABIDETH FOREVER</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The teaching that this planet shall be destroyed by fire literally, is unscriptural, unreasonable and absurd. Solomon, the wise man, declares: “The earth abideth for ever.” (Ecclesiastes 1:4) Again, the prophet Isaiah as the mouthpiece of the Lord, states: “Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited.”—Isaiah 45:18; see also Psalm 104: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The confusion which prevails in this particular connection has arisen principally through a failure to understand the many metaphorical statements relevant to the destruction of this “present evil world” preparatory to the inauguration of the “world to come” ‘“wherein dwell-eth righteousness.” Earth’s existent evil social arrangement or “world” must perish prior to the complete establishment of the “everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.” To this change of dispensation there are numerous figurative allusions in the Word of God.—2 Peter 3:1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font8"> thoughtful consideration of the matter will bring conviction that the planet Earth will endure for ever. It will be a suitable home for regenerated men; the whole earth will become a Paradise, and will naturally supply everything necessary to sustain life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures foretell that the time shall come when “there shall be no more curse.” The earth shall “yield her increase”; “instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree”; “the desert shall rejoice, and blossom </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font8">the rose”; “there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">any more pain”; “they shall build houses and inhabit them”; “the inhabitant shall not say: I am sick”; “while the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.”—Psalm 67: 6; Isaiah 55:13; 35:1; Revelation 22:1-3; 21:1-7; Isaiah 65:17-25; 33: 24 ; Genesis 8: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For further Scriptural evidence on this subject the reader is referred to pages 82 to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">95 </span><span class="font8">of the“The Finished Mystery”(published by the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> New </span><span class="font8">York and Lancaster Gate, London, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">W. 2.), </span><span class="font8">where will be found a masterly collation of the predictions of twenty-four Hebrew prophets pertaining to the matter under analysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE RANSOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The sacrificial death of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ guarantees to every member of the race an opportunity of restitution to the perfection enjoyed by Adam in his sinlessness. Without the ransom this gracious provision of God would be impossible—unless Jehovah selected some other expedient. The means which He has devised are unquestionably the wisest and best.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Adam, in the circumstances hitherto mentioned, violated divine justice, which consequently demanded his life and that of each member of his posterity, who through heredity inherited Y3 his condemnation. It should be clear, then, that human restoration cannot take place until the death sentence against the race is annulled. This can be effected only through the propitiation of justice.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark44"><span class="font8">The Mosaic code taught this principle of &quot;&nbsp;justice in requiring life for life, tooth for tooth,</span></a></p>

<p><span class="font8">The exactitude of justice, a cardinal attribute of God, as illustrated in the law, necessitates J a complete correspondency or equivalent before a reprieve of mankind can be rendered practi- 1 cable. This provision has been made by God in 4 His Son Jesus Christ, who by voluntarily lay-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font8">down His human life at Calvary, provided the perfect correspondency demanded by justice. As a reward for this noble and meritorious self-sacrifice Jehovah raised His Son from the dead and “set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.” (Ephesians 1:20-23) Thus God hath “highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above eve</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ry </span><span class="font8">name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font8">tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”— Philippians 2:9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That the doctrine of the ransom sacrifice of Jesus is thoroughly Scriptural can be proved by an examination of the following passages:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Without shedding of blood is no remission.” —Hebrews 9: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The Son of man came ... to give his life </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">ransom for many.”—Mark 10: 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“He is the propitiation for our sins: and not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.”—1 John 2: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Ye are bought with a price.”—1 Corinthians ,7:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.”—1 Corinthians 15:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“The man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all.”—1 Timothy 2: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The compound Greek word rendered “ransom” in 1 Timothy 2:6 signifies, literally, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">corresponding price. A question now to be considered is this: In what sense can it be said that Jesus was a corresponding price “for all”1</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Our glorified Master “in the days of his flesh” was a perfect man. He was like Adam in his perfection—holy, harmless, undefiled. He knew no sin. When Adam transgressed the command of God, the race, to use a Scriptural mode of expression, was in his loins. (Compare Hebrews 7:5, 9, 10) So, too, in the case of Jesus, in His perfect manhood, there was also in this sense a race in Him. It can be seen from this standpoint that Jesus in His humanity was a perfect correspondency to Adam in his sinless-mess. The race in the loins of Jesus was a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">cor</span><span class="font8">respondency to the race in the loins of Adam which subsequently had actual existence. Hence Jesus and the possible race in Him constituted the ransom or corresponding price for Adam and all his posterity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Adam had the right or privilege, contingent on obedience, to live as a perfect man for ever upon this planet. Similarly the race in him was individually heir to that same conditional right. Adam through transgression forfeited that privilege to which, resultantly, none of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font8">offspring could lay claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NEW COVENANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jesus, by His death on Calvary, purchased the race. His was a substitutionary sacrifice, through the merit of which it has </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">been made </span><span class="font8">possible for Adam and all his posterity to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">judicially released from divine condemnation and placed in the hands of Jesus that, during His Millennial reign, He may restore “whosoever will” of mankind to human perfection, under the terms of the new covenant provided for that purpose. This covenant is to be made, at the commencement of the reign of Christ, with regathered Israel, whose blindness respecting the Messiah and the promises of God shall then have passed away. (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Romans 11, etc.) Jesus, in association with His glorified gospel church, the members of His mystical body, His bride, shall be the Mediator of the new covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Mankind eventually will come under that covenant and thus become “Israelites indeed,” just as in the past, by subscribing to the various features of the Mosaic law covenant, the gentiles, through proselytism, could enter the commonwealth of Israel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is clear then that the sacrifice of Jesus Christ the Righteous assures that every individual member of the Adamic race shall have one perfect, complete opportunity of attaining to perfection of manhood. Hence, since the only ones who have had an opportunity of salvation are those who have been reconciled to God during this gospel age, whose reward is the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4), it follows that as the overwhelming majority of the race have gone into a Christless grave, not having heard of the only “name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved,” the dead must come back to receive that knowledge and its attendant opportunity of restitution. Jehovah lias provided for this necessity in the resurrection of the dead.—-John 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">MILLIONS NOW LIVING WILL NEVER DIE !</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many earnest students of the Word of God contend that we are today living in the period of time in which the gospel age is closing and the Millennial age dawning. The fundamental purpose of the former dispensation is the selection of the church of God, whose destiny is the divine nature with all its unspeakable concomitants; the latter has for its object the restitution to human perfection of all the willing and obedient of mankind through the instrumentality of the glorified church of which Jesus is the Head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All mankind, with the exception of consecrated believers, are under legal sentence of death; this condemnation has not yet been annulled. In the process of time as the human race comes into harmony with Messiah’s kingdom man shall obtain the earthly blessings which shall then be proffered. When the human family shall have been reprieved, it will be no longer necessary for any individual to enter the tomb on account of Adamic sin; and since there is reasonable evidence for the conclusion that the majority of mankind shall be restored to perfection and that only a small minority shall suffer the penalty of second death because of incorrigibility, it follows that there are millions of people now living upon this earth who will never die but will eventually through the process of restitution become the inheritors of eternal human life on this planet, which ulti-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“NOW”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tell It out among the nations, Let them shout and sing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hallelujah choruses</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TO Christ our Lord and King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Earth’s jubilee is sounding Old things now'pass away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Glad tidings of great joy are due In this Millennial Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our King has come in glory</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To take His power and reign;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let all His saints proclaim </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And join </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the glad refrain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">mately shall reach a condition of natural perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">THE TRUE GOSPEL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jesus and IIis divine church shall have completed this great restitution work, then at the end of the thousand years, pj; ^MiUenpinm^,, the kingdom shall be handed over to Goa, the Father, as St. Paul informs us in 1 Corinthians.. 15:24-28. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The consummation of this gigantic task will introduce the ages of glory and blessedness— the beginning of an eternal future. Each member of the human race shall have passed his final testings, the incorrigible shall have perished in the second death, and the earth shall be peopled with a family, each one of which shall be perfect mentally, morally and physically, in the image and likeness of Jehovah, the God and Father of all.—See Revelation 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In this manner shall the original purpose proclaimed in the Garden of Eden be accomplished—a logical effect of the ransom and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">result which shall be to the eternal praise of the glory of Jehovah through Jesus Christ His Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This, then, is the Gospel or Good News—• the one preached to Abraham four thousand years ago; the same proclaimed by the angel to the shepherds on the plains of Bethlehem at the birth of Jesus; the one taught by Jesus ami His inspired apostles, and declared by all God's holy prophets since the world began. Truly it is a gospel of which no Christian need feel ashamed.—Genesis 12:1-3; Galatians 3:8, 1G, 29; Luke 2:10; Acts 3:19-21.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font4">With Issue Number 60 we began running Judge Rutherford's new book. “The Harp of God”, with accompanying questions, taking the place of both Advanced and Juvenile Bible Studies which have been hitherto published.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>120</sup>After the death of Jacob his offspring were known as the children of Israel, or Israelites. Joseph when a lad had been sold into Egypt, had grown to manhood, had become a mighty man and ruler in Egypt under the king, and was dwelling there in power and glory when his father and the other members of his family moved into Egypt to live. During the lifetime of Joseph the Israelites were well treated. After his death, however, a new king came to the throne of Egypt, who began to oppress and persecute the Israelites. God raised up Moses and used him to deliver the Israelites from the land of Egypt and from the oppressive hand of Egypt’s king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>121</sup> We incidentally remark that here are some other pictures foreshadowing portions of the divine plan. Egypt under the rule of a wicked king pictures or represents the world of mankind in darkness under the rule of the unrighteous one, Satan, who is the god of this world. The Israelites in Egypt picture the people of God and those who shall ultimately come into harmony with Him; while Moses was a type foreshadowing the great Messiah, who is to deliver all mankind from the bondage of sin and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>i22</sup>Moses was a prophet of God and God spoke through Moses, using him as a mouthpiece or messenger. After the Lord had delivered the children of Israel from Egypt by the hand of Moses, He spoke through Moses, who prophesied unto Israel, saying: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ye </span><span class="font8">shall hearken.” (Deuteronomy 18:15; Acts 3:22) From that time forward the* Israelites watched and waited for the coming of the great prophet, priest, and king who should be like unto Moses and of whom Moses was a picture </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or a </span><span class="font8">type. They knew that such a one must</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Poet and seer </span><span class="font6">that question caught,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Above the din of life’s fears and frets;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font6">marched with letters, it toiled with thought,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Through schools and creeds which the earth forgets. </span><span class="font8">come from the house of Judah, because </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font8">had promised as much. David was a direct </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font8">scendant of Judah.—Luke 3: 31-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>12J</sup>From time to time God’s prophets gave </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ut</span><span class="font8">terance to words that kept alive in the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">minds </span><span class="font8">of the Israelites the hope that God would </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">send </span><span class="font8">them a mighty one, through whom the. promise made to Abraham would be fulfilled. In </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">time </span><span class="font8">this promise was specifically limited to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">house of David, the Lord causing His prophet to write thus: “The Lord hath sworn in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">truth </span><span class="font8">unto David; he will not turn from it; Of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. If thy children will keep my covenant and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">my </span><span class="font8">testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.”— Psalm 132:11, 12.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>About ten years apo</span><br><br><span class="font13" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>these were perplexing questions:</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Is ignorance a road to heaven? What becomes of the infants, the unbelieving, the heathen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Are a few elect and the remainder damned?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Are millions fore-ordained to a hell of fire and brimstone?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then the Bible was viewed as a book of warnings, forebodings, platitudes, and “thou shalt nots,” useful only when life was at ebb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">One was considered better off to have no knowledge of the Bible’s contents, arguing that “where there is no law there is no sin!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">But that was years ago! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Today it is recognized that the Bible also discloses answers to questions such as:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why are the dates 539, 1799, and 1874 important?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is there any significance in the present-day breaking up of kingdoms, empires, and republics ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why should the progress of the Jewish nation be watched?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">How do we know that the dead soldiers will come back from the battlefield into their own homes? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is the earth large enough for all the living and all the dead to live on at one time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And, further, that the answers prophesied centuries ago are proving to be the direct solution—guesses, speculation and philosophisings of statesmen, politicians, and economists to the contrary notwithstanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible opens before you a field of endeavor, instead of “preaching” a course of limitations and circumscribed effort. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It tells you hqw to be one of the millions now living who will never die. The Harp Bible Study Course of thirteen consecutive lessons is short yet thorough and comprehensive. It helps you to answer these questions. It deajs with fundamentals.</span></p>
