Bonaparte, ex-Secretary of the Navy, is seventy years of age; and so are Thomas F. Ryan and Perry Belmont, the multimillionaires, and David Starr Jordan, President of Leland Stanford University, Palo Alto, California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Senator Lodge of the Foreign Relations Committee, is seventy-one years of age; and so is Sir Thomas Lipton, yachtsman, and purveyor of most excellent teas. Sir Thomas' favorite . hours for office work are between 9:00 P. M. <sup>v</sup>'and 2:00 A. M. Pity his luckless stenographer!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luther Burbank, the plant wizard, is seventy-two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Right-Honorable Arthur J. Balfour, British statesman, and Leslie M. Shaw<sub>r</sub> exSecretary of the Treasury, are seventy-three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thomas A. Edison and Alexander Graham Bell, the great inventors of the phonograph and the telephone, are each seventy-five years of age. Mr. Edison's birthday occurred on February 11th. He went to work as usual on his birthday anniversary, punching the time-clock at 9:19 A. M.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge Elbert H. Gary and Field Marshal Von Hindenburg, are each seventy-five years of age. The one is the head of the steel trust, the other was the Kaiser's right-hand man during the years 1914-1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A man may still have considerable life at seventy-five. A. A. Warford, of Brooklyn, rode his bic^He to Coney Island one day in June last, as was his usual custom. He struck a trolley car and was hurled ten feet, suffering a lacerated scalp and contusions of the back. However, v^hen the ambulance arrived, he was laughing over his mishap, waved the ambulance corps a blitfle adieu, and pedaled home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Theodore N. Vail, head of the Bell Telephone Company, is seventy-six: and the Dowager Queen Alexandra, of England, is seventy-seven.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Charlie Dennis, an eighty-year-old carpenter, while working on the roof of a house fell thirty feet, sustaining three broken ribs. This was his first accident in sixty continuous years of carpenter work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Auguste Rodin, the sculptor, is eighty-one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Edward Payson Weston, one of the professional pedestrians of the six-day walking contests of fifty years ago, is still alive and walking twelve miles daily at his home in the Catskills. This is the same man that at seventy-five years of age astonished the world by trying to walk from New York to San Francisco in one hundred days. He failed on the first attempt, but shortly afterward, by selecting a more direct route, made it on schedule. He is now eighty-two years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John D. Rockefeller is the same age as Mr. Weston; and although he long since lost all his cranial moss, and has to wear a toupee, he says that he feels well, has no aches nor pains, enjoys his food and has at last learned how and what to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">General Nelson A. Miles, in charge of the United States Army during the last of the Indian uprisings, back in the eighties, and more recently prominent leader of militant Protestantism, is the same age as Mr. Weston and Mr. Rockefeller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John Wanamaker is eighty-three, and began the eighty-fourth year of his life by getting to his desk at 8:15 in the morning. Charles Erickson, of Southeast Brainerd, Minnesota, is the same age as Mr. Wanamaker, and has the added distinction and satisfaction of having recently sprouted a new set of teeth, his third outfit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Colonel Washington A. Roebling is eighty-four — former vice-president of the John A* Roebling Sons Company, builders of the Brooklyn Bridge. In June last Mr. Roebling’s nephew, who was then President of the company, fell dead while playing golf; and Colonel Roebling succeeded him. He had to wait same time for a promotion, but at once showed that he was made of the right stuff by announcing a vigorous business policy which included enlargement of the mills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex-Speaker Joseph G. Cannon and ex-Secre-tary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage are each eighty-five.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex-Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson and ex-Secretary of the Navy William E. Chandler, are each eighty-six. At the same age Albert Stone is still in the employ of the New York Central Railroad Company, having been J in their continuous employ for seventy-one years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Chauncey M. Depew, ex-president of the New York Central Company, and ex-senator for New York, is eighty-seven, as is also ex-Presi-dent Eliot of Harvard University. At the age of ninety Colonel James R- Silliman is an usher in the Cathedral of St John the Divine, New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John A. Stewart, chairman of the board of trustees of the United States Trust Company celebrated his ninety-ninth birthday by getting into his automobile at Morristown, N.J., thirty-one miles away, and getting out at his office at Wall Street at 11 A. M. to perform the duties of his position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Over the. Hundred Mark</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">FEW months ago the editor met in a railway train a gentleman travelling all alone,</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19220412_files/g_E_19220412-5.png" alt="" style="width:16pt;height:17pt;">

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">who remarked that he was one hundred years old that day. New York city has a marine-corps sergeant. Matthew M. Bradley, of the same age. The record^ show his enlistment date as January 3,1855.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When they get to be one hundred the boys ^have to be watched. Not all are as trustworthy, or at least as safe in these days of flying automobiles, as was the centenarian on the train. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports as missing Abra-ham Brown, one hundred years old, who went out in the morning from his daughter’s home in the Bronx, as was his usual custom, to buy to-' bacco. Abraham may be a bit reckless with the \ weed; but if he wants to live to a good old age, he should know enough to let tobacco alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A somewhat similar instance occurred where Anthony* Lettie (but he was only ninety-seven and perhaps did not know better), who was living with his daughter near Elizabeth, N. J^ went walking with his poodle dog and failed to return. Neither did the dog show up, and the whole countryside had to be scoured to locate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Life seems to be pretty uncertain after boys get past the hundred mark. Recently the papers reported the death of two of them at the age of 103, although at the same age Unde Jack Higgins, of Wabash, Indiana, celebrated his birthday by dancing a sailor’s jig to talking- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark11"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">machine music. Once a week, regularly, Unde</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jack walks to town from his home a mile away. B</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark12"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The papers report the death of Edward Bu-brey, at bis home near Utica, at the age of 105.</span></a></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark13"><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is believed that his death was hastened by</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the fact that he smoked incessantly. Two other persons each 105 years old, one 114 years old, and one 115 years old, are also reported in the papers as having died recently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the days of the Civil War, shortly after slavery was abolished, his former master, Joseph Everhart, gave to one of his faithful Negro servants, John Johnson, a 160-acre farm near Williamsburg, Missouri. Johnson, who is now blind and who claims to be 121 years old, is still living on the farm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Cherokee Bill,” an Indian-Negro, who has twice been listed in the census report as the oldest man in America, and who is reputed to be worth $80,000, lives on a farm near Grand Junction, Colorado. He was born August 13, 1797, and is therefore almost 125 years of age. He has walked with the aid of one cane which he has had for over fifty years. The Government is fully satisfied respecting his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tom Morris, of Westerville, Nebraska, also lays claim to the age of 125 years. He bases his claim upon the old family Bible and other records which show that he was born in Berrew, Montgomeryshire, North Wales, and was twen-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ty-one years old when the Duke of Wellington won the battle of Waterloo from Napoleon. He is blind and almost deaf, smokes constantly and eats heartily. He has the unhealthy habit of eating between meals; and if he wants to live to grow up he should stop it, as it is considered very bad for the health. Tom has missed a lot; for he never learned how to read or write,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">William Peyton, a Negro ex-slave, recently died at Little Hocking, Ohio, at the age of 128. He was in full possession of his faculties until within a few weeks of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' Uncle John Shell, of Greasy Creek, Kentucky, j was recently reported in the papers as having laid claim to an age of 132 years, but an ' investigation of his claims has led to the conclusion that he is only about 100. He is a moun-‘ taineer and not very certain respecting his age. ■<sup>j</sup> Many reports of longevity have no other basis j than family tradition or local belief. The practice of keeping church registers did not come</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">3 into vogue<sup>1</sup> until the sixteenth century and did £ not come into general use until a century later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Many of these records are undecipherable or i otherwise unreliable, and they are very incom-i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">■ On the basis of tradition, but without other 4 support for the belief, Domingo Jacinto, chief of a tribe of Digger Indians in California, is i said to be 144 years old, having been born the year the Declaration of Independence was signed. Although feeble he can still walk and see </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&gt;&nbsp;and</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> hear without difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Old Age in Turkey</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LD age in Turkey makes itself respected by a capacity and willingness to work. A j certain Murad, employed as a messenger by the ! Turkish telegraph office, was offered a pension <sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he reached his 120th year. He did not</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wish to lose his job, but the officials insisted</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">that he make room for some younger man who j otherwise would have no place. He finally agreed quit, on condition that his son be giv-i en the job: This was agreed to; and he brought around a white-haired patriarch who looked as old as himself, and whom he introduced as his •on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• The oldest man in Turkey, Zorro, mentioned j in Golden ^ge Number 3, is now 146, and has | recently been married for the fourth time to a I beautiful Turkish girl of twenty-five. He started i in life at the age of twenty as a street porter; and after working at it for ninety years he tired of it and quit for another job, at 110. He then became porter in a munitions factory, which job he still holds. He lost all of his teeth and hair at 109, and then grew an entirely new crop of both. He is also alleged to have developed a third kidney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Zorro is said to be angry with his ninety-six-year-old son because the latter will not work but sticks around the house. Zorro takes a cold bath every morning, eats no meat, partakes of neither alcohol nor tobacco, but eats plenty of milk curdled with yeast, bread, cheese, sweets, and weak tea without </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">milk-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> He works every day along with his grandson and his grandson’s grandson. He was taken to Paris for exhibition; but his eyes were so bright and his step so firm that few would credit his real age, and the exhibition was not a success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ne Oldest of AU</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE census taken by Vespasian in the year 74 A.D., thirty men were found in the alpine sections of Italy who were over 140 years of age; and there is a record of a man in Switzerland who lived to the age of 335. The oldest man in the United States of whom we have any record was a man in Massachusetts who died at the age of 165.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is now claimed that the oldest human being on earth is a man by the name of Sadhu Swami, better known in the Himalayas as Kal-ambi Baba, who makes his home in the town of Karimganj, India. He is reputed to be over 330 years old and is treated by the natives with the greatest respect He says that he remembers vividly the first battle of Paripat, which occurred more than 300 years ago, and recalls readily the principal historical events which occurred within his observation during the past three centuries. If his story is true he was born about 1592, before the Pilgrim fathers landed at Plymouth, and even before the Jamestown expedition left the shores of Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The average ages of eight of the ten patriarchs from Adam to Noah was 929 years (Genesis 5:5-31; 9:29); and despite the flood, and the consequent unfavorable effect upon human longevity, the average ages of the sixteen patriarchs from Shem to Moses was 251 years.— Genesis 11:10-32; 25:8; 47:28; Exodus 6:16-20; Deuteronomy 34:7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g</span></p>

Mr. Shaw is pained at the thought that we are so short-lived that by the time we are old enough to live sensibly we are ready for the undertaker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Metchnikoff also wrote a book on how to live to be 100 years of age; but as he died before reaching the age of seventy, his work is not now in great demand. It was his thought that ■ man should live to be at least 120.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. A. H. Warner of New York says there is no reason why a man or a woman should not reach 150 years. He is now seventy-two, and says he intends to live to 100, and if life then looks good to him he will go on living another half century. He thinks long life is merely a matter of psychology and good living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Carl H. Bjerregaard, aged seventy-five, librarian of the New York City Public Library, says that the way to remain young is to keep the mind continually refreshed with new ideas, new interests, new activities; and this is one of the most valuable of the many suggestions that * are offered on the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Chauncey M. Depew, eighty-eight years of age in April, 1922, says the secret of long life is, “Don’t change your habits”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Colonel A. J. Nutting, eighty-eight years of age in May, 1922, one of Brooklyn’s foremost merchants, says the secret of longevity is to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">forget all about one's self</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and to think only of family and business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John R. Voorhis, ninety-two years of age, chairman of the Board of Election Commissioners of New York city advises the seeker for long life to smoke good cigars, drink good whiskey (I!), eat plenty of food (such as roast ponk in thewrinter and apple pie in the fall, and other delicacie^in season), to sleep seven or eight hours every night in a comfortable bed in a well-ventilated room, to work eight hours a day at some congenial occupation, and to walk two or three m\les a day if one feels like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Stephen Smith, ninety-nine years of age, founder of*\he American Public Health Association, advises avoiding the easy chair, keeping at work, drinking quantities of milk, getting ^plenty of sleep, and avoiding too much meat He has never smoked or drunk stimulants of</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Captain John Black, of Eastport, Maine, is . 100 years of age and followed fishing in Passas maquoddy Bay and the Bay of Fundy for three ordinary generations. Subsequently he opened , a fish-market. He has never tasted liquor, and ' has not touched tobacco since he was a boy of seventy-five. He never hurries, never worries, eats plenty of plain food, drinks quantities of water, enjoys companionship, sleeps eight . hours a day, takes a walk whenever he can get out, is a Bible Student, and does not feel old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eighteen residents out of a total population of 120 in a little village in the Caucasus Mountains are each more than 100 years of age. Their diet consists exclusively of bread, cheese and sour milk, confirming the scientific theory that sour milk prolongs life by destroying the harm- -ful bacteria in the lower intestines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Washington Bissell, of Great Barrington, Massachusetts, a retired New York lawyer, was J01 recently. He says tjiat smoking has helped to prolong his life. He is the oldest college &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Uncle John Dabney, the Minnesota centen- j a ri an and pioneer, who is the same age as Mr. ' Bissell, says that the secret of a long life is to “keep movin&quot;; and Uncle John has hit it about right It is as true in the physical world as it is in the spiritual world that the only way to keep alive is to keep on keeping on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Louis Horowitz, who celebrated his 104th birthday recently in the Harlem Home of the Daughters of Israel in New York, prescribes: “Work and exercise, kind thoughts about one’s fellows, and a conscience that lets you sleep— that is the way to live, and. that way lets you live the longest”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Chester R. Woodford, of Avon, Connecticut, age 107 years, the oldest living ex-member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, says that refusal to worry is the secret of a long and happy life. It has a lot to do with it. Death * would normally be a long time reaching anybody that refused to worry and that kept his intestinal tract in good order by proper food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cardinal de Salis of Venice wrote at the age of 110: “By being old when I was young I find myself very young when I am old”. He meant that by taking great care in his youth he was spared that necessity in his old age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Age is</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> no </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reason for Ceasing Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">J</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ohn W. Barth, of Omaha, speaking at the ninth annual convention of the National Association of Mutual Life Underwriters in Chicago, made the statement that during the ■past fifty years ten years has been added to the length of life of the average man and that every indication points to the fact that an equal amount will be added in the next fifty. Mr. Barth is right, and more than right</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Meantime, what is to be done with these men whose natural course has been lengthened by ten years </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1 Are</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> they fit only to be discarded! Such was the famous Osler theory. Indeed, that theory suggested that all men should be chloroformed at or before sixty, as they were thenceforth of no benefit to their fellows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If that plan were put into practice now, it would take way some of the most important and supposedly valuable men in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">erican business life. Not long ago a list was made of the Fifty men rated as the foremost leaders in American business and finance; and their average age was sixty-one. Not a railroad in the United States has a president as young as forty, and hardly any as young as fifty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The president of one of the most powerful banks in America the First National, of New York city, George F. Baker, is in his eighty-second year. The average age of the twentyeight men who have been presidents of the United States was between fifty-four and fifty-five when they took office, and their average at death has been a few months under seventy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We sometimes hear it said that the United States is a young man’s country, which is another way of saying that it does not value either faithfulness or experience. There is much truth in the statement; but the age </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">t of activity is rising rapidly, and many of the conspicuously important positions are now filled by men of sixty, sixty-five, seventy, and upwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Occasionally something transpires that suggests to an elderly man that he is as good as ever. During the war an old man in an Ohio poorhouse happened to remember that he was a good shoemaker. He went out and got a job at $36 a week, and has been busy ever since. The editorial writer Arthur Brisbane is of the opinion that the normal working period of a pan’s life should be 144 years, twelve times as long as the number of years preceding the reproductive age.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ES, reader, there really are some sensible women that are willing to admit that they are over thirty. Harriet Beecher Stowe lived to be eighty-five, Florence Nightingale was ninety, and Julia Ward Howe ninety-one. A report comes from Texas that Mrs. M. M.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eliza Anderson, aged 103, one of the inmates of the Catholic Home for the Aged, of the Little Sisters of the Poor, New York city, recently attended an all-day party given to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the home. At five o’clock in the afternoon Eliza complained of being tired and wanting to take a nap. She said it had been a hard day. One of the features of the program on this occasion was an Irish breakdown danced by Catherine McGinty, seventy-eight years of age, and blind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Serena Bracey, Camden, South Carolina, a colored woman 104 years of age, thinks that she is the.oldest woman in the United States; but Serena is mistaken, as she will see if she is a subscriber to The Golden Age. And she ought to be a subscriber, even if she isn’t Anybody that has reached 104 years of age, and is not a subscriber to The Golden Age, has missed something.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mrs. Delia Bouton Sanford, Norwalk, Connecticut, has just celebrated her 105th birthday. She has the reputation of manifesting a remarkably cheery disposition, and is never so. happy as when doing something to make others happy. She deserves to be among the Millions Now Living Who Will Never Die. Indeed, she has one of the prime characteristics of the bride of Christ, who will have a still better inheritance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If this article had been written prior to the first of last November it would have been able to mention Mrs. Eliza Ann Barron, who was then living with her daughter at Woodbridge, New Jersey, at the age of 105. Mrs. Barron voted at the presidential election in 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Henrietta Jones, Orange, Texas, a Negress 106 years of age, is still actively engaged in cooking, washing, ironing, and sewing.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mrs. Bosella Cohen, Trenton, New Jersey, has reached the age of 107, and attributes her long life to the fact that she never worries. Mrs. Antoinette Smith, a Portuguese woman 108 years of age, is Illinois' third oldest woman. She has found no joy in life since the prohibition amendment was enacted and took away the daily portion of wine in which she had always indulged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mrs. Mary Vermett is Illinois' second oldest woman, and celebrated her 110th birthday last Christmas. The very oldest woman in Illinois, and the oldest woman of whom we have any record at the The Golden Age office, is Mrs. Sarah Quinn, of Chicago. Sarah was recently overcome with gas in her home. She was rushed to a hospital and revived. Upon waking she said that she was feeling as well as usual and desired to return home at once, so that she could do the dishes. Sarah is 115 years old; and she showed much more enthusiasm in doing the dishes than some girls 100 years younger show with respect to the same job; and this is no joke, even if it does sound like one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tike </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sorrows of Old Age</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">LD age ought not to have any sorrows. It ought to be a time of placid contentment at haring done in life all that one was able to do to make the world a better place; and many grow old in just that way. But there is a considerably disposition on the part of young men who have the power to try to get rid of old men on the false theory that every old man who works keeps some young man from working, and that young men would do more and better work than can old man can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Winston Churchill, British Minister of War —and Mr. Churchill is no longer a young man himself—has altered the retiring age from the British arsenals from sixty-five to sixty, probably with a view of making room for more young men. This affected about 1,000 workers; and retiring them ten years ahead of the pension (seventy) left them to face ten years of doubt and distress at the time in life when they could least afford it Many of these men ■ have spent the best part of their lives in the country's service. There are 96,924 old age pensioners in Australia, each receiving about $200 per year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ernest L. Smith, fifty years of age, of North Scituate, Massachusetts, used to work in the Providence, Rhode Island, mills. He was laid off several months ago and was unable to find anything to do. Wherever he applied for employment he was told that he was too old. Becoming discouraged because he had a family that he was unable to supply with food, he barricaded </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the house, set fire to it, and shot himself through the head, dying en route to the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In its issue of August 5,1921, The New York-</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> contained the following beautiful poem by F. L. Montgomery on &quot;The Loneliness of Age”:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Time once was when the day lacked hours Enough to finish the tasks begun,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When morning scattered the scent of flowers, And evening's curtain was finely spun</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of moonlight’s web and starry showers In unison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The lyre was touched and a song went winging Its joyous way as befits in youth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Easily laughter and hail came ringing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And eye met eye with the glance of truth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For song was sweet and the heart was singing Of love, forsooth I</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">One by one as the leaves are shaken From old trees' branches by Autumn's blast,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">So were the old companions taken, Leaving him lonely, left to the last,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Left to himself and his thoughts, forsaken—-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Living the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Old age makes no plan for the morrows— Whom shall it work with, with whom play?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Burdened with debt of the days it borrowed Age expectantly waits to pay—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Waits and dreams of the past, and sorrows Only to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Science and Longevity</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">tatistics show that of the people who live to he over eighty years of age 56 percent lived in comfortable circumstances, 10 percent were rich, and 34 percent were poor; 90 percent had always enjoyed good health; 92 percent had had good digestion; 88 percent had had good appetites; 94 percent had led an active life, while only 6 percent had led a sedentary life. Only 7 percent had lived much out of doors; and as they grew older they gradually lowered their activities. Nearly all were good sleepers, not necessarily long sleepers, but sound ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Medical men have noted that many men of activity pass away a short time after retiring from business at the age of sixty; and in a discussion of the subject in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Medical Review of Reviews</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> not one of the profession advocated retirement, but a large group advocated hard work, merely stipulating that after sixty years of age one must pay closer attention to the laws of personal hygiene. Play was stressed by several, systematic exercise by others, vacations by two, and care in eating by six.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been noted that people who have reached eighty or more years of age die as a rule suddenly. Often they fall asleep without any pain. The machine stops; it has run down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Jacques Loeb, of the Rockefeller Institute, in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Science Monthly</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> for December, 1919, tells the real reason why people die. We have read it twice without understanding it, except that it seems to us to teach that people die because they stop breathing. In the hope that some of our readers may have better success in seeing what Dr. Loeb is trying to get at we reproduce the paragraph which bears most directly on the subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Recent progress in physical chemistry permits us to state tiiat the spontaneous disintegration of the body which set-in at death (at the proper temperature and proper degree of moisture) is a process of digestion, comparable to that which the meat we eat undergoes in our stomach nr.d intestines. The essential nature of digestion is in this case the transformation of the solid meat into subhibln products by two ferments—pepsin, which exists jp the stomach ; and trypsin, which exists in the intestines. The successive treatment of meat by the two ferments results in the breaking up of the large insoluble molecules into the small soluble molecules of amino acids which are absorbed by the blood and carried to the cells of the body, where they are utilized to build up new solid cell matter. These two ferments, pepsin and trypsin, exist not only in the digestive organs, but * in many and possibly in all living cells; and the question arises, Why do they not constantly digest and thus destroy our body while life lasts? A tentative answer to this question has been given by Dernby, who has been able to show that the cooperation of both ferments it required in the same cell for the work of destruction, and that this cooperation of both ferments becomes possible only at a certain degree of acidity, which cannot be reached in the living body on account of the constant removal of acid through respiration and oxidation. When respiration ceases the degree of acidity necessary for the digestive action of both ferments in the same cell is reached, leading to gradual digestion and liquefaction of the tissues which characterizes the disintegration of the dead body. Death, then, in a human being means the permanent cessation of respiration.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prenatal Influence and Longevity</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">r. A. L Logan, in an address before the Allied Medical Association of America, in New York, is of the opinion that there is no reason why man should not live to be a thousand years old, with proper care and dieting, provided the parents have, by prenatal influence, equipped the child favorably as respects constitution and disposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Nascher also indicates his belief in the same principle. He calls attention to the fact that out of every 100,000 persons who reach the age of ten years, nearly 36,000 reach the age of seventy, about 13,300 reach the age of eighty, and 1,330 reach the age of ninety. He thinks that longevity does not depend upon the mode of life, environment, health, or any other outside factor, but upon the constitution one has inherited, As the body between infancy and old age passes through several stages he is hopeful of determining what the proper length of each stage should be, with a view of ascertaining what really should be the length of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. William S. Welch, of Johns Hopkins University. Baltimore, Md., argues along somewhat similar lines, stating that the constitution seems to determine the arrival of the dreaded hour when the powers begin to fail, and that constitution is a legacy, not an achievement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Welch says that our greater knowledge of life and its preservation has added twelve and a half years to the span of life in the last century, most of it in early life, infant mortality having been greatly reduced; that not much has been done for those who have reached fifty years, for after a person has reached that age</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">death is generally caused by some organic hormone. It has been learned that with the dis-</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fred B. &quot;Pitney, writing in The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tribune,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and noting that the length of human life is increasing, suggests that what was meant by the Psalmist's familiar declaration was really this that &quot;[under the present limitations of our knowledge] the days of our years are threescore years and ten”. The same writer looks forward to the possibility of h</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">uma</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">n beings living to reach 2,000 years of age, due to the discovery (!) &quot;that life is a chemical reaction now requiring seventy years to complete”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Buffon found that several animals lived seven times as long as it took them to gain their complete growth, and on this basis thought the normal duration of the life of man should be 210 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Harriett Luella McCollum, reasoning from the fact that in the most advanced specimens of the human family not ten percent of the brain cells are developed, argues that in two more generations the normal span of life will be 150 years and in a century or so it will be 600. It will be even better than that, we can assure her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Longevity by the Gland Route</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN a frog is hatched from an egg, it has a long tail but no legs. It takes three or four months normally for the legs to develop. If the thyroid gland of the tadpole is removed, it will never grow any legs at all If it is fed on the thyroid glands of other frogs or other animals it will grow the legs at once. The thyroid gland contains traces of iodine; and it is interesting to know that tadpoles have been changed into frogs by feeding them minute quantities of inorganic iodine. Iodine has something to do with development and therefore with longevity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Science is now at the stage where the importance ’of,, the various glands of the body is dimly comprehended and is being closely studied. It has been discovered that the thymus gland, a gland behind the thorax, is old when we come into the world, and at the age of fourteen disappears; it has played its part in the development of life^and is no longer needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Recent studies have brought to light the fact that the ductless glands of the body supply an organism (which, like vitamines, has not been isolated) to which has been given the name of</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' appearance of the hormones come old age and death. Would you EveT Keep a full supply of hormones on hand. How to do it is the question that is bothering everybody, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports continue to come of the good results obtained from the transplantation of energy glands. Dr. L. L. Stanley, surgeon at San Quentin Prison, California, speaking before the • California Medical Society, cites forty cases where these glands were transplanted upon prisoners. All of the operations were successful, and the patients immediately gained physically and mentally. General debility gave way to robust vitality, wrinkles were automatically removed, sight and hearing and appetite all improved, as a general result of the strengthening of the body by the transplantation of the glands. Eleven of these transplantations were from humans and twenty-nine from goats, and there was no difference to be noted in the after effects. The operation is simple, and the recovery rapid. The glands intended for transplanting may be preserved for a week by being immersed in vaseline and frozen to a temperature of 12 degrees Fahrenheit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the experiments which are being made to preserve or restore vitality one of the oddest is that undertaken by Dr. J. H. Parsegan, of New York. The Doctor has invented a machine for stitch</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ing</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">g human hair into a bald scalp by means of a fast-working needle which thrusts the hairs into the epidermis. The Doctor has sewed fifty snips of feminine hair into his scalp and claims that some of them have grown since the good work began of transforming his doorknob pate into a mossy bank of verdure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Longevity by the Temperature Route</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">D</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a. Loeb has been experimenting with the fruit-fly, and has discovered that the duration of the life of the fly may be multiplied almost nine times by keeping it in a cold temperature. Ordinarily the fly lives twenty-one days at a temperature of S6 degrees Fahrenheit, while if the temperature is reduced to 50 degrees it lives 177A days. It is from this experiment that Doctor Loeb formed the opinion that life is a chemical reaction, for the reason that the influence of temperature on the life of the fly is the same as on the velocity of a chemical reaction. He argues from these premises that if the human blood could be kept at a permanent temperature of 45.5 Fahrenheit the average life now reaching to threescore years and ten would stretch out to twenty-seven times that length. But who would wish to slowly linger in a state of semi-freezing for nineteen hundred years, experiencing little, if any, of the joys or sadness, the pains or pleasures that would be one's inheritance in a more comfortable temperature!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Much interest has been aroused by the Loeb experiments. It seemed demonstrated in the case of the housefly that the period of its youth was increased in the exact ratio that the whole life-span was increased, but longevity by means of lowered temperature does not seem possible with human beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Eugene L. Fisk, medical director of the Life Extension Institute, commenting on the Loeb’ experiments, hopes for the addition of thirty or forty years to the span of human life, but expects it to be accomplished only by hygienic living, hygienic eating, with instant attention to any defects that may be found. He suggests close attention to the category of conditions antagonistic to human life, including heredity, infection, poison, food deficiency, food excess, fear, grief, emotional excess, and psychic apathy due to lack of life interest He draws comfort from the fact that the turtle Lives to be 200 years old, while the California redwoods are virtually everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Alex Carrel, of the Rockefeller Institute, in his efforts to find some of the secrets of life, has taken the heart of an unhatched chicken and kept it alive for seven years. It is still growing. What is to be learned from this experiment we do not yet know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Development, Maturity, and Decline</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">D</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">r. Nascher, previously referred to in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">this </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">article, has pointed out that a careful study of those who have led quiet, regular lives shows that the period of development is thirty years, of maturity the same and of decline the same; £ that each of these periods is broken in the middle, at fifteen by puberty, at forty-five by change qf life, at seventy-five by senile decline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Nascher points out that although there is no increase in height after twenty-one the body continues to grow in every other direction. At thirty the man needs a larger hat, a wider suit, • larger shoes and larger gloves than he did at twenty-one; and his heart and lungs are at maturity, which was not the case nine years earlier. The Bible shows that thirty is the age of maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Investigations show that the point of lowest mortality is twelve years. At twenty the risk of death is twice as great The years to thirty are the ones in which the least proportionate increase in mortality is noted. At forty the risk is five times as great as at twelve; at fifty it is eight times as great, and at sixty it is sixteen times as great</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Central National Bank has published data showing that twenty is the age when the son thinks he knows more than his father; at thirty he concludes that he does not know as much as he imagined, and that his father is a man of fair intelligence; at thirty-five the son realizes that life is a reality, and that he is not as smart as he once thought, and that his father was a man of excellent judgment. At forty-five 16 percent are dead, 65 percent are self-supporting, 15 percent are dependent wholly or in part, and only 4 percent have accumulated something and kept it After fifty not one in fifty can recover his financial footing in case of failure.</span></p>

The skeletons were found in a stone house which was partially submerged by the hardened lava, and which was reached with difficulty by a native sheepowner. The hair of the girl was of a reddish brown. and beside her head were two large turquoise ear-rings.

The note is on a clay tablet at the University of Pennsylvania and has four witnesses, who placed upon it their seals instead of their signatures.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">During the days of the Lord's coming kingdom on earth all the mysterious treasures of antiquity will be located, every human being whose remains now lie mouldering in the tomb will be brought back to life, and the era of everlasting human life as a gift from God Almighty at the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ will have dawned upon a poor world that longs for this great gift, but knows not how to obtain it. It will come in but one way. Science will never bring it God alone knows the secret of life; and as far as humanity is concerned, this secret is all in the keeping of the One that bought us with His own blood. *Tn him was life and the life was the light of men.’*</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> W. X. Pelle</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">KNOWLEDGE is perception of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Understanding</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is knowing what the knowledge you have means. It is knowledge digested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A person might eat an apple, but it would do </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> no good unless he digested it. The same is true in respect to knowledge. Adam ate the apple and by the time the apple was digested he understood what sin really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Wisdom</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the proper use or application of the knowledge which one understands. It might be compared, in the above crude illustration, to the proper use of the strength derived from the digested apple. Many persons possess great knowledge, and they have the proper understanding thereof; but the majority of them might not know how to use it. For example: You may know that the big fellow across the street is an ignoramus, and you may understand fully what that means. But if you possess wisdom, you will refrain from telling him that fact.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HAVE you seen the article published in the Denver, Colorado, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rocky Mountain News </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of January 19, 1922, and entitled “Medieval Jails’*, by F. J. Haskins, Washington, D. C. Out of two hundred county jails recently visited, only ten were fit for human occupation. This is the report just sent in by Mrs. H. S. McIntire, Secretary of the Prisoners’ Relief Society, after a trip from Washington, D. C. to Seattle, Washington, during which she visited some two hundred jails in order to observe conditions. Mrs. McIntire found the majority of these institutions dirty and unhealthy, with graft rampant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The prisoner who sends out for a quart of milk is apt to have to pay twenty-five cents, and the change goes to the jailer or whoever does the errand. Vermin of all sorts are the rule rather than the exception in county jails, we are told. Disinfectants, sanitary precautions in ease of illness, and clean kitchens are luxuries which seem to have no place in the average American jail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Helen Keller and Heifetz</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HE great violinist Heifetz was recently in Denver and at the Brown Hotel he played for Helen Keller, the world-famed blind and deaf woman, whose attainments, under the tutelage of Miss Sullivan, have astonished the world, The Denver </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> narrates the &lt;tory:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“For ohee when Heifetz was playing the audience was more interesting than the player. All eyes were on the blind woman as sho placed the tips of her wondrously sensitized fingers under the belly of Heifetz’s Stradivarius. The bow swept the strings, and the woman quivered a.« i thoroughbred rave horse under the whip. The melody ^wept through her being. Her body responded to every note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“She seemed to feel everything that the Cremona was trying to say to her. HeiL-tz was playing ‘The Hymn to the Sun* from die opera ’J&gt;e Cuj d’Or*. As the magic tones mounted the scales, the woman seemed to rise with it; her whole being quivered with an ecstasy that made those who looked on wonder if it was all delight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“But it was not only the tempo to which she responded—the vibrations of the strings, fast or slow. Sho seemed to divine the real message of the music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“‘So tender, so tender/ she murmured once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“Then Heifetz played *La Chasse,’ an old French hunting song—a gay, rollicking tune. The blind and deaf woman laughed with delight. There remained no doubt She was hearing it all It was as though her whole being vibrated with the violin itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The master of the violin was playing on a greater instrument than any ever turned out from the workshop of Antonio Stradivari. He was playing on what is probably the most highly attuned organism in the world —Miss Helen Keller.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Seventy Cents for</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dollar</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN the farmer takes products worth a dollar to market he can get only seventy cents’ worth in return. In 1910 the farmer’s dollar’s worth of products would buy $1.06 worth of other products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the big-profit year of 1918 the farmer for a brief period could get $1.04 for his dollar’s worth, but he was prevented from making any great profit and becoming a profiteer by the maximum price set by the Tumulty administration and by Herbert Hoover’s food administration tactics. In 1920 at the behest of the packers, it is recorded, the Department of Justice got after the farmer’s products and started the deflation which resulted in the ruin of tens of thousands of able, hard-working farmers, who found it impossible to compete against such odds as big business and big politics imposed upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is fortunate for the American farmers that in 1920 they elected to Congress the men who have now coalesced into the farm block of about twenty-five Senators and a hundred-odd Congressmen. These alert and progressive legislators are showing the farmers what can be accomplished by politics in action. They are not numerous enough to control Congress, but are sufficient in number to hinder any legislation whatever if the farmers* interests are not likely to be properly taken care of. It is expected that in the fall elections of 1922 the farm block will be augmented by a sizable labor block, jointly able to make considerable headway in maintaining and advancing the rights of the common people against the now all-powerful Wall Street Block in Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Praying to be Seen of Men &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By J. Suwinder</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">GOING from the sublime to the ridiculous seems to be the evolutionary process of present-day ecclesiasticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From those days of simplicity and faith when Jesus taught His disciples how to pray, it has been a long stride to this marvelous brain-age. But we have evoluted wonderfully. Instead of ignorant and unlearned fishermen, we now have “best minds” and “profound thinkers”. In the place of the simple prayer of faith, expressing the heart's most earnest desires, has come the high-sounding dictation, advising Jehovah how, when, and where to bestow His favors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Any cause, project, or desire is sufficient excuse for almost any D. D. to indulge in one of those incantations, if only a crowd of some sort can be induced to listen to the performance. All sorts of drives, sawdust trails, peace conferences, and other “worthwhile” innovations have this as a permanent feature of their programs. Consistency is one jewel which the “men of the cloth&quot; do not covet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Recent frantic efforts on the part of the Church Federation to enlist prayers for the Washington Cdnference reminds one of an incident related by a lawyer in a certain Indiana college town a few years ago. That section of the state was experiencing a protracted drought, which was severely damaging the crops and menacing the health of the community. A mass meeting was held in the Methodist Church to discuss the situation and provide relief. It having been unanimously agreed that a committee be appointed to offer up prayers for rain, the moderator proceeded to name seven or eight prominent “church pillars” more favorably known for their ability to ‘kicE in’ with the ‘change’ than for their piety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeming to have run out of material, the moderator hesitated a short time, and then re-markeji that he thought they should have two or th restore. At this juncture one impious brother arose and said: “I think we have enough, Mr. Moderator; we don't want a flood!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sunlight and Health </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Dr. S. Rosenstrauch </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SUNLIGHT, it has been proved, is more helpful to vitality and health than fresh air. As a vitality builder, there is nothing much better than a thorough coat of sunburn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As you may know, it is not the bright light, nor is it the hot ray of the noonday sun that “tans your hide”. It is a radiant energy, beyond the visible red, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet end of the spectrum—a species of ultra-violet ray not perceived or sensed by the human eye, which tans the skin and has been found to possess remarkable curative qualities in the treatment of many germs and glandular diseases. Whether from the sun, a candle, a lamp, a gas-jet or an arc light, whitish light is really a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow. The rainbow is called a spectrum or white light- analyzed, dissected or split up into the real color visible to the eye. Raindrops act as bubbles or prisms of water and reflect back against the sky the dissolved yellowish sunlight This returned light is split up into the natural colors, and forms the rainbow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If crystal, a bit of quartz, or certain other transparent objects be interposed between any source of light and a smooth surface it will split the light the same as the raindrops do in producing rainbow colors. The result is called the colors of the spectrum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">By scientific methods it has been discovered that beyond the violet end of the spectrum there are thousands of other sets of radiations invisible to the human eye. These are the rays that cause the tanning and the pigmentation of the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Sickly, anemic, and tubercular people do not freckle or tan as easily as do healthier people; still these invisible chemical rays seem the most important to the sickly and anemic. By experiment in the laboratory and in actual practice it has been proved that the germs, microbes and bacteria of diseases are quickly destroyed by &quot;sunlight&quot;, or rather by the chemical rays of light that produce freckles and tan.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T\OUBTLESS most readers of The Golden Age are familiar with the well-known work of fiction by A. Conan Doyle entitled “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”, in which the principal character figures as a dual personality. As a result of certain experiments he is supposed to have discovered a means by which he could accomplish the end that he desired—the separation of his two selves (which he recognized as co-existent in one org</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">anism</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">), the elimination of the lower self and the perpetuation of the higher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He soon found that his success was merely a temporary one, and that he was not able to avert periodic lapses to a state in which his “evil” . self was in the ascendant. As time went on the duration of these “lapses” increased, until at last the lower tendencies prevailed entirely and he found it impossible to bring about a reversion to the more desirable state,' and died a painful and shocking death. As Dr. Jekyll he was a respected member of society and lived a life worthy of emulation: as Mr. Hyde he was an outcast and murderer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The possession of the elements of a dual character is not limited to the fictitious person of “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”, but this duality is a quality possessed by all; for while in some . the higher qualities prevail and in others the lower, we believe there are few who do not still possess at heart some traces of the original likeness of our common forefather, Adam, of whom we are told that he was “made in the [human and earthly] Likeness of God”. Which of us, begotten to a new nature, does not realize the coexistence of the two! — for we know that “the flesh lusteth against the spirit”, that we cannot do the things that we would. Certainly the apostle Paul must have had this </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">realization </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In mind when he said: “The things that I do, those I would not, and the things that I would not do, those I do,” meaning to say (as personifying the Jewish people) that in spite of his best efforts to keep the law, evil sometimes prevailed. Not even he, noble character that he was, was free from the effects of the Adamic fall; nor ‘ could he ever hope to be while he remained tabernacled in an imperfect body of flesh. And we, too, share his lot; the same struggle is ever present. But not for that need we to lose hope; for we are told that “He [Jehovah] knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dost”. (Psalm 103:14) As long as we are actuated by a fervent </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">desire</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to live aright in spite of our ► present imperfect organisms (which now render such a thing impossible) and would not willingly do otherwise were we living in perfect conditions, we ^are safe. In the Millennial age, the inauguration of which is but a few years distant, the Human race will have perfect conditions under which to progress from height to . height With the great majority victory will * follow on victory, until at last complete perfection of mind and body will be attained. Then, and only then, will man be really free—master and ruler of himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let each do the best he can now, even though it may be little, keeping in mind the words of the wise man that “as a man </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">think</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">eth in his heart, so is he”. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">International vs. National Markets </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Byo.Mathew </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mb. Editor : In The Golden Age of August 31, 1921, it is stated by one of your contributors that “the only remedy for the present conditions of unemployment is the restoration of Europe to a condition similar to that which existed before the war, that we may sell our products”. I wish to say that such seems to be impossible, as well as out of date;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While I realize the necessity of international commerce, yet to say that America is dependent upon Europe to remedy her present condition does not seem at all logical Why not develop a plan that will improve our markets at home by raising the buying power of the workers so that they may become a current market for their own products! Has there yet been a time when all the people in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">erica were oversupplied with the necessities of life!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">America might have Europe for a market and overcome the unemployment problem. But the unrest and discontent of her masses will never be overcome until every worker receives enough wages to buy the things that make life comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is agreed that with a’surplus of wealth created by the toiling millions whose wages are too small to afford the necessities of life there is a need for a foreign market; and the financier will use the foreign market successfully to dispose of that surplus wealth for himself, even though it will infringe upon the rights of a foreign people. Moreover, he will do it even though it may cause international friction—war—and conscription of the toilers to cross the sea, fight, and perhaps die to protect a market for the purpose of getting rid of the products which he has helped to produce, and of which he and his family are in need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This“foreign market”problem has been handed down to us from that far-off time when it was supposed that the greater part of the human race were in a semi-savage condition and would make cruel weapons of warfare, such as a stone tied to a stick, in order to make war on their neighboring tribes and thus get the things they needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But our twentieth-century civilization, while looking back with horror at the cruel deeds of these savages, has invented dreadnaughts with a dozen or more fourteen-inch guns, submarines, zeppelins, and poison-gas, and makes war upon their brethren across the sea in order to get rid of the things which they need in their own homelands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We may rest assured that as long as the world’s commerce is owned' and controlled by private exploiters, and the military forces are used by them to protect their domestic interests , and their foreign markets, we shall have panics, unemployment, and wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes; the loom that weaves the present social fabric has become greatly out of order, and is giving poqr satisfaction everywhere. It is to be much doubted that our money-tinkers will be able to fix the old machine; for it has been condemned by an all-powerful God who will in due time cause it to be thrown into the junk heap, never to be used again to enrich the few and to enslave and impoverish the many.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Recently a proposal was made to give them alphabetical names instead, to avoid confusion.

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Caverns of Kentucky By Ben Rockoff </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DEEP down in the mightiest recesses of this earth, fastened to a heap of rock is a little sign-board whose legend is, “There is a path from the lowliest depths, that leads to the loftiest heights”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The significance of this statement is nowhere better illustrated than in the immense, wonderful, weird caverns of Kentucky. So vast and intricate are these subterranean labyrinths that some of them have never been fully explored. Not only could David and his little band have found shelter there, but whole armies could find room in the apparently numberless and endless passages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Among the latest caves to be discovered is Great Crystal Cave, near Cave City. Its presence had long been suspected by the owners of the farm in which its entrance is located, because of the rustling of twigs and weeds in the vicinity caused by the constant air currents coming from crevices in the rocky mountain-side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These currents, which are as strong as a good breeze, are found at the entrances of the larger caves. They flow out of the cave in the summer, but into it in the winter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The entrance to Great Crystal Cave is by a descent through rough rock, past a great inclined slab of rock into a low passage with rough sides and floor, but a ceiling so level that it seems to have been made by man. This passage becomes gradually larger, until suddenly we come to a wonderfully great and lofty passage, so high that a good thrower can barely cast a stone to hit the highest portion of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This is fittingly called “The Grand Canyon”. “ The mighty grandeur of the rough rock as revealed by the light of the guide and the lanterns of the visitors is well nigh indescribable. It is evident of course that there is no natural llght jn these vast depths and so intense is the darkness that it can almost be felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The great walls of this canyon of rock rise above us, narrowing down to form a ledge or, as it were, a balcony on either side. Then they widen and narrow again, forming another ledge and then i curve together to form a beautiful arched ceiling. Before us the canyon curves away into vast darkness. Behind us is utter blackness. We are completely at the mercy of our guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' Our lanterns cast weird, everchanging shadows as we proceed to greater depths; for the greatest wonders lie in the greatest depths. We climb over great masses of fallen rock, then tread a soft, sandy pathway turning this way and that. We pause to sip crystal clear, icecold water, from a spring hidden in a rocky nook; again we force ourselves through a narrow place barely large enough to permit us to pass and soon, wonder of wonders, we come to Fairies’ Retreat!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Surely, had there ever been fairies, they would have dwelt here. The walls and ceiling are literally covered with crystal encrustations. Fantastic shapes and odd designs abound everywhere. One can </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ima</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">gine figures of lions, tigers, people, church spires. There are miniature heavens with miniature stars and clouds. Almost anything can be imagined in the fanciful designs on the walls and ceilings, none of which was made by the hand of man. The natural agencies and forces of God formed it all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Most wonderful of all are the beautiful, pure white crystal flowers that grow on the walls. Each has four petals emanating from a common center and curving gracefully back toward the crystal encrusted wait There are tiny ones, smaller than a mayflower; and large ones, as big as a sunflower. They are not a vegetable growth; for there is no plant life in the caves, excepting here and there a pure white mold which resembles frost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Very little life of any kind can be found. The only animal life in these depths other than the fish found in the subterranean rivers and lakes, is the cave cricket, a sort of daddy-long-legs with two hind legs like a cricket’s. It is a sluggish insect, found beneath rocks. What it lives on in such a place as this, is a mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Continuing our travels we reach a great natural dirt roadway, large enough and level enough to accommodate an automobile. Qn and on and on we go until tired, and yet our guide says we have only begun our journey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">On the return trip our guide took us aside to a sandy ledge which forms the floor of an arched niche. Here, reclining in the sand was the skeleton of a boy, probably an Indian lad. In the frail remains of his bones we can read the tragedy. He had unlocked the hidden mystery of the cave years before the white man found it. But he had unlocked a treasure so vast that he was lost in it; and after vain wandering where day and night are alike, where he heard no sound except his own footfall, find-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ing no gleam of light, weary, footsore with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">clim</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">bin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">g</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> he flung himself down in despair and awaited death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We go on and reach the entrance, having decided to see more of these wonders later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MAMMOTH CAVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Next day we visit the&quot; most famous of caverns, the great Mammoth Cave, which has 152 miles of known passages varying from small openings, mere crevices, to lofty domes. The entrance to this cave is by a great opening in the mountainside, which rapidly narrows down until it is only as large as a small door. Carefully shielding the lights which have been provided, we are led past the narrow passage into the Great Rotunda, from which most of the passages begin. The Rotunda is a great vault-like room and from it we descend into one of the passages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We pass through the Valley of Humility, so low that we must humbly bow as we go on; we pass through Fat Man’s Misery, so narrow that even the thin folks must go side-ways. The guide shows us the Bottomless Pit, and towering over it the Great Dome. We see stalactites, like great icicles, hanging from the walls and ceilings, and stalagmites built up to meet them. They represent the result of drop after drop of water falling through ages of time. We find towering above us pillars that in their rough beauty and imposing massiveness have a grandeur that no human touch could give.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And away down in the depths, with hundreds of feet of rock above, we come to Echo River. We embark on this stream, strange as the fabled Styx, peering intently into the blackness before us. We are on a voyage that comparatively few of earth’s millions ever take. Our guide sings a few notes. After a brief wait they come back from the cavernous beyond, but intensified and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">mellowed like the tones of a great pipe organ, reverberating and resounding until lost in a last faint trail of sound. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After twenty or thirty minutes on this greatest of subterranean rivers we disembark, and by more circuitous passages start back for the ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">entrance. But before reaching it there comes one last strenuous climb through solid rock, up and up, catching a hand-hold here and a foot* hold there, squirming, twisting and turning toward the top until suddenly we are back in the Great Rotunda. We pass, out into the open air, but it seems hot and oppressive in comparison to the ever constant temperature of the cave, which day and night, winter and summer, is but 54° Fahrenheit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How much like the Christian’s pathway is this experience! We must follow our,Guide and trust Him implicitly. We have only the light He furnishes. We are in the world, even as we are literally in the heart of the earth when in the cave, yet entirely separated from the world out- -' side. But, oh, what gross darkness all around; j and yet hidden in that darkness what beauty, I what grandeur! But only those who have a I light can see it, and then it is often necessary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">for the guide to point out the beauties to us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At times the path seems wide and smooth. <sup>1 </sup>Sometimes it is rough and narrow; and careful attention to the Guide is essential or the bottom- <sup>1 </sup>less pit of death may claim us. But we find refreshment in the cooling waters of truth at the well-springs in the rook. At the greatest depth flows the river of God’s love, and the notes of God’s truth reverberate until all shall hear. The atmosphere of peace never changes &gt;&nbsp;with our varied experiences, but like the exhilarating constant temperature of the cave is ever the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Doctor Black </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Rebecca Fair Doney</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NE day, while waiting on the street, where busy cars filled up the track, above my head I saw this sign: “Free Consultation — Doctor Black”. I looked again. “A Specialist” was written there in letters bold; I wondered:“Does he really wish to heal the sick or get their gold!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“What kind of patients visit him! I’ll wait a little while and see.” And so I let my car go by, and watched the door—603. I had not very long to wait till one by one they passed within</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—the rich, the poor, the young, the old, the deaf, the lame, the fat, the thin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I said: “I must investigate; for I would really like to know what are the methods of this man; so up the steps with them I'll go&quot;. Into the spacious waiting-room where many sat, I made my way, and boldly questioned one and all, and one and all made haste to say</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That they had suffered many ills, and with disease and pain been racked, till life itself a harden seemed, before they heard of Doctor Black. &quot;Well, is he helping you!” I asked. Each one was ready to declare what benefits he had received from all the treatments given there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The testimonies that they gave were wonderful, if they were true. I listened till a nurse appeared and said: &quot;The Doctor waits for you&quot;. She led me to another room; and as she bade me seated be, a man of grave and kindly face entered the room and greeted mq.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Now, Doctor Black,” I said to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> &quot;I chanced to see your sign down there, and saw so many coming up that I made bold to climb the stair to ask you what your secret is. Have you discovered something new! Have hidden springs of life, long sought but never found, been shown to you!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Doctor smiled and shook his head. &quot;To such renown I lay no claim; old as creation is the force: Jehovah's lightnings is its name. This mighty power, so long unknown, of God's displeasure stood a sign; and sins of nations, or of men, brought down the fires of wrath divine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Down through long ages, man has feared this force: nor did he once surmise that God would give to him, some day, the power to draw it from the skies, and harness it, and master it, and let it do him good or ill: but now today man holds the reins, and bids the genie do his will</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Man makes him drive his chariot wheels, and turn his darkness into light, and give </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> wings to cleave the air o'er land and sea in boundless flight. When winter winds blow loud and fast o'er drifting snow and icy ways, the genie fills his master's house with pleasant warmth of summer days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;He bears his master's voice afar; nor time nor distance stops his pace, till those who live the poles apart hold conversation face to face. Long, weary years, man toiled and groaned <sup>J</sup>nearh&lt;&lt;burdens far too hard for him, so hard, they sapped his very life, till forms were bowed and eyes grew dim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But one glad day the genie came, and said: Tve come to set you free, poor ti red one; I'll be your slhve. Lay all your heavy tasks on me.' And now, wherever wheels go round, and hammers drive, and shuttles hum, the genie works; while man looks on and dreams the Golden Age has come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;But, sir, the genie I control must use his power to cure and heal; and as the first essential part he must the hidden cause reveaL This fluoroscopic instrument lays all of nature's secrets bare, and paints the lurking dread disease in all its hideous details there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And having thus before his eyes the ravages disease has made, the doctor with a skillful hand can call the genie to his aid, and so direct this mighty force that it shall bring relief and joy. I shall be pleased to show you, sir. some of the methods we employ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;This is the new electric bath; from all these walls the healing rays shine bn the patient resting there who sits, as in a golden haze, while light and heat both play their part with gentle, penetrating power, that cleanses, soothes, and stimulates, restoring nature's choicest dower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;When patients come with tortured nerves or rheumatism's fiendish pain, high-frequency is here applied, and quick relief and ease they gain. This treatment stimulates the skin, and sends the blood in quicker flow till nerves and muscles feel its power and all the body is aglow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;This ozone generator gives that vital product of the air found 'neath the fragrant pine tree's shade, or on the mountain top so fair; a pleasant medication this, a tonic, good for every one; its healing, soothing power is felt in every tube from nose to lung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Within the lungs it meets the blood, which creeps along, well freighted down with waste, and refuse, gathered up from every part, along its rounds. It seizes this, and burns it up, and thus relieves the blood, which flows back on its rounds with quicker pace, repairing, building, as it goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Sit down a moment in this chair, hold these electrodes in your hands; and while the current through you flows, I'll try to help you understand how great a work this genie does while you are sitting here at ease. This is the greatest thing that's known to rid the body of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;On every gland, both large and small, his magic power is exercised, as from the swiftly flowing blood each one secretes its own supplies. He carries oxidation on. as nerves and tissue both decay, and through the kidneys, lungs, and skin he sends the poison streams away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Upon the sympathetic nerves which govern stomach, lungs and heart, the genie lays a master hand, and added strength to each imparts; digestive powers are increased, new vigor to the heart is given, And from the blood — the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">source of life—are poisons and bacteria driven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;One would not think while sitting here, how high the voltage is, that goes through every part without a shock; the only way the patient knows is by the warmth in hand or wrist; or, if the doctor touches him a bluish flame or sparks leap out, where'er the fingers meet the skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“If we should wish to specialize on certain parts, and those alone, we use these pads, the Morton Wave, and very good results are shown. This is the radiant treatment here; this, vibratory, for the spine. And many others, I could show for each disease, the proper kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The human maladies are few which we cannot alleviate, and many, very many cures, if you had time, I could relate.” And so we went from place to place, I interested, he enthused and very pleased to demonstrate the merits of the treatment used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I wattehed the white-robed nurses work, their whole desire to serve and please, with skillful touch and tender hand relieving pain and giving ease. From cashier’s desk to treatment rooms, up stairs, or down, the slightest call brought quick response and ready aid. I fell in love with one and all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;What you are doing here,” I said, “to lessen pain and lengthen clays, and give relief to suffering man, deserves the highest meed of praise.” “I have the last and best,” he said, ‘Tm sure you will agree with me, the future doctors of the earth are 'Doctors Electricity'.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“These future doctors,” I replied, “how many will they heal and bless! The curse of Adam rests on all: the world is full of wretchedness. In every land 'neath every clime, disease and suffering meet the eye. To every one that you can cure a million pine away and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">'For Death is sitting on his throne, his hands are always full of prey; he gathers here and gathers there, and none have power to say him nayYou have a sympathetic heart; you’re not indifferent. I know, to all this heritage of sin, the crime, the misery, and woe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">’•The shivering, hungry, homeless ones, the broken hearts that sigh and weep; the tears of man likA rivers run; the griefs of man are Oceans deep. 0 Doctor, you, as well as I. have vainly wished we had the might to straighten up this poor old world; the power to make the wrong things right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“I know you will be glad to learn, Pm sure</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">you’ll not offended be if I should tell of better ones than 'Doctors Electricity’. ¥ou have the latest, not the last; for after you shall those arise who, wielding powers unknown to you shall make this earth a paradise</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And banish sickness and disease. Who are</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">those doctors, do you ask! To saints of this, the <sup>1 </sup>gospel age, will God entrust this mighty task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These future doctors of the earth have been in training, all unknown. The first to train and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">' graduate was Jesus Christ, Jehovah’s Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Such sweet obedience He showed, such loving zeal, such faithfulness, God set Him up as pattern grand, and made Him teacher of the rest. And all along the narrow way which He had been the first to tread&lt;with tender care He leads His own, their Teacher, Guide and Living Head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“This is no ordinary school, and very few can pay the price; the cost is great, all they possess must be laid down, a sacrifice; and they must obligate themselves to be obedient to each rule;. they must subscribe to all the terms to be admitted to that school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Small wonder, then, there are not more who crave to share their Master's cup. The earthly treasures are so dear that few can bear to give them up. But there are those whose eye of ■ faith sees — far beyond the present loss — the crown of immortality; and gladly they embrace the cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“And coming with their little all, they count it as an honor great to lay it down beside their Lord’s, and share with Him in His estate of deep humiliation, first, of suffering oven unto death, and then, to highest station raised as King and Lord of all the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“They ask to have their names enrolled, and place themselves in His dear hands to train and tutor at His will. He knows how much each one can stand. Though long and hard the lessons are that only end when life is done, they weary not but con them o’er until they master every one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“So jealous is He over them, He watches them both night and clay; no evil powers can touch His own, no adverse winds can blow their • way. They are the apple of Ris eye, in all the earth there's none so fair; He spares them not, but molds, and shapes, until He sees love's fruitage rare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“He lets the fiery furnace burn. But He is with them in the heat to temper it, till in each heart He sees His image all complete, and says,</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Their souls, their lives, their future hopes, they calmly yield into His hands; they close their eyes to earthly scenes, and open them on angel bands—such glorious beings, mortal eyes can never hope to gaze upon—who had been sent to welcome them* and bring them to their heavenly home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Around Jehovah's mighty throne where rainbows Sash their radiance bright, the seraphim of heaven stand in all the colors of the light.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;The sweetest music fills the air; the golden harps, the tuneful lyres, the chiming bells, all join their notes to heaven's grand celestial choirs. And then, a hush falls over all, the harpers cease, the bells are dumb, as through the ’vault of heaven runs the joyful sound, They come! They come!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;On, on they sweep, that radiant throng, till on the breezes sweet and clear, the first notes of the triumph song is borne to every listening ear. The waiting choirs take up the strain; the golden portals open wide; and there before His Father's face the Son presents His lovely bride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;So glorious to look upon, all heaven wonders at the sight; their rich embroidered garments are of costly linen, pure and white; and over these the purple robes, of heavenly royalty a sign; their golden crowns proclaim their right to life, immortal and divine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;He says, 'My Father, here behold the ones Thy love hath given me. Throughout the steep and rugged way, from Jordan’s depths to Calvary, their love for me has been so great, they faltered not, nor turned aside; earth's highest joys were naught, compared to being chosen as my briefer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot; 'Their names have been cast out with mine; they put behind them earthly fame; they were disowned by dearest friends; they suffered loss, reproach, and shame. They have been hated for my sake; tBey drained my cup of bitterness; they followed peace, they walked in love; and now they crave the power to bless?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;With looks of love which thrilled their hearts, the Father said, '0 beauteous One, all Itf&amp;aven unites to welcome thee, and see thee take thy promised throne. Of all the jewels I possess none with thy splendor can compare. Thou art my peerless diadem, 0 bride of Christ, divinely fair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;'Since thou didst leave thy father's house, and set </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">thine heart on heaven's estate, mine angels have received command upon thine every step to wait; thy lying down, thy rising up, have all been open to mine eyes; thy bread and water never failed, thine every need my love supplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“ '0 royal pair, I send thee forth, the promised Seed, to rule and bless. Cause every one to know my </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">name, make plain to all my righteousness.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;While glittering myriads wheeled and flashed to form that grand triumphal train, the harp's low sweet entrancing sound again takes up the bridal strain. It swells and swells, till every voice and bell and viol join the song as through the pearly gates once more the heavenly pair are borne along. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;They near the earth; and what a scene is spread before their pitying eyes—a world in chaos, steeped in blood! Is this the future paradise T Man’s hand against his fellow man in dreadful carnage, peace has fled; the powers of darkness reign supreme and every human hope lies dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;What is the first important thing those doctors do! you may inquire. The Scriptures make it very clear. They will lay hold of that old liar, and bind him fast and banish him who held the whole world in his thralL They'll roll the clouds of darkness back which covered </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mankind like a pall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And having locked the rascal up, they will proceed to liberate his slaves, who have in bondage been since Adam passed through Eden’s gate. The deadly evils drink and vice, twins, who have traveled hand in hand and left a trail of woe and death, will be swept out of every land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And every other evil thing shall follow in their train, they'll flee like mists before the sun when these M. D.’s begin their reign. I love to think upon their power; they only have to speak the word, and their commands are carried out as though it were the word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;To clean men's bodies up will be the'first step on the upward way; in simple laws of hygiene they'll be instructed every day. They'll learn the magic properties of water, sunlight, and pure air, and revelling in these, will grow each day, more healthful, young and fair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“No one shall suffer from the cold, no tattered rags, no shivering back; the busy looms shall weave for all, and goodly raiment none shall lack. The clothing of each one shall be of glorious hues, of texture fine; for beauty, comfort and for health, shall every garment be designed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Grand homes, with every mortal thing that mind could plan, or heart could crave, will dot the earth from pole to pole, and every one his own shall have. And there the genie will be found, the motive power in every home. None need to toil; he will combine a thousand servants all in one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Man never more shall cry for bread, none feel the pangs of hunger sore; the years of want forgotten are, as looking from his open door he sees his fields of waving grain, and knows his harvest time will come; his vineyards, with their clusters rare, are slowly ripening in the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“His orchard boughs are laden down with fruit of every taste and hue; his vines, with clusters bending low, are glistening in the morning dew. His gardens, reaching here and there, delight the eye with their array of every kind of food that grows, some new thing ripening every day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And flitting here, and flitting there, the birds sing in their leafy bowers, and give a concert, free to all, at morning, noon, and evening hours. So beautiful, so free from fear, of such resplendent plumage these, you’d think a rainbow had come down and lost itself among the trees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;And over all and crowning it, the sweetest perfumes fill the air, as nature with a lavish hand strews flowers, flowers, everywhere. Their beauty captivates the heart, their glorious hues entrance the eye, till man's whole being thrills with pcaise and gratitude to God on high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Their^patients’ bodies and their health, are not the doctors’ only care; for every one must go to school, and minds, as well as bodies, share in this uplift, this glorious climb to reach per-fec tion's highest plane, to stand where father Adam stood, and to his perfect powers attain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Their niTiicls have been so warped by sin, and so k'clouded by the lie that Satan told our mother Eve when he declared, ‘Thou shaft not die*. The higher faculties have been so subjugated by the fall, that proper balance has been lost and selfishness rules over alt</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“That lie, with all its dreadful brood of error, superstition, fear, shall be held up to scorn of all; and great Jehovah’s name be cleared. The beauties of His character shall be unfolded to their gaze, and every false, distorted view from every mind shall be erased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“They’ll see why justice has enforced His stern decree from age to age. They’ll magnify the wisdom shown in His great plan at every stage. They’ll stand in wonder at the love which sent His only Son to die, and let a rebel race have power to mock, and scourge, and crucify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“And when they see His mighty power, which governs all the universe displayed in their behalf each day, in rolling back sin's dreaful curse, their hearts will open up to God, as turn-eth flower to the sun; and resurrection’s glorious work in every one will be begun.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Can you not hear the shouts of joy as loved ones clasp their long-lost dead! When hungry empty arms are filled, when aching hearts are comforted!

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Precession of Equipoxes and the North Star</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> WELL-KNOWN* astronomer has described the Precession of the Equinoxes as “the • gyration of the axis of the earth around a perpendicular to the plane of its orbit in a period of 25,788 years”. The period has also been 'Stated as 25,868 years; approximately, it is 25,800 years. As the earth spins around on its orbit, it wobbles, and the wobbling motion causes the Celestial Pole to move very slowly , ' in a circle around the pole of the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the apparent path of the sun among the stars. There is also a very slight motion to the ecliptic itself and its pole; so the combined motion is somewhat complicated. The ancients, indeed, found it a very puzzling phenomenon; nor was it ever satisfactorily explained until the antiquated Ptolemaic system was superseded by that of Copernicus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Precession is the effect of the earth's response to two contrary movements—its rotation, and the pull of the sun’s and moon’s attraction on the inclination of its axis. At the equator, the earth’s rotation has a velocity of 1,040 and a fraction miles per hour. A sphere tends to keep in the same plane of rotation; so that the position of the earth’s axis would remain constant, if the plane of its equator passed through the sun. But the axis of the earth is not perpendicular to its orbit, but in-dined 23J degrees (more exactly, 23 degrees, 27 minutes, 8.23 seconds) to that perpendicular, which accounts for the phenomenon called the ^obliquity of the ecliptic” — the divergence of the Celestial Equator from the sun’s path. Ow-* ing to centrifugal force, our planet is an oblate &gt;&nbsp;spheroid, with its greatest diameter at its equator. Likewise the gaseous envelope of our planet is thinnest at the poles and at the equator thickened into a bulge, or ring, more than thirteen miles in depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As the plane of the earth’s orbit passes through the center of the sun, the attraction of p/' that limitary is continually exerted to overcome the tilt of its axis, which is maintained by rotation. The attraction of the sun is more powerful on that point of the gaseous ring nearest to it than on the earth’s center; hence, greater thaA its centrifugal force. It is least on the poinfcsfarthest from the sun, so there is a surplus force to draw that side away from the sun. As the ring is placed obliquely toward the sun, the effect of these surplus forces is to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 0. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L. Rosenkrans, Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">pull it down until the earth’s equator is in the plane of its orbit. But this is counteracted by the earth’s rotation; so, instead of being pulled down toward the sun, there is produced a very alow motion at right angles to this direction— which is the motion of precession. This motion is not uniform, but greater in the months of June and December, when the sun is at its greatest declination, or distance from the equator; it is least in March and September, when the sun is on the equator. For then the plane of the ring passes through the sun, and the forces which tend to draw its opposite sides toward and from the sun are neutralized by acting directly against each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In consequence of precession, the Celestial Pole does not remain stationary, but gradually shifts from point to point, traversing a circle during the slow ages. Our present North Star, Polaris, was-not always in the same relative position to the Celestial Pole, but has been drawing nearer to it for about 12,000 years. After two more centuries, it will be only 1 degree from the Pole instead of degrees, as at present. The North Star does not appear as a fixed point in the heavens, as many people suppose, but describes a small circle, 2½ degrees in diameter, or five times the apparent diameter of the moon, during 24 hours. (Or, properly, 23 hours, 56 m., 4.09 s.) Within this small circle are eighty stars visible through a telescope, and two hundred recorded on photographic plates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus, the Polar Star seems to move' rapidly (comparatively speaking) in a small circle of steadily diminishing circumference around a point in the heavens which itself is slowly moving in a large circle. After two hundred years, Polaris will commence to expand this circle moving farther and farther away from the Pole, until in about 12,000 years Vega in “Orpheus’ Lyre” will be our North Star. Vega is a brilliant, bluish star, the fourth brightest in the whole sky, and is supposed to represent that point in space toward which our solar system is travelling at the rate of thirty-four miles per second. After another 12,000 years, Polaris will again be our North Star.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">About 4.000 years ago, Thuban in the “Dragon” was the North Star. The stellar body now actually nearest to the Pole is invisible to the naked eye, being a ninth magnitude telescopic star. Polaris, called a second magnitude star,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is in reality a stellar system, consisting in the first place, of a telescopic double, whose largest component is a spectroscopic triple. So this single point of light, in fact, consists of four ■tars. It is so far away from the earth that it requires forty-five years for its fight, travelling at the rate of 186,360 miles a second, to reach us. It has been well said that navigators might steer for half a century, unwittingly, by the light of an extinguished orb. The ancients fancied they beheld in the Little Dipper a resemblance to a dog, rather than a bear, consequently they named Polaris Cynosura, meaning “the end of the dog’s tail,&quot; whence we derive our word cynosure—and few will deny that a dog’s tail is frequently a &quot;center of attraction” to the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To the precession is attributable the difference between the Sidereal year of 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, and 9 seconds, which represents the revolution of the sun in the heavens, and the Tropical, or Equinoctial year of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 48 seconds, which marks the return to the same equinox. The latter is the calendar and civil year. One revolution of the sun among the stars does not accurately correspond to the return of the same seasons: for whatever constellation the sun may be in, the seasons depend on its return to the same equinox. Since the wobbling of the earth’s axis induces a corresponding movement of its equator, which must always be 90 degrees from its poles, the sun crosses the equator 20 minutes earlier each year, making a difference of 5 hours and 20 minutes to the century. The effect is that the equinoxes slide around in a direction from east to west, contrary to the movements of all the planets — unless as some astronomers inferred, Uranus, and possibly Neptune also, have a retrograde motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When we contemplate the illimitable abyss of space with its unplumbed depths and unfathomable mysteries, its distances and immensities beyond the grasp of human comprehension, tinie-vatiies lose their customary significance. Standing awed on the brink of infinity, we gain a wholly novel perspective, a new sense of proportion, so that the usual routine of our daily lives loses\its engrossing importance: its salient features become inconspicuous. Out of the billion and a half people of nnr world, who knows of ourself and our affairs! or even of the busy local community we honor with our presence! A recent traveller in the Andes was amazed because the natives supposed that the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and Russia were villages merely, in a neighboring country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Even the earth is invisible outside of our. solar system, whose central sun is but an insignificant speck in the cosmic scheme compared with such giant bodies as Betelgeuse with a diameter nearly equal to that of the orbit of Mars. Such reflections instill a profound realization of the vastness of the spatial universe and our horizon is immeasurably expanded. On the other hand, it remains forever limited as a field of research by our physical incapacities, so no one can prove, what some chemists have dreamed, that each tiny atom combined into the molecules which compose the cellular structure of our bodies constitutes a microscopic universe, as it were, in itself, of revolving electrons: wheels within wheels, worlds within worlds!—infinitesimal worlds, inhabited, perhaps, thought the chemists, by sentient beings, as oblivious of our consciousness as we are of theirs. For, they argued, the indivisible unit maybe such only to our gross perceptions;there are regions into which we cannot enter; if there seems to be evidence of indefinite multiplication, why not infinite subdivision! We are prone to lose our way in the intangible; hence, the Almighty has formulated rules for our guidance which are ample to insure us happiness, if we would only observe them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Since, then, we know so very little, should not we therefore, humble ourselves in the presence of Him who knows all! who willed all this stupendous universe to come into existence! Well might we doubt—insignificant creatures that we 'are, precariously clinging to our dim orb in an obscure corner of space — that we enjoyed any special claim to His interest, had we not His positive words of reassurance. It is written, “The Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool'’; and I will make the place of my feet glorious&quot;.—Isa. 66:1; 60:13.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jewish Sabbath Shadows Good Things to Come </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">By Eknjdmin H. Barton (Deceased) (UPRINTXX) BY BBQtJZST)</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">G</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OD never authorized anyone to change the Sabbath of the Decalogue from the seventh day of the week to the first But we do believe that just as truly as the Christian has a greater High Priest, and a greater sacrifice,and a greater <sup>z</sup> tabernacle than Israel had, so, too, the follower of Christ has a much greater sabbath than had the follower of Moses. Everything under the Jewish dispensation was typical of “good things to come”. (Hebrews 10:1) The Atonement Day, the Passover, the sabbatic years, the jubilees, ete., were all figures of more important things, so why should it seem strange that the seventh or Sabbath day was typical any more than the seventh or sabbatic year I That this is the Scriptural thought hear Paul in Colossians 2:16,17: &quot;Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: which are a shadow of good things to come; but the body is of Christ”. The seventh-day keepers will argue ' &lt;&nbsp;that the Sabbath here refers to some of those yearly occasions, which were also called Sabbaths, because part of their observance required rest from ordinary labor; for instance, the Day of Atonement But this cannot be the meaning of Paul's language, for he had already included all these yearly sabbaths under the words, “an holy day”. In harmony with his usual systematic forms of expression Paul first spoke of the yearly holy days, then came the monthly festivals, the new moons, and next the weekly rest days. The Christian has a sabbath, too, but, as‘we shall see, .his sabbath is as much greater than the Jewish Sabbath as the substance of a thing is greater than its shadow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">'<sup>%</sup> It may be asked: “Did not the Lord in Exodus 31:16 speak of the seventh day Sabbath as being given for a perpetual covenant?” In answer to this, the very identical language which the Lord used here of the Sabbath He uses elsewhere of the harvest offering (Leviticus 23:14), the Pentecostal sacrifice (Leviticus 23:21), the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 23:31, 32), and the feast of tabernacles.(Leviticus 23:41) The same Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">olam,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is translated “perpetual” in the seventh-day reference, is the word translated “forever” in the other passages. (Sete Young's Analytical Concordance) So if the Advent view is correct we should still be keeping the feast of tabernacles as well as the Sabbath, but as some of their own brethren have shown, when dealing with the punishment of the wicked, the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">olam,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> like the Greek aion, really means “age-lasting”, or “lasting to a consummation”. It is sometimes used in the sense of eternal, but not necessarily. Thus in Exodus 29:9 we read of the priestly office being given to Aaron and his descendants “for a perpetual statute”, the same word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">olam</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> being used. But that it does not properly mean “perpetual” in this passage is evident, for Aaron's family lost the priesthood 1800 years ago. Note Hebrews 7:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We find, then, that Jehovah need the very same language in speaking of the weekly Sabbath which He used respecting other Jewish institutions which passed away rbes that of which they were typical cAme, eo similarly may not the Jewish Sabbath hate passed away, being supplanted by a greater sabbath! Notice our Lord's words in Matthew 5:17,18&gt; “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy but to fulfill; for verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled*. Our Savior did not say the Law should not pass away, but that it should not pass away until it was fulfilled. But He tells us first that He came to fulfill it, so if it was fulfilled in Him it has passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is a vast difference between a thing being destroyed and passing away as a result of fulfillment. The law of circumcision was never destroyed, but it passed away and was abolished when that to which it pointed, circumcision of the heart, was set forth, and it is this higher circumcision we must observe. (Romans 2:28, 29) Likewise Christ did not destroy the Law. nor set it at naught, but His perfect life fulfilled its every requirement, as we imperfect creatures could not, and thus He became the great inheritor of all the promises of the Law, with the right to distribute what He inherited under the Law to all who would become His. Additionally the Law led to Christ and pointed Him out as the Holy One of whom Moses had said, “Hear ye him”. (Acts 7:37; Galatians 3:24,25) Therefore to‘consider the Law given through Moses as binding upon the Christian is to doubt whether Christ has accomplished what He came for—“to fulfill” the Law. Of course the Christian must study that Law, and he finds jewels of inspired wisdom in it; but he studies it as a shadow of better things, as typical of the blessings promised under the greater than Moses—Christ</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ml</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Then is the follower of Christ under no law! Yes; he is under a new law, a higher law. Just as he has a better High Priest, a better sacrifice, a better everything than the Jew had, so he has a better law, and it contains a better sabbath. Isaiah 42:21 foretold that Christ was to “magnify the law and make it honorable’<sup>9</sup>, and we are now under this magnified law. The Law said: “Thou shalt not kill,” but Christ magnified that when He taught that whosoever hateth his brother without a cause is guilty of murder. (See Matthew 5:21,22,27,28) The Law said: “Thou shalt not steal,” but Christ taught us that we should not merely refrain from robbing our neighbor, but be ever ready to share with him what we have, even to the extent of laying down our lives for our brethren. (John 13:33; 1 John 3:16) The Law said: “Honor thy father and thy mother”; but we are instructed to *honor all to whom honor is due’.—Romans 13:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">So we see that Christ magnified the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth commandments, but some fail to realize that He magnified the fourth, the Sabbath commandment, too. To the contrary, they believe He made it smaller. One put it to me this way: “Before Christ every little act contrary to the Sabbath commandment, even the building of a fire, was to be severely punished, but since Christ’s sacrifice, as long as we try to do our best to keep the Sabbath, the Lord will pardon and overlook where we come short in our obedience to that command”. That would have magnified God’s mercy, but it would not have magnified the commandment. Would it be magnifying the sixth commandment if we should say: “Before Christ murder was to be severely punished, but $ince then, if you try to keep the Law— 'thou shalt not kill’—it will be all right if you ’do kill a man once in a while”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let me now present our understanding of how Christ magnified the Sabbath law. The Israelite was to consider one-tenth of what he had as holy unto the Lord; but do we ever hear the Christian advised forgive a tithe to the Lord! Not once. How ranch are we advised to give Ilim! All that we are and have. We are to give all that we can in as direct a way as we can, and the remainder is to be given </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him in</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a more indirect way; e. g., we give Him the money we spend for food and clothing, because our body belongs to Him and is being used to glorify and serve </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> The food gives us strength to do more for Him, therefore the money we spend for food is being spent for our Lord. (Romans 12:1; 1 Corinthians 6:20; 10:31; 2 Corinthians 5:15) In Luke 14:33 our Master does not tell us to forsake or surrender a tenth, but “all that he hath”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Jew sang; “Some of self and some of thee”. The true Christian sings: “None of self but all of thee”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Likewise the Jew gave God one-seventh of his time, but the Christian is to give Him sevensevenths. The Lord said in Leviticus 19:30, “Ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary”. The sanctuary was the holy structure through which God manifested Himself to Israel So to them the word meant a certain definite holy place; but the Christian finds his sanctuary wherever he is; every place is a holy place to him. Similarly every day is a holy day, a sabbath of rest to hint </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">He</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> has a better sanctuary to reverence and a better sabbath to keep. But not only does his sabbath differ from the typical sabbath, the nature of his rest also differs. It does not merely mean a cessation from manual labor, but a rest from laboring for self in order to work and live for God. It means to rest as God rested after He had completed the work of creation, as the Word expresses it: “To enter into his rest”. God’s rest does not mean idleness. &quot;He sends his rain and causes bis sun to shine” on the seventh just as much as on any other day. Then how did He rest! He ceased working for Himself in order to work for man through His Son. And how do we rest like Him? By ceasing to work for self—to establish our own righteousness through works—and rather to rest in our God-given justification, and this that God may work in us and we may thus work for Him through Christ Hear Hebrews 4:10, “For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.” And then Paul continues in verse 11, “Let us labor therefore,” not let us cease from labor, but labor to put down these selfish propensities which would lead us, contrary to God’s will, to live for self, instead of permitting us “to enter into that rest”. This rest of which the seventh day was a type will not end with this life, but it will continue an eternal rest</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Let me digress here to say that God’s rest day was not a period of twenty-four hours, but, like the six days of creation, was a long period ’ of time. In our own language this is a very common use of the word “day”, and it is equally 'frequent in Bible language. (2 Peter 3:8; Psalm 95:7-10) While the day of salvation of 2 Corinthians 6:2 is already over 1800 years long, so it was with the great days of creation. They were long periods of time, and likewise the seventh day, in which God rested, is a long period; it is not over yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But to return to the subject of this letter. In Isaiah 58:13 we have a description by the inspired Prophet of what constitutes Christian sabbath-keeping. We must refrain from doing ' our own ways, and from finding our own pleasures, and from speaking our own words. That is sabbath-keeping. But the Christian must do ’ that every day, therefore every day must be a sabbath to<sup>4</sup> him. The latter part of the verse, - Revised Version, reads: “And shalt honor it, ■ not doing thine own ways,” etc. Every day we <sub>r</sub> are to “§peak aa the oracles of God”. (1 Peter 4:11) Every day God is to work in us “to do of i- his good pleasure&quot;. (Philippians 2:13) Every U day “the steps of a good man are ordered of the Lord”. (Psalm 37:23) So, every day is a ; sabbath to him who liveth “not unto himself”. : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not this a glorious magnifying of the Lawf</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We can now see how “Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness [justification] to every one that believeth”. (Romans 10:4) We can understand why Paul could say in Galatians 3:19, “The law was added ... till the seed should come”. Then in verses 23 to 25 he boldly ’ compares the Law to a severe pedagogue to whom they were committed for a season, &quot;but after that faith is come we are no longer under a pedagogue”. And we can comprehend why Paul mourns because “ye observe days” (Gal, atians 4:10,11), and intimates that the brother is weak^who “esteems one day [Saturday or Sunday] dibove another” (Romans 14:5—read , verses 1 to 7), failing to realize that they are all to be counted as days in which His glory is to . . &nbsp;&nbsp;be sought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Some good Christian people divide the Law into two parts, calling the Decalogue “the law of God”, and\he remainder “the law of Moses”, and then claiming that Christ did away with the law of Moses, but not with the law of God. This is an awful mistake; it was all the law of God, because it came from Him, and it is al] the law of Moses in that it came through him. (Leviticus 26:46; Deuteronomy 5:5) Thus our Savior, in Mark 7:10, quotes one of the ten commandments (Exodus 20:12; Deuteronomy 5:16, and then in the same verse a law which was not in the Decalogue (Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9), and yet attributes them both to Moses. He was not the author of either, but he was the agent through whom God delivered both commands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Furthermore, the fact that the Law, which was until John (Luke 16:16; Matthew 11:13), ineluded the Decalogue as well as the ceremonial features of the Law, is proved by Romans 7:6, 7; for Paul, after saying, “We are delivered from the law,” leaves no doubt as to what law is meant by quoting from the tenth commandment. And as his words show we are no longer under the letter (it was the letter which was on the stones), but under the spirit, the antitype, that which was shadowed forth in the words on the stones, the greater law of love. (James 1:26; 2:8) When we read, therefore, in the books from Acts to Revelation about the redeemed keeping &quot;the commandments of God”, we do not think of the letters in stone given through Moses, but of the magnified law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus.—Romans 8:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Notice another passage, viz., 2 Corinthians 3:3-11. The expression, “written and engraven in stones,” and the reference to Moses’ face shining at the time is evidence that Paul is speaking of the Decalogue. In verse 7 he tells us how the Law was accompanied with such glory that it even caused Moses’ face to shine. Then in verse 8 he refers to something which would be accompanied with more glory, and following this up shows that when “the glory that excelleth” (v. 10) should come then that which was given with glory—i. e., the Law written and engraven on stones—was to be “done away”, (v. 11) Note the remarkable similarity between the Revised Version rendering of verse 11 and Matthew 5:18. Then in verses 12 to 18 Paul shows that while Israel had Moses cover his face so they could not see the glorious results of the giving of that glorious Law, yet we should refrain from covering our hearts with the veil of prejudice, etc., as we wish to see the more glorious results of this more glorious law upon tie hearts and lives of our brethren, especially as it was reflected in our great Elder Brother, the Lord Jesus.—2 Corinthians 3:1&amp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul’s preaching upon the seventh day, etc., is no endorsement of one day above another. That was a day when the cessation from labor brought the Jews together in their synagogues and gave Paul an opportunity he gladly used. Wherever and whenever he found ears to hear he was ready to preach. There were crowds in the synagogues on the seventh day, so Paul went there, and there were numbers at the market every day, so Paul preached there on other days. (Acts 17:17) So just as Paul esteemed those opportunities, so we esteem the opportunities afforded us on the first day, not because there is a divine command to consider that day a sabbath above other days, although we consider it a very appropriate dsy for meetings of the people of God, being our Lord’s resurrection day. However, refraining from actual labor on the first day is not an endorsement of the wrong ideas many have held about it, any more than, a belief in the Bible would mean an endorsement of the many wrong views which have been entertained of its teaching. It has been a great comfort to me to find that salvation does not hang upon such a slender cord as the keeping of* a weekly rest day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are other features of the Sabbath, for instance its foreshadowing of the Millennium, which I have not touched upon at alL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Anglo-Israelism </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By C. V. Tenney</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">O</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">NE of the great delusions of the last days— Anglo-lsraelism — is being revived and preached in our churches by certain gifted and plausible speakers, to the detriment of the cause of truth. For this reason we wish to present briefly some of their strong arguments and show how they may be refuted from the Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This theory had a running some years ago, at which time it met its match in the persons of Couch, Pile, Hemenway, David Baron, Hon. E. B. Burpee, and others. These staunch defenders of “the faith once delivered to the saints” having passed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of£</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the stage of action, it has raised its ugly head once more to find no one to oppose it. For this reason, it is high time new defenders of the truth arose and loudly denounced this theory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the first place, these advocates claim that there is a distinction between the term Jew and the term Israelite, referring the term Jew to the visible Hebrew of today while claiming that the term Israelite refers to the Anglo-Saxon nations, especially Great Britain and the United States of,America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This clSim is easily refuted from the Scriptures. There is no distinction whatever between Jew and Is</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">raeli</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">te in the Scriptures when speaking of the Hebrew people after the Babylonian Captipty. Bead carefully for proof the following passages: Acts 21:39; Romans 11:1; 2 Corinthians?Ll: 22,24; Acts 13:16; 28:19,20; 2:14; 3:12; Matthew 10:5,6. Note that the people are addressed as both Jew and Israelite, interchangeably. Ezra calls them Jews eight </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">times and Israel twenty-four times; Nehemiah' calls them Jews eleven times and Israel seventeen times; Esther calls them Jews forty-five times; the New Testament calls them Jews one hundred seventy-five times and Israelites forty-nine times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Their second principal claim is that there was no return from Babylon of the ten tribes of Israel, either nationally, by tribes, or by remnants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This claim also, is easily refuted from the Scriptures. Read carefully Ezra 2:2; 7:7, 13; 6:16, 17; 8:35; 1:3; Nehemiah 7:73; Acts 2:5. Also note that the term Babylon refers to the empire, which included old Assyria, as well as the city. After the captivity, Josephus said that the cities of Palestine lay very thick, and that the, very least of them contained about 15,000 inhabitants. At the time of the Maccabees, it is recorded by Dr. Pusey, there were millions of Israelites in Palestine. The fact is that the captivity broke up the division among the Jews and when they returned it was by families and the remnant included some of every tribe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thirdly, they claim that there is an election of race as well as an election of free grace. The election of race, they say, included the Anglo-Saxons in the plan of redemption, regardless of character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This claim should not appear serious to any person who fully understands the plan of salvation. The Scriptures teach the election of grace only. This election is for those who cnme through. CttBXST who is the only door. The gospel makeh^o distinction whatever between Jew or Greek, male or female, bond or free. Bead carefully the following passages: 2 Peter 1:10; Romans 9:6,11; Galatians 3:16,29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; “If ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These theorists, in the fourth place, cl</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">aim</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> that there is no such thing as conditional prophecy, and that all unfulfilled prophecies concerning fleshly Israel are yet to be fulfilled in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This claim is easily overthrown. There are many conditional prophecies in the Bible. Here are a few samples: Deuteronomy 28:1,14-15, 68; Exodus 3:7, 8; Jeremiah 18:7, 10; Jonah 3:4; Ezekiel 38 and 39; Zechariah 6:12, 15; Matthew 23:37; Romans 11:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a fact that the prophecies regarding the . restoration of the temple after the return were partially fulfilled; because the Jews only partially met the conditions laid down in the prophecies. Read Ezra 9:5,6; Nehemiah 1:6,7; Malachi 1:8; Mark 12:12, to see how they continued in sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There are other points which might be made. We believe, however, that having knocked down several of the main props of this theory, it should easily fall to the ground. Prof. Rawlinson said of this theory, that it is not calculated to affect the opinion of those competent to form one; buf for fear some one may be misled into error we are anxious to write this message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">There is no room for such a program in the teachings of the parables. See Luke 19:12,27; Matthew 21:33,45. There is no place for such a theory in the consecutive prophecies, as given by Daniel, Christ or John. Daniel says (chapter nine) that after A. D. 70, the Jews shall be no more God’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The teaching of the Two Covenants is that the first was worn out and displaced by the second. See Hebrews 8:9,10; Galatians 4:22, 31; Jeremiah 18:10, 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Finally, some of their absurd applications of prophecy should turn us away from this error. For instance:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They claim that the Euphrates river was miraculously divided for the lost ten tribes on their way to Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They claim the stone Joseph used for a pillow in the desert is now tteder the throne in England, having been carried by the Israelites, after Moses brought water from it,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They claim the adoption of Romana 9:4 refers to the adopting of Ephraim and Manasseh by Jacob.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They claim Great Britain to be descended from Joseph’s half-breed sons, which explains the fact that their noses are straight while that of the real Hebrew of today is hooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">They claim the references in the Bible to “Isles” mean the British Isles. They claim for themselves all the promises which we understand belong to the church through Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But perhaps this is enough evidence to convince one of the falsity of the theory.</span></p>

When the war came on, they had their chance and got busy right away, with the result that I was dismissed from the service by wire, on April 5, 1918, without even charges being preferred against me or without my having an opportunity to reply to them, as the law says that J should have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I took the matter up with Senator Chamberlain, and with his help I finally did get from the post-office department their reasons for dismissing me. In their letter to Senator Chamberlain they gave four of them, as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In answer to your letter of the 29th ultimo, which the Postmaster General has referred to me, regarding Kirp P. Loop, formerly a letter carrier at McMinnville, Oregon, who was removed from the service on April 5, 1918, I beg to inform you that a number of complaints were received at the Dept, regarding the [Christian] conduct of Mr. Loop, and the matter was made the subject of a very careful investigation. The investigation disclosed that Mr. Loop had been one of the leaders of the I. B. S. A. in McMinnville. The association was denied the use of the lodge hall for meetings, and the meeting of March 20 [prayer meeting] was scheduled to be held at the residence of Mr. Loop. Mr. Loop assisted in the distribution of copies of the book called</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">'*The Finished Mystery*. [Before it was banned by the Government]. Ai you are probably aware, the Dept of Justice holds that this book violates the Espionage Act and proceedings are pending against the moving spirits of the L B. S. A. for their action in publishing the book. The Dept believes that Mr. Loop is not a proper person to be retained in the employ of the Government at this time. In view of your very great interest in the matter I regret that more favorable action could not have been taken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The M. E. minister, D. L. Fields, told one of the boys in the office some time before I was dismissed that &quot;that man Loop ought to be put out of the service, and I would like to have the job of circulating a petition to have him put out”. I never saw any of the “complaints”, but I have it straight that the clergy were the &quot;moving spirits&quot; in my case. Besides, who else would care anything about my religion and about prayer meetings being held in my home!</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">D</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ESPITE the easily-proven fact that the whole clergy business is a self-perpetuating fraud, that there was no such class in the early church, and should be no such class in the church now, the clergy are determined at least to be respected. And if the people who know of the fraud they are trying to perpetuate dare to laugh at them, or assist others to laugh at them, woe be to those luckless individuals hereafter, because the “public morals board” (whatever that is — our idea is that private morals are the thing that should be sought after) of the Methodist Episcopal Church is going to make a bold effort, so it alleges, to “stop the contemptuous treatment of the Protestant ministry by some cartoonists, artists and authors. On the stage and in motion pictures the Protestant minister is seldom represented except as an effeminate fool. [Wonder how they ever got that idea—Ed.] The members of the Protestant churches are exhorted to be liberal, to take humor as humor and be slow to wrath. But the members of the Roman Catholic church do not tolerate such treatment of their priesthood, which is always represented on the stage and elsewhere in a most favorable way and whose religion is treated with consideration. The Catholics are to be commended. The time has come also when Protestants should not tolerate any other than courteous treatment of their religion and ministry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The way, at present, by which the “public morals board” will punish offenders is that as soon as any violations of their ideas of propriety’in respect to the clergy are brought to their notice, they will make the whole matter public. We wish them luck, and if they will really publish the facts we will furnish them with duplicate plates of the leading articles in The Golden Age Numbers 60, 61, 62 and 63, so that they will have an abundance of material to start with. This “public morals board” has its headquarters in Wa.-hington — a place famous for the taking mi of the morals of the public at the same time that the private variety is cast off.</span></p>

This would absolutely ; disprove consciousness of the dead and would disprove also the immortality of the soul “Death is spoken of in the Bible as a sleep, <sup>s</sup> for the’reason that God intends in His due time to awaken all of the dead and give them an j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opportunity of life. The Bible abounds in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expressions referring to the dead as asleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>L</sub> A few of these expressions are: “David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David”. (1 ^ings 2:10) “The fathers fell asleep.” (2 Peter 3:4) “The greater part remain until this day, but some are fallen asleep.” (1 Corinthians 15:6) “I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep;... them also which sleep will God bring [forth] by Jesus [in the resurrection].”—1 Thessalonians 4:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“We must conclude from these Scriptures that the dead are wholly unconscious from the moment of death until such future time as the Lord may be pleased to awaken them out of death and give them opportunity </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> life, which He purposes to do, as set forth in His great plan. (John 5:28,29) Man was made of the dust He was sentenced to return to the dust; that is, the condition of the dead. And the Lord said: ‘They that sleep in the dust of the earth shall arise \—Daniel 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DOES GOD TORMENT ANT ONEf</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>T0</sup>For a long time men have been taught that the punishment for the wicked, those who disobey God, is everlasting torment or torture in a hell burning with unquenchable fire and brimstone. Many have been frightened away from the Bible because of this terrible doctrine. Many have refused to believe in God and the Lord Jesus because of it. It is another doctrine of Satan, used to blind the people. The doctrine of eternal torment cannot be true for at least four separate and distinct reasons: (1) because it is unreasonable; (2) because it is repugnant to justice; (3) because it is contrary to the principle of love; and (4) because it is entirely un-scriptural.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And we agree with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>4</sup> If to ‘seek meekness and to do righteousness’ means to have the sanctimonious, long-faced, “better-than-thou” attitude of the pest reformer; then, truly, life would have no joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But it does not mean that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">^Tfiink of a life with no sickness, sorrow, pain, dying, or woe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That is what living forever on earth is, in a negative way. And can you imagine men morose, gloomy, and grouchy, with no sorrows to make them so?</span></p>
