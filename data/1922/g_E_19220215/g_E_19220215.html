<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HERE is a growing ambition on the part of some of the clergy to take over the management of the social functions of humanity. Reverend Downie, pastor of the Unitarian Church of Detroit, 5fichigan, has organized a Get Acquainted Club which meets in his church on Sunday .evenings. Reverend Downie says of the club:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“AVp</span><span class="font5"> have an hour's program at ♦each rn«&lt;ting.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EDITORIAL NOTE</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font5">HE </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mannar-Herald.</span><span class="font5"> of Athens, Georgia, in its i&gt;-ue of September 21, 1921, contains a halt-page advertisement b. a ring the above caption, indorsed by the announcements of the ten principal churches of the * ity. all denominations.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">I believe it dn«- a* much good as a sermon [Probably mon—Ed.] ; for it promotes friendship. and that after all, is- the basis of real religion.'*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Cleveland, Ohio, in October, 1919, Reverend Alexander MeGaffin. pastor of the Euclid Avenue Presbyterian Church, announced that the old-fashioned midweek prayer meeting is a failure and that hereafter the church rooms hitherto devoted to prayer meetings on Wednesday evenings will be used for the activities of a neighborhood debating society. Also, according to the Chicago </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Wedncsdav night prayer meetings have been stricken from the'eakndar of the First Congregational church of Evanston as weekly devotional services. Instead an address bv a popular speaker will be provided on the first Wednesday of each mouth, a dinner for church men and women on the second, and a mating of the Men’s Club on each third Wednesday. These announcements appeared in i£e church bulletin distributed at services yesterday and the pastor, Dr. Hugh Elmer Brown, declared that small attendance had prompted the change.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A somewhat similar idea to that of Reverend McGaffin seems to be in the mind of Reverend Percy Stickney Grant, who belongs to the liberal wing of the Episcopal Church. Dr. Grant wished ro use the church parlors for an open forum meeting, which Bishop Burch of the Episcopal diocese of New York refused to sanction. Dr. Grant expressed his Indict' that the arrogance of the Episcopal bishops is liable to split the church wide open in America, arid pointed out that rhe great Lambeth Conference of Bishops has been wasting precious time in. haggling over divorce questions instead of considering the things which to him seem far more important: un-cm ploy me nt, d isarmaineiit, equal rights, for women: and the plagues, pestilences nud famines w hich cpver the earth;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Eort Nowton, pastor of the London Temple, has been urging that mon and women should be privileged to smoke cigars, cigarettes, and pipes in church while listening to sermons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But not.all clergymen are prepared to broaden out and he “liberal-minded” about their flock and the management of their church. The Reverend Thomas B. Gregory is quoted by the Rochester. New York. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Herald</span><span class="font6"> of May 2nd, 1920 as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A famous preacher of the olden time said: ‘I magnify mine office*; but it begins to look as though there are certain preachers in the land who are doing all they can to belittle and degrade their office. To reduce this statement to the concrete we have but to remember that only la.st summer a New Jersey clergyman invited the men of his congregation to attend the Sunday services in their shirt-sleeves, assuring them that he himself would go into the pulpit and preach to them in the same easy costume. Nor can we forget that other clergyman who notified his flock that he was in no way <sup>4</sup>op</span><span class="font6">posed to smoking&quot; during the Sunday service* and that they 'might feel quite free to bring along their pipes and smoke during the sermon*. Finally, we have the case of the western minister who made arrangement* with the business men of the town whereby in return far donations they were to have advertising privilege* in his church—so much space on the walls in return for so much cash. Of course, a man sitting in church in his shirt-sleeves, smoking his pipe, cigar or cigarette, </span><span class="font5">looking </span><span class="font6">through clouds of tobacco smoke, now at the business ads on the church walls, and now at the coat</span><span class="font5">less </span><span class="font6">minuter, can hear what the man in the sacred desk </span><span class="font5">has to &lt;ay </span><span class="font6">as well as though he were differently attired </span><span class="font5">and in the midst of a different environment.&quot;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Reverend Dr. John Thompson, of Chicago,sees another way in which some use may be macle of the church buildings which he. in com-mmi with many other speakers and writers on tlir subject, seems to think are far more numerous than arc needed or desired by the people. Tn an address to the Council of Cities of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Pittsburgh, b’t bruary 12. 1920, he said.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Every city pastor will hear me out in the statement that there are thousands of girls in every metropolitan 'li'-Tiict who have r.n suitable nlace in which to enter* i.itn their male friends. There is every reason why our churches should Mt up rooms with cozy corners where there is not too much light, so that city young persons may do. their love-making urukr favorable circum-•tance&lt;/’-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Sponsors of Marriage</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font6">ARRIAGE is a purely civil contract, and is properly regulated by the civil law. While it is of divine ordinance, yet it never was thought of as a sacrament until the Reverends tried to &quot;corner' it. The most godless &lt;’an and do participate as well as the most godly. But for reasons of sentim-nt the civil law nf most states provides that marriage may be legally performed by any person who is the recognized pa&gt;tor of a congregation. But it lias b^en taken fur granted that clergymen performing the olhee of marriage would have the interest of the young couples at heart and would give them such wi&gt;e. kind, loving, fatherly counsel as would help them to pass through the tiSals and difficulties ul life with calm and peaceful hearts, ami tlms^he state would be saved much later t- able.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A sample of the way in which some clergymen view their &quot;holy” office may be seen in the way</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BBOOSX.TV. N. X,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">they do things at Cumberland, Maryland, a city on the edge of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The city has been, because of its location, a favorite point for young people to visit who have been contemplating matrimony; and for years it has maintained a regular marriage trust, participated in by ministers and hackmen who have gouged the highest possible fee?’ out of the young people and then divided the loot between themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is estimated that for the three thousand marriages per year performed in Cumberland the fees exacted total not less than $40,000. Tn cases where the minister has taken $20 or even more from couples he has made the adroit statement when a kick was registered against the outrageous charges, that the law “provided” (did not prevent) this sum as a fee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In several cases which were recently brought to light because of the inordinate rascality of the Reverends, it was learned that every dollar possessed by one voting couple was taken from them, and in two instances couples were left stranded in the city. Persons who were not in the clergy business provided them with food and shelter and with carfaro to get home, which was afterward repaid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same thing was done on a smaller scale at Elkton, Maryland, in the eastern part of rhe state. A Reverend from Montana came all the way to Elkton because he saw how a profitable clergy business could be built up. Tie had succeeded splendidly with his scheme, and was making $200 to $250 per week marrying runaway couples from Pennsylvania and Delaware, when it leaked out that he was splitting his marriage fees with jitney drivers and hackna-n, and the good people of his church united unai t-mmisly in chasing him out of town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend E. J. Webster, of Aurora, Illiums, startled his community by announcing that he would accept no more fees for performing marriages or preaching funeral sermons, but his generosity in these directions was offset somewhat by the fact that he used such savage language against the ungenerous and sting}' of his congregation that an attempt was made to oust him from the pastorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend J. J. Messier, a Methodist clergyman of Bridgeton, New Jersey, found a way of drawing trade, by giving public notice that “owing to the high cost of living” he would “give a liberal discount of twenty percent to all parties seeking to be joined in the bonds of matrimony, provided the fee justified the giving of such a liberal discount&quot;.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>. The Clergy and Education _</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6">&gt; , TOURING the dark ages the whole field of edu</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">' U</span><span class="font6"> cation was in the hands of the clergy, and that is what made those centuries the dark ages. Victor Hugo summed this up in masterly style, when he addressed the clergy of the only religious system with which he was familiar:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“You wish us to give you the people to instruct. Very well. Let us see your pupil?. Let us see those you have produced. What ha;-e you done for Italy? U’hat </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">have </span><span class="font5">you done for Spain? For centuries you have kept in your hands nt your discretion, at your schools, these two great nations, illustrious anions the illustrious. What have you done for them ? I shall tell you. Thanks to you. Italy, mother of genius and of nations, which has spread over all the universe ail the most brilliant marvels of poetry and the arts. Italy—which has taught <sub>z</sub>, mankind tu read—now knows not how to read.'<sup>1</sup>’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the advent of the Protestant Reformation the clergy of the Church of Rome were replaced by the clergy of Protestantism in the minds of the people; and in the schools of the Old World (ho clergy always had a prominent place. Tn America the principle of clerical interference in education has been manifested by the presence of numerous parochial schools and sectarian colleges; but the non-soctarian founders of the American Republic made such a bold stand for free schools under government jurisdiction and for the absolute separation of church and stalo, (hat the clergy in America have not been able to influence the situation much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Relics of the time when all education was to be found in the hands of the clergy persist in the courses of instruction in sonic of the schools which, even to this day. point the youth more toward the ministry or to college as his ultimate goal than toward some useful business whore he will be a real asset to the community and a iri-nuinv help to himself and his family. The study &lt;»f the classical languages, Greek and Latin, all'tends in this direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Aside flAui standing squarely across the path of religious instruction, discouraging the study of the Bible and of books which explain it, which we will discuss later, the clergy have been equally obtuse and equally perverse as respects progress in other lines. Copernicus was declared by the Reverends to be an atheist and infidel because he proved that the earth revolves around the sun. He was compelled to recant the truth under penalty of death. Galileo also, summoned before the Inquisition of the Reverends, narrowly escaped death on the same grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And to this day the Reverend Wilbur Glenn Voliva, head of the Dowie church, at Zion City, Illinois, is causing a thousand children of that city to be taught that the earth is flat and that the sun revolves around the earth, getting its heat as it passes through a red-hot tunnel in one end of the hell which is alleged by Mr. Voliva to be beneath our feet. Put the cause of education back into the hands of the clergy, and there will be a Voliva in every town in the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For many decades one of the principal features of a school event has been a Reverend in uniform—in long black coat, white tie, and collar on backwards—to lend dignity to the occasion. The Reverends some thirty years ago fought their hardest to prevent progress in the schools that was made in spite of them. The fact that pupils do not waste three years on Latin, and as many on Greek, with a year or two lost on religious history and mythology—tlio study of demons and their doings—is not due to the activities of the Reverends; for they put up a memorable fight to keep such trash in the curriculums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Germany the grip of the clergy has just been broken. According to the Pittsburgh </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Press:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘'The management of the schools in Germany has taken a &amp;tpp that *eems radical over there. luterfcnmcp with the schools by the clergy has been stopped. Under the old system, in villages, the local ruler bossed the parson, and the par«on waa inspector and sub-boss ot the village school. Now they are imitating thi? oltkr republic. They keep schools and churches separate, and allow the teachers to run the schools?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The age-long conflict between ecclesiasticism and progress will end only when the Reverends are finally forced to keep to their proper sphere —that of real religion.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>The Clergy and Charity</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19220215_files/g_E_19220215-4.png" alt="" style="width:13pt;height:16pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">HE commercializing of charity in the name of religion has been a disgrace for so long that it seems like a waste of time to discuss it in the columns of The Golden Age. The care of the poor is properly the concern Of the taxpayers; that is what the taxes are ostensibly collected for and that is what they should be used for. But there have been vast diversions of public funds from these legitimate ends to ends that are not legitimate, and there have been vast funds raised by street solicitation and solicitations from house to house that have failed to reach the supposed beneficiaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Salvation Army worker in Pittsburgh some years ago, when asked why she did not go to work like other girls, replied that she knew, of no way by which she could make four dol’ars per day easier and quicker than in her present occupation, which was that of soliciting funds ostensibly for the Salvation Army work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Detroit, in October, 19'21, Reverend Frank .C. Doan, commenting on the commercial spirit of the clergy, told the General Conference of Unitarian and other Christian churches that in many instances the modem preacher:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Is a .-alt-man and hi?? job is to sell religion to an unwilling and unconvinced public. His study with its filing cases. its card catalogs, its form letters and such things, looks for all the world like the oincc of some up-to-date commercial business. His prrac’ung even is colloquial and businesslike. It must he said for him that he succeeds far oftener than his less progressive brother.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The records show that the clergy do sometimes do real works ctf charity. Thus, on December, 1919, during the coal strike, thirty-five members of the Wichita, Kan&gt;as. Ministerial Alliance cut twelve cords of wood for the poor of the city. This was about one-third of a cord of wood: and at the old price of two dollars per cord for cutting macle for the thirty-live Reverends the day’s total of $24 or about 70 cents per worker. Does this indicate that the value of these men to the community can be assessed at seventy cents per day, if they are put at some useful employment ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At a session of the General Synod of the Reformed Churches of America, held in Detroit. June 27, 19'20, a resolution was brought up that ministers should abandon the use nf tobacco in order that they might give more liberally to the churches. ThU was deputed by a vote nf Bl to 20, and is in hue with the clerical attitude during the World War and during the time of our Lord. It will Im* remembered th;d H ■ &lt;vd of representatives of that class Lu I Lis My. &quot;All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do- not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders: but they themselves will • not move them with one of their fingers.&quot;— Matttew 23: 3, 4.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>The Clergy and Missions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font6">OT long ago in the State of Mississippi an innocent woman was hung up by the heels and disemboweled by a mob of church members. This shows that we need to send a lot of missionaries to China right away. The more we send the belter it will be for this con: try. To be sure it will bo worse for the Chines*--, but the Chinese are henthmi and deserve no better at the hands of &quot;Christians&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But curious to say. the Chinese don't seem to, think that they need our missionaries. They are wondering what they can do to bring real reliirion to us instead. Thus, a Chinaman writes to the editor of the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font6"> and asks if a peace resting on the Ten Commandments, would not be more desirable than that attempted by the fourteen points. A reader of that paper. ‘.-oinmenting on this item, savs:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘•SfiT*r.ge that </span><span class="font6">a </span><span class="font5">Chinaman has more vision than </span><span class="font6">we </span><span class="font5">who (.’aim to be a mod-1 nation. Can China b'* brought </span><span class="font6">to </span><span class="font5">Chri-t as long as we are a scandal to Chris’s teachings? Will the Lord of all nations overlook our sin&lt; t ward the Chk.c-e and other unchristian nations? V. '■ ■ ’» should haxc the preference, the Gospel or commerce?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We are not left in doubt as to ’Much does liavt* the preference in China. The &lt;tory is told by Doctor E. E. Vmletto, former pas^r of the Central Christian Church of Kan.-n-' City. He says there is absolutely no hope for the evangelization of China as it is being undertaken at the present time. He asks the pointed question and gives the answer as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘‘What can the white race expect to accomplish in China when it hires the Chinese on week days for ten cents a day and proaches to him on Sunday the doctrine of mijc'lfisluiess? European nations must abandon their lard-4rubbing and their eternal exploitation of Chinese labor if the missionary is to accomplish anything. Ei_d’*v percent of China is now under the control of foreign nations. They have obtained concession after concession, and the end is not in sight. The </span><span class="font6">Chinese </span><span class="font5">spe their lands and industries </span><span class="font6">taken from them year hv </span><span class="font5">vpar </span><span class="font6">bv the people who go to them with words of brotherly love. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">When we extend th* obve branch with cue </span><span class="font6">hand they are wondering what is in the other hand. Enough eggs were shipped from Chinh in the course of the famine to have fed the entire population. They </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">were </span><span class="font6">sold in Japan at that time at cents apiece.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">this</span><span class="font6"> country is a Christian nation, as the Supreme Court rules, there seem to be consid-©Table opportunities on our shores for those who have the real missionary spirit. It is with a good deal of shame that<sup>rea</sup>^ Americans learn of Armenian girls, fleeing from untold horrors in their own country and turned back by American immigration laws, throwing themselves into the ocean rather than face the fate which awaited them had they returned to their own land. The Armenians of a batch recently sent back by “Christian” America were promptly massacred by the Turks after the women had been raped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A writer in the Minneapolis </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Xciva, conwienthig on</span><span class="font6"> this fact, says that it is enough to make a person question whether we are a Christian land. The answer is “dead easy”. The United States is not a Christian laud. It is a land of pagans and worse than pagans. A hypocrite who pretends to be a Christian, but is really a pagan at heart, is a ten times worse pagan than a pagan who knows that he is one and confesses himself to be such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">America and the Reverends are a proper field for real missionaries, but a field that is being neglected. A settlement worker writing in the &quot;Yale Review” shows how inevitably the Protestant churches have been drawn to serve most those who need it least and hence have been drawn to serve least those who need it most. The people ot means live in the most attractive suburbs; the churches have followed them there; the Reverends have followed the churches that paid the best salaries; congregations have been measured by their giving power; hence the man with the most generous check-book has Income the most important figure in the church and the one most sought for membership on the various boards that make up the church's activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Miss Manik Kosambi, a Hindu girl of Poona, India, and now a student at Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that Christianity is fighting a losing battle in India: that out of 350^000,000 population there are only 400,000 Christians and 18,000.000 Mohammedans, while all the rest are Buddhists. An East Indian writing in the “Elkhart Review” tells oue reason why this is so. He says that the Christian missionaries that go to India usually build their estates at some distance from the towns and never mix with the people, as did Christ with the lowly orientals among whom He lived, and that their information and contact with the people is thus generally second or third hand and inaccurate and misleading. The same is true in Japan and China.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>One Jfyn Activity</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">L</span><span class="font6">ET us see. Is there not something we have omitted! Is there not one more activity of the clergy! Oh, yes! We have it. Besides all the other things they do they are engaged in preaching. But they are not preaching the Bible, for they do not believe in it; and they are not preaching the gospel of the Bible, for it has no place in their philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tile modern clergyman ridicules the simple and truthful stury of the creation of num in the Garden of Eden and his fall from perfection to his present unhappy condition. Proof of this can be obtained on any Sunday in any town in the United States, and in almost any church. So completely has the Anglican church exchanged the Bible for the Darwinian theory of creation that recently when Canon Barnes at th&lt;* fifty-fifth annual church conference of that church, denied the Biblical story of the fall of man and gave a lengthy address on evolution, it caused no amazement or excitement whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the clergy are in the same general condition. as respects the Bible story of the fall of man. They simply do not believe it. Thus, the Reverend A. C. Stevens, writing of the work of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Saratoga Springs said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">‘‘No </span><span class="font5">longer will the ritual of the Methodist Episcopal Church hold that ‘men are conceived and bom in sin’; </span><span class="font6">for </span><span class="font5">this time-honored </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">sadly misused declaration is to be obliterated. In its place is to be a clear statement setting forth the faith of the church in the belief that little thildron are already redeemed, and even when not baptized arc of the kingdom of </span><span class="font6">God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Obviously if this teaching is true, and if the other teaching of Methodism is true that when the children grow up most of them will turn into dinners who will not become saints but must fry and cook and stew and parboil and fricas-sen and bake and simmer and stay all ‘‘het up” with real fire and real brimstone through-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SM out eternity, then the only sensible thing 'for Methodists to do is to choke dll their children the moment they are bom, so that theymay be sure of a glorious and eternal reward for their brief but pious lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There being no fall of man and no original sin, it follows that the average clergyman sees no real need of a Savior, since evolution is accomplishing the whole task of lifting up mankind anyway. Thus, the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, held in British Columbia in 1913, officially endorsed and approved a book by Reverend Professor George Jackson, entitled ‘‘The Preacher and the Modern Mind”, in one part of which he makes the statement, “We are not bound to any Chris-tology or to any doctrine of the work of Christ”. This is tantamount to saying, “We are not bound to Christ in any way whatsoever”, which is the hard fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Doctor Appleton Bash, of Pittsburgh, speaking to a graduating class of young Methodist Episcopal clergymen in Clarksburg, West Virginia, November 2. 1919, told the young men to speak in terms that would be understood by the man of the street, saying, “Don’t expert to interest the man outside by using such phrases as being born again or washed in the blood of Jesus”. Without a doubt those young Reverends, anxious to get along in the clergy business, will do just as Doctor Bash has advised, or at least they will do it as far as their congregations will permit them to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On April 6, 1920, at the Church of the Glorification, St. Louis, Missouri, the Reverend F. A. Gustafson.made the statement respecting Christ that &quot;His death upon the cross had no more to do with salvation and redemption than my losing my Life in order to save your child would have to do with saving the child”. We do not know the denomination with which the Church of the Glorification is connected; but whatever it is* we say, “Shame to it”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Occasionally there is a body of Christian men that dares to stand by the Bibb*. Throe Baptist chnrdios in the state of Washington publicly withdrew Christian fellowship from the Plymouth C&lt;»ngrvgiuional Church because the paster of tin* latter had made the statement that mo*lorn sAidy of the Bible does away with the idea ol blood sacrifice, which he denounced as u &quot;pagan principle”. All we have to say is that</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">toomn,</span><span class="font9"> BB</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">if that principle be pagan then the whole Christian religion is a pagan religion and we are all without God and without hope in the world..</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There being no fall of man and no Savior it follows obviously that there are no miraeles. The Reverend Elmer L Goshen, of the First Congregational Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, is said to have reached the ‘^positive” conclusion' that so-called miracles have no place in a modern program and that unless the church as a whole shakes off these shackles of superstition it will soon lose its uplift force and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We commend this observation to the attention of Reverend Antonio Garriteno, Rector of St Anthony’s Church of Chester, Pennsylvania. That gentleman is reported in the Philadelphia Presx of September 18,1920, as having received from Rome a part of the garment worn by Christ at His crucifixion. The account went on to say that the relic was recognized as genuine by the Vatican and that the seal of the \ atican was upon the document accompanying it from R-.nm*. Surely here is a great miracle. .Surely the preservation of a piece of this garment for so long a time is a Wonderful thing. And the garment itself must have been a wonderful garment; for enough pieces of it have been shown in the last 1900 years to make a good-sized circus lent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There hung no fall of man, no Christ and no miracles, it follows that Christ never had a prehuman existence, or a miraculous birth of a virgin mother, or a miraculous resurrection from the dead. Just at this writing the city of Huntington, West Virginia, is all stirred up because two Congregational ministers have been expelled from the local ministerial association for expressing their disbelief in the divine con ception of our Lord Jesus Christ. This ministerial association did its duty, did just what it should have done; and it could go much further and expel many more of its members; and the act \vould all be to the advantage of those who are trying to be Christians in the city of Huntington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There being no fall of man, no savior and no miracles, it also follows that we have ru i.» ed of the Savior’s promised reign on earth, the Golden Age. And any book such as Revelation which plainly tells of this coming era of peace on earth, good will toward men, is therefore a useless and pernicious book. So we are not -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">surprised when the Reverend Doctor Shirley J. Case, Professor of Early Church History and New Testament Interpretation of John D. Rockefeller’s great University of Chicago for educating young Baptist Reverends comes out with a book in which he said substantially that John was a failure as a prophet, that Revelation did not come true and will never come true. Doctor Case thinks that most of the trouble in the world is due to people who'believe in the Revelation as a gift from God, saying, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I think today that part of the unrest over the globe, the inability of millions to settle back into their old orderly pursuits and their seeking after spiritualism and new sources of consolation are due to the recurrence of the old haunting despair of the human soul to which the term premillennialism has been applied. Premil-lennialism is based on the admission that nothing is of any use after all. I believe that if this old bogey [that Christ’s kingdom is actually to come.—Ed.] could be forever laid, if not only ignorant people, but millions of earnest and devout men and women could put this evil dream out of their minds, it would have world-wide quieting etfect/’ [This is just what Satan would like to hase done.—Ed.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">President Harding' is a good echoer, a first-class one, and we understand that not !&lt;i:tg since he echoed this sentiment of the Reverend Shirley Case. The idea is bearing fruit; and accordingly we learn that for preaching this doctrine, with which the Bible abounds from cover to cover, the Reverend James Colville, of the V’roo Will Baptist Church, Adrian. Michigan, lias 1k&lt; n siv-d by the trustees in an effort to oust him. The htdief was attacked in court as “having no place in the articles of faith of either the regular Baptist or Free Will Baptist Church.”. The complaint did not specify, however. and could not, that the belief Las no place in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Denying the fall of man, the need of a savior, the authenticity of miracles, ami il-o realitv of the long-promised kingdom is loading the Reverends to gradually take their stand in denying the Bible in toto and everything that stands for it or stands by it. Tie’s, the Reverend Clarence S. Gee, pastor of the Park Presbyterian Church, rtt ?uraddr-s&lt; in &lt;’h v»lnml. Ohio. September 21^19If), made die statement that “creeds [expressions of faith] are splendid monuments to the expressed thought of men. but no one believes a creed”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We presume it is because of this disbelief in anything and everything that an undertaker in Chicago advertised that he had a unique establishment so arranged that mourning guests might stay there without being conscious that there were any dead about them, or that they might be with their dead if they so desire, a place which has all the facilities of a hotel, and, last but not least, is provided with a Reverend “who has the ability to adapt his remarks to any denomination, creed or philosophy—a sort of all-around man”. Wonderful!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergyman in this undertaker’s employ may be a subscriber to the sermon service which issues somewhere in these United States. We do not know the address of the sermon factory, but have learned the titles of five of the sermons, namely, “God’s Masterpiece — Man,” “The Church of Tomorrow/’ “Humanity’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Head-</span><span class="font6">light,’’ &quot;The Man of Galilee,'* and ‘'America, the Queen of Nations”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There was a &quot;time when Protestants were perfectly fearless in declaring that the papal system is the Mari of Sin, the Antichrist. I u u r tlv new order of things this would never do. There will he no recognition of either Christ or Antichrist. Reverend George W. Coleman, President of tlie Northern Baptist Convention, writes of his ideas: &quot;My ideal church would be so big and broad that no one would think of having more than one such institution to serve any given community”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Andrew Melrose Brodie, Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, of Wichita. Kansas, is also in favor of completely casting behind his back the horrible record of the system that fastened the bloody Inquisition upon Europe ami drenched its soil with the blood of seventy million martyrs. At a banquet in honor of the Right Reverend John Joseph Hennosy, Catholic Bishop of Wichita, October 16, 1919, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘*1 hope to see an American pepo elected. I hey? the tir o may conv» when all strife between ereed- will be M-t .vid-' and the lUmun Catholic Church will hud all den^minatious into the kingdom.'’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For the encouragement of Reverend Brodie we &lt;-Ml attention to the fact that it is already leading hi some things. Thus the Reverend Leo Kabner,Catholic Chaplain of the Joliet.Illinois, penitentiary, points out that the Catholics of Illinois comprise only 19.4 percent of the population of the state, but that is the Joliet prison they make up 45.1 percent of the prison population. This percentage by which they are leading the Protestants toward the Promised Land would be larger except for the fact that many policemen, most of whom are Catholics, will never arrest one of their omA kind except under circumstances which they cannot possibly escape. A Catholic priest in Chicago got drunk and shot and killed an inoffensive station agent and never came to trial because a lying Bishop filled the Chicago papers with swill about what </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">beautiful character he was and how much he loved </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">flowers.</span><span class="font6"> This love of flowers was all imaginary, as was afterward discovered by those who made investigation of the matter. But it did the trick The papers can be depended upon nowadays to accomplish any trick that is laid before them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there are plenty of black sheep in the Protestant ministry, too. One of the most flagrant recent instances of the crookedness of Reverends was the case of the Reverend A. D. Tucker, arrested at Savannah, Georgia, January 27, 1920, and returned to Columbia, S. C., where he was arraigned for stealing $1,500 from a brother minister with whom he was rooming in a Columbia hotel. lie was conducting revival services at the time the theft occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wc wonder how the other Reverend got the $1, 500 in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Percy Jones, Rector of Calvary Church. Bastrop, Texas.'in a letter to the Galveston Ncics tells of a visit which ho recently paid to a fashionable church in the East:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Every ••(Tort wa- made to supply all except the chief thing for which the church exist*, namely: To pn-acn the gospel. There were polite ush»?rs. fine music, ornate ritual, gorgeous stained gln&gt;x leaflets in the racks at the doors, leaflets in the pew.-. The parish had sewing guilds, boy scouts. camp-fire girls, a swimming pool, and club-rooms. But the sermon was a four or five minute ‘mutation’ on some collect or hymn, squeezed in tight between a long list of announcements, and tearful appeals for money in ‘drives* that were being run ‘at sundry time- and in divers manners*.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a sermon preached at Tabernacle Baptist Church. Raleigh. North Carolina, July 29, 1920. Reverend I%ctor Oscar Haywood delivered himself of some pretty plain talk as to the present condition of religion in the United States after several generations of the most ardent effort on the part of the clergy to pound the desk, deny the Bible and yell for more money in the most strictly^orthedox way. We collect a few of his choice sentences as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The church fails because it fails in its conception of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">its duty to the world,</span><span class="font6"> because it </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">has </span><span class="font6">lost sight of the fact that it is in the world and not of the world. By the time we convert Africa, missionary boards along the Congo will be </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">sendi</span><span class="font6">ng missionaries to New York, Chicago, SanFrahcisco, and Raleigh. There is hardly </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">church you can go to that doesn’t look like </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">music hall. The only way you can. tell church members is for them to wear uniforms like the Salvation Army. If you should start out today preaching the gospel that the disciples preached, there is not </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">denomination on earth that would own you; and if Christ should come to Raleigh and preach tomorrow as he preached nineteen hundred years ago, you would have him in Jail before night.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>On </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Its Last Legs</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">HE clergy business is on its last legs. One evidence of this is that of the 108,000,000 people in United States not more than 44,000,000 are counted members of religious denominations, and only twenty percent of the Protestants go to church regularly; there are 3,000,000 less children in the Sunday schools than there were in the year before the war. Moreover, there are now 40.000 pastorless churches in the United States, according to the Federal Council of Churches of Christ: and whereas there are required 5.000 new clergymen each year to take the places of those who drop out. the total output of Reverends of Protestant seminaries for last year was only 1.450.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of Princeton’s 30S graduates in 1921 only eight were expecting to enter the ministry, and Amherst graduated only one who was anticipating that line of work. The significant fact here is that both Princeton and Amherst were founded with the avowed object of providing schools for the training of young men for the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As the total attendance at Protestant seminaries is now estimated at only 5,500, it is calculated that in 1922 ten thousand more Protestant pulpits wall be vacated than in 1920. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Digest</span><span class="font6"> says of this movement of the youth of the land:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“While the seminaries are failing to check their losses, all other institutions of higher learning have been put to it to accomodate the avalanche of students which descended upon them after the war, which would seem to show tKat men are deliberately shunning the pulpit in favor of other professions”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Dr. Burdette B. Brown, Executive Secretary of the Methodist Child Welfare Society, said of this failure of young men to train for the clergy business:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sub>z</sub> &quot;It ia really creditable to the young manhood of our time that they hesitate to enter the ministry unless they are under a conviction.sufficiently strong to lead them to the work regardless of the compensation received”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Doctor then explains how commercial institutions make a practice of visiting colleges and universities regularly each year and offering tempting opportunities to the graduates. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;A similar plan of recruiting students for the ministry should be followed by the commission on recruiting, awarding a lucrative salary, that they too may have the hope of a home and familv”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The American Board of Applied Christianity and Applied Patriotism with military (L e., machine-gun and poison-gas) ideas incorporated under the laws of New York, with Major General Leonard Wood, LL.D., as Honorary President, has a scheme for enticing young men into the ministry. Tills scheme was started in October, 1921, with an advertisement for 4,500 men to receive free training in practical politics, public speaking, current news, work among boyn. financial inana'.-muent of churches, and religious education. The advertisements state that full information can be obtained from the headquarters of H.r i.iovri.ieet. 70 F'ifth Avvnno. New York, or from the pastors, ushers or leaders in local churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">l'&gt;'identlysomel&gt;odyis badly scared and trying to get more of tl?o modern variety of Reverends at. all hazards. Cheer up. They will not get them, and it will t blessing to the country that they f.-dl '<sup>r</sup>h ’•nanc men of today want to do something worth while and most of them are convinced in^t the clergy business has had its day. A Congregational minister in the course of a recent tour made the remark, “This is the Ihirty-fifth church I have visited, and not one of them has sent a single man into the ministry in thirty years”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bishop Warren A. Candler, of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, (brother to Asa G. Candler* proprietor of the Coca Cola beverage business) writes in the Atlanta </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jour nal,</span><span class="font6"> October 26, 1919, lus opinion of the kind of instruction the young men have been receiving in the theological seminaries of these United States:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Too many American theological leaden and teacher* have been showing young men who coma to them for instruction how to write and preach and live on the least possible belief”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bishop Candler puts his hand on the sore spot The men who teach the Reverends have no faith themselves and Are unable to impart to the young what they do not themselves poa* seas. An odd fact is that the denominational seminaries are virtually abandoned, while the seminaries which are centers of infidelity and higher criticism are being well filled. This shows that by some means the young men of today hav$ become convinced that doctrines do not matter, and that the best way to get on in the world is not to have any principles at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Evidences of how hard pressed the Protestant denominations^are may be seen in the fact that in July, 1921, the staid old Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States, at its conferences in New York and St. Louis decided to use the advertising columns of the daily press for general church advertising as well as evangelistic purposes, and the tyrannically governed Methodist Episcopal church a year previous granted to women the right to preach. At last reports fifteen women Reverends had been licensed to preach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Reverend William T. Ellis, writing in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Evening Post of</span><span class="font6"> the reports of ministerial meetings held in various cities, said, March, 1921:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;If one were to judge religion by these gatherings of the city clergy he would be surely justified in assuming that the major interests of the churches are such matters as the use of cigarettes, the length of women’s skirts, fashions in the movies, Sunday baseball, local politics, and the minutiae of ecclesiastical mechanics”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All this takes place, he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;With the whole earth in such agony as it has never before known; with vast spiritual fermentation and unrest a world-wide condition; with the very foundations of Christian civilization imperiled; with a nation steadily loosening its hold upon the elemental^ of faith”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font6"> commenting upon the decrease of young men in the theological seminaries. points out that: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The Episcopal, Congregational, and Presbyterian churches have felt the strain most, chiefly because their young men have been thinking independently since the war, and struggling to choose the ri^ht course. Thew churches appeal to a thoughtful constituency which re* fuses to accept doctrine without question. Naturally,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">300</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">so tremendous an event as the great conflict has given rioe-to much questioning. Many of the men have returned frankly baffled.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Even of those who, while in jeopardy of instant death, turned to religion, the account in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font6"> goes on concerning the much heralded spiritual uplift which tha Reverends predicted would come of the war:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The army of men with renewed faith which had assumed such proportions in- the Argonhe and at Belleau Wood diminished visibly at Brest and dwindled to a handful <sup>f</sup>in the practical realism of the port of New York. And instead of gaining substantially, the churches even lost many of those who had intended to cuter the ministry before the war. For the spiritual wave which was so confidently expected to follow in its wake was lost in rhe greater surge of materialism and sordidness which flooded the world. The churches battled manfully and futilely to stem the tide and prevent the w wkage.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Reverend Charles Brent, speaking before the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church, in October. 1919, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•‘There was a time when the Church was a pillar of fire leading the army of Christians. Now it is more like an ambulance following on behind and picking up tin* woundi d.*' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Reverend Paul R. AV right is not so optimistic. He does not think the church is headed in the right direction, to say nothing of following behind and picking up the wounded. In an address before the men’s Bible class of the First Christian Church, Santa Ana, California, he said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">T IS evident that while only the intervention of the strong arm of the state can save the clergy busuiess from complete wreck, it is still true as Benjamin Franklin astutely observed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">v;Whcn religion is </span><span class="font6">good </span><span class="font5">ir will take care ot' itself; </span><span class="font6">ulh-ifSt </span><span class="font5">is nut able to take rare of and God does nul </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">mv</span><span class="font5"> fit t&lt;» take care of it. that it has to ap{&gt;eal to the civil power for HippoiL it is evidence to my mind that its &lt;&nbsp;a;i&gt;e is a bad one*’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wln-n any institution has to come forth and explain why it has gathered to itstdf weaklings and hypocrites it has certainly reached a low obit. Revermid Joseph A. Kyle. Brooklyn, New York, writing in ‘'Unity” as to why there are weaklings and hypocrites in the clergy business says;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“They ire not bo by nature or by choice, but </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font6">spent many lonely and bitter hours before yielding to a pressure greater than they could bear&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Kyle follows this statement with the observation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Every minister in every church yearns to stand upright and speak his mind freely on every subject, but the suffering that it would bring to those dependent upon </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> holds him in check and gradually dwarfs his soul&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same gentleman also says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. “There is no possibility of stating the function of the minister in such a way that it will fit all groups of men and women&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We accept this statement as true, therefore wp say : Away with them all, and lot us get back to the simplicity and honesty of the early church. But the Reverend gives us some more:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The Roman Catholic Church with its celibate priesthood serve* a groat mass of people in a way that they need; no other church could do it. There is a certain type of man and woman that is at home only in an Episcopal Church. Another craves the Methodist Church with its warmth of devotion, or the Baptist Church, or the Presbyterian. Still another finds religion, spiritual comfort and uplift only in Christian Science, I am a friend of them all.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later on in the article Reverend Kyle says: “Better a handful of people serving the Master than a mob believing nothing in particular”. Is that so! Then if a collection of Roman Catholic, Methodist Baptist, Presbyterian, and Christian Science saihts is not “a mob believing nothing in' particular”, win Reverend Kyle not explain how such a mob should be made </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There are plenty of clergymen who frankly confess that the Reverends have made a colossal failure of their job. At the Methodist Ecumenical (inference. in London. September, 1921. the Rev. Ezra Squier Tipley, Madison, N. J., said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The world wants to </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Im?</span><span class="font5"> rid ol poverty, iguorar.ee, lust, greed. violence, ill-will, social injustice, and the warping burden of hatred and war. What help is there for this broken world? Naturally wo would look to the church; </span><span class="font6">but </span><span class="font5">we find </span><span class="font6">it full of imposing ceremonies, </span><span class="font5">thuibiering moralities, rigid decencies, the clatter of rub-. । da tit lido, venerable traditions, infinite cogwheels of organization, vvetything except </span><span class="font6">the spirit of the Gali</span><span class="font5">lean peasant who came to </span><span class="font6">plant in tho garden of the </span><span class="font5">world the seed of the love of </span><span class="font6">the Almighty.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Henry R. Sanborn, pastor of the Episcopal Church, Sparks, Nevada, stated the exact truth, in an address at Detroit, Michigan, in October, 1919, when he said:</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19220215_files/g_E_19220215-5.png" alt="" style="width:24pt;height:149pt;">

<p><span class="font6">&quot;The church is in the Laodicean stage today. The church boasts of its wealth, increases its goods, and apparently needs nothing. As a matter of fact, it/is miserable, poor, blind and naked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Doctor George W. Shelton, preaching at the Alvin Theatre, Pittsburgh, December 21,1919, gives the main reason why the clergy business has been a failure. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Education has failed us. It has only made a rascal more effective. The most highly trained people in the world became the most diabolical. Science has failed us. Every invention of man has been turned to human destruction. Evolution has failed us. We have returned . to the primal instinct of tooth and claw. Christianity has not failed us. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">It has never been tried** '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was tried, with astonishing success for three centuries—but none of the Reverends , seem to know about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Newspaper dispatches tell us of a town whore churehianity does nut flourish. They tell us that Walcott, Iowa, the richest town per capita in the state, has been without either a church or a jail for tnore than fifty years. The town is large enough to possess two banks, with combined deposits of over $1,500,000. This brings up the houiely but practical question. If a tiling is absolutely no good, what good is it I The answer is &quot;What's the use?” and there isn’t any. This does not mean that we do not believe in Christianity. The Christianity of Christ and “church-ianity” of the Reverends are as far apart as the East is from the West.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Common People “Catching On”</span></h5>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">N IMPORTANT section of the churchmen</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">. oi</span><span class="font6"> England are of the opinion that the day of the sermon has passed. They hold that the preaching of two ten or fifteen minute sermons each Sunday imposes a great strain upon the clergy, r. strain equally severe on the laity who have to listen to something that usually means absolutely nothing to anybody. They cite the unpopularity of bound volumes of sermons, once in ^reat demand, as an evidence that the people no tdtiger wish to hear them. They are quite right. They have hit the nail on the head. A young woman, writing to the Toronto </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font6"> in August, 1921, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Why have preachers? We are intelligent and all have Bibles to* read. We gather to worship to sing God’s praises, t£rt,encourage each other. Does it need a college education of many years to be a leader ? Many in the congregation could read a chapter intelligently. I need to be a church-goer. Now I use Sunday as a day of rest, read my Bible and other good literature, and give my tenth to every good cause, mostly to buy Bibles, English and foreign. I’d rather support a mission in some store than pay any pastor of any church I have found so far here. They are great visitors, great gos-ripen, great eaters, great egotists, and everything else. There are few ideal pastors. Let us all be evangelists to each one we meet, and the millennium will come soon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A writer in the Toronto </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font6"> signing him* self merely with the title “Plain Man” makes a somewhat similar observation and suggestion:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“There are men in the church capable of managing railway systems, governments, newspapers and large industries; and if they express an opinion on theological questions they will apologize for having trodden on sacred ground. The result is the pew is comparatively dead. There is do doubt ecclesiasticism is largely responsible for this state of affairs^ Where is there any room in the prevailing systems for obeying the injunctions of Romans 12:6-8, 1 Corinthians 14:31, and numerous other commands of similar import? In the first century every convert who could was supposed to. and did, preach the Word everywhere (Acts 8:4 and 11:19). And they were not college students, nor were they ordained by their fellow men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">An anonymous Article in the Winnipeg </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tribune</span><span class="font6"> of May 14, 1921&gt; shows that they are getting their eyes opened in Manitoba, too. It says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The priest of today lives in an artificial world, and between him and the mass of men is a great gulf fixed. A celebrated cleric has himself suggested the remedy, though in his case primarily on economic grounds. Let the preacher support himself like other men by a secular vocation, and perform his spiritual duties on Sunday and in intervals of leisure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And so say we all. It is quite useless for men to try to tell other men and women how to behave in this sin-cursed world unless they are themselves battling with the very same problems as those to whom they seek to minister.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">HEN Rabbi Harry R. Richmond, of Paterson, New Jersey, resigned from the rabbinate he gave some reasons which reflect very well the reasons which are forcing thousands of other conscientious men out of the ministry. Of course, if a man had no conscience he can try to stay in the business a little while yet. Rabbi Richmond said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The pulpit does not accomplish the good it is aup-posed to do. It does not stop poverty, lynching, peonage,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">war, </span><span class="font6">graft, bribery, and other similar evils. The rabbi or minuter of today can no longer* mould human life. Organised religion does not come to uproot things. It sanctions things. It cannot do anything else. It is powerless to do anything else. If it will not sanction the institutions of the day, it will be deserted by the people?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some’of those who see that the jig is up, and that the people can- no longer be led about by ‘the nose in this matter of religion as they have beeri in the past, are going into the business for which their training more particularly fits them, that of salesman. Thus, the Reverend H. B. Schultheis, of the Christian Church of. East Palestine. Ohio, left the church to become a salesman for a brokerage firm in Pittsburgh; Reverend Willis. Pastor of the Lutheran Church. Louis Comer. Wisconsin, left to become a travelling salesman: Reverend A. I.. Snow, pastor of Liuisdown Christian Church. East St. Louis, left to lu-come a salesman for the Gohl Grain Milling Company; Rabbi Samuel Sale. Lor thirty-two years the rabbi of Temple Shaarc Emeth. St. Louis, Missouri, left to become a life insurance agent with the NorthwoUm Mutual Life Insurance Company: and Reverend Doctor T. G. Syl«'s. of Grosse Pointe Protestant ClftTFcli. has resigned to enter tli&lt;* real estate business: while the Reverend W. II. Fresblry. Pastor of the First Evangelical Church. South Ih-nd. Indiana, has become the manager of tlic local branch stoic of th*- Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some arc going back to the farm. Reverend II. Shaw. Pastor of the Bethany Christian ('hutch. Evansville, Indiana, has irniip back to a farm: Reverend R. H. Cooper, of Marion. Illinois, has done tie* same: and the pastor of our *0 rhe local churches । &gt;i' &lt;&nbsp;'•nuiiivro’. Georgia, is (•aruimr $1.50 a day pulling fodder for the farmer. We wish to call attention to this last man. lie is doing the right thing; With his back aching Saturday night after a Lard week's work he is In^far better condition to give a message of comfort to some other poor fellow whose back is also aching from the suiuc kind of work, than he would if he had Iwcii loafing during the week, “working not at all”.

<p><span class="font6">Reverend .Ellis Slipporly, pastor of the V Methodist'Episcopal Church, Peckskill, New York, resigned the pastorate to liegin work as a pearl-cutter in a factory in that city.

All the church members in those three (‘Lurches may Ijeeomo Christians before<sup>1</sup> -Reverend Fuller gets through with them, if he keeps on. Reverend H. J. Kingdon, of Poughkeepsie. New York, is working in a hat shop during the week, pasting hatbands at a salary of $18 per week. The Baptist Church pays him ' $20 a wwk more for preaching on Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Others are going into other lines for which &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">they are more jjeculiarly adapted. Within the past year in California thirty clergymen have ' left the'ministry and become public school teachers. In Scotland reports are that many of them arc leaving the church and becoming i&gt;olicemen. At Duluth, Minnesota, the Reverend .Martin Best, pastor of the Norwegian Holiness Association Church, applied for a job as a butcher or as a newspaper editor. At Marion. Illinois, one became secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, one became county superintendent Of schools, on&lt;- took a joh as a lineman. one as a job printer, and one an editor. At Keeseville, New York, Reverend AV. B. Kelley of the Episcopal Church, resigned to become the proprietor of the wayside tavern, with its accompanying dance hall and dining room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England at hast twenty-five Protestant -ministers are reported as having died of starvation in 1919. and'the clergy have formed the National Clerical Union for the “establishment of a minimum living wage for the clergy”. -Bishops and even cardinals are feeling the pinch. Several of the cardinals in Rome have asked for a raise of pay, and the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> says that some of them have had to dismiss their carriages. Alack! and then some more, Alack!!</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">The Bishops of Lichfield and of Durham, England, have had to give up their castles for smaller quarters and even the Lord Bishop of London had to give up one of his. Now, isn’t - that The Bishop, Doctor Ingram, evidently fedff sore over his lost prestige and, realizing that the old graft is about played out, made the d ^ statement in a speech, April 10, 1921: “The business men of London are not such fools as to put their sons to such a rotten profession as preaching”. When the Bishop gets down to an honest job, say ditch digging, or coal heaving, \ tavern keeping, or whatever he is adapted to, he will feel better about all this; and it will be a fine thing for London, too.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">naturally honest. We have three of these Taylors in mind. The first is the Reverend ' Doctor Joseph Judson Taylor, D. D., of Leaks-ville, North Carolina. Writing in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Mantifac-- Hirer’s Record,</span><span class="font6"> August 26, 1920, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Mun who are today denouncing the wickedness of war, only a few months ago were as eanu^tly proclaini-<sub>r</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ing the righteousness of war, the war they wanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministers who, like the writer, have never read a trea</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">tise on international law in their lives, have felt quite competent to lecture senators on their duties concerning I th? so-called League for Peace: and yet less than two wars ago the same men were preaching war from their pulpits, and in some cases were promising the victims of war salvation from sim and rest in heaven/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">[ . The second Taylor that conies in for our respectful attention is the former pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Rochester, Min-j nesota. lie gave up his ministry to study os-' teopathy, declares that the modern church is a Judas that denies the Lord, and that if the i business houses of the country were run on the same unscrupulous lines as the churches they would all be bankrupt within thirty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The ^hir.d Taylor, and perhaps we ought to « call him the Master Taylor, was the Reverend I. Paul Taylor of Highland Park, Michigan. He writes for the magazine “Unity”, explaining why he cannot remain in the ministry and why he is leaving it. We quote sentences here and there from his masterly article. He goes to the foundation of the whole fraud that has been perpetrated upon the common people:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• “&quot;When I say that I cannot be a Christian and a successful minister I mean just that I cannot remain true to the teachings of Jesus, I cannot maintain my interest in the negroes and other oppressed people and rise to be the minister in a large church at the same time. I think I know how to do it, how to agree with the editorials of the subsidised press rather than the Sermon on the Mount, how to bow to the authority of the state at every crisis rather than to hold fast to the leadership of the Carpenter of Nazareth. Yes, I know how to do all this; but I won’t For me to cooperate with them, for me to make my living by being a ‘successful' min</span><span class="font5">ister, would be to accept the thirty pieces of silver as did Judas. Trace the history of the world and you will find that it is the history of one conflict after another for the same thing, the suppression of the slaves or peasants in eveiy revolution. Am! where has the church historically stood in the.-o contests? Has she luid a definite set of principles which have been her guiding star? Not since the days of that early apostolic church whose members were persecuted by the Roman Empire as the ene</span><span class="font6">mies </span><span class="font5">of the established order. Not </span><span class="font6">since the </span><span class="font5">days when those ancient lowly men followed in the footsteps of Hhn who was put to death because he •'stirreth up the pt'ople’ </span><span class="font6">and </span><span class="font5">‘is </span><span class="font6">no </span><span class="font5">friend </span><span class="font6">of </span><span class="font5">C:vsn&lt; Because </span><span class="font6">ever </span><span class="font5">since that day we have had not a Christianity which was ‘good now.** (gospel) to the poor and ‘common people who heard him gladly', but we have had state religions whose glory and shame it has been to uphold any old hokns-i&gt;oku3 game winch might be decreed by their King.

I was brought up to be tactful. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">J</span><span class="font5"> was told in the seminary to follow the admonition of Paul and feed the people with milk when they could not stand meat — for the sake of the organization.

<p><span class="font6">The fact of the business is that the organized system of religion which has spread over the earth calling itself Christianity is not Christianity at all.An article in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Stiht rd'! it</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font6"> correcting those who think that the modern church is a representative of Christianity and an attempt to carry out the personal teachings of Christ says of it:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It </span><span class="font5">is nothing of th? sort, and no church authority will support that idea. Christianity—more particularly after the ascendancy of the Trinitarian doctrine was established—was and is a theological religion; it is the religion that triumphed over Arianism, Manicheism, Gnosticism, </span><span class="font6">and the </span><span class="font5">like; </span><span class="font6">it is based not on </span><span class="font5">Chrbt </span><span class="font6">but </span><span class="font5">on its creeds; Christ indeed ia </span><span class="font6">not </span><span class="font5">even its symbol; </span><span class="font6">on the contrary, the chosen symbol of Christianity is the cross to which Christ was nailed and on which He died. It was the warrior Theodosius who, more than any other’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">single man, imposed it upon Europe. There is no reason, therefore, either in precedent or profession, for expecting any plain lead from the churches in this tremendous task of organizing and making effective the widespread desire of the world far peace. And even were this the Case, it is doubtful if we should find in the divines and dignitaries of the Vatican, of the Russian and British official churches, or of any other of the multitudinous Christian sects* the power and energy, the knowledge and ability, or the good will to negotiate so vast a thing as the creation of a world authority.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Let us thank God that He has not left Himselfi without a true people in the earth, small in. numbers though they be; and let ug thank Him also that He has provided the great Ruler whose right the kingdom is, who shall bripg in the everlasting peace and righteousness for which all </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font6"> men, in and out of the clerical business long.

<p><span class="font13">N</span><span class="font6">OT that there is a People’s Party, but that the hitherto inarticulate common people have become vocal through officials chosen by informal nonpartisan methods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tn an issue of The Goldex Age over a year ago on the coining rise of the fanner and labor element in politics it was predicted that these classes would quietly elect men after their own heart, but chosen nominally as Democrats or Republicans. This would be accomplished by the unnoticed capture of local jx&gt;litieal machines and the designation of men for office who would properly and adequately represent the common people. In Congress, Cor example, they would nominally be Democrats or Republicans, but when it came to action they would stand by themselves voting and acting for the people who sent them to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prediction has been fulfilled to the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tn the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font6"> for November 23, 1921, the emergence of this new force in national affairs was announced under the heading, “Republican Heads Lose Grip on Party. Progressive Farm Block in Congress Takes Control of Tax and Tariff Legislation. Harding’s Appeal Ignored.” It goes on to say that (bracket* ou^s):</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘•Milit&lt;iht.progros&gt;ivism is in control in Congress, and (he Republican Party is without direction in its most important legislative policies, tax and tariff matters.

<p><span class="font6">, “When ninety-four Republican members of the House refused last week to adopt the recommendations of President Harding on the surtaxes, they proved that there were enough independent Republican votes to take the reins of legislative control out of the hands of the majority leaders on legislation of distinct party flavor. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[Times</span><span class="font6"> wants readers to think this way]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The progressive farm bloc in the Republican Party holds the balance of power in Congress, and, cemented together a&lt; it is. will be powerful enough to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dictate the </span><span class="font5">writing of the tariff bill, as it did the revenue bill, sweeping aside the judgment of the recognized leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•‘It developed today that *tho [farm] Senate group which forced the 50 percent surtax [hated by the rich] into the revenue bill had gained six new converts in the fight to raise the duties on farm products, [so as to help the hated farmer] bringing the number to twenty-seven.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">to there has been, and now-is, a Wall Street block powerful enough to dominate all legislation and bent on preventing anything that would help the comtnon people, if it encroached at all on the preserves of Big Business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now, as predicted, there is seen the beginning of the complete ousting of the Big Business block. Big Business, headed by PresidenLHard-ing their tool, purposed to eliminate the tax on the excessive profits of corporations and the rich. It was for the very rich that the President pleaded at such length for the reduction of the surtax, a tax which affects only the largest incomes in the country. The President’s “obstructive interference” was declared by Senators to be a violation of the Constitution [political talk by the Democrats]. But anything is justifiable when Big Business is to be defended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It need not be imagined by the Democratic Party that the revolt from the Republican Party is destined to benefit the Democrats. The latter party lias been a dead issue ever since the 7,000,000 landslide of voters away from Wilsnn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The revolt now in progress is an uprising of the common people against Big Business, Big Politics, and Big Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The heroic seven million stood up against Wrtson and the papal hierarchy, and chose a Big Business party headed by President Harding and Standard Oil, as the lesser of two evils. The common people were fleeing from the savagery of Rome and the Espionage laws, the Sedition laws, the cruel inquisition of the Palmer secret service, the brutality of militaristic domination. the lash of the Federal Reserve Banking system, the scourge of unnecessary hard times. and the obnoxious interference with private affairs of Herbert Hoover and the Protestant ecclesiastics and their “dry” law espionage. These millions fled to the Republican Party only as a temporary port of refuge. They are not Republicans. They are not Democrats. They are rimply plain people—the real 100-percent Ameriahis—in revolt against their tormentors and oppressors, of whatever political party. The Republican leaders were much mistaken if they thought that the 1920 election was a Republican yictory. The Democratic leaders are much more mistaken if they imagine that such elections aS that for the New York City mayorship mean a Democratic “victory”, when the people who had gone two to one for Harding reversed themselves and went two to one for the Democratic candidates. It was simply a mad rush'from the oppressive dominion of Big Business. The New York Administration will do well to heed the warning, regardless of the fact that it resulted so fortunately for them. The only way to continue even for a time what appears like popular approval is for the New York Administration to boldly take the side of the common people^tad to cut loose from all domination and interference by Big Business, or Big Church. Any other course will result in certain loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The breaking away of the masses from Big Business political control appeared again in the peculiar result of the election-for mayor of Youngstown. Ohio. There a “stranger within the gates”, who had come in only a few months before.' started a produce market, and through his advertisements talked about the things lie knew the people wanted — humorously put in the IT’or/d as “discontinuance of street-car service, turning the streets over to jitney buses and jailing any citizen who paid a tax under a recent valuation” to say nothing of “permitting spooning in city parks under police protection. dismissing the entire police force if it ‘doesn’t mend its wav’,” and a promise to turn over his entire salary to charity. The result astounding to the two political machines of Youngstown, was the election of Mayor George L. Oles by an overwhelming vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This again was the fleeing of the couuinm people, and particularly the women voters, who more keenly than the men suffer from the privations and hardships of the hard times and the evil effects of 'corrupt government, from the oppression and torments inflicted on their victims by Big Business and Big Politics, to say nothing of Big Church, which in the background incites many an act harmful to the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Cleveland the same landslide was seen away from the old parties to a man that held out a little hope to the people. Tin’s time it was a former Chief of Police, who for his attitude in behalf of the common people and against the political bossism, was elected by a handsome majority. When he was dismissed in 1913 on charges of conduct unbecoming an officer, preferred by the Newton D. Baker who later became a cabinet member under the infamous Wilson administration, he said, “Cleveland will some day elect me its Mayor<sup>3</sup>’. That day has come; and if Mayor Fred Kohler loyally stands as an. actual champion of the common people his name will be long remembered with regard. But if he again takes up with Big Business, Big Politics, or Big Church he will surely feel the heavy hand of popular wrath.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">This mass movement of the people against corruption among their former leaders is one of the significant signs of the times. It portends ill for corrupt men in high circles. It promises better things for the ordinary man. It is worldwide in extent, is visible in England, in Canada, in far-off Australia, in all parts of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So vast a movement was not unknown in the prophecies of the Scriptures which in a variety of ways, sometimes by simple utterances, sometime by the deeds of champions against wrong, depicted these things. For this is Jehu in action. Jehu represents the common people revolting against official iniquity. Jehu began his famous ride in America prior to the 1920 election. Jehu —the people — destroyed the Romanist Democratic Party at a blow. Now this heroic figure is inflicting a deadly blow against the nominally* “Protestant*’ Party of Privilege, the Republican Party. Soon the common people will turn their attention to Big Church in polities and will in some manner, not clearly seen as yet, throw down and bring about the utter destruction of the church-state system prophetically termed “Jezebel”. It is a general cleaning-up by the people—part of the cleansing away of the corruption and iniquity which have stained the nations of tho world (2 Kings 9.1^1. rnd which must be completed before the Golden Age.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font13">K</span><span class="font6">NOWING that you are interested in social uu-re tore went out on strike on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">conditions in their various phases in differ</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">ent parts of the country, I am goin-x to write a brief resume of the Oil Worker’s Strike in the California oil fields, but particularly in Kern County or the San Joaquin Valley. You may assume that any and all statements are true: for I will omit any that have the nature of he-rsay. It might be well to add that I am not a member cd' any labor orr'n<sup>r,</sup>’.ation, and that I am employed in a capacity ■ ’ h enables urn to look at the viewpoints of b«qh the operators and the workers; and I rm wr»tmg th s solely because 1 road your pv.hlicr thui rcxul'idy and accept its r-t-doments in 27&gt;od faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Oil Workers went out on strike in support of a principle which they cons:dered worth lighting for: namely, the continuation of the Mediation Board for Oil Workers’ Affairs instituted by the Government during the war. Tiie operators hold that the end of the war brmurht to'n close the necessity for this or any like arbitration committee; and to emphasize their stand they promptly gave out a general notice that all wages would be cut one dollar im r day, tok take effect September 1st, 1921. One or two companies agreed to meet with the Mediation Board, but in the main the operators offered a solid front of resistance to the workers and refused to meet them at alL The workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The strike, as organized and carried :m. holds a distinctly unique place in the history »»f organized labor struggles; and other strikes in the future will in all probability be organized only after taking into consideration the merits or disadvantages of the unique strike as staged in the California oil fields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the first place, the strike-lead&lt; rs had many hundreds of men deputized, giving them full legal status ns police in the strike area. Th&lt;*&lt;fe men for the most part were ex-soldiers, and they inmirdir.tr-y took up the work of arming them-sdw to the extent of making the necessary embargoes on the “outlaw companies’ ’effective. Motorcycle squadrons for the police of highways were also organized, and took up their stations on the main lines of traffic, in order to stop cars and ascertain whether or not they wt-re carrying strike-breakers into the strike districts. All those police were designated “law and order men”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On about September 20 the Associated Oil Company attempted to run a train into the area, loaded with strike-breakers, or “guards”, as they afterwards claimed these were. The strikers stopped the train and sent it back In the meantime the motorcycle riders maintained a close watch on the roads, stopping, all ears that they did not recognize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Soon after the strike became effective certain individuals, who owned interests in the oil fields and who wished to bring unworthy criticism in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font6"> the press to bear to their advantage, attempted • to antagonize the road sentries by passing them without stopping. This occasionally brought a * rifle shot at their tires or over their heads to intimidate them. Of course the press im- mediately took this up, and certain Los An-gelcs papers published articles about “Little Bed Russia in the Oil Fields”, stating that the workers had set up a soviet form of government. women were not safe on the streets, etc., all calculated to prepare the public mind for the Government’s sending in machine gunners. To their disappointment the machine guns never developed, although they kept up their exaggerated articles until the close and wrote articles about Taft’s being the center of an I. W. W. uprising. The remarkable thing was that a stranger visiting the town would never have known that a itrikc condition existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The strikers were maintained by the levy on union employes in other Hehls who wr.v mu affected, and by the funds saved up prior to the Strike. Many of the men left the fields for other parts of tlu? country, but for the most part the men carried on in the hope of bringing things to a successful close. However, the smaller companies closed down their production, and the larger ones ran their oil into storage or had it transported to tidewater through the lines of unaffected companies. The lack of demand for oil operated in favor of the companies, and they were able to continue this plan indefinitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After appealing to the Government for intervention and receiving no hope of the Govern. meat’s taking any hand in the affair the strikeleaders decided to return to work and called the strike off on November 1st.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AFTERMATH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whejj the men were ready to return to work, it seems &quot;that the various oil companies had been cooperating to a greater extent than was suspected; for the men were told that their jobs were taken by other men or that they were not needed. Strikers from one company would ap-' ply to another company, and find that that company was informed as to their previous employment and would not accept them. A very careful and elaborate system of checking and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">blacklisting</span><span class="font6"> had been evolved so that only very few well-trained or“ valuable” men did get their jobs back, and the rest were turned loose jobless, moneyless and, in a great many cases, foodless. It was next discovered that the merchants of the towns also were informed as to the names on the Black List in oYder to shut down their credit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The next step, and probably the lust in this modern strike-drama, was the organization of the One Hundred and One Club. This club is ostensibly for the purpose of protecting the helpless citizens of the town against the ravages of a much-heralded mob of plotters, Bolshevists. Reds, Anarchists and I. W. W., who are supposed to be residing in our midst. Great pains have been taken to spread the whispered word around that “they are planning to blow up the reservoir” this or that night. (The reservoir has been empty for years) The One Hundred and One Club presented the proper opportunity for the merchants of the town to got rid of these jobless strikers. They figured that a jobless man has no dollar-and-ceuts value to their community, and that he should-be rushed out. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The chib itself was organized by a hireling whose reputation for selling out his fellow men will follow him to his grave. His salary ami the other incidental expenses of organizing wore paid out of a fund provided by the larger of the oil companies affected by the strike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The achievements of this “brilliant” organi zation so far have l*een the raid on the home, in the dead of night, of one Moore. Moon a homesteader on sonic oil-hearing property which one of the companies has been trying buy. They have tried every known way except murder -in order to get him off the property without taking the matter to court, whore it would gain some notoriety. Moore was immediately branded as a Red and an I.W.W., although his friends know him for a gentle, inoffensive human being who simply wants to enjoy the right to live. The gallant One Hundred and One Club masked themselves, after relieving him of his gun the day before, and then stole into his house—with all the upstanding courage exhibited by skunks in killing baby rabbits. Moore was in bed; and when be got out of bed and turned on the light one of their number fired a thirty-eight-caliber bullet through the side of a thin partition into his back. He fell, and the noble One Hundred and One rushed in and arrested him for being disloyal to, the government The papers printed an entirely different story and moved the bullet down about eighteen inches in hi? anatomy for the sake of decency, stating that some one “unknown” had shot him in the leg during th/* raid on his home. Of course about five pounds of seditions literature was confiscated during the raid—five pounds being the stock in trade amount that is usually carried by any raiding party into any one’s private</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A Comparison of JEmmanuelism and Taoism</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font6">ODAY, when probably the majority of people in Christendom either openly subscribe to New Thought opinions or tacitly acknowledge them in principle, it may be pertinent to examine the sources whence this erroneous doctrine is derived. It is our contention that there exists a close relationship between “psychic phenomena’* and Spiritism; and that Theosophy, Christian Science, and Enimannelism are an Occidental adaptation of that ancient esoteric philosophy of the Orient whose fruits in their native soil are a medley of nightmare superstitions and cruel and revolting customs and institutions which have kept the heathen mind under a spell of ignorance, apathy, hopelessness, despair, and fear, for unnumbered centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a former article I endeavored to show the connection between th ? various New Thought cults in general and those schools of Hindu thought to which they owe their origin. In this place I will attempt a more specific comparison between Emmanuelism and Taoism, both of which are typical examples—one, of a system of New Thought; the other, of an Oriental religion. The intention is not to infer a direct derivation of one from the other, but to disclose the probable origin of both in the Vedanta school of Hin^u Philosophy. The parallel features of Emmhhuelism and Taoism are: Spiritism, evolution, spiritual self-mastery (or will-culture), hypnotism, the conception of “starry angels”, the “subconscious mind”, and perhaps psychotherapy. It is probable also that the Taoists regard Shang Ti, the Supreme Being of their Pantheon^ina pantheistical sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Emmanuelism originated in Boston in 1906, in the Emmanuel Church; hence its name. Ita </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">home</span><span class="font6"> when they do not happen to like him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great work goes on. Slowly but surely the jobless strikers are branded as I. W. W„ and then told to leave by these valiant masked </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">as</span><span class="font6">sassins of the One Hundred and One Club 'of Big Business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As you may know the members of the One Hundred and One Club are thesame men who , once put their hands on their chests and said in , a deep patriotic voice: “We are 101 percent Americans”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By 0. L. Rosenkrans, Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">founder was Dr. Elwood Worcester, a thoroughly up-to-date clergyman, who subscribed to all the most recent opinions of the evolutionists, psychicist and higher critics, and who sought to combine them into an essentially modernist interpretation of the Creed of the Apostles. Dr. Worcester had completed his education in the German schools, where he became a disciple of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(J.</span><span class="font6"> T. Fechner, himself a follower of Buckert, who discovered his alleged “treasures of wisdom” in the I’uranas, or sacred books of the Hindus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Taoism was founded by the sage Lao-Tzi during the reign of Ling Wang (B. C. 571-544) of the Chow dynasty, which exercised a nominal authority over the semi-independent princes of China during the Feudal period. The temporal dominion of the Chows was restricted to their heredity patrimony, their authority over the princes being a pseudo-spiritual one, as the exponents of ancient laws and customs. So the “Hall of Light”, or imperial palace at Loh-yang corresponded somewhat tb a supreme court whose decisions are final; and here Lao-tzi held office as Keeper of the Royal Archives. He was considered a native of Ch’u state; but the Sina-logue Terrien La Couperie, who claims to discover a regular intercourse at this time between the Chinese coast towns and Indian sea-traders, believed him to be a wandering Hindu pilgrim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The title “Lao-tzi”, or the “Old One”, was a reverential one. probably implying “Old Master”; however, the sage’s biographers advance a more fanciful explanation, relating that Lao-tzi was prenatally conscious that his birth would be fatal to his mother, and so intentionally delayed the same for eighty years, being born</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* gray-headed and gray-bearded, possessing, be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">sides, the physical peculiarities of twenty toes, £ a double-ridged nose, and ears of an extra-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> ordinary length—long ears being supposed to <sup>5</sup> .indicate wisdom! His mother’s conception was ascribed to a shower of meteors—a miraculous <sup>e</sup> ?*. _ phenomenon associated with the birth of various ancient personages, and probably directly suggested by invisible malignancy to east discredit on the conception of the mother of our Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Lao-tzi professed to have discovered the “One Truth”, the “Clue to All Things”—a truth /which could not be expressed in language, but must be inferred indirectly (this is the essence of much of the New Thought philosophy), saying, “They who speak do not know; they who know are silent”. Like other philosophical systems, his abounds in unctuous platitudes, reiterating lofty morality; so his disciples are enjoined to “seek the higher life”, and “to return good for evil”. The motives, however, are not altruistic, but selfish, the object being to ‘<sup>r</sup> beguile the unwary in order to take advantage of them. This explains itself in the “Doctrine of Inaction”, which is interpreted as the “overcoining of the strong by the weak, the weak by the soft; the entering in where there is no fissure of that which has no substance”. Evidently this means nothing more nor less than spirit-control,. though modern students of psychic phenomena might pretend to discover a variety of abstruse meanings therein, very plausible and ingenious, and in strict accordance with advanced modern thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lao-tzi’s philosophy is embodied in the book</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Tao Teh King”.awork of conspicuous brevity, , but said to contain profound truths of nature, hidden in allegory. It is enigmatical and obscure in treatment, and is composed in such an obsolete style as to be almost uninterpretable - by modern Chinese scholars. The “Tao Teh purports to explain the relations of Tao, “the<sup>x</sup>Way,” to the universe. Orientalists interpret Tao to mean Logos. Reason, the right <sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause of conduct, but say that it comprehends</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">a wider significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">TacAis the Eternal Path, is Being itself; in it originate all things, and back to it all things return. It is an ancient Chinese word and was used in similar sense by Confucius. In effect, Tao corresponds to Para </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Btahiu with</span><span class="font6"> the *' Hindus; and like the Hindus the Chinese regard</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">existence as a cycle. The Taoist teaching that soul is a refinement of matter, appears also to be a variation,of the Hindu belief that Purusa, or soul, creates matter through a cycle of evolution whereby the emanations of the soul become constantly more gross until the grossest stage is reached of visible, tangible matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According to the Taoists, the soul-essence exists in every object of nature and is the spirit controlling its development. Substantially this soul-essence corresponds to the “subconscious mind” of Enimanuelists and psychicists in general; and its workings are similar. The Taoists believe that the soul-essence subconsciously directs the growth of natural objects; a latent evolutionary principle which urges an upward striving through which, they believe, insects become the spiritual progenitors of birds, birds of animals, and the latter of man—an oriental “evolution”. It is hard to determine their exact application of this idea; for they do not maintain that the conscious entity is immortal, but on the contrary that after death ordinary human souls dissolve into thin air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Taoist initiate, however, who has mastered the art of concentrating his spirit, may retain his entity intact at the death-pang and continue his existence (or “pass on”, as Christian Scientists would say) as a spirit being, a. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">yau-kicei,</span><span class="font6"> or genie, one of the exalted beings who reside in stars, or wander at will through space, playing like conjurers with the forces of nature. (This was also Feeliner’s belief, adopted by Dr. Worcester, that the heavenly bodies are heavenly beings, or “starry angels”) The idea that the initiate can develop supernormal powers by a rigid course of moral discipline and meiiThl concentration is equivalent to the acquiring of Pranayama by Ilindmyogis; is the will-culture &gt;of New Thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Sometimes souls which have survived the death-pang experience metempsychosis, being reborn in human bodies without losing their supernatural powers. Suoh are the Taoist popes, who claim to exercise sovereignty over the spiritual world as the “Son of Heaven” was formerly believed by all Chinamen to govern the world of mankind by divine right. The first pope was Cliang-tao-hng, whose apotheosis. Yu Hwang, was delegated his authority by Shang Ti. the Supreme Being. When a pope dies, the assembled aspirants cast into a well iron plates</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■on which their respective names are inscribed. The true avatar of Chang-tao-ling is determined (so the/inform our credulity) by one floating, and the rest sinking to the bottom!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">- ’ Taoism is one element of the San Chiao, or “Triple Religion”, to which in recent times each individual Chinaman subscribed. Though the • three are in some features irreconcilable, each one contrived to minister to some superstitious need of the Sons of Han. Confucianism regn-/ lated his ethical relations with his fellow men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The doctrine of Fdh, or Buddhism (as adapted by Chinese rationalism) supplied him with a theory of “Rewards and Punishments”, a god - of hell, Ti-tsang-hwang, who ruled over quite a Dantean inferno, and a goddess of mercy, P’u Sa. who incarnated pity in a system of society where the struggle* for existence was so severe that the exercise of pity was equivalent to almost suicidal folly, and mercy became an abstract principle. Taoism equipped the laity to deal with the spirit world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is palpable that Taoism is thoroughly entangled with spiritism. The Taoists recognize only two basic human motives; longevity and wealth. The impulse which governs the initiate is to obtain both of these, and also immortality. His instrument is will-culture, whereby he acquires not only supernatural powers, but also command over spirits; as a “Higher Soul” with the power of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hsien-jeu,</span><span class="font6"> or spirit manifestation. In short, he becomes a spirit medium, and as such performs incredible feats as a magician, juggler, prestigiatcur, and hypnotist. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wi'i-kwei,</span><span class="font6"> or genii, are supposed to preside over - every department of nature; over the Five <sub>t</sub> Planets and the five terrestrial elements, furnishing gods of fire, medicine, agriculture, the rivers, the kitchen wia res, gods of going to bod and of getting up again in the morning. All these must be propitiated; so , the Taoist priesthood are in great demand and j musVdje consulted whenever a building site is J chosen that the geomantic influences may be i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;determined; OF-tuunmoned to a sick-bed to ex-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">robust, which gives rise to the custom ef healthy people sleeping with the sick for the protection of the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Certain of these genii, calledi </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sien-jin,</span><span class="font6"> preside over the “Weak Water”, or Elixir of Life, which the Taoist magieains pretend to manufacture artificially. Some animals, especially cats are anxious to become </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sien-jin,</span><span class="font6"> and slyly rub themselves against the legs of people in older to divert the human vital current into themselves. Cats also drink jn this vital current from the moon. Perhaps some people in our own country recall the superstitions belief prevalent in childhood that eats “sacked the breath” of sleeping persons. I mention these nonsensical ideas only to show how dose is the analogy between heathen superstition and some of the reasoning of psychicists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Worcester and his followers promulgated the pantheistical error of the “God within us”, that “God's spirit-ami man<sup>r</sup>s spirit are in their essence one”, that “God is in the world as the soul is in the body”. On this assumption they base their claim that by persevering in the cultivation of his will man is able to direct the action of his own subconscious mind and his own spiritual growth. Correctively, as his powers grow, his ability to dominate the subconscious mind of others increases. This is considered a feature of the law of Evolution which directs all growth, and theoretically the will-culturist will use his expanded powers only for the good of others—never to their prejudice! So the Eiumnnuelist clergyman poses as a psychn<sub>T </sub>therapeutic healer, curine his patients either by semi-hypnotic suggestions or bj<sup>r</sup> direct hypnosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Wo have shown that the, Taoists also recognize a supposed law of evolution which they apply not only to animate life but also to minerals, each mineral advancing through the successive stages of load, cinnabar, tin, and silver to gold. This is the foundation of their theory of the Transmutation of Gold, it being the ob ject of the alchemist to hasten artificially this evolutionary process. The same law applies to the pursuit of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Lien-tan,</span><span class="font6"> or the Elixir of Life, which gave rise to experiments in chemistry, during the course of which the Taoist magicians discovered metallurgy, the alloying and inlaying of metals, pigments, gunpowder, alcohol, arsenic, calomel, corrosive sublimate, pyrotechny, sympathetic ink, asphyxiating compounds, aqes-</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The “subconscious mind” of Emmanuelists is represented by the “soul essence” of the Taoists, and the professors of each philosophy <sub>r</sub> strive to direct its action by self-mastery. The <sup>A</sup> Taoist practice is for the neophyte to retire to some secluded mountain valley and there subject himself to a severe course of training, which consists in prolonged rolling of the eyes, gnashing of the teeth, and cracking of the joints—all of which are conducive to mental concentration. He is specially cautioned to guard against the intrusion of women, chickens, and cats during his exercises! Evidently our ideas of the cause of mental distraction approximate very closely to the Taoist The practice of the psycho-thera-” peutic and that of the Taoist exorcist are . practically identical; for both strive to gain control of the patient’s-will. The former effects his cure by persuading his patient that the .« microbe is innocuous or non-existent; the latter, that the demon has yielded to his persuasions and has departed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is evident that both Taoism and Emmanuel-ism are derived from Hindu sources, and especially from the Vedanta school of philosophy. Like the latter, which has a holy triad of Para Brahm, Siva, and Vishnu, Taoism has a trinity of Tao, I, and Wei, the “inscrutable, inexpressible Three, combined into One, without body, form, or image; unseen, unheard, and unfelt”. (Surely quite a mysterious matter!) “ The Tao produced One; One produced Two; Two produced Three; the Three produced all things. ’ ’ What would a false religion amount to without a trinity!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">During the period of decadence in the Graeeo-Boman world, Orientalism crept out over the western provinces, finding a congenial field in the corrupt practices and moral rottenness of an effete and degenerate race. Its pernicious influence should have completed the ruin except for the influence of Christianity, which checked and retarded demoralization, effecting a spiritual renovation of Europe (in spite of ecclesi-asticism) in concert with the physical regeneration effected by the Germanic nations. In our degenerate age Orientalism reappears to weave its spell of magic. Fortunately, as before, the authority of Jesus will suffice to redeem the world, in the near future, when the kingdom of our Lord is establish^! over all the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">R</span><span class="font6">EPEATEDLY The Golden Age has reminded its readers of the incoming New Era, and pointed out many proofs of its advent along Biblical, scientific, historical, and prophetical linos, as well as noting “signs of the • times”, and climatic changes indicating the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the proofs noted in a recent issue of The Golpkn* Age was the fact that rhe large ir-e fields of the Arctic regions are rapidly melting, thu’s^empering the climate, resulting in longer season^, milder winters and cooler summers. These changes are quite perceptible if we allow our minds to take in the scope of ten or twenty years. Twenty years ago, we occasionally heard stories a .second crop of red raspberries as far nort£ as the New England States. On several occasions I have seen this second crop, late in October, in years past. In more recent years we have heard occasional reports of apple and cli»*rry trees in full bloom for the second time in a season. This phenomenon was general in 1921 in New York. Michigan. Pennsylvania. Maryland, and Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We have heard reports of the fruit &lt;in the apple and cherry trees lieing “sot”. But ar Roanoke. Va.. at a public meeting, a farmer handed me an apple fully half matured, and said that it was the second crop and that the tree hung full of them. I am sending you a sample in tubular container. Please note the pleasant aronia which it sheds forth, and which soon fills the room. [The apple was received and enjoyed by several of the office force.—Ed. |</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We do not believe that in the incoming age fruit trees will always bear two crops; but these facts are indisputable evidence of the lengthening of the seasons and the advent of the New Age with all its blessings, when frosts and blight will not kill nor insect destroy.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>To Nationalize</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">A</span><span class="font6">T ALMOST the same time, in the same , month </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6"> November, 1921, in two cities thousands of miles apart, two bodies of public men were discussing like conclusions upon a certain important matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In England it is conceded that the coal industry is in a desperate plight. The reparations and indemnities in coal from Germany to France have flooded Europe with the excess of coal which France cannot use, and consequently sells cheap. This has cut the bottom from the British coal market, closed many mining operations, and thrown thousands of miners ont of work. The British mine owners find it unavoidable to cut the wage item in their cost sheet, but the miners realize that they cannot live on the wage offered. They have taken the wage; but the hard times still increasing in Britain, mount up, and the British industries use ever less coal. No one in England knows what to do without a complete change in the economic system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the United States statements are made by reliable authorities of which the following are specimens:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The bituminous industry is as unorganiz»‘d as the retail grocery business.” This is from C. E. Lesher, editor of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Coal Aye. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The unstable condition that now surrounds the industry is costing the country not less than $1 a ton. or $500,000,000 annually.” Thus President Eugene McAuliff, of the Union Collieries Company, indicts the inefficient management of yhe coal mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“This industry considered as a whole is one of theworst functioning industries in theUnitcd States. It is equipped with capital, with machinery, plants, and labor for a peak load at least 20 percent above the average necessity.” So asserts Secretary Herbert Hoover of the Dcpartih^it of Commerce and Labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a profiteering industry, according to President T. H. Watkins, of rhe Pennsylvania Coal &amp;&nbsp;Coke Company, who made the following answers before the La Follette Senate Committee. WheVi asiced as to who caused the increase in prices of coal from $1.55 in 1916 to $2.72 in 1917 — a trifling advance compared with 1920 — Mr. Watkins answered:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Well I should say that it was affected by the market;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>the Coal Mines</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6">it was affected by the abnormal demand, which came into the situation caused by the European war orders.<sup>4</sup> •</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“What do you'mean by market conditions?” the chairman asked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Demand,” said Mr. Watkins. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“You mean the opportunity to sell at higher prices ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>&lt;f</sup>Yes, the market conditions,” </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">was Mr. </span><span class="font6">Watkins' </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">an</span><span class="font6">swer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the moment of answering these questions thousands of miner boys were suffering the horrors of war in the trenches in France and hundreds were pouring out their life-blood, at the call of their country—at $1 per.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is common repute that one West Virginia corporation with a capital of $178,000 made a profit of $478,000 for the first nine months of 1920.” This is from Albert G. Wulson &amp;&nbsp;Co., 198 Broadway, New York, a stock concern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later iu 1920 the coal industry was guilty of the unparalleled profiteering suggested in a recent issue of this publication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A Senate Document—confidential, of course —was distributed in select circles in 1917 entitled “Corporate Earnings and Government Itevenuc”. This disclosed many instances of ' scandalous profits. It is called a breach of ethics to let the American people sec this re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The. Federal Trade Commission, which big business is trying to shackle, reported on the Pittsburg Coal Company:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;It .-to:tvri with a (•iqiin.lizprirr,' oi‘ $1,000. which v-as afterwards ii.erra.'od ;&lt;i S3o.000.nnO — $l0.0&lt;}O,(;i'i0 pivtVrrt &lt;1 and $20 nao.Oofi uf uiinnMi Ptcck. $2n.er&gt;o,-aoa cf this &gt;to&lt;k v.ii' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f..r‘which nothing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">paid.’’ . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the American cord industry the annual fatal “accidents” total 2,500, and the injured total 30.090. or one miner dead for every 262,000 tons of coal. Mining doesn’t pay—for the miner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The miners are given work for an average of only 215 working days a year—the average for thirty years. During the first half of 1921 the miners w-.-re permitted to work only half the time. This in a time when people were crying for coal, r.nd unable to get the money to buy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In London on November 9, 1921, the Miners’ Executive Committee met in London with Premier Lloyd George. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">/mujAX IS, 1322</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The plans of the British Labor Party to meet the coal situation were as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A representative Mining Council to deal with the present emergency and with reorganization of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The providing of specially low-cost coal to set the British industrial world in motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The taking oyer of the coal mines by the Government and their operation as a public utility without profit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The drastic reorganization of existing mines, closing some and developing others, with the extension of the use of machinery and the general improvement of equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The payment of full wage to all the miners working in the mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The stopping of the enormous wastes of the industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The centralization of municipal gas plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The establishment of by-product plants to save the A'aste. and build up a British chemical industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reorganization and centralization, at the mines, of the entire electric light and power industry of Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With this reorganization effected and the coal handled by the Government, it is believed by the Labor Party that Britain can again compete successfully in the world coal market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The other gathering was that of the Public Ownership League on November 22 in Chicago. At this meeting it was advanced by President John Bn.phy, of District No. 2, of the United Mine Workers of America:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Our n-medy against the criminal wa4e of our coal deposit.® and of our human resources is Nationalization of the Minvs- The miners 4and for nationalization and democratic management of the mines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Bevau®•» the mines nationalized will be worked more economically;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“BecauMj nationalization will mean coal to the people </span><span class="font6">at </span><span class="font5">reasonable prices:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Because only in this way can the coal resources of the nation conserved for the future;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Because only under nationalization, freed from the profit motive, can the industry call out to the full the skill. the interest and the experience of the mine worker;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5"><sup>4</sup>‘Because only in this way can the miner feel that </span><span class="font6">he has </span><span class="font5">a sh.ireHn tHr industry and that his work is for </span><span class="font6">the </span><span class="font5">service of tht people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The operators oppose nationalization. In order to discover who is advocating the right remedy, we ask all to cooperate with us in making all the facts available to the public. We ask immediate legislation for centralized, continuous and compulsory fact-finding in the coal industry. If nationalization would be detrimental to the public interest, as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">opentm</span><span class="font6"> maintain, we do not see why they should fear to give the public all the statistics at their command.<sup>0</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Nationalization not merely of the mines but of many other industries, is undoubtedly one of the next steps that will be taken by the people in various countries in their endeavor- to right the affairs of man that are so woefully wrong. Thia might succeed, if it had the hearty cooperation of all classes, and especially of the more able and clever men who have been drawn for their abilities into the various industries. These men for personal interest, and many of them from a conviction inculcated by environment and training that the nationalization program is utterly subversive of all that is good, will not support or aid the project. Their elever opposition and hindering will wreck the well-meant plans of the worker. Such action will do the wreckers no good, but will accelerate the rush toward chaos, which might be stopped if all hands should in a kindly, brotherly spirit observe the Golden itule in all these affairs, and work for everybody instead of for Number One.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reorganization of all industries upon the best possible lines will come, but it is reserved for the Golden Age and for men who will find pleasure in devoting themselves to the service of all the people, not for selfish gain, but from a sincere desire for the universal good.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Facts About Vaccination </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">g.</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> del Pino</span></h4>
<p><span class="font13">W</span><span class="font6">HETHER the theory or theories about vaccination, published in the Golden Age of April 27th, as submitted to you by me are correct or not, remains to be seen. But leaving theories out of consideration for the present. I wish briefly to state some facts in re the matter for rhe sake of some incredulous readers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a well-known fact that before calf-lymph (vaccine) was discovered smallpox used to claim thousands of victims during epidemics, apart from the endemic and sporadic havoc. Last year in this town of Glasgow there was an epidemic of smallpox. I was careful to notice the statistics as published by the Medical Officer of Health of this city. And although I have not the actual figures with me at the moment, it is a matter of coiinnon knowledge to everyone who read the papers that the disease hardly attacked •the vaccinated, or if attacked the patients recovered comparatively easily; whilst in the ease of the non-vaccina ted who were affected by the trouble they either succumbed to the disease or only recovered with great difficulty. To emphasize those facts I wish to mention a recent ease which I have been treating with detoxicated vaccine. This patient has been a sufferer of chronic g----for about six years. He has been</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">treated both by other doctors and myself in the ordinary way and has tried all other treatments without much good. I suggested these vaccines and gave him a course of twelve injections wiih-in two mouths, with the result that he feels quite cured and all previous symptoms have vanished. Whether the cure will he permanent or not. I cannot tell. Iu any case, for the time being, he feels quite well. The question arises: Why does he feel so well after the vaccine injections?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a well-known fact that thousands of lives have been saved by diphtheria antitoxin serum. If this serum had no curative qualities, how have these lives been saved physically that were about to^cease licfore the serum was injected!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The same facts are exhibited in the ease of snake venom. Many people die, or used to die, al'ii-r being bitten by stakes. Now we have the cobra antitoxin taken from the reptile's teeth, which whmSnjerted into a person bitten by the same speciejtof animal at once counteracts the STU'ik 's</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All these are it.ooFb that the animal organism of man as well as that of the lower animals is highly specialized ; and that in perfect health the organism is capable of forming, almost instantaneously, anti-substances which at once destroy whatever poisons or germs enter the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I myself have personally noticed that after an attack of coryza or influenza at the beginning of winter, I seldom am troubled with a second attack the same winter. This is a proof of the ‘ theory’’ that anti-bodies are formed in the system, as the result of the original iugostiou of micro-organisms or their toxins into the system. The body has the power to form these anti-toxins, if' healthy; but if weakened by whatever cause, the opsonic index is lowered, and the body is liable to suffer under the toxic products of the causative agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">T am not one of those who stick-in-thc-mnd or one who does not favor <sup>n</sup>light and truth”, as w*dl as progress in all things. Theories are very good: but facts are better. And if facts attest the reasonableness of theories, then theories become very valuable adjuncts to real progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a very short-sighted perspective to condemn true science because some have either mad&lt;- mistakes in the preparation of substances, or more probably. failed to take precautions in their administration. Personally, I can truthfully say that as yet I have not had a single case (in ordinary vaccination) complaining of either a sore arm. etc., or any other complication. Carefulness mid cleanliness in administration &lt;»f va&lt;-«-invs seem to be the secret of success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">S</span><span class="font6">TEEL traps are costing us the conscience and finer feelings of our boys and young mon. While we are represented at a peace parley at Washington, wp are, by the use and abuse of stool traps, educating our boys for warriors. Can wp afford to continue this awful torture of the lower animals! Often men attend church, while they have animals in their traps in freezing weather writhing with pain. Said a hunter to me: “Why is it that we like to hit and cripple game, though we do not kill it?” “Because.” I replied, “Wo value our marksmanship above our humanity.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">■ And so, in this time of “capital vs. labor”, with many votes in sight, a listening ear is lent to the side that is of most interest, even though the contest may not be between labor and capital: for the writer believes it to be a triangular contest, with the commonwealth between the upper and nether mill-stones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. About the beginning of the Civil War people had found it more profitable to dig wells alongside of Oil Creek, in Pennsylvania, than to skiin the oil off the surface of the creek for sale as medicine. The wells yielded copiously, and soon a fight was set up. It was not a fight between capital and labor, but it was in the criminal gang of adventurers who were exploiting the wells. Murders were of daily occurrence, and &quot;&quot;&nbsp;robberies were occurring hourly. It was then that a young man named Rockefeller appeared. He had a limited amount of money <sub>r</sub> but an extensive vision. He corralled these outlaws, formed a company, sank deeper wells, and began refining oil. They all got rich: some were prudent enough to save, hut others were not. Kerosene (from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">keros,</span><span class="font6"> light) was one of the first distillates marketed. We had been paying $1.15 a gallon for kerosene, which was distilled from cannel coal, imported. Soon we were getting kerosene for eight cents a gallon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The writer then regarded Rockefeller — whom he lias never seen—as a benefactor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">, Now, if we have the courage to be guided by results, by the testimony of facts, we may arrive at something to the advantage of the commonwealth. We have abundant proof that poor boys of the last generation are among the rich men bt.this. The brainy men of this generation were the* poor boys of the last. Take the Congressional Directory, and see what a number of Senators and Members were once poor boys, and are self-made. Is there a reason for this! They were all bom equal, in a constitutional sense. Th^rich man’s son has the advantage of early education which gives him a better start But he does not always succeed, even measurably. Whyf</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* Well, we are all creatures of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">habit </span><span class="font6">The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rich</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">boy soon learns to spend; the poor boy is forced to earn, and has no time to spend. The rich man’s son succeeds to the father’s business* always knows more about it than the old man, and soon the chief clerk is one of the firm. Then the chief clerk becomes the owner; and the rich man’s son has the experience, and his money is gone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Like all of God’s creatures, the very rich man. like Carnegie, must die, and his fortune be divided; it does not take many years for that wealth to vanish. I cannot see that there is any permanent danger in great fortunes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The framers of the Constitution were unanimous on one subject, and that was “man, vested with great power, for a long time, is bound to abuse that power”. Those wise men did not specify any particular class of “man”, but evidently meant the kind of man that God made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Congress, in former years, seemed to be on the alert to prevent the creation of a privileged class, and the only pei'sons who apparently had inherited that ambition were the rich fellows, the millionaires. When such a nabob employed a large number of men, he was generally a favorite with political aspirants. But times have changed: and now that the “hands” have federated, the votes may be obtained without reference to the employer, but to the Union Leaders instead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Things </span><span class="font6">aint </span><span class="font5">always what </span><span class="font6">they seem;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Skimmed milk masquerades </span><span class="font6">as cream.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the sobriquet of “Labor”, the fdea is gathered that th^y are mechanics, the producers of high-class articles of commerce, and are all skilled artisans. The old trades unions were such, but today it is almost impossible to find a good all-around machinist or smith, and hard to find an all-around good mechanic in any trade. The old trades unions protected the trade, the workman, and the employer. Today the soi-dis* ant [self-styled] workman alone is protected. There has never been any provision* since the federation, for scaled wages nor obligation to “tote fair” with the employer. It is said that there are today 50,000 high salaried officers in the federation, and that the chief of that government receives as much salary as a Cabinet officer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ministers of the gospel who have been round-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">*B16 ly condemned for espousing, the cause of faddists, such as prohibition, disarmament, suffrage for the girls, eta., say that the pressure s on them to espouse those causes is overwhelming. Many of them have lost caste, many have lost respect, and they have damaged their holy calling. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It would be a Utopia here, could we divide the world’s wealth equally among us, provided we were all balanced well enough to use the wealth economically, to be able to avoid excess, and all be willing to share in the toil. Each class of men believes its own plan, is the best. and. would fight to the bitter end the innovations of the other class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The soi-disant labor “unions” believe they have created the wealth, and that it should be theirs. The Soviets in Russia tried this: they . confiscated a factory, put the old hands to work, • and soon were in confusion for want of superintendence. They wen* obliged to search for the Ttu n/cr su|m■ riut&lt;*mlent..and to pay him his salary: and very soon ids old staff was around him and 1 lie factory running much as it had run in tlie time of the ('/.ar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The labor “unions’* neVer “shoot up” a strike. While w&lt;* agree that a man has the right to n'fnsc inadequate wages, or even to strike, he has no riudit to prevent another man from taking a job ho has abandoned. Here is the crux of the whole trouble. Men who have been called “strike breakers&quot; have b&lt;»ejrassaulted, maimed, ami mutilated. The union nieii disclaim any hand in that, and the arrests seem to show the “shooters” are merely syni|mthiz&lt;*rs. But it is a long lane that has no turn. The Washington </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font6"> M* May 13, 1915, records the court proceedings in a New York court in which it was shown that Mr. Benjamin Fein. alias Poppy Bonny, testified that he, as chief of a gang, was in the employ of a labor union, with a retainer of $15 a day, to keep in readiness a gang of men to “shoot up” at strikes.

<p><span class="font6">“Thesd forms of taxation were described by other &amp;• speakers, one of whom advocated taxation at the rate ■ of 100 percent on all incomes in excess of $100,000 a year, while others urged the imposing of taxes of SO percent or more </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">on such</span><span class="font6"> incomes, on excess profits, and on unimproved lands.’’</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">cleansed, and highly productive soil for man's needs in the Golden Age, it is particularly interesting to look at the experiments of the lat»* Electoral Print-’* Carl von Eckhartshausen, o' Munich. Bavaria. This gentleman succeeded in isolating the corrupting dements from the soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(I) A flower pot was filled with earth which had hem cleansed according to his proscription; then a single grain of wheat was laid in the pot and tin* whole was placed in the open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There were much quicker signs of life in the seed and a more rapid growth than is the case in ordinary earth; and one hundred heath of wheat sprouted from this single grain, which exceeded in thickness, size, and beauty the kernels of all known varieties of wheat. The individual kernels had such a self-contained and beautiful golden color that one would have sworn them to be overlaid with the finest of gold</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The taste of the grains was sweeter and more pleasant than that of ordinary wheat, and they lacked that gummy and pasty consistency, which wheat flour generally leaves on the tongue. Chemical analysis showed that the mucilaginous quality, gluten, was missing. This quality it is that causes fermentation and putrefaction of • flour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) A hen was fed for nearly two months</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">exclusively on pellets made from this flour and on water, and then killed. An examination of the blood showed no trace of fibrinogen Xblood gluten), which is the cause of rapid putrefaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ Moreover, the blood did not coagulate, but remained liquid and fresh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(3) Likewise, quite noteworthy experiences were had with flaxseed and its products. Flax grown in this soil was of hitherto unknown beauty and strength, and it would not burn with the readiness of that grown in other soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This soil, virgin in every respect, had several other very wonderful qualities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) Worms and insects brought into contact</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">with it crawled away with all the speed at their *“ command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(5) The observation was also made that when two parts of cleansed earth were mixed with one <sup>r</sup>‘ part of common earth and the whole saturated with water, the uncleansed third underwent a change and became clean, the non-conformable elements disappearing by vaporization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These experiments demonstrate the possibility of a chemical improvement of the soil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">I</span><span class="font6">N Rochelle Park, New Jersey, twenty-five men were brought into court last winter for failure to remove the snow from their sidewalks. It was on a Sunday, and when the cases came up they were dismissed because it appeared from the statutes that it was illegal<sub>}</sub>to hear theiV^ses on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mayor Charles P. Gillen, of Newark, N. J., speaking of the efforts to reestablish the blue laws in his city said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;I believe Sunday movies are a great thing — the only form tof recreation within the reach of the poor on their day of rest. What would these so-called reformers have them ao—remain in-doors all day Sunday looking out on fire-escapes and family washes hanging on the clothes-line? The rich can ride in their limousines on Sunday, play golf, and indulge in other pleasures that only they can afford. But I don't intend that the poor shall be deprived of their little pleasures, no matter what these Blue Law reformers think about it&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Doctor Charles Townsend, Rector of the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd, Rosemont, Philadelphia, is another sensible man. In a sermon July 10, 1921, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is not the purpose of religion to act as a moral policeman. It is not the purpose of religion to lay down a set of rules to be followed by the people, to say what people must do and what they must not do. When religion is made an excuse for trying to force human ideas of morality or laws upon the people it loses its power, and the great need of the world ia real religion and not moral regulation.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Reverend Samuel Eliot, D. D., LL. D., of Boston, is of the same opinion as Doctor Townsend. He says of American Christianity:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“It is not an infant industry. It does not have to be sheltered b</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ehin</span><span class="font6">d repressive ordinances or promoted by petty inquisitions. A healthy church does not ask the aid of title police authorities to dose up rival attractions and give it a monopoly of Sunday. It is grotesque to assume that the restriction of Sunday recreations and the closing of places of amusement will direct people into the churches.<sup>v</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font6">*’AU dominion rightly belongs to Jehovah. He had given man dominion over the things of earth. Lucifer observed Adam and Eve, the perfect ones, in Edon: and knowing that they were endowed with authority from Jehovah to multiply and fill the earth, he conceived the thought in his own heart or mind that lie should have a dominion of his own, and that he could have this.by separating man from God and by inducing him to come under his (Satan's) dominion. The prophet Isaiah gives us some light upon this FiihjxH-t when he says: “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning I how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine Heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above tlm heights of the cloud&gt;; 1 will he like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit.’’—Isaiah 14: 12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup>“Thus we see that Satan had an ambitious desire to be like the Most High. God manifested Ills justice toward Lucifer by expelling him from Flis presence and has decreed that he shall bo ultimately destroyed. (Ezekiel 28:14-13: Hebrews 2:14) When Lucifer was expelled from the presence of Jehovah because of Ju's wickedness, he thereafter was and is known by the names of dragon, that old serpent, the devil, and Satan. (Revelation 12:9) Tn Genesis 3 he is snoken of as the serpent. The name dragon moans devouror; Satan menus adversary; devil moans slanderer: while serpent moans deceiver: and all these names indicate the characteristics of Sa£an, the evil one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“According io the Genesis account, the old serpent, the devil, deceived Eve in this' manner: As wo have heretofore observed, Jehovah had told Adam and Eve that they must not eat of a certain tr&lt;f in Eden, known as the tree of knowledge of g^od and evil. Appearing to mother Eve in the' capacity of a serpent, a deceiver, the devil said to her in effect: 'Hath God said that ye shall not eat of every tree in F.denT’ To this question Eve responded: “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the xnidst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die'*. The old serpent, the devil, replied: A’e shall not surely die: for God doth know’ that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and \’h shall he as gods, knowing good and evil&quot;. In oilier words, he told Eve that Jehovah was trying tn keep her and her husband in ignorance ami thus take-advantage of them. Doubtless the devil himself ate of the fruit in the presence of Eve and then delilieratoly lied to her by saying: “Ye shall not surely die’*—God knows that you will not die. And by this moans lie induced mother Eve to eat of the fruit— which wtis a violation of God's law. We know that Saran is a liar, bi Hinse Jesus said of him: “He was a uiiirdvrer from the beginning, and abod&lt;* not in tie* truth, because there is no truth in him. Wh»*n hr speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: fur hr is a liar, and the father of it.*'’ —John S:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>45</sup>The fact that Eve was deceived and thereby induced to violate- the law of God in no wise changed the law or affected its enforcement. Adam dr)ilioratcly ate of the fruit and he was also in the transgression.—L Timothy 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Afb-r they had violator! Jehovah's law, Adam and Evo bid amongst the trees in Eden. Jehovah-spoke to Adam and asked: ‘’Hast thou oaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not oat?” Adam responded that Eve had given him the fruit to eat; and Eve said that thr serpent had deceived her. they lx&gt;rh stood before Jehovah and confessed their guilt. The majesty of the law of Jehovah must l&gt;e npheld.His lawl&gt;eingunchangoablo( Hebrews 6:18). there remained nothing to do but to enforce that law. Then Jehovah pronounced His judgment against them, the record of which reads: ‘'Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception: in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire -hall Im? to thy husband, and he shall rule</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FknUA&amp;T 13, 1022</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">over thee. And unto Adam he rsaid, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is lli-’ ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou tat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and ?tln»u shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it was thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.&quot;—Genesis 3:16-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'•’Thus the perfect man forfeit' d his life. He had been endowed with perfection of home, liberty, peace, happiness, and life everlasting on earth. Now he must die and return to the dust from whence he was taken. God did not put him to death immediately, but permitted him to have 9‘'0 year* of experience that he might learn the han&lt;4*til effects of sin. Eden contained perfect food that would have sustained the perfect man and he would not have died had he remained in Eden, unless Jehovah had put Aim to death in some direct manner. But God drove him out of Eden, tuok him away from the perfect food, canned him to gather his food from among the thorns and thistles and from other imperfect elements of the earth that were found outside of Eden: and in Jthis condition he continued to sicken and to die until at the end of the period of 930 years he was dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">**A kind and loving parent sometimes indicts punishment upon a child because the child has violated a rule. The parent punishes the child not because he loves to seo the child suffer, but for the good of the child, in order that it might be disciplined and might learn the proper les-‘<sup>r</sup>ms. If the child always did good and never did evil it would not merit nor receive any punishment from a loving parent. Ono of the chief purposes of Jehovah in dealing with mankind in the manner He docs deal with them is that hunjmikind might be disciplined and learn the lessofiKpf good and the effect of doing wrong, and thus learn to appreciate the love of the heavenly Father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;When God sentenced-our first parents to death and drove them out of Eden, He had in mind ana had already planned for their future blessing, &quot;Ms we will see upon a further examination of His plan. Hence it was love that prompted His action in sentencing Adam to die. Every act of Jehovah is prompted by love; for God is love. He always acts that good may result. The manifestation of His strict justice was essential that the dignity and greatness of Jehovah might be maintained. At the same time, in so doing, love was the motive that prompted His action. It must have brought sorrow to the heart of Jehovah to he compelled thus to pun* ish His creatures, because God takes no pleasure in evil things: yet haring in mind tlie ultimate blessing and restoration of them, there would be pleasure in thus manifesting justice that ultimate good might result.</span></p>
