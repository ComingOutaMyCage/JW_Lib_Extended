<h1><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font25"><a name="bookmark2"></a>THE PURPOSE OF THIS HANDBOOK</span></h1>
<p><span class="font19">Health care for children of Jehovah’s Witnesses at times presents a challenge to the medical community. However, our refusal of blood transfusions, founded on deep religious convictions, does not make us antimedicine. On the contrary, Jehovah’s Witnesses accept most medical treatments and surgical procedures available. We cherish health and love life. That is why we seek medical care for our families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Physicians occasionally feel that a child’s life or health will be seriously threatened if blood is not given. Most likely, treatment involving blood will conflict with the wishes of the Witness parents. Physicians and others may be inclined to take action to force a blood transfusion. However, before any decision is made in such a serious matter, certainly all the pertinent facts need to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Therefore, we are making this publication available to professionals (physicians, judges, social workers, and others) who may become involved in health-care decisions involving children of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">This handbook will acquaint you with</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">♦ Jehovah’s Witnesses as a people noted for the love and care given to their children</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">♦ a worldwide network of Hospital Liaison Committees that assist families of Jehovah’s Witnesses and the medical community to resolve problems that can arise pertaining to the use of blood</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">♦ the standards of treatment and the most up-to-date medications and surgical procedures that experienced physicians are using to treat children when nonblood alternatives are requested</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">We are confident that this family care and medical management program will benefit our children, the parents, and the physicians in providing optimum care without violating our strong religious convictions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">The names and telephone numbers of the members of the Hospital Liaison Committee for Jehovah’s Witnesses in your area are shown on the last page of this section. In a medical emergency involving one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, please get in touch with a member of this committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Local Congregation Elders: In all congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a body of elders functions to provide needed spiritual and emotional support to each member, each family, on a weekly basis. These elders know best the convictions of the Witness patient and can better communicate with the patient. This has often helped eliminate misunderstandings, thus facilitating application of acceptable treatment by physicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The Hospital Liaison Committee Network: These committees in all major cities are composed of trained and experienced professionals who act as a liaison between the doctor and the Witness patient at the patient's request. Their services are programmed to solve problems that arise when physicians feel blood is necessary. They support the family and the attending physician by locating doctors and medical teams experienced in nonblood management techniques. There are more than 25,000 physicians around the world (more than 12,000 in the United States alone) who are cooperating in utilizing such alternative medical strategies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Hospital Liaison Committee members have extensive information on available alternatives to blood transfusion therapy. They maintain a file of up-to-date articles on nonblood management strategies from respected medical literature that can be made readily available to the attending physician. They may also assist in transferring a patient. The expanding network of more than 160 of these committees in the United States and Canada (more than 800 throughout the world) has already proved very useful to doctors and patients alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Hospital Information Desk: At most branches of the Watch Tower Society around the world (see title page), personnel are assigned to care for medical emergencies. They are equipped with a listing of cooperative physicians in their respective countries and a file of medical alternatives. Each branch is networked with other branches for expanding the available pool of cooperative physicians where necessary. Committee members also are ready to arrange for transfer of a patient from one hospital to another within the country or from one country to another where this may be required in unusual cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Hospital Information Services: This department at the international headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Brooklyn, New York, coordinates the work of the Hospital Liaison Committees and branches in caring for medical emergencies. It researches a vast medical data base regularly in order to supply Hospital Liaison Committees, as well as cooperative doctors, risk managers, some hospital and medical associations, and others, with up-to-date information of the very latest in alternatives to donor blood, transfusion risks, new surgical techniques, and the latest in medications that assist in maintaining an adequate hematocrit and in controlling hemorrhage. To meet emergency situations, this department maintains an extensive data base of articles on medical alternatives to blood products and provides an international fax service to Hospital Liaison Committees, individual doctors, hospitals, and social workers to give needed nonblood care for Witness patients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">We sincerely urge you to take full advantage of this reservoir of up-to-date medical information, the skilled services of the Hospital Liaison Committees, and other support services for providing the best medical care for Jehovah’s Witnesses and their children. From our experience we are convinced these initiatives will greatly minimize negative confrontations and maximize positive cooperation between Jehovah’s Witnesses and the dedicated members of the medical profession.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16">This legal directive is an exercise of my right to accept or to refuse medical treatment in accord with my deeply held values and convictions.

I am years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">I also know that there are various dangers associated with blood transfusions. So I have decided to avoid such dangers and, instead, to accept whatever risks may seem to be involved in my choice of alternative nonblood management.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES’ RELIGIOUS POSITION ON MEDICAL THERAPY</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Jehovah’s Witnesses avail themselves of the various medical skwills to assist them with their health problems. They do not adhere to so-called faith healing and are certainly not opposed to the practice of medicine. They love life and want to do whatever is reasonable and Scriptural to prolong it. (For a detailed discussion of the following subjects, see the Watch Tower publications cited.)</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark24"></a>ABORTION</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Deliberately induced abortion simply to avoid the birth of an unwanted child is the willful taking of human life. If (at the time of childbirth) a choice must be made between the life of the mother and that of the child, it is up to the individuals concerned to make that decision.—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures, </span><span class="font19">pp.25-6.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark26"></a>AUTOTRANSFUSION</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Autotransfusion</span><span class="font19"> is acceptable to many of Jehovah’s Witnesses (this being a matter of conscience) when the equipment is arranged in a closed circuit that is constantly linked to the patient’s circulatory system and there is no storage of the patient’s blood. Jehovah’s Witnesses do not accept </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">preoperative collection, storage, and later reinfusion of blood—The Watchtower,</span><span class="font19"> March 1, 1989, pp. 30-1; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?,</span><span class="font19"> pp. 13-15.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark28"></a>BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Jehovah’s Witnesses have definite objections to blood transfusions for both religious and medical reasons. They are deeply religious people who believe that blood transfusion is forbidden by Biblical commands such as: “Only flesh with its soul—its blood—you must not eat’’ (Genesis 9:3,4), “[You must] pour its blood out and cover it with dust” (Leviticus 17:13, 14), and, “Keep abstaining from ... blood and from things strangled and from fornication.” (Acts 15:28, 29)—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font19"> June 1, 1990, pp. 30-1; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?,</span><span class="font19"> pp. 4-6; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures,</span><span class="font19"> pp. 70-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">While these verses of the Bible are not stated in medical terms, Witnesses view them as ruling out transfusion of whole blood, packed red blood cells, and plasma, as well as white blood cells and platelet administration. However, Witnesses’ religious understanding does not absolutely prohibit the use of components such as albumin, immune globulins, and hemophiliac preparations; each Witness must decide individually whether he will accept these.—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font19"> June 1, 1990, pp. 30-1; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Journal of the American Medical Association</span><span class="font19"> (JAMA), November 27, 1991, Vol. 246, No. 21, p. 2471.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark30"></a>HEART BYPASS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Some Witness patients permit the use of a heart-lung machine when the pump is primed with nonblood fluids and blood is not stored in the process.—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font19"> March 1, 1989, pp. 30-1; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?,</span><span class="font19"> p. 15.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark32"></a>HEMODIALYSIS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Hemodialysis is a matter for each Witness patient to decide conscientiously if a closed circuit is employed, if no blood prime is used, and if there is no blood storage.—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font19">March 1,1989, pp. 30-1.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark34"></a>HEMODILUTION</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Induced hemodilution is a matter for the Witness patient to decide according to his conscience when a closed circuit is used and no blood storage is involved. Jehovah’s Witnesses do not accept preopcrative collection and storage of blood and its later transfusion.—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font19"> March 1,1989, pp. 30-1; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?,</span><span class="font19"> pp. 3-5,15.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark36"></a>ORGAN TRANSPLANT</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">While the Bible forbids consuming blood, there is no Biblical command specifically forbidding the taking in of other human tissue or bone. For this reason, each individual faced with making a decision on this matter should carefully and prayerfully weigh matters and then decide conscientiously what to do before God. It is a matter for personal decision.—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font19">March 15,1980, p. 31; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?,</span><span class="font19"> p. 28.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark38"></a>SERUMS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Serums are not forbidden; however, an individual Witness may stwill conscientiously refuse them. The same applies to albumin as a minor component of blood.—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font19"> June 1, 1990, pp. 30-1.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark40"></a>VOLUME EXPANDERS</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Nonblood expanders are acceptable to Witness patients. (See Advance Medical Directive/Rclease.)—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures,</span><span class="font19"> pp. 73-4.</span></p>

<p><span class="font25">SELECTED ARTICLES FROM PUBLICATIONS OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The family unit is very important to Jehovah's Witnesses. Witness parents love their children and want them to grow up to enjoy productive and meaningful lives. A comprehensive educational program is conducted in each congregation to help families develop such desirable values as honesty, morality, integrity, and dependability. The Bible shows this is necessary to please God. The Bible also requires abstinence from blood. (Acts 15:28, 29) Witness parents seek medical care for themselves and their children and ask physicians to use alternatives to blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Keeping God’s approval and having a good conscience are very important to Jehovah’s Witnesses, religiously and psychologically, and they ask that others respect these sincere aspirations. Witness parents believe God’s promise that those who are obedient to him have the hope of everlasting life on our earth restored to a paradise. They want this inheritance for their children also.—2 Peter 3:13; Revelation 21:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In this section of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Family Care,</span><span class="font19"> we invite you to examine a sampling of articles (titles below) specially prepared for use in family education.</span></p>

<p><span class="font32">Families</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;">Draw Close Before It's Too Late</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Family is the oldest human institution. In many ways it is the most important. It is society's most basic unit. Entire civilizations have survived or disappeared, depending on whether family life was strong or weak.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—The World Book Encyclopedia</span><span class="font6"> (1973 Ed it ion).</span></p>
<p><span class="font33">T</span><span class="font17">HE family unit is an umbrella of protection for children. In many places today, that umbrella is full of holes; in many other places, it’s being closed and stuck in the closet. The traditional family is frequently sidetracked as outmoded. Television comedies often portray fathers as ninnies, mothers as smarter, but children know best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Marital infidelity is commonplace. In some industrialized countries, one of every two first marriages ends in divorce. As divorces escalate, single families proliferate. In increasing numbers, two become one without benefit of marriage. Homosexuals seek to dignify their relation with marital vows. Sex, normal and abnormal, takes center stage in movies and videos. Schools view chastity as impractical and pass out condoms to make fornication safe—which they don't. Sexually transmitted diseases and teenage pregnancies skyrocket. Babies are the victims—if they are allowed to come to birth. With the demise of the traditional family, children are the primary losers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Years ago, Nobel prize winner Alexis Carrel, in his book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Man, the Unknown,</span><span class="font17"> sounded this warning: “Modern society has committed a serious mistake by entirely substituting the school for the familial training. The mothers abandon their children to the kindergarten [sooner now, with day care and preschool) in order to attend to their careers, their social ambitions, their sexual pleasures, their literary or artistic fancies, or simply to play bridge, go to the cinema, and waste their time in busy idleness. They are, thus, responsible for the disappearance of the familial group where the child was kept in contact with adults and learned a great deal from them.... In order to reach his full strength, the individual requires the relative isolation and the attention of the restricted social group consisting of the family.&quot;—Page I76.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">More recently, comedian Steve Allen commented on television’s assault on the family, with its preoccupation with foul language and sexual immorality. He said: “The flow is carrying us all along right into the sewer. The very sort of language parents forbid their children to use is now being encouraged not only by anything-goes cable entrepreneurs, but the once high-minded networks. Shows that depict children and others using vulgar language only point up the collapse of the American family.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">What legacy is society now leaving to its children? Read the papers, watch television, note the videos, tune in the evening news, listen to the rap music, see the adult examples everywhere around you. Children are glutted on mental and emotional junk food. “If you want to destroy a country,” former British education secretary Sir Keith Joseph said, “you debauch its currency.” And he added: “The way to destroy a society is to debauch the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! September 22,1991 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">children.” “Debauch,&quot; according to </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Webster's, </span><span class="font17">means “to lead away from virtue or excellence.” That is being done with a vengeance today. Much is said about juvenile delinquency; more should be said about adult delinquency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">They Will Come Back to Haunt Us</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Geneva B. Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Family Service America, said in a lecture delivered earlier this year: “The family is deeply, perhaps fatally, will.&quot; Calling it a “grim picture for many of our children,” she then said forebodingly: “The willingness of the nation to relegate so many of our poorly housed, poorly fed, poorly treated medically, and poorly educated children to the role of outcasts in a rich society is going to come back to haunt us.” It is already coming back to haunt us. You can read about it in the newspapers, hear about it on the newscasts, and see it on your television set. Here is a small sampling:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Judonne pulls out a gun and shoots Jermaine three times in the chest. Jermaine is dead; he was 15. Judonne is 14. They had been best friends. They argued over a girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">One hundred people gather at the funeral of 16-year-old Michael Hwilliard. He was shot in the back of the head as he walked away from an argument at a basketball game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In Brooklyn, New York, three teenagers set fire to a homeless couple. When rubbing alcohol didn't work, they tried gasoline. It worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In Florida a five-year-old pushed a toddler to his death from a fifth-floor stairwell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In Texas a ten-year-old took a gun and shot his playmate and stuffed his body under the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In Georgia a 15-year-old boy stabbed his principal while being disciplined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In New York City, a gang in their late teens and early 20’s, armed with bats, pipes, axes, knives, and a meat cleaver, went “wilding” near a settlement of homeless men, injuring many and leaving one with his throat slashed. Motive? One investigator explained: “They were getting their jollies attacking the homeless.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">in Detroit, Michigan, an Il-year-old boy joined a 15-year-old in raping a 2-year-old girl They allegedly left their victim in a garbage Dumpster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In Cleveland, Ohio, four boys ages six to nine raped a nine-year-old girl at an elementary school. Commenting on this, columnist Brent Larkin, writing in the Cleveland </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Plain Dealer</span>, said: “It speaks volumes about what’s happening in this country, about how our value systems are headed straight for the sewer.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Dr. Leslie Fisher, a professor of psychology at Cleveland State University, blamed television. He called it “a big sex machine,” and “kids 8 and 9 years old are watching these things.” He also blamed parents for the deterioration of the American family: “Mommy and daddy are too involved in their own problems and can’t take the time to tend their children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! September 22 1991</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Garbage In, Garbage Out</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Various elements in society, especially the media, entertainers, and the entertainment industry—elements that profit by pandering to the worst in humanity—disgorge sex and violence and corruption and thereby contribute heavily to the degradation of the young and the family. So the rule goes into operation: Sow rot, reap rot. Garbage in, garbage out. The chickens are coming home to roost—and the homecoming is horrendous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Is society breeding a generation of children without conscience? The question was raised after the notorious “wilding” spree in New York’s Central Park where a 28-year-old woman was beaten and raped and left for dead by a roving gang of teenagers. Police said they were “smug and remorseless” and when arrested “joked and rapped and sang.” They gave reasons for doing it: “It was fun,” “We were bored,” “It was something to do.” </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Time </span><span class="font17">magazine called them “psychic amputees&quot; who had “lost, perhaps never developed, that psychic appendage we call conscience.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">U.SJIews &amp;&nbsp;World Report</span><span class="font17"> urged: “This nation must act to avoid another generation of the children without conscience.” Dr. Ken Magid, a prominent psychologist, and Carole McKelvey highlight that very danger in their explosive book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">High Risk: Children Without a Conscience.</span><span class="font17"> Case histories and testimony from many psychologists and psychiatrists give overwhelming support to Magid’s contention: The root cause is a failure of strong bonding between parent and child at birth and in the formative years that follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Surely, families must draw close during those formative years before it’s too late!</span></p>
<p><span class="font32">Love at First Sight</span></p>
<p><span class="font28" style="font-weight:bold;">And Forever After!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN </span><span class="font17">YOU watch babies after they are born,&quot; notes Dr. Cecilia McCarton, </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">JL </span><span class="font17">of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, “they are exquisitely awake and tuned into their environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">They are responsive to their mothers. They turn toward sounds. And they fixate on their mother’s face.&quot; And the mother makes eye contact with her baby. It’s love at first sight —for both of them!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! September 22,1991</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This moment of bonding between mother and baby happens naturally if the birth is natural, without drugs that dull the senses of mother and baby. His cries stimulate her production of milk. The touch of his skin against hers releases a hormone that reduces her postdelivery bleeding. The child is born with brain programs to ensure attachment—crying, sucking, babblings and gurglings, smiling and ecstatic kickings to entice mother's attentions. Attachment, to the mother primarily, makes it possible for the infant to develop a sense of love and caring and trust. The father quickly becomes important as an attachment figure. His relations lack the intimacy of the mother’s but add an important dimension: poking, tickling, gentle roughhousing, which the baby responds to with excited laughter and wigglings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Dr. Richard Restak reports that for the newborn to be held and cuddled is like a nutrient. “Touch,” he says, “is as necessary to normal infant development as food and oxygen. Mother opens her arms to the infant, snuggles him, and a host of psychobiological processes are brought into harmony.” Under this treatment even the physical brain develops “a different physiognomy of bumps and crevices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Guard Against Detachment</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some have indicated that if this attachment between mother and baby does not take place at the time of birth, tragedy lies ahead. Not so. With loving mothering there are hundreds of intimate moments in the weeks that follow that make bonding secure. Denial of such intimacies over a longer period of time, however, can lead to dire consequences. “Although we all need one another throughout our lives,” Dr. Restak tells us, “that needing is most acute in the first year. Deprive a baby of light, the opportunity to gaze at a human face, the delight of being picked up, cuddled, cooed at, fussed over, touched—and the infant doesn’t abide such deprivations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Babies cry for many reasons. Usually they want attention. If their cries are not responded to after a time, they may stop. They feel that their care-giver is not responding. They cry again. If still no response, they feel neglected, insecure. They try harder. If this goes on for a longer time and if it is repeated frequently, the baby feels abandoned. It is first angry, even enraged, and finally it gives up. Detachment occurs. Not receiving love, it does not learn to love. Conscience is undeveloped. It trusts no one, cares for no one. It becomes a problem child and, in extreme cases, a psychopathic personality incapable of feeling remorse for criminal acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Love at first sight is not the end of it. It must continue forever after. Not just in words but also in deeds. “Let us love, neither in word nor with the tongue, but in deed and truth.” (1 John 3:18) Lots of hugs and kisses. Early on, before it’s too late, teach and instruct in the true values of God’s Word, the Bible. Then it will be with your children as it was with Timothy: “From infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to make you wise.” (2 Timothy 3:15) Daily spend time with them, throughout childhood and the teen years. “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.” —Deuteronomy 6:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">'We May Cry, but It’s for the Best'</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Discipline is a touchy subject for many. When properly administered, however, it is an essential part of parental love. One little girl recognized this. She made a card for her mother, addressed “To Ma, To a Nice Lady.” It was decorated with crayon drawings of a golden</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! September 22,1991</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A close bond with the mother helps the baby to develop emotionally</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">sun, flying birds, and red flowers. The card read: “This is for you because we ail love you. We want to show our appreciation by making a card. When we have low marks you sign our paper. When we’re bad you smack us. We may cry, but we know it’s for the best.... All 1 want to say is that I love you very, very much. Thanks for all you do for me. Love and kisses. [Signed] Michele.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Michele agrees with Proverbs 13:24: “The one holding back his rod is hating his son, but the one loving him is he that does look for him with disci</span></p>
<div><img src="1992_fc_E_files/1992_fc_E-15.jpg" alt="" style="width:208pt;height:223pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">pline.&quot; Use of the rod, representing authority, may involve a spanking, but many limes it does not. Different children, different misbehaviors, call for different disciplining. A rebuke kindly given may suffice; stubbornness may require stronger medicine: “A rebuke works deeper in one having understanding than striking a stupid one a hundred times.” (Proverbs 17:10) Also applicable: “A servant [or, a child] will not let himself be corrected by mere words, for he understands but he is paying no heed.”—Proverbs 29:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In the Bible the word “discipline&quot; means to instruct, train, chasten—including spanking if it takes that to correct behavior. Hebrews 12:11 shows its purpose: “True, no discipline seems for the present to be joyous, but grievous; yet afterward to those who have been trained by it it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness.” Parents are not to be overly harsh in their disciplining: “You fathers, do not be exasperating your children, so that they do not become downhearted.” (Co-lossians 3:21) Neither are they to be overly permissive: “The rod and reproof are what give wisdom; but a boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame.” (Proverbs 29: 15) Permissiveness says, ‘Do as you like; don’t bother me.’ Discipline says, ‘Do what is right; I care about you.’</span></p>

The true aim of discipline, a word that has the same Latin root as </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">disciple,</span><span class="font17"> is not to punish unruly children but to teach and guide them and help inner controls.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">They Hear What You Say, They Copy What You Do</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An article on discipline in </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Atlantic Monthly</span><span class="font17"> was introduced with this statement:</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Father's tone </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">with the child Is also vital</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“A child can be expected to behave well only if his parents live by the values they teach.&quot; The article proceeded to show the value of inner controls: “Teenagers who behaved well tended to have parents who were themselves responsible, upright, and self-disciplined—who lived in accord with the values they professed and encouraged their children to follow suit When the good teenagers were exposed, as a part of the investigation, to problem teenagers, their behavior was not permanently affected. They had far too securely internalized their parents’ values.&quot; It proved to be as the proverb says: “Train up a boy according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.&quot;—Proverbs 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Parents who tried to instill true values in their children, but which they themselves did not follow, had no success. Their children “had not been able to internalize those values.” The study proved that “what made the difference was how closely the parents lived by the values that they tried to teach their children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">It proves to be as author James Baldwin said: “Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them.&quot; If you love your chil-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! September 22,1991</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">dren and you want to teach them the true values, use the best method of all: You be the example of your own teachings. Do not be like the scribes and the Pharisees that Jesus condemned as hypocrites: “Therefore all the things they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds, for they say but do not perform.” (Matthew 23:3) Or like the ones the apostle Paul questioned accusingly: “Do you, however, the one leaching someone else, not teach yourself? You, the one preaching ‘Do not steal,’ do you steal?” —Romans 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Today many dismiss the Bible as outmoded and its guidelines as impractical. Jesus challenges that position with these words: “All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by all its children.” (Luke 7:35) The following accounts by families from many countries prove his words true.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Taking the time to do things together will contribute to a strong family bond</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">our first child was born. There was wonder over the beginning of a new living creature. I remember seeing Carol so happy and contented while nursing baby Rachel. I was happy for her, but 1 also felt a little resentment, a tinge of jealousy. Carol was bonding with Rachel, but where was I? I felt as if I had been pushed—ever so gently but nevertheless pushed—outside our family center. With Jehovah’s help I was able to express my feelings and concern to Carol, and she showed me much sympathy and support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Thereafter I was able to get closer to our new baby by helping with all the baby chores, including some of the disagreeable ones —washing a soiled diaper is a unique experience, to say the least! We’ve had five more children after Rachel. Rebecca is the last one, now eight years old. We’ve conducted personal, individual Bible studies with each one of our children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“One more thing about the early childrearing. Carol and I enjoyed talking with our babies from the time they were born. We</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! September 22,1991</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">talked about all manner of things. Sometimes we talked about Jehovah and his beautiful, wondrous works. Sometimes we talked about silly, playful, funny things. Of course, we were trying to teach them something, but more than that we were just having a pleasant, relaxed, innocent time together. I believe such talks contributed a great deal to parentchild bonding. No doubt they helped to create the good communication that we have had in our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Jehovah has taught us the greater value of spiritual things, of giving of ourselves. Carol and I have never had an abundance of material things, but we’ve never really sought them or missed them. If we had spent more of our time slaving for riches, we would not have had enough lime to devote to Jehovah and our family. We made the right choice.&quot; (Carol’s comments follow.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I think nursing your babies helps greatly in the bonding of babies to their mothers. You spend so much time cuddling and carrying your baby that you can’t help getting close. The mother can never leave the baby’s side for more than two to four hours. Ed and I have always been very strict about not leaving our children with sitters. I always wanted to be able to teach my babies and watch them as they grew up. So during the lime that they were little, I did not hold an outside job. I think this helped them realize how important they were to us. The main way to get close to your children is to spend time with them. Nothing takes the place of your being there physically. All the material things will not take the place of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“The teen years were difficult only because I had to adjust to the babies’ growing up. It was very hard to take, to realize that they didn’t need me as much and were becoming independent. It is a scary time, and it tests al! your work of teaching, disciplining, and molding that you have done. It is really too late to start when they are teenagers. Too late to try then to teach them morals, a love for mankind, and especially a love for Jehovah. These things must be inculcated from birth on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“You have 12 years to get your work done before those critical teen years. But if you have worked hard to apply Bible principles, it is time to reap joy and peace when they decide they want to serve Jehovah from the heart’’—Edward and Carol Owens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">From Zimbabwe</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Children are ‘an inheritance from Jehovah.’ So says the Bible at Psalm 127:3. Bearing this in mind has helped us as parents to do all we could in caring for this inheritance. One of the primary efforts in our family was to do things together—pray together, study the Bible together, worship together, work together, visit friends together, play together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Discipline was needed at times. One time our son, in his early teens, was late getting home. We were worried. He was evasive. We sensed that something was wrong, but we decided to shelve the matter until the next morning. Around midnight we heard a knock on our bedroom door. It was our son, with tears in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“‘Father, Mother, I have not been able to sleep for the last four hours, all because I did not listen when you counseled me from the Bible about bad association. After school today some of the kids pressured me into going swimming with them, and one of the boys pulled me under the water. If another boy had not helped me, I would have drowned. They laughed at me and called me a coward. I came straight home, but I stayed outside the house because I felt guilty. I’m sorry I didn’t listen to you when you warned me about bad associations, as shown in the Bible.’— 1 Corinthians 15:33.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">“He wept and so did we. We were pleased that he had learned a lesson, but we disciplined him to make a deeper impression. Exodus 34:6, 7 shows that Jehovah is merciful and pardons error, but still ‘by no means will he give exemption from punishment.’” —David and Betty Mupfururirwa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">From Brazil</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I am a widow and have to raise my boy by myself. At the same time, I work as a teacher. It is not easy to instruct and discipline children. What is needed is coherent instruction, balanced discipline, and a good example on the part of the parents. It was hard for me to be firm and at the same time sympathetic. I had to develop the art of listening, especially listening with my heart. It is important to communicate, not just talk, but get the child involved, make him respond emotionally. I tried to make him feel a part of the family by getting him involved in the family budget. When the light bill or the water bill arrived, or the price of clothes or shoes went up, we discussed these matters together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“It is important to commend with sincerity for things well done. As opportunities arose, I would show him the value of following God’s laws and principles. On one occasion, after having counseled him several times, I had to use the literal rod. How difficult it was for me, but, oh, what blessed results! In the adolescent phase we have our ups and downs, but we can see the value of instruction and discipline. He tells me his personal problems and expresses his sentiments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I have to stay alert to maintain good communication. So 1 try not to get too involved in my secular work in order always to have time for my son. When we do have problems, I try to listen very attentively, and with the help of Jehovah, we overcome them. I let him know that I make my share of mistakes. On one occasion I was very angry, and I told him to ‘shut his mouth.’ He told me that to tell someone to ‘shut his mouth’ showed a lack of love. He had a point. That afternoon we had a real long talk.”—Yolanda Moraes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">From Republic of Korea</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“I eagerly applied Bible principles in my family life. Especially Deuteronomy 6:6-9 was deep in my heart. So I tried to be with my children as much as I could, to draw close to them, to inculcate the principles of God’s Word in their minds and hearts. I also invited full-time missionaries and Bethel family members to our home to give my children a feel for full-time service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“The first thing parents should do when children cause problems is to display the fruits of the spirit. It is easy to get upset at the children and to lose one’s temper. We parents, however, must be patient and show exemplary conduct. It is important to respect children and give them the opportunity to explain the situation. If there is no clear evidence of wrongdoing, then trust them and always build them up. When you have to discipline a child, first reason with him, show him what he did wrong, and point out how displeasing his action was to Jehovah and to his parents. Only then discipline. Often my sons would say after they were disciplined: ‘Dad, 1 don't understand myself, why I was rebellious. I was so foolish.’ They appreciate parents who care enough to discipline them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Parents need to be alert to the start of bad conduct. When my oldest son was in middle school third grade, I heard loud rock music coming from his room. I discovered that he had joined a student discipline team (older, exemplary students who counseled other students), and he had been exposed to worldly influences. I learned that under continued pressure from team members and out of curiosity, he had smoked. We reasoned together on the dangers of smoking, and my son con-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">eluded on his own that he should resign from the team, which he dId. To fill the vacuum left by dropping objectionable school activities, we arranged for healthy recreation with the family and congregation members.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Finally, I want to say that the most important thing is for parents to set a good example. I had always told my two boys that 1 wanted to serve God full-time as a minister preaching the good news. When my second boy finished school, 1 was able to retire from my job at a silk factory and become a full-time minister. My two boys saw my determination and followed suit. After serving time in prison because of the neutrality issue, both entered full-time service and are continuing to this day.”—Shim Yoo Ki,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">From Sweden</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“We have raised seven children, five boys and two girls. Now grown, all are very active in preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom. From an early age, the children attended the congregation meetings and went with us in field service. Step-by-step they learned to do the preaching work—ring the doorbell, say hello, give their name, and offer a handbill, tract, or magazine. When still quite young, they gave talks in the Theocratic Ministry School.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“Sometimes serious problems required special attention. Showing love and patience is then important—no shouting or quarreling. Problems were solved by reasoning things out and stressing Jehovah’s views. We trained them in money matters. When older, they worked distributing newspapers, peat harvesting, gardening, and so forth. Visiting their grandparents far away from home made them aware of older people’s problems and sympathetic toward them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">“THANK YOU FOR ALL!

<p><span class="font25" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span><span class="font17"> success of a child's education should not be measured simply by the grades he receives. Of greater importance are the values he develops, his moral standards, his behavior, and his thinking. But who bear the principal responsibility for the child’s development in these fields?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“The parents do,” answers one longtime school counselor. “The primary objective of formal education is to support parents in producing responsible young adults who are well-developed intellectually, physically, and emotionally.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Such school counselors have frequently learned what works and what doesn’t work when it comes to producing well-adjusted young adults. Roddy Cameron, another such counselor, has dealt with hundreds of cases over the years. He was asked by</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!:</span><span class="font17"> “What do children really need most to succeed?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">After pondering for a moment, he replied: “You show me a troubled kid, and the chances are extremely high that I can show you troubled parents.” In reviewing his experiences in talking with such parents, he noted: “When trying to explain to me why they work so hard and have to be away from home so much, they almost always say they want to give their kids what they themselves didn't have.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Yet, are the material advantages that so many parents lacked when they were young what children really need? Are expensive cars, fine clothes, and exotic vacations important to becoming successful, well-adjusted students? “What’s wrong with a hug, a kiss, love, attention?” asked</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">Show me a troubled kid, and the chances are that I can show you troubled parents’</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Time, Love, and Concern</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Tender loving care is the basic need of children. And the most effective way parents can provide it is by unselfishly giving of themselves, giving of their time, and not being ashamed to show genuine, uninhibited love and deep concern. One writer noted that the best gift one person can give another is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;being there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In its brochure </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Plain Talk About Raising Children,</span><span class="font17"> the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health reported the results of a survey of successful parents. They were identified as those whose children, over age 21, “were all productive adults who were apparently adjusting well to our society.&quot; The parents of these well-adjusted young adults were asked: ‘Based on your personal experience, what is the best advice you could give to other parents?’ The most frequent responses were: ‘Love abundantly,' ‘discipline constructively,' ‘spend time together,’ ‘teach your children right from wrong,’ ‘develop mutual respect,’ ‘really listen to them,' ‘offer guidance rather than a speech,’ and ‘be realistic.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Does that sound prosaic, old-fashioned? Yet, parents might well ask themselves: If</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">6 </span><span class="font17">something works well, why abandon it for something different, something that doesn’t work?' Yes, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">time, love,</span><span class="font17"> and </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">concern </span><span class="font17">make up the glue that holds families together. It is the parents’ homework to provide these basic needs for their children. fulfilling their assignment will help their children to become successful students and then successful adults. There are no shortcuts, no substitutes, such as providing material things, thinking that they will make the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Comparable to Plants</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In many respects, children grow and develop like plants. The successful farmer knows what it takes to reap a good crop —fertile, cultivated soil; warm sunshine; water; weeding; and protective care. Often there are difficult times and heartaches along the way, right up to the harvest But how proud successful farmers are when they see their hard-earned rewards!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Surely, a human life is more valuable than a farmer’s harvest! Should it therefore, be expected that the desired result could be obtained with less effort? Not according to the parents surveyed by the National Institute of Mental Health, nor according to the scores of parents and students interviewed by </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font17"> over the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The successful parent knows that raising a child takes commitment The home environment must be right, with plenty of warmth and understanding. Gently and persistently, parents need to cultivate in their children an appreciation for learning and living. Patiently they need to adjust, watch, and helpfully share the difficult times and heartaches that mar every life’s path. If parents do these things, the chances are very good that the harvest will be a successful young adult</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Beatrice, a mother of two girls, also decorates her kitchen with the schoolwork of her children. She says: “I do it because I’m proud of my kids and want them to know it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Recognizing the high value of praise, the Dallas, Texas, Independent School District encourages its volunteer tutors to make generous use of encouraging expressions, such as: Terrific! Much better. Keep it up! Good for you. That’s clever. Exactly right. Very creative. Good thinking. Excellent work. Now you’ve got it. I appreciate the way you’re trying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">If you are a parent, could you give encouragement more often?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Providing Support in Other Ways</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In addition to praising their children’s efforts, parents who do their homework cultivate a home environment that is conducive to study. They get their children interested in reading and learning about the world around them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“My parents supported me,” explained Julie, “by putting a fence around my study time. I had a particular place in the house to do my homework, and I was off limits to the rest of the family until it was done. During my study time, I was not required to do chores. Interruptions in my concentration were thereby avoided.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Mark tells how his parents supported him and his sisters: “They made sure we always had available a dictionary and other books to assist us in our studies. They encouraged us to build personal libraries by letting us buy books we were interested in without having to pay for them out of our allowances.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&quot;We began our reading program with the children when they were about three months old,” explains Althea, mother of four. “It was difficult to maintain because, like many women today, I had to work. To make room for it, I had to buy out the time from other activities. The children had over 300 books—nursery rhymes, scientific books, all kinds. They would bring me their favorites to read to them. Sometimes 1 would skip sections to try to shorten the session, but that didn’t work. The kids always knew the missing part and would remind me by filling it in from memory!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Johan from Finland says that his parents would read to him 10 to 15 minutes every night before bedtime. “I could pick the story,” Johan explains. “Mom would play the characters in the story.

<p><span class="font17">Ravindira from Sri Lanka loved having her father put her to bed because of his reading style. “My favorite bedtime story was </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">How the Camel Got Its Hump.</span><span class="font17"> Father would thump, pump, laugh, and do everything else during the reading. That was supposed to put me to sleep, but it only succeeded in keeping me wide awake and wanting more. He pretended not to know this, but he knew exactly what he was doing. Later, when I was older, he would let me carry the books back to the library. That made me feel important and further encouraged me to enjoy reading.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Describing how her father helped her, Susan says: “Dad loved Field trips. He would take me everywhere—museums, bird sanctuaries, libraries, to pick wild ber-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">Emilo from Puerto Rico recalls: “My mother wanted us to know that we were always learning. When I would come home from school, she would ask, ‘So, what did you learn today?’ If I said, ‘Oh, nothing,’ she would come back with, ‘What do you mean, nothing? You must have learned something.' She would stay with the questioning until I came up with what I had learned. She did the same thing with my two brothers. She wanted us to know that we were very important to her and that she cared for us. This made us a close-knit family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Cultivating Family Closeness</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Successful families get along well together, but this requires effort. So parents who do their homework seek to cultivate a cooperative family spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“We discuss family business honestly and almost on a daily basis,” observes Carol, a single parent of two teenage daughters. “Sometimes the girls will hold their problems back because they feel I have enough of my own. I can tell when they do this, for they get into arguments over swilly things. I have to remind them that the family arrangement works best when we talk out our problems with one another honestly.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Money is a source of problems in many families, but Carol says that her being open with the girls regarding the family’s financial situation has elicited their support. She explains: “I encourage them to find jobs to earn their own money for the extra things they would like. I respect</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9 </span><span class="font17">them for earning it and let them know it is their money.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some parents use their family’s financial situation to teach their children budgeting, banking, and mathematical skills. “Another lesson we have been able to teach through this arrangement,” observes Henry, father of three boys and a girl, “is cooperation in family activities through involvement&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">But where can parents find the time for such homework? Audrey, a mother of two, says that because of her tight schedule, she invites the children to join her while she runs errands. She gets her talking time in then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Handling Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In order to do their homework well, parents need to learn to listen carefully to their children. As the Bible proverb says: “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction.” (Proverbs 1:5) Attentive listening builds trust, and this is vital in handling problems successfully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">For example, when Leon and Carolyn learned that their eldest daughter, Nikki,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Your youngsters need personal attention</span></p><img src="1992_fc_E_files/1992_fc_E-27.jpg" alt="" style="width:151pt;height:128pt;">
<p><span class="font17">was skipping school and failing some courses, Carolyn’s first reaction was to blame the had influence of school friends. However, Leon explained: “I suggested we reserve judgment until we had all the facts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“But even then,” Leon notes, “it took a week of patient, gentle probing and listening before we reached the root of Nikki’s problem. What a shock it was to us! Nikki felt we weren’t interested in her, since we had been so busy with our own activities! Carolyn and I made adjustments, and Nikki responded by becoming more alert to her responsibilities around the house and at school.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Dan and Dorothy have eight children. These spend an hour and a half on school buses each day, and a major problem has been the worsening conditions there. “When the older ones were in school, it was an easy matter to utilize the time on the bus to do homework or catch up on reading,” Dan noted. “In just the last 12 years, however, that has all changed. Now there are many unwholesome distractions —foul language, loud rock music, and smoke from cigarettes and marijuana, usually in the rear of the bus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Dan explained that they brainstormed this problem with the children. “Two ideas surfaced,” he noted. “Sit as close to the bus driver as possible, and equip each child with lightweight headphones connected to a personal AM/FM cassette player. Now the children are able to isolate themselves from the trouble, enjoying easy-listening music while they read or do light homework. The solution seems rather simple, but it has worked!”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>What Else Can Parents Do?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">In modern society, teachers and schools are important to the successful development of children. That doesn't mean they can fulfill the role of parents, but they can be of vital assistance in rearing children successfully. So another homework assignment that you parents have is to cooperate asfuUy as possible with the school system in which your children are enrolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">What, then, if there is a special function or program at school ! For example, ata school in Massachusetts, there was a Student Awards Achievement Presentation program. “I went because 1 wanted my children to know I was proud of them,&quot; explained Joanne, a mother of four boys. Twenty students received special achievement awards that day, yet most of the parents did not show up. Do you think that their absence encouraged their children to do better in school! Hardly!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Consider also the teachers. Schools often set aside evenings to exhibit the students'work and to review their progress with parents, and many teachers give up personal time to prepare for these activities. One teacher observed: “We have our own families and our own lives to live too. It</span><span class="font17"> is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">discouraging when you spend so much time preparing for special events and see only one, turn, or three parents all evening.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">AWAKE!—September 8, 1988</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">parents, you may at times expect schools and teachers to make adjustments to meet the special needs of your children. Should you not be willing to make similar sacrifices to support the efforts of the school system, especially since it</span><span class="font17"> is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">endeavoring to help your children grow into successful adults!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The brochure “School and Jehovah’s Witnesses,” published topromote understanding and cooperation between parents and teachers, outlined the following homework for Jehovah’s Witnesses who are parents: “It</span><span class="font17"> is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">important that parents become acquainted with their children's teachers—making arrangements to meet and talk with them....</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">“In such a meeting the Witness father or mother should let the teacher know that the parents expect proper Christian conduct from their children, and that if the children misbehave, they want to be informed. The parents also should give assurance that they will support the teacher in whatever reasonable discipline is administered, even reinforcing it at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">“Other ways that parents can help: Make sure children get a good breakfast before they leave for school. See that their homework</span><span class="font17"> is </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">complete and that they have all their books with them. Always show respect for school regulations and expect the children to respect these as well. Get the children to talk at home about school activities and any problems they may encounter there.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Don’t you agree that these are fine suggestions! Are you as parents applying them! Part of your homework is to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11 </span><span class="font17">influence of teachers. Parents who appreciate what that means in terms of learning potential for their children will want to see to it that this time is well spent. A mother of three children explained how she and her husband made sure that it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“When John and I were dissatisfied with one of our children’s classes,&quot; she relates, “we would go to the school and work out a suitable adjustment with the guidance counselor, the teacher, or the principal. We stayed deeply involved in our children’s formal education from beginning to end. Now that it is over, we are satisfied they got the best of what was available to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Children may need help with their schoolwork, and part of a parent’s homework should be to become involved. Yet, the parent wisely cooperates with the school system. “One thing I remember about my parents,” says Wesley, “is that they never interfered with the teacher’s classroom strategies. They realized that the teaching process can be varied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Questions for</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-style:italic;">Parental Self-Examination</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">1. Do I take a real interest in my children’s schooling?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">2. Do I know their teachers?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">3. Do the teachers know that I appreciate their efforts?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">4.</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> Do I make sure that my children take their schoolwork seriously?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">5. Do I see to it that their homework is done properly and on time?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">6.</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> Is my attitude toward knowledge and learning a positive one?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">7.</span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;"> Do my children see me study?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">12</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“For example, when I was baffled by the process that would get me to the answer of a math problem, Dad would give me the answer and let me struggle with the process until I figured it out. I knew I had it when my answer matched Dad’s.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Not an Easy Assignment</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Any child will tell you that some homework assignments are harder than others. But the homework you parents have is much more difficult than any that you ever had in school. Indeed, rearing children successfully is a complex, long-term assignment. Some have called it a 20-year project.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The key to success includes being an attentive, friendly, understanding parent, one who knows the children well and responds to them as individuals. Remember, what your youngsters really need is personal attention that is demonstrated by loving concern for their welfare. Nourish in them a thirst for learning, and help them make the gaining of knowledge a pleasurable experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">All the Effort Worth It</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">You parents who do your homework are self-sacrificing, not self-indulgent. You are ready to make adjustments. You realize that to help your children, you must ‘be there,' and you must expend yourselves by providing the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">time, love,</span><span class="font17"> and concern that your children really need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">When you do your homework, the results may be comparable to the harvest of a farmer who prepares the soil and then plants, cultivates, and waters his crop. You may be rewarded with a delightful harvest. It is as the Bible says: “Train up a boy [or girl] according to the way for him; even when he grows old he will not turn aside from it.”—Proverbs 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">AWAKE!—September 8, 1988</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How to Strengthen Family Bonds</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The reasons why youths leave home are many and often quite involved. While this article cannot address them in depth, it does show that Bible principles, when applied, can work to keep the family intact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font33">I</span><span class="font17">T IS hard to establish just how many children run away from home. Printed estimates range from 600,000 to 3,000,000 missing children a year in the United States alone. Such estimates often lump together such categories as runaways, pushouts, throwaways, and children abducted by divorced parents without legal custody. Estimates they must be, for children who are abandoned by their parents are not reported as missing, and some</span></p>
<p><span class="font34">4 THE WATCHTOWER—APRIL 1. 1988 </span><span class="font17">children regularly run away. “A 16-year old who runs away five times in a year and stays overnight each time he runs away would show up in the . . , statistics as five missing children,” says </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Neui York Times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">More important than numbers are the reasons why children leave home. “When a youngster runs away, it is generally a symptom of dysfunction in the home environment,” states the magazine </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality.</span><span class="font17"> It may be because of problems that already exist, such as physical abuse, neglect, lack of love, divorce, excessive demands, or harsh and unbending rules. Or it may be due to fear of repercussions, as in cases of pregnancy or brushes with the law. When asked why they left home, most runaways cite reasons involving their relationship with their parents. “The parent-child relationship is apparently an extremely influential factor relative to runaway behavior,” says the journal </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence.</span><span class="font17"> It adds: “Runaways report poor parent-child relationships, extreme family conflict, alienation from parents, interpersonal tension, and poor communication with parents as primary factors behind running away from home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Understanding the Reasons</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">These are stressful times. “With unemployment climbing, and more and more families in difficult financial straits, domestic tensions and problems multiply,&quot; says the magazine </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Ladies’ Home Journal.</span><span class="font17"> “When a father is laid off and a mortgage goes unpaid, everyone in the family feels the stress. Young people, who haven’t developed the skills to cope with these pressures, use flight as a means to escape.” Sometimes parents themselves unwittingly drive their children out. Angrily, they may tell their offspring to accept their decisions or leave. Irritated and exhausted from fighting their daily economic battles, they have little energy to deal with their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the same time, just being an adolescent produces its own stress. Teens are torn between the need for the security and</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">care they received as children and the sense of being independent from their parents as they struggle to become adults. It causes confusion and anxiety for them. Bodily changes are also taking place. Their lives have suddenly become quite complex, and they may feel overwhelmed. They feel pressure from parents and peers. They also experience periods of selfdoubt and depression. “While you try to figure yourself out, don’t be surprised if you sometimes feel misunderstood at home,” advises </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">’Teen</span><span class="font17"> magazine. “After all, if you can’t understand yourself, how can your parents know what’s on your mind?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font34">THE WATCHTOWER—APRIL 1, 1988 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Many parents, especially with their first offspring, are unsure as to how much freedom to allow their children. Overcontrol and lack of understanding have led many youths to run away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“But running away doesn’t solve anything,” notes author Judy Blume in her book </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to Judy.</span><span class="font17"> “Running away is a symptom, not a solution. Instead, families have to sit down together and face the facts. They have to deal with reality. Only then can they make the changes that will help them live together in peace. And often they need help in doing that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Finding the Needed Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The best source of that help is God’s Word, the Bible. Why so? Because as man’s Creator, God knows what is best for his creation. And he has given us instruction with that purpose in mind, “for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.&quot; (2 Timothy 3:16, 17) Bible principles work, and they cover every aspect of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As noted, though, all members in the family must be willing to face the facts and make changes. Without such recognition and desire, improvement will not be made, and the impelling force to escape will remain. Especially is that so in families with problems of alcohol, drug, and sexual abuse. These must be overcome before the normal pressures of life can be dealt with. Faith in God and a sincere desire to please him, based on accurate knowledge of his Word, have helped many families to overcome tragic situations that in other families have impelled youths to run away.—Compare 1 Corinthians 6: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Just living in this modern world with its increasing selfishness, distrust, and soaring crime rate can put a strain on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font34">6 THE WATCHTOWER-APRIL 1, 1988 </span><span class="font17">family bonds. That is why “all the things that were written aforetime [in the Bible] were written for our instruction, that through our endurance and through the comfort from the Scriptures we might have hope.”—Romans 15:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Applying Bible Principles</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With knowledge of the factors that induce a child to run away, Bible principles can be applied. The Bible addresses these factors by advising parents to spend the needed quality time with their children, to give consistent, loving training. Both extremes of lack of interest and of overly strict discipline are to be avoided. God’s Word advises: “Fathers, do not be irritating your children, but go on bringing them up in the discipline and mentalregulating of Jehovah.”—Ephesians 6:4; Proverbs 22:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As in Bible times, proper supervision, attention, and instruction are to be things that parents constantly give—‘when they sit in their house, when they walk on the road, when they lie down, and when they get up.’ (Deuteronomy 11:19) While discipline is needed at times, it is to be administered with love. (Proverbs 13:24) Family happiness certainly will be enhanced if such advice is followed!</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Children also are to do their share: “Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous: ‘Honor your father and your mother.'” (Ephesians 6:1, 2) The ancient wise man Solomon, who wrote so as “to give to the inexperienced ones shrewdness, to a young man knowledge and thinking ability,” also advises: “Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother.... If sinners try to seduce you, do not consent.”—Proverbs 1:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">How would family problems be handled?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">WHAT PARENTS CAN DO</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Spend time with your children; know their problems and needs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Be constant in attention and supervision</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Administer discipline and training in love</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Make the home a happy place</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">WHAT CHILDREN CAN DO</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Be obedient, loving, and respectful to parents</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Avoid isolation; take an active interest in family affairs</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Think of the family as a whole, not just your own desires</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Be open and communicate</span></p>
<div><img src="1992_fc_E_files/1992_fc_E-30.jpg" alt="" style="width:225pt;height:201pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">In love, for the Bible counsels: “Let all your affairs take place with love.” (1 Corinthians 16:14) This should be a deep-rooted love that is willing to overlook the imperfections and idiosyncrasies of another, which might otherwise irritate and grate on one’s nerves. “Above all things, have intense love for one another,” says the Bible, “because love covers a multitude of sins.”—1 Peter 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Such love also takes an interest in the happiness and well-being of others and draws the family closer together. Note that the so-called golden rule was positive: “Do for others what you want them to do for you.” (Matthew 7:12, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Today’s English, Version)</span><span class="font17"> Most runaway youths interviewed in one study said that their involvement in their family was at a minimum prior to leaving home. “‘Family disengagement’ is a major factor in the process of deciding to run and remain away from home,” says </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence.</span><span class="font17"> But by following the Bible’s admonition to be “keeping an eye, not in personal interest upon just your own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others,” more time will be spent together as a family, and the problems of poor relationships, alienation, and poor communication can be overcome. (Philippians 2:4) With close feeling and interest at home, the influence by peers that may induce a child to run away will be minimal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">With the application of Bible principles, running away from home no longer appears as the solution to the problems in life that each person must face. With loving support from individual family members, the family becomes a sanctuary from the pressures of the outside world. A fuller understanding of Bible principles and their application, together with the hope that God gives, will further enhance that happiness. Why not let Jehovah's Witnesses discuss it with you?</span></p>

Hence, there would be “a sword” causing division in some households, because of the believer’s showing less love for his family, “yes, and even his own soul.” (Matthew 10:34-37; Luke 14:26) Such divisions in families continue to our day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font34">26 THE WATCHTOWER-NOVEMBER 1, 1986 </span><span class="font17">to keep the family intact, some unbelieving mates simply are not “agreeable to dwelling” with the Christian, and a separation or a divorce ensues. (1 Corinthians 7:12-16) Disrupted families also occur because during “the conclusion of the system of things” there has been a ‘cooling off’ of love for God and his laws, including those regarding marriage. (Matthew 19:6, 9; 24: 3,12) In the United States the divorce rate increased 236 percent just between 1960 and 1980! Since about three out of five divorcing couples in the United States have children, those in broken homes face complex problems. Usually when people learn the truth of God’s Word, their family life improves, but some persons were involved in divorces before becoming Jehovah’s Witnesses. Sometimes even a Christian who failed to apply Bible counsel earnestly at home has ended up in a divorce. (John 13:17) What can Christian parents do under these circumstances to rear children to love Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">“Fellow Feeling” Vital</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>3</sup> In Malachi’s day certain Israelite men were treacherously divorcing their wives. The “weeping and sighing” of these rejected women as they appealed for God’s help were, in effect, “covering with tears the altar of Jehovah.” (Malachi 2:13-16) The breaking up of a marriage today is likewise painful, even if there are solid Scriptural grounds for the breakup. Though the husband and the wife suffer, the children often suffer more.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">* Even if the divorce brings relief from abuse, a child’s whole world sometimes seems to fall apart. Hence, it is necessary for a believing parent to show out-of-the-ordinary love and understanding in handling the situation. “I was always in the middle. I felt divided,” explained a youth whose Christian father obtained a Scriptural divorce when the boy was five. “I kept my true feelings to myself. This caused bouts of depression.” Helping a child deal with such intense emotions requires that a parent have “fellow feeling&quot; and be “tenderly compassionate.” (1 Peter 3:8) The child may be silent out of guilt, feeling that he is in some way to blame for the divorce. A parent needs patiently to explain that he loves the child and that the divorce is not the child’s fault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>s</sup> Bitterness between parents can become intense, especially so when religious issues are involved. Yet, rather than “paying back injury for injury or reviling for reviling,” the believing parent should consider the welfare of the child.

<p><span class="font15">5. Why should a Christian parent endeavor to end hostilities with the ex-mate?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">Francke states: “Parents who are hostile to each other make these children’s problems far more difficult and even destructive. Not wanting to risk alienating either parent, the child can withdraw from positive relationships with both parents.” Yes, “bitter jealousy and contentiousness” are not only wrong but can even estrange the child from you. (James 3:14, 16) Thoughtless verbal attacks against an unbelieving parent can deeply hurt a child. (Proverbs 12:18) If an unbelieving ex-mate wishes to continue the conflict, “as far as it depends upon you [the believer], be peaceable with all men.”—Romans 12:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Protect Your Child's Heart</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>6</sup> After custody is determined, there may still be difficulties to contend with. “One of the major problems,&quot; states a report from the Watch Tower Society’s branch in Australia, “is that the parent who has gained custody of the child tends to relax... Even a parent in the truth can lose sight of the basic reason he or she wanted custody of the children. The primary reason should be to bring them up as true worshipers of Jehovah.” To do so requires constant effort.—Ephesians 6:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>7</sup> Of course, a law court often grants visitation rights to the parent who no longer has custody of the child. Can these be respected while still protecting the child’s heart? Yes, and as appropriate, the child should show due respect to an unbelieving parent. If during the visit the unbeliever engages in unchristian conduct, rather than build hatred by condemning that parent, the believer can explain to the child that God has set standards of conduct in the Bible and that “each of us will</span></p></li></ul>

(Romans 14:12) Yet, make clear that such conduct is not to be imitated. Discreetly show that though some people do not live by these standards, in time many change because of seeing a Christian example in the child and the ex-male. In this way, it may be possible for the child to have a measure of respect for that parent. A divorced couple’s differences about religion should not prevent a parent from affecting the child in a positive way. The Christian parent will “let [his or her] reasonableness become known to all men.” (Philippians 4:5) What, though, if the unbeliever tries to undermine godly training?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>8</sup> Preparation for the visits is the key! One Christian mother whose ex-husband became an apostate reported: “Before the visit, I would study with the children about how their conduct would be regarded by Jehovah. We would act out situations. I would say: ‘If your father says this or that, how will you answer?’” Another Christian who was divorced because she became a Witness adds: “Before [my two teenagers] leave for their weekend visit with their father, we say a prayer asking Jehovah to be with them and to help them to witness to their dad, especially by their fine conduct.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>9</sup> An unbelieving parent with visitation rights may try to woo the child with lavish gifts, expensive entertainment, and other recreational pleasures. Jochebed, the mother of Moses, (and Amram if he was still living) knew what would face Moses when he was turned over to Pharaoh’s daughter. So she no doubt applied herself in shaping his sense of values while be was still with her. (Exodus 2:1-10) Despite facing the tempting “treasures of Egypt,”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font15">28 THE WATCHTOWER-NOVEMBER 1, 1986 </span><span class="font17">Moses made his own choice to follow godly principles. He “esteemed&quot; his spiritual privileges as real riches! (Hebrews 11: 23-26) Christian parents should similarly prepare their children to meet such temptations by discussing Scriptural material that focuses on spiritual treasures.* Children often see through the shallow motive of a parent who would attempt to buy their affection.—Proverbs 15:16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">‘“In some extreme cases, such visits may pose a serious threat to the child. A parent would have to decide what to do under the circumstances, prayerfully evaluating the severity of the threat, the legal recourse available, and the possible consequences of refusing to honor visitation rights.” Avoid rash actions that could put into question your fitness as a parent, —Galatians 6:5; Romans 13:1; Acts 5:29; 1 Peter 2:19, 20.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>11</sup> What if it is the Christian parent who has only visitation rights?

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>12</sup> Despite what might be limited opportunities, a noncustodial Christian parent can do much to instill in the child a deep love for Jehovah.

So the using of wisdom to success means advantage.” (Ecclesiastes 10:10) For instance, on occasion the unbeliever may make excuses to prevent access to the child. Rather than make an immediate issue of this, a parent may get better results by applying Proverbs 25:15: “By patience a commander is induced, and a mild tongue itself can break a bone.” Patience and mildness, though not easy to show when one is faced with unjust restrictions, can soften even one who is as hard in his opposition as a bone. (Compare 2 Timothy 2:23-25.) Arguments can often be avoided by your being punctual and following suggestions (not in conflict with the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font34">THE WATCHTOWER-NOVEMBER 1, 1986 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Scriptures) that are given by the custodial parent regarding the child’s care. If you are concerned that the unbeliever is making derogatory remarks about you to the child, remember 1 Peter 2:15: “By doing good you may muzzle the ignorant talk of the unreasonable men [and women].&quot; If you set a good example, the child will see who is right.—Proverbs 20:7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>13</sup> During the visits, endeavor to put the Word of God into the child's heart by, whenever possible, personally studying spiritual material with him and by taking him to congregation meetings. Even if there are stringent legal restrictions, the parent can informally refer to God’s creative works, and in other ways help the child to love God. (Romans 1:19, 20; Matthew 6:28-30) Jesus recognized the limitations of his listeners. He “would speak the word to them, as far as they were able to listen.” (Mark 4:33, 34) So in addition to discussing serious spiritual matters, engage in other upbuilding activities, such as visiting with good friends, including some who are of the child’s age. (Proverbs 13: 20) Enjoy wholesome recreation together. Make the visit a precious occasion. Reasonable discipline shows love. (Proverbs 13:24) At times, however, the problems may seem overwhelming.

As the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">New Berkeley Version</span><span class="font17"> renders the phrase: “When he falls, he shall not be down and out.” Why? Because Jehovah offers his hand of uplift by means of his holy spirit and his loving worshipers. —James 1:27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17"><sup>15</sup> One Christian woman, after her opposing ex-husband was granted custody of her two young children, stated: “When matters were taken completely out of my hands, I learned really to rely on Jehovah. 1 have learned to accept what he allows and not try to take things into my own hands. I am still learning. It’s a hard lesson.” However, she is making full use of her visitation rights and has drawn comfort not only from her new husband, a faithful Christian elder, but also from others in the congregation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">“ Another Christian whose apostate ex-husband kept the children with him for several months against the court’s ruling, said: “I was so depressed that I thought I was going to fall apart.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Safeguarding Your Children From Misuse of Blood</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>1</sup> “Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah.” (Ps. 127:3) If you have such a precious inheritance from Jehovah, you, as parents, have a happy, although serious, responsibility to train, care for, and protect your children. Fur example, have you taken every reasonable step to protect your young children from a blood transfusion? How would your children react if faced with the prospects of a transfusion? Have you discussed as a family what you might do to deal effectively with an emergency situation in which a transfusion is threatened?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">’ Preparing your family for such situations need not be a cause for anxiety or undue stress. You cannot anticipate and prepare for every eventuality in life, but there are many things you, as parents, can do in advance to protect your children from a transfusion. Neglecting these responsibilities could result, in your child being transfused when getting medical care. What can be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> Firm Conviction Important: </span><span class="font15">Serious thought should be given to how firm your own convictions are regarding God’s law on blood. Are you teaching your children to obey Jehovah on this matter, just as you teach them wills law on honesty, morality, neutrality, and other aspects of life? Do we really feel as God’s law commanded at Deuteronomy 12:23: “Be firmly resolved not to eat the blood&quot;? Verse 25 adds: “You must not eat it, in order that it may go well with you and your sons after you, because you will do what is right in Jehovah’s eyes.&quot; A doctor may claim that blood will 'make things go well’ for your sick child, but you must be firmly resolved before any emergency comes up to refuse blood for yourself and your children, valuing your relationship with Jehovah as higher than any alleged extension of life that would involve breaking his divine law. I'avor with God now and everlasting life in the future are involved!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>4</sup> Yes, Jehovah’s Witnesses are life-oriented. They have no desire to die. They want to live so they can praise Jehovah and do his will. That is one reason why they go to hospitals and take their children there for treatment. They ask physicians to treat them, and when they are told blood is the standard or medically indicated course of treatment, they ask for alternative nonblood medical management. There are many alternatives to blood. Experienced physicians are using them. Such alternative management is not quack medicine but consists of medically sound treatments and procedures that are documented tn leading medical journals. Thousands of physicians around the world are cooperating with us in providing good medical care without the use of blood, although it is still a problem at times to locate physicians who will treat Witness children without using blood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>5</sup> Finding a Cooperative Doctor: </span><span class="font15">Physicians have many concerns in treating patients, and when you ask them to treat your child without blood, this increases the challenge. Some physicians will agree to treat adults while respecting their wishes on blood as long as an acceptable release is filled out. Some may similarly agree to treat minors who have demonstrated they are mature minors, since some courts have recognized that mature minors have the right to make their own medical choices. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font15"> June 15,1991, pages 16-17, for discussion of what constitutes a mature minor.) However, physicians may refuse to treat young children, especially infants, unless they have permission to give blood. In fact, very few physicians will give 100-percent assurance tliat they will not use blood under any circumstances when treating a child. For medical and legal reasons, most doctors feel that they cannot give such a guarantee. Nevertheless, an increasing number want to provide care for the children of Jehovah’s Witnesses while going as far as they feel they can in respect' ing our wishes on blood.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">* In view of this, what if, in your search for a suitable doctor for your child, you find one with a record of good cooperation with Jehovah’s Witnesses and who had in the past performed the same bloodless procedure for other Witnesses, yet he feels that the law does not allow him to give you an absolute guarantee that blood would not be used? However, he assures you that he feels there will be no problem this time as well You may decide this is your best option. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Under these circumstances</span><span class="font15"> you might conclude that you could grant permission to proceed. Make it quite clear, however, that in giving permission for medical treatment for your child you are not giving permission for blood transfusions. Taking this course would be a responsibility you would have to bear without your decision being viewed as a compromise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR KINGDOM MINISTRY. SEPTEMBER 1992</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">’ Or course, if you could find a reasonable alternative treatment option that would further reduce or possibly eliminate the problem of blood being used, then you likely would take the less risky course. It would be expected that you would make a diligent effort to find the physician or surgeon who would go further than any other in agreeing not to give blood. The best defense is to anticipate problems. Make every effort to find a cooperative doctor in advance. Try to stay away from uncooperative doctors and hospitals where possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• In some lands another factor that can make a difference in whether a blood transfusion is given Is how hospital care will be paid for. Where parents have health insurance or other security that permits searehing out a doctor of their choice, the children can more easily be kept out of the hands of uncooperative physicians or hospital personnel. Sufficient financial coverage often determines the type of service and cooperation a family receives from doctors and hospitals. Also, whether a hospital or physician is willing to accept transfer of a child will often depend on the parents’ ability to pay for care. And prospective mothers, it is important that you look after your health during pregnancy! This will do much to prevent premature births and the associated complications, since the standard treatment for premature babies and their problems many times involves blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">• At times physicians complain that Jehovah’s Witnesses do not discuss their objections to blood until the last minute. This should never be the case. One of the first things Witness parents should do when going to the hospital or when engaging the services of a physician is to discuss their position on blood. If surgery is involved, request an early meeting with the anesthesiologist. The surgeon may be able to assist you in doing this. The admittance forms should be checked carefully. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">You have a right to cross out anything objectionable. To remove any doubt, write on the admittance form clearly that blood, for religious and medical reasons, is not wanted or permitted under any circumstances.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>10</sup> Help From Jehovah's Organization: </span><span class="font15">What provisions has Jehovah's organization made to help you in protecting your children from blood? There are many. The Society has published much to educate us on blood and nonblood alternative management. You have studied the brochure </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">How Can Blood Save Your Life?</span><span class="font15"> and other publications on this subject. And you have your brothers and sisters in the local congregation who can give you much help and support. When there is a crisis, elders may consider it advisable to arrange a 24-hour watch at the hospital, preferably by an elder with the patient's parent or another close family member. Blood transfusions often are given when all relatives and friends have gone home for the night.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">“ In the United States, there are over a hundred Hospital Liaison Committees located in major cities. All congregations are assigned to a committee made up of trained brothers who are available to assist. Call on them, through your elders, when they are needed. They should not be called about minor problems, but do not wait too long to call If it is perceived that a serious problem may be developing. They often can supply the names of cooperative physicians and suggestions on alternatives. Where necessary and possible, these brothers arrange to be on the scene and help to manage the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">” Anticipating and Dealing With Court Involvement: </span><span class="font15">What if a doctor or a hospital intends to get a court order to transfuse your child? Is this the time to quit, assuming that there Is nothing more that can be done? By no means! It may still be possible to avert a transfusion. Preparation for such a possibility should be made ahead of time. What can be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">” Understanding some of the legal principles that guide or influence hospitals and judges in these matters will help you greatly in making a defense. One such principle of fundamental Importance is the fact that the law does not give parents unlimited authority to accept or refuse medical treatment for their children. Although adults generally have the right to accept or refuse medical treatment as they wish, parents are not free to refuse treatment considered necessary for their child's welfare even when their refusal Is based on sincerely held religious beliefs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>14</sup> This basic principle was reflected In the 1944 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said: “Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can make that choice for themselves.&quot; This same primary concern for the child’s physical health and welfare is embodied in childwelfare laws today. These laws, which are aimed at child abuse, are also designed to protect children from medical neglect</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>15</sup> Protecting children from parental abuse and neglect certainly is not objectionable to Christian parents. But child-neglect laws and the Supreme Court statement quoted above often are inappropriately applied to cases involving children of Jehovah's Witnesses. Why? For one thing, Witness parents have no intention of “martyr&quot; their children. If they did, why would they take their children to the hospital in the first place? On the contrary. Witness parents willingly seek medical treatment for their children. They love their children and want them to have good health. But they believe they have a God-given duty to choose responsibly the kind of medical treatment that is best for their children. They want their children’s health problems managed without blood. Not only is such alternative nonblood care better and safer than blood but, most important, it keeps their children in the favor of the great Life-Giver, Jehovah God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15">*• Despite the benefits of nonblood medical management, many doctors and child-welfare officials view transfusion therapy as standard medical practice that may be necessary or even lifesaving in certain circumstances. Thus, when Witness parents refuse recommended transfusions, problems can arise. Generally speaking, doctors cannot lawfully treat children without the parents’ consent. To overcome the lack of parental consent to use blood, doctors or other hospital personnel may seek consent from a Judge in the form of a court order. Such court-authorized consent may be obtained through child-welfare officials or by doctors or by hospital officials acting to protect the child from alleged medical neglect?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>17</sup> Many times court orders authorizing the use of blood are obtained very quickly with little or no notice to the parents. Doctors, hospital administrators, or child-welfare officials try to justify such expedited orders by claiming there is a medical emergency that does not allow time for the parents to be fully informed of what is going on. Often under questioning, however, doctors have admitted that a real emergency does not exist and that</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">• When there is a present, ongoing emergency which, in the doctor's opinion, requires immediate attention, may treatments deemed necessary to the child's life or health (including blood transfusions) be lawfully provided without either parental or judicial consent. Of course, a physician must be accountable when he relies on this emergency power in the law </span><span class="font15">they want a court order “just in case&quot; a transfusion might, in their opinion, become necessary in the future. As the natural guardians of your child, you have a fundamental right to know what doctors, hospital administrators, or child-welfare officials are doing with respect to your child at all times. The law requires that, if at all possible, you should be Informed of efforts to obtain a court order and should be allowed to present your side of the dispute before the court.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>18</sup> These legal realities highlight the value of finding a cooperative doctor Work with him, and with assistance from members of your Hospital Liaison Committee, help him pursue nonblood management of your child’s medical problem or have your child transferred to a doctor or hospital that will provide such treatment. But if there are signs that the doctor, hospital administrator, or child-welfare worker is contemplating obtaining a court order, you should be alert to ask if twills is what is being planned. Sometimes this is done secretly by telephone. If there is a plan to go to court, emphasize that you want to know about it so that you can present your side to the judge also. (Prov. 18:17) If there is time, it often is advisable to seek the help of an attorney. On some occasions attorneys have been appointed by the court. If you have your own or a court-appointed attorney, the Society’s Legal Department can share information with him that will help him make the best defense possible under the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">*• If your refusal of blood is taken to court, the doctor's opinion that blood is necessary to preserve your child’s life or health can be very persuasive. The judge, as a medical layman, will usually defer to the doctor’s medical expertise. This is especially true when parents are given little or no opportunity to present their side of the case and the doctor, without challenge, is allowed to express his claims about the “urgent&quot; need for blood. Such one sided proceedings are not conducive to determining the truth. The fact is, when and why doctors feel blood Ls needed is highly subjective and uncertain. Often, when one doctor says blood is absolutely necessary to save a child's life, another doctor, experienced in managing the same medical problem without blood, will say blood is not necessary to treat the patient</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“ What will you do if an attorney or a judge asks you why you are refusing a “lifesaving&quot; transfusion for your child? Although your first inclination might be to explain your belief in the resurrection and express your strong faith that God will bring your child back if he dies, such an answer by itself may do no more than convince the judge, whose paramount concern is the physical welfare of the child, that you are a religious fanatic and that he must step in to protect your child.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>21</sup> What the court needs to know Is that, although you are refusing blood on deeply held religious grounds, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">you are not refusing medical care.</span><span class="font15"> The judge needs to see that you are not neglectful or abusive parents but, rather, loving parents who want their child treated. You simply do not agree that the alleged benefits of blood outweigh its potentially lethal hazards and complications, especially when medical alternatives that do not carry these risks are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“ Depending on the situation, you might make known to the judge that it is the opinion of one doctor that blood Is needed, but doctors differ in their approaches, and you would like the opportunity to find a doctor who will care for your child with widely available methods of nonblood management. With the help of the Hospital Liaison Committee, you may have already found such a doctor who will treat your child without blood and who may give helpful testimony in court, perhaps by telephone. Likely the liaison committee will be able to sliare with the judge—even the doctor pressing for the court order-—medical articles that show how your child’s medical problem can be effectively managed without the use of blood.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>23</sup> When judges are called upon to issue court orders hastily, often they have not considered or been reminded of the many dangers of blood, including AIDS, hepatitis, and a host of other hazards. You can point these out to the judge, and you can also make known to him that you, as a Christian parent, would view the use of another person’s blood in an effort to sustain life as a serious violation of God’s law and that forcing blood upon your child would be viewed as tantamount to rape. You and your child (if old enough to have his own convictions) can explain your abhorrence for such bodily invasion and can appeal to the judge not to grant an order but to permit you to pursue alternative medical management for your child.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>24</sup> When a proper defense is made, judges are able to see more clearly the other side—your side—as parents. 'Phen they are not so quick to authorize a transfusion. In some cases judges have severely restricted the doctor’s freedom to use blood, even requiring that alternatives be considered first, or have given parents the opportunity to find doctors who will treat without blood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>25</sup> In dealing with those seeking to force a transfusion, it is essential that you never give any evidence of wavering in your convictions. Judges (and doctors) sometimes ask if parents would have any difficulty &quot;transferring&quot; to them the responsibility for the decision to transfuse, feeling that this would make it easier for the parents to live with their conscience. But it should be made clear to all concerned that you, as parents, feel an obligation to continue to do all that you can to avoid a transfusion. This is your God-given responsibility. It is not transferable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>24</sup> Hence, in speaking with doctors and judges, you need to be prepared to state your position clearly and convincingly. If a court order is issued despite your best efforts, continue to implore the physician not to transfuse and urge alternative treatment. Continue to seek His willingness to consider medical articles and the advice of any doctors who are willing to be consulted on the medical problem so as to avoid blood. On more than one occasion, an apparently unyielding doctor has come from the operating room and proudly announced that he did not use blood. So, even after a court order has been issued, never give up, regardless!—See June 15,1991, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font15">&quot;Questions From Readers.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>27</sup> Remember, Jesus said: “Be on your guard against men; for they will deliver you up to local courts ... You will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.&quot; For our comfort under such circumstances, Jesus added that the holy spirit would help us recall what would be appropriate and beneficial to say on such occasions.—Matt. 10: 10-20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15"><sup>29</sup> “He that is showing insight in a matter will find good, and happy is he that is trusting in Jehovah.&quot; (Prov. 16:20) Parents, make the necessary preparations in advance to protect your child from a spiritually contaminating blood transfusion. (Prov. 22:3) Children, respond to the training of your parents in making these preparations and apply them to your heart. As a family, “be firmly resolved not to eat the blood... that it may go well with you&quot; because of having Jehovah’s blessing and smile of approval.—Deut. 12:23-25.</span></p></li></ul><img src="1992_fc_E_files/1992_fc_E-33.jpg" alt="" style="width:321pt;height:561pt;">

<p><span class="font25">WHEN PHYSICIANS APPEAL TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND JUDGES FOR ORDERS TO TRANSFUSE CHILDREN OF JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Legal/ethical/social factors that reasonably should be considered before decision is made:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In brief:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">1. Jehovah’s Witnesses are not opposed to medical treatment, only blood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">2. Has the local Hospital Liaison Committee for Jehovah’s Witnesses been contacted for assistance?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">3. Does a true emergency exist?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">4. Have the parents been heard from if at all possible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">5. Has treatment with alternative nonblood management been fully explored?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">6. Have the hazards of using blood been fully considered?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">7. If a court order is issued, are limitations appropriate?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">More details on the above points are discussed below:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">1. Jehovah’s Witnesses are </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font19"> opposed to medical treatment in general. Witness parents have no desire to “martyr” their children for the sake of their religion. On the contrary, they want their children to enjoy good health and to receive necessary medical care. It is just blood transfusions that they refuse in favor of alternative nonblood medical management.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">2. The local Hospital Liaison Committee should be consulted as early as possible to help resolve the problem. As this manual shows, members of such committees have information on nonblood management as well as the names of physicians who may be consulted on or assist in providing nonblood management of the problem at hand. (Names and telephone numbers of members of the nearest liaison committee appear on the last page under the tab “Network.”)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">3. If the doctor says the child’s life or health is in serious danger unless a transfusion is given, how valid is the claim? If a bona fide emergency exists, likely the doctor would not need a court order to treat the child legally. So why is the physician petitioning the court for an order in this case to give him permission to use blood?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">4. If at all possible, the parents should be heard from and given the chance to present evidence about effective nonblood management and to question the doctor’s opinion about the need for blood. While one physician may feel only blood will preserve the life or health of the child, often more knowledgeable or experienced doctors will realize the patient can be managed with acceptable and effective medical care that is an alternative to blood. Have other physicians, providing at least an independent second opinion, examined the patient? What are their recommendations?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">5. Nonblood medical management for many health problems afflicting minors is reported as effective care in the medical literature, even in emergency situations. Such alternative care should be fully explored in all cases involving the children of Witness parents.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">6. Has due consideration been given to all the lethal risks involved in giving blood, such as AIDS, hepatitis, and so forth?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">Alleged benefits should be weighed against known risks before making any medical decision. Are all concerned aware of the emotional trauma that would be imposed upon the patient/family if there is a forced transfusion?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">7. When considering the above information, many judges (especially when </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font19"> clear emergency does not exist or the alleged need for blood remains speculative or unclear) have seen a basis for refusing authority to give blood, while encouraging further diligent effort to treat the child with alternatives to blood, as requested by the parents. When some judges have felt compelled by the circumstances and the law to issue a court order to permit blood, they have considered the following questions:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">(a) Could limitations be placed in the order pertaining to when and how blood might be used? For example, the physician could be required to use or consider the use of reasonable alternatives and record in the child’s medical chart why blood was deemed necessary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">(b) Since blood is the only issue, could the order be limited to only matters having to do with blood, without taking away parental authority to make other medical decisions for their child?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">(c) Could a time limit be put on the order, showing a specific expiration date or time for judicial review?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font21">MEDICAL NEGLECT REQUIRE CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Before a parent's choice of medical treatment is adjudged neglectful and a child is determined to be in need of protection, knowledge about the medical treatment in question is essential. Thus, in cases involving parents who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, knowledge about transfusion practice in general and about the particular transfusion situation at hand is of the utmost importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">When disruption of families and interference with parental authority over children is at stake, the danger of assuming the medical facts can hardly be overemphasized. As writers have observed: “The necessity of the recommended treatment is not an assumption in refusal cases. Rather, the necessity of the recommended treatment is a key issue to be resolved in each refusal case.” Clarke, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Choice to Refuse or Withhold Medical Treatment: The Emerging Technology and Medical-Ethical Consensus,</span><span class="font19"> 13 Creighton L. Rev. 795, 795 n.l (1980). “The issue of compulsory treatment should only be reached after the medical diagnosis is found to be sound. In determining whether the judgment is sound, the opinion of the doctors seeking authorization should be carefully scrutinized in view of their involvement.” Note, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Compulsory Medical Treatment: The State's Interest Re-evaluated,</span><span class="font19"> 51 Minn. L. Rev. 293,304 (1966). Such “[j Judicial scrutiny ... must include painstaking inquiry into the alleged necessity and efficacy of the proposed intervention and into the availability of. .. alternatives.” Gallagher, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Prenatal Invasions &amp;&nbsp;Interventions: What’s Wrong With Fetal Rights,</span><span class="font19"> 10 Harv. Women’s L.J. 9, 55 (1987).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Even in emergencies there is need for careful examination of the facts. A Council of Judges for the National Council on Crime and Delinquency explained:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">[Although an emergency may exist from the physician’s point of view, the person may not in fact be </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">in extremis. </span><span class="font19">This Does not imply that doctors do not testify in good faith as to a person's likelihood of surviving a crisis without undergoing a particular procedure. It means, rather, that medical knowledge is not sufficiently advanced to enable a physician to predict with reasonable certainty that his patient will live or die or will suffer a permanent physical impairment or deformity. Doctors tend to urge the imposition of a treatment when, in their expert opinion, death or permanent physical impairment is more likely to occur if the treatment is not given than if it is. However, it is the duty of the court to determine the seriousness of the emergency in a particular case, to press the testifying physician on the imminent likelihood of death or impairment, the chance of survival or of alleviation of prolonged agonizing pain if the proposed treatment is given, and the danger of the treatment itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">National Council on Crime and Delinquency, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Guides to the Judge in Medical Orders Affecting Children,</span><span class="font19"> Crime &amp;&nbsp;Dclinq., Apr. 1968 at 109,116. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">See also</span><span class="font19"> Health Law Center, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">The Hospital Law Manual </span><span class="font19">H 1-9, at 17 (Supp. 1990) (“[d]etermining whether the degree of urgency is sufficient to constitute an emergency ... is a factual question”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Just because the ready use of blood has been or may be the standard or preferred choice of treatment does not mean the case cannot be managed without transfused blood. Numerous cases involving Jehovah’s Witnesses have shown that patients can be successfully managed without administering blood, despite physicians’ dire predictions that blood was or would be necessary to save the patient’s life or avoid serious injury.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark47">1</a></sup><sup></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Judicial scrutiny of the medical details of any request for court-authorized treatment is of the utmost importance in view of the fact that “[hjealth care professionals often reflect their own value preferences when they favor one alternative over another.” If alternatives are available, the parents’ choice of treatment should be accommodated. President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Making Health Care Decisions,</span><span class="font19"> 42 (1982). As the President’s Commission explained:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">[Health care providers and others have an obligation to see that patients can choose among a range of available and potentially beneficial treatments.

<p><span class="font19">undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection. It is plain that the interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children “come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.” </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Kovacs v.

Ed. 2d 101 (1979):</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Our jurisprudence historically has reflected Western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children. Our cases have consistently followed that course; our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is ‘‘the mere creature of the State” and, on the contrary, asserted that parents generally “have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare [their children) for additional obligations.”. . . The law’s concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life’s difficult decisions. More important, historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Id. at 602,99 S. Ct. at 2504,61 L. Ed. 2d at 118.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Moore v. City of East Cleveland,</span><span class="font19"> 431 U.S. 494, 506, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 1939, 52 L. Ed. 2d 531, 541 (1977), the Supreme Court explained that “the Constitution prevents [the government] from standardizing its children—and its adults—by forcing all to live in certain narrowly defined family patterns.” Similarly, in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Meyer v. Nebraska,</span><span class="font19"> 262 U.S. 390,402,43 S. Ct. 625,628,67 L. Ed. 1042, 1046 (1923), the Supreme Court had observed that the government’s desire “to foster a homogeneous people with American ideals” does not justify interference with fundamental liberties. These expressions apply with full force to a parent’s liberty interest in caring for and managing his child’s physical health and welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The state’s general interest in seeing that parents provide for their children’s medical needs should not devolve into rigid, state-mandated standards for parental decision-making in matters of health care. The uncertainty and subjectivity of medical practice make hard and fast rules unrealistic and unreasonable. To suggest that what is routine among doctors should become mandatory for parents is to replace parental choice with professional preference. As the court said </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">In re Cicero,</span><span class="font19"> 101 Mise. 2d 699, 421 N.Y.S.2d 965 (Sup. Ct. 1979): “Certainly, every physician who prefers a course of treatment rejected by a parent is not privileged to have the court decide upon the treatment under its </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">parens patriae</span><span class="font19"> powers.” </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Id.</span><span class="font19"> at 702, 421 N.Y.S.2d at 968.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Choice of medical treatment naturally and logically lies with the parents. As the Supreme Court said in </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Parham v.J.R.,</span><span class="font19"> 442 U.S. 584, 603, 99 S. Ct. 2493, 2504-05, 61 L. Ed. 2d 101, 119 (1979): “Simply because the decision of a parent . . . involves risks does not automatically transfer the power to make that decision from the parents to some agency or officer of the state.” If at all possible, parental choice should especially be respected when uncertainty, controversy, and danger attend the medical intervention sought to be imposed. In this regard, the balanced position of the New York Court of Appeals is worthy of note:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">[ T]he most significant factor in determining whether a child is being deprived of adequate medical care ... is whether the parents have provided an acceptable course of medical treatment... in light of all the surrounding circumstances. This inquiry cannot be posed in terms of whether the parent has made a “right” or a “wrong” decision, for the present state of the practice of medicine, despite its vast advances, very seldom permits such definitive conclusions. Nor can a court assume the role of a surrogate parent and establish as the objective criteria with which to evaluate a parent's decision its own judgment as to the exact method or degree of medical treatment which should be provided, for such standard is fraught with subjectivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">In re Hofbauer,</span><span class="font19"> 47 N.Y.2d 648, 656, 393 N.E.2d 1009, 1014, 419 N.Y.S.2d 936, 940-41 (1979). Professor Joseph Goldstein of the Yale Law School made the same point when he wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Precisely because there is no objectively wrong or right answer, the burden must be on the state to establish </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">wrong,</span><span class="font19"> not on the parent to establish that what is </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font19"> for them is necessarily </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font19"> for others. Indeed it is in just such cases that the Constitution, which separates church and, to a different degree, science from state, dictates abstention from imposing one group’s orthodoxy about health care or truth about the meaning of life or, for that matter, death upon another.</span></p>

The Maine high court ruled that expressions the young man had made before the car accident that had rendered him incapacitated were sufficiently clear and informed to warrant the law’s respect. As the Swan court explained:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The fact that [the patient] made these declarations as to medical treatment before he reached the age of 18 is at most a factor to be considered by the factfinder in assessing the seriousness and deliberateness with which his declarations were made. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">See Slate v.

<p><span class="font25">ACCOMMODATING JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES’ CHOICE OF NONBLOOD MANAGEMENT<a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark49">3</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The following article was written by Donald T. Ridley, attorney, Brooklyn, N.Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Jehovah’s Witnesses want good medical care. They are not opposed to medicine and they do not believe in or practice any kind of faith or spiritual healing. Yet because of their choice of medical treatment without blood transfusion, Witnesses regularly encounter opposition from health care providers. When a Witness parent or patient refuses blood, medical personnel and hospital administration may pressure the family or the patient to accept it, or the hospital may seek court authority to administer the transfusions against the parent’s or patient’s will. Such confrontations are frustrating for all involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">With the number of Jehovah’s Witnesses and their associates in the United States now totaling more than 1.8 million and growing, the prospect of ongoing conflict between Witness patients and health care providers is very real. It is hoped that improved understanding of the Witnesses’ motivations and concerns will help avoid or at least minimize future conflict. This article will discuss the basis for the Witnesses’ choice of alternative nonblood management, the problems with the health care industry’s typical handling of Witness families and patients, and the benefits to the industry and the Witnesses from dealing with the Witnesses in a spirit of cooperation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Jehovah’s Witnesses and Blood</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Jehovah’s Witnesses respect the gift of life and believe they have an obligation to God to safeguard their own and their children’s health. The Witnesses do not smoke, use illicit drugs, overindulge in alcohol, or practice abortion. When they are sick, they freely seek medical care. However, in seeking such care, Jehovah’s Witnesses obey the plain Biblical directive to “abstain . . . from blood” (Acts 15:28, 29). For Jehovah's Witnesses, abstaining from blood is a very serious matter. In the same Bible passage directing Christians to abstain from blood, Christians also are told to abstain from idolatry and fornication. Jehovah’s Witnesses therefore view the violation of God’s word on blood to be as serious a wrong as engaging in false worship or sexual immorality; also, they consider the forcible, nonconsensual ad ministration of blood to be morally equivalent to rape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Although Jehovah’s Witnesses view their relationship with their God and their obedience to his word to be of the highest importance, they also are aware of the many hazards and complications of transfusion therapy (ref. 1). Notwithstanding the popular medical opinion of our day, Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that Jehovah God, as man’s creator and as the creator of blood, knows infinitely more about the use of blood than any human or group of humans will ever know. Indeed, the Witnesses’ confidence in the wisdom of Jehovah’s prohibition of blood continues to be confirmed by medical science. The growing professional acknowledgment and public awareness of the hazards and complications of transfusion therapy strengthens the Witnesses’ conviction about the benefits to be gained from heeding God’s word.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Uncertainty of Transfusion Practice</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">The Witnesses’ choice of nonblood management of their medical and surgical needs is therefore not a reckless decision based on blind faith. It is an informed choice that comports not only with Scripture, but also with an acceptable standard of medical care. It must candidly be acknowledged that although blood transfusion certainly has attained the status of “standard” practice, it is a practice based on very little science. As the U.S. Congress’ Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) Task Force recently observed: “[D]ata by which to evaluate the overall appropriate use of blood products do not exist, in many cases because of lack of scientific precision concerning when a component or derivative should be administered” (ref. 2). This same report noted that “[b]oth blood suppliers and users agree that blood is overused and used inappropriately” (ref. 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Corroborating those statements, a recent survey of anesthesiologists &quot;confirmed the existence of widespread variations in transfusion practices... It would appear that many transfusion practices are based on habit rather than scientific data” (ref. 4). As the OTA Task Force concluded, “To some extent, then, controversy surrounds the appropriate use of all blood products” (ref. 5). Thus, although it might sound extreme to say so, clinical practice and the literature show that transfusion therapy is largely a matter of habit resting on anecdotal assumption and guesswork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Au example of a transfusion practice being dictated by medical habit as opposed to medical science was the focus of a recent consensus conference convened by the National Institutes of Health to review perioperative red cell transfusion practice, including the long-observed requirement that a patient have 10 grams of hemoglobin before receiving an anesthetic. The report of this consensus conference concluded that “the available evidence does not support the necessity of the ‘10/30’ (100/.30) rule. However, the literature is remarkable for the absence of carefully controlled, randomized trials that would permit definitive conclusions regarding perioperative transfusion practice” (ref. 6). One speaker described this rule as “a myth” whose origin was “cloaked in tradition, shrouded in obscurity, and unsubstantiated by clinical or experimental evidence” (ref. 7). A major textbook of transfusion medicine agrees: “[RJules of thumb about when to transfuse, optimal hematocrit levels, and other such notions are unrealistic” (ref. 8). Information such as this does little to bolster confidence in the “science” of transfusion therapy.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Alternative Nonblood Management</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">In contrast to the general uncertainty of transfusion practice is the certainty of its dangers. Although medical science has known that many serious, potentially lethal hazards and complications attend all blood transfusions, the advent of AIDS has stimulated reexamination of all aspects of transfusion practice. For example, the recent report of the Presidential commission on the HIV epidemic exposes the error in assuming that what is or has been standard practice is necessarily good practice. Casting much doubt on the accepted standards of transfusion practice for the past several decades, the report stated: &quot;[T]hc surest preventive measure with regard to the blood supply is to eliminate exposure of a patient to the blood of others ...” (ref. 9). The Presidential commission recommended that informed consent be obtained before the administration of any blood product. The commission explained that the process of obtaining such consent</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">should include an explanation of the risks involved with the transfusion of blood and its components, including the possibility of HIV infection, and information about appropriate alternatives to homologous blood transfusion therapy. These specifically include predeposit autologous blood, intraoperative autologous transfusion, hemodilution techniques, and postoperative collection (ref. 10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The same commission also made the following more comprehensive recommendation (ref. 11):</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">In health care facilities, all reasonable strategies to avoid homologous transfusion (blood from others) should be implemented including predeposit autologous transfusions, hemodilution techniques, intraoperative autologous transfusions, and postoperative collection. Health care facilities should offer aggressive in-service training to their staff, particularly blood banking and transfusion services personnel, to bring them up-to-date on current autologous transfusion therapy techniques (ref. 11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Some of the methods of alternative nonblood management recommended by the Presidential commission (that is, intraoperative blood salvage, hemodilution, and some methods of postoperative blood salvage) have been sought by Jehovah’s Witnesses for years (ref. 12). Moreover, as reflected in the medical literature, the experience of Jehovah's Witnesses shows that all nature of medical and surgical care has been safely and successfully managed without blood (ref. 13).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Current Response to Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">The health care industry’s reluctance to acknowledge the uncertainty, subjectivity, and danger of transfusion practice, together with its general unawareness of the effectiveness of alternative nonblood management, have shaped the way health care providers and courts of law deal with Jehovah’s Witnesses. A single doctor’s opinion that blood is “needed” to save the patient’s life sets the tone. Witness parents and patients are viewed as people who refuse “life-saving” treatment rather than as people making an informed choice between alternative courses of management. In the minds of many hospital administrators, risk managers, and hospital counsel, Witnesses are grouped with those asserting a right to die. Not surprisingly, when such matters are brought before courts of law, it is this right-to-die characterization that imbues the proceeding; the hazards and complications of blood are either ignored completely or cursorily brushed aside because of the attending physician’s opinion that transfusions are needed to save the patient’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Such courtroom confrontations often begin when either hospital policy or a member of the medical team demands the use or at least the availability of blood for the proposed intervention. Although the Witness parent’s or patient’s choice of nonblood management is known to the attending physician, hospital administration, and hospital personnel from the outset, conflict over that choice often does not arise until the eleventh hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Initial attempts to “resolve” the conflict may include coordinated efforts to pressure or frighten the patient into consenting to the use of blood. Doctors, hospital personnel, and nurses will talk of certain death without blood and of never seeing loved ones again. They may also threaten to obtain a court order in any event if the family or patient does not acquiesce. In anticipation of the proposed intervention, such tactics do little to calm any patient old enough to sense such pressure (ref. 14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">If such efforts at intimidation are unsuccessful, the hospital may indeed take steps to obtain a court order. The family or the patient often is not informed of the hospital’s actions until much later, if at all (ref. 15). Despite this lack of timely notice, indications that court intervention is being sought can be seen in the administration’s and the medical team’s sudden change of attitude, from one of hostility to one of either uncharacteristic solicitude or concerted silence in which all responsible persons mysteriously disappear and are unavailable to answer any questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">If the family or the patient does receive notice of the hospital's petition or complaint, they usually have only a few hours or minutes to prepare their response. Once before the court, the hospital attorney and the doctor do their best to make things appear as cut and dried as possible—blood equals life, no blood equals death. The Witness parent or patient is politely portrayed as an unthinking religious fanatic whose child or life must be saved by the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">There is little the parent or patient can do to counter such misrepresentation because the attending physician is usually the only medical expert to testify and the parent or patient has had no time to retain an attorney or consult other doctors. Evidence about the uncertainty and danger of transfusion therapy or about effective alternative management rarely is heard. Thus, with the alleged death of the patient looming over the entire proceeding, the judge (a medical layperson) generally defers to the only expert medical testimony adduced and does nothing more than rubber-stamp the doctor’s opinion (ref. 16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">When proceedings are so hurriedly convened and conducted, they are adversarial in form only—there is no real seareh for the truth, no real cross-examination of the attending physician, nor any independent expert testimony about the alleged need for blood. The usual care and deliberateness of the judicial process are abandoned in the face of the attending physician's untested and unchallenged cries of “life-threatening emergency” (ref. 17). The result invariably is a court order authorizing not only blood but all &quot;necessary” treatment, even though it is only blood that is at issue.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark57"></a>The Need for Change</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">The lack of basic procedural fairness in such irregular proceedings is patent. Substantive constitutional and common law rights also are violated. Invasion of the parent-child relationship and the nonconsensual administration of medical treatment necessarily implicate f undamental rights of parental autonomy and individual self-determination. Public hospitals are “state actors” for federal civil rights purposes and are liable for deprivations of such rights. And although private hospitals are not themselves state actors, they too are subject to liability under federal law when they work in concert with or perhaps direct state actors (social workers, child welfare agencies, courts of law) in depriving families or patients of their federal civil rights. In addition, in many states, hospitals, whether public or private, are places of public accommodation and are statutorily prohibited from discriminating in providing services on the basis of religion (ref. 18). Hastily issued orders obtained on dubious procedural and substantive grounds do not insulate doctors or hospitals from liability (ref. 19).</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Blood transfusion is a “dangerous,&quot; “error-prone” intervention that unavoidably exposes the patient to “substantial&quot; and “significant” risk (ref. 20). Such risk should not be forcibly imposed on unwilling families or patients simply because many doctors believe the risk is worth it. Assuming there also are risks with nonblood management, the question is not which risks should be chosen but who should make the choice of risk. Who is to say what is right or best for a particular patient when there are risks no matter which choice is made?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Arguments about the “routine” and “nonextraordinary” nature of blood transfusion are unavailing. They ignore the lethal hazards and complications of blood and put institutional values ahead of individual self-determination. The controlling consideration should not be what the medical profession views to be routine, nonextraordinary treatment, but what the individual views as acceptable. In a matter as subjective and value-laden as choice of medical treatment, it is the values and preferences of the family or individual patient, not those of some doctor, hospital, or judge, that should control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">By disregarding the uncertainty and danger of transfusion therapy and by failing to inform themselves about the feasibility of nonblood management, health care providers complacently assume that blood transfusion is the medically (and therefore the ethically and legally) “right” or “correct” way to treat certain medical problems. Such a pat, idealized vision of medical practice replaces parental and individual choice with professional habit. If a parent’s or patient’s choice is to be respected only when the doctor agrees, the choice is entirely the doctor’s and respect for the family or the individual is a charade.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Accommodating Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Jehovah’s Witnesses want to avoid confrontation. They are ready to do what they can to help health care providers accommodate their choice of alternative nonblood management. The Witnesses realize that such accommodation often will not come easily. They realize that most practitioners are unfamiliar with and therefore doubtful about alternative nonblood management. The Witnesses also realize that, to a great degree, a provider’s dealings with Witness patients and families are beyond the control of risk managers. The habits of the medical profession establish standards of practice. Largely on the basis of those standards, health care insurers and hospital counsel establish hospital policy for liability avoidance. Risk managers are therefore in the position of enforcing policies adopted by others. And because those others are often licensed professionals, risk managers undoubtedly would feel and be viewed as presumptuous if they were to question doctors about their transfusion habits or hospital counsel about their institutional policies. In view of these realities, the Witnesses have taken steps to help health care providers accommodate Witness patients. In more than 100 major U.S. cities, hospital liaison committees of Jehovah’s Witnesses are active in meeting with physicians, medical societies, hospital representatives, and risk managers. Coordinated by the Hospital Information Services department at the Witnesses’ national headquarters in Brooklyn, NY (ref. 21), the members of those local committees have been trained to work as intermediaries to help avoid conflict whenever possible. Each committee maintains directories of cooperative doctors for purposes of consultation and possible transfer. If a specialist offering nonblood management is not available locally, committee members can contact neighboring committees or the national office for names of the nearest cooperative physicians or hospitals. The local liaison committees, under the oversight of the national office, are ready to provide help not only to Witness families, but also to doctors, hospitals, and risk managers.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Conclusion</span></h5>
<p><span class="font19">Medical treatment forcibly administered against a parent's or patient’s will should not be viewed as an acceptable solution to the Witnesses’ choice of alternative nonblood management. The handling of Witness patients described in this article is usually the product of institutional authority exercised for the perceived welfare of the institution, not the patient. Many times insurers, and therefore hospital counsel, administration, and risk management, appear to be more concerned about dollars than about the humane and respectful treatment of families and individual patients. This approach produces needless confrontation, which, in turn, creates added liability concerns. There is a better way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Jehovah’s Witnesses are trying to work with and improve communications with health care providers. They want cooperation, not confrontation. However, providers also must be willing to cooperate. The Witnesses are not going to go away. If the violations of their fundamental rights continue, confrontations will continue. Surely, cooperation is the better way.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">INTRODUCTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The risks in accepting a blood transfusion and the refusal of some to receive blood on religious and conscientious grounds have motivated caring physicians to develop many alternative ways to treat the patient. Actually, having to select and use alternative management in a case is not unusual in the practice of medicine. When one therapy is not acceptable or available, the doctor gives thought to using an acceptable alternative. This is part of weighing the benefits against the risks and making choices of therapy. Such alternative management can often be provided without reducing the level of care needed by the patient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Presented on the following pages are techniques developed and used by leading medical professionals for treating their patients who object to blood. These treatments have proved to be effective, even in emergency situations. In many instances they represent the cutting edge of medical practice. Not all physicians may be familiar with some of these techniques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Table of Contents, located on the next page for easy reference, shows some of the most common maladies of young children. Turning to the respective tabs will provide information that supports the validity of alternative nonblood medical management, as reported in medical publications. Parents who are Jehovah’s Witnesses respectfully ask for such medical care, since it does not conflict with their deep religious convictions, nor violate their conscience as to use of blood.</span></p>

We found widespread deficiencies in physicians’ knowledge of transfusion risks and indications.... Attending physicians routinely had lower knowledge scores than did residents, yet they exhibited more confidence in their knowledge. Residents’ transfusion decisions, however, were strongly influenced by the desires of their attending physicians, resulting in their ordering potentially inappropriate transfusions. Of the residents surveyed, 61% indicated that they ordered transfusions that they judged unnecessary at least once a month because a more senior physician suggested that they do so.”</span></p>

For the most part, controlled scientific studies have not been performed to clearly establish the indications for the transfusion of blood components to neonates.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Page 906: “Generally, RBC transfusion is performed to maintain a level of hematocrit believed to be most desirable for each neonate’s clinical status. It is widely recognized that this clinical approach is imprecise, and consideration of more physiologic indications such as RBC mass, available oxygen, and measurements of oxygen delivery and tissue extraction has been suggested.... Clearly established indications for neonatal RBC transfusions, based on controlled scientific studies, do not exist. In many clinical situations, the need for RBC transfusion seems logical, but often efficacy has not been established, and a complete understanding of the risks is lacking. Because of the limited data available, it is important that pediatricians critically evaluate the following recommendations in light of neonatal practice at their institutions.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">&quot;Maintaining normovolemia with crystalloid solutions appeared to be a significant factor in preventing morbidity and mortality. Another report describes 100 patients undergoing major surgery with blood losses greater than 1000 ml who were treated with Hartmann solution (lactated Ringer solution: NaCl, 102 meq/liter; KCl,4 meq/liter; CaCl<sub>2</sub> 3.5 meq/ liter; and sodium lactate, 27 meq/liter), using two to three times the estimated volume of blood lost. Postoperative mortality and morbidity were not affected by the lack of blood, and there were no unexpected complications.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Page 1634: &quot;The necessity for transfusing blood to patients with chronic stable anemia is rare. Blood transfusion of such patients is probably unjustifiable if the hemoglobin level is above 7 g/dl... There may be significant misuse of blood transfusions in patients with chronic anemia. Data from 300 hospitals over a 1-ycar period (1974) revealed that 401 nonoperated patients with anemia were transfused, even though they had a hemoglobin concentration greater than 10 g/dl. There is no evidence that this abuse of blood transfusion has changed markedly ...</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">Page 1090: &quot;Transfusion may have impaired oxygen utilization by its effects on the oxyhemoglobin affinity curve.

<p><span class="font19">“Regimens that improve VO<sub>2</sub> are now being advocated as important in the treatment of septic shock, since maximizing VO<sub>2</sub> may improve survival from septic shock (1, 2,4-7).

<p><span class="font29">BLOOD RISKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Blood transfusions have received a title of standard care among physicians, but it is also universally recognized that there are dangers and therefore definite risks involved with receiving a blood transfusion. Such risks should be clearly understood by the patient or guardian so that proper evaluation of the dangers versus the alleged benefits can be made. Moreover, when patients who are Jehovah’s Witnesses refuse transfusions primarily because of their deep religious convictions, there are added significant reasons for treating the patient without transfusions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Report of the Presidential Commission on the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Epidemic</span><span class="font21"> stated: “Informed consent for transfusion of blood or its components should include an explanation of the risks involved with the transfusion of blood and its components, including the possibility of HIV infection, and information about appropriate alternatives to homologous blood transfusion therapy. . . . In health care facilities, all reasonable strategies to avoid homologous transfusion (blood from others) should be implemented.”—Page 79.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">1. HIV (AIDS)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">An acronym for the human immunodeficiency virus, which is a viral infection that suppresses human immunity, leading to early death. This infection is referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in its late clinical stage.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">2. Hepatitis A, B, C, D, NANBH</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">Hepatitis is the name given to a group of viruses that cause an infection of the liver with swelling of the liver and impaired liver function. The types, A, B, C, D, and NANBH, refer to the particular variety of hepatitis. Each variety has a different level of severity. The initial hepatitis infection can cause jaundice, vomiting, fever, weight loss, and weakness. In severe cases it can cause encephalopathy, internal bleeding, heart failure, and death.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">3. Cytomegalovirus</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A group of herpetoviruses that can infect the visceral, or internal, organs. Once infected, the virus can cause widespread damage and death. These infections are most commonly seen in newborn children or those with suppressed immune systems.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">4. Herpetovirus</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A group of double-stranded DNA viruses that cause various infections in humans. Most notable is herpes simplex and Epstein-Barr. Epstein-Barr has been found in cultures of Burkitt’s lymphoma, a malignant and deadly disease, and is also associated with infectious mononucleosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Bacterial Infections</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">5. Chagas’ Disease or South African Trypanosomiasis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">An infection caused by a parasite. In the acute phase, it can invade heart muscle, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and nervous tissue, resulting in heart failure and meningitis. Chronic disease problems include dilatation and malfunction of organs, as well as severe heart disease.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">6. Malaria</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">An infection caused by a parasite. These parasites invade red blood cells and begin reproducing within the host cells. After maturation, these new parasites are released into the bloodstream by rupturing the host cell. This activity can cause blood to be restricted in certain areas of the body, including vital organs such as the brain and heart. Severity ranges from mild symptoms to mortality in 20 to 30 percent of cases.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">7. Toxoplasmosis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">An infection caused by a parasite. This infection can cause inflammation of the joints, heart muscle, heart lining, lungs, and brain. If the patient survives the acute phase, a chronic latent phase develops with the formation of parasitic cysts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">8. Typhus</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">An infection caused by various rickettsias. Such a parasitic invasion of the body causes cell destruction. Severity ranges from mild headache and fever to renal and circulatory failure and death.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">9. Salmonellosis and Typhoid Fever</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A gram-negative bacilli infection. The bacilli cause the formation of large mononuclear cells in tissue of the lymph, liver, spleen, intestine, bone marrow, and lung. Cell death in areas of the intestinal tract can cause massive hemorrhage or perforation of the intestines. Other manifestations include inflammation of the brain, bone linings, joints, and kidneys: pneumonia; deafness; loss of hair; and hemolytic anemia. Relapse occurs in 5 to 10 percent of cases.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">10. Leishmaniasis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">An infection by a protozoan of the species </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">leishmania.</span><span class="font19"> Severity ranges from changes in skin and mouth lining to invasion of bone marrow, where growing infection pushes out normal bone marrow. This may result in a decrease in red and white blood cells, as well as clotting products.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">11. Syphilis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A chronic bacterial infection caused by </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Treponema pallidum.</span><span class="font19"> In its primary state, it causes skin lesions; in the secondary state, it may cause skin lesions, hair loss, fever, weakness, and inflammation of the brain, liver, and joints. Untreated cases may cause irreversible damage to the kidneys, brain, and heart, which can lead to early death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Immune Reactions and/or Suppression</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">12. Allergic Reaction to Transfused Blood</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A hypersensitivity to antigens found in blood or to certain blood proteins. May cause swelling, red patches, low blood pressure, heart palpitations, and difficulty in breathing. In extreme cases it may lead to anaphylaxis and death.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">13. Intravascular and Extravascular Hemolysis</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A very rapid red-cell destruction from incompatibility within die ABO system and from anti-Lc, anti-Jk, and anti-Fy antibodies. May cause anxiety, flushing, chest pain, and rapid breathing and heart rate. In severe cases it will have the appearance of shock and renal failure. Extravascular hemolysis is normally caused by Rh incompatibility and in acute stage is less severe but may cause complete rapid destruction of all transfused cells within a week,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">14. Graft-Versus-Host (GVH) Disease</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">An immune reaction caused by the presence of T cell lymphocytes from transfused blood. May present with anorexia, vomiting, skin eruptions, watery or bloody diarrhea, hyperbilirubinemia, and decrease in the number of all types of blood cells. The great majority of repotted cases of the disease have been fatal despite immunosuppressive therapy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">15. Immune System Suppression</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A condition of decreased immunity seen after blood transfusions. The exact cause of this condition is unknown. Such immune suppression increases incidence of cancer recurrence, and increases morbidity and mortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">Chemical/Metabolic Im balance</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">16. Circulatory Overload</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A condition in which the body’s circulatory system is not capable of meeting the demands placed on it. Transfusions can cause an elevated amount of fluid to accumulate, compromising the heart and other vital organs. The blood may also become viscous and decrease oxygen delivery to parts of the body.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">17. 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate Deficiency (2,3-DPG)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A chemical compound of red blood cells that changes their ability to carry oxygen. The 2,3-DPG levels of blood decrease rapidly when stored. Such transfused blood has a decreased ability to release oxygen to the cells, thus causing oxygen starvation at the cell level. Cell oxygen starvation occurs in spite of normal hemoglobin levels and apparent adequate color of the patient.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">18. Iron Overload</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">Increased red-cell destruction of transfused blood can increase the amount of iron in the body. Large amounts of iron accumulations in the body can cause loss of cell function, cell death, and organ failure. Normal body excretion of excess iron can take many years.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">19. Posttransfusion Thrombocytopenia</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">A condition of decreased platelet counts after the transfusion of blood. The transfused blood may have specific antibodies to the recipient’s platelets, thus destroying these platelets. This may cause purple areas on the skin and increased bleeding, and it may increase the risk of life-threatening massive hemorrhage.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">20. Electrolyte Imbalance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">Electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and carbonate, are maintained in balance by the body for its proper operation. Transfusions may introduce into this closed circuit an imbalance of these elements. Such imbalance may alter body metabolism and lead to shock, coma, or heart failure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">21. Plasticizer Toxicity</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">Plasticizers are chemicals used to make plastic polyvinyl chloride storage bags malleable and soft. Questions have arisen as to these chemicals being potential cancer-causing agents.</span></p>

The effects vary according to the type, duration, and intensity of the agent and part of body involved.

<p><span class="font21">The severity of a burn injury determines much of the course of treatment. The classification of burns is as follows: A first-degree burn is much like a sunburn; a second-degree burn has a characteristic blistering; a third-degree burn destroys nearly all the layers of skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Care during the acute phase of a serious burn injury is concentrated on maintaining fluids to keep the individual from dehydrating. Infections are also an important concern. Following this acute phase is the debridement phase, where the dead skin is scraped from the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Debridement can be associated with much blood loss unless certain techniques are used. The following section contains selected medical articles that explain these new techniques that are now available to treat burns.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Cancer is a medical condition in which normal cells have become altered. They begin to divide uncontrollably, since the normal inhibitions for division are not functioning. The body, nevertheless, continues to recognize these cells, though aberrant, as being part of the body and not foreign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Treatment is therefore targeted at destroying the cancer cells while leaving normal cells unaffected as far as possible. Since chemotherapy destroys rapidly dividing cells, it is an effective cancer treatment, but it also impairs or destroys normal body cells that divide rapidly, such as those of the skin, hair, digestive tract, and bone marrow. Stem cells, found in the bone marrow, grow to become blood cells. When the bone marrow is affected by the agents used to treat the cancer, deficiencies of the red and white cells and platelets can result. This, in turn, leads some physicians to feel that blood transfusions are necessary when treating cancer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">DEFINITION: “An acute or chronic disease in man and other warm-blooded animals characterized by an abnormal increase in the number of leukocytes in the tissues and often in the blood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Leukemia is a cancer that affects the blood-producing tissues of the body (bone marrow, spleen, and/or lymph nodes). The name is derived from the Greek word </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">leukos, </span><span class="font21">meaning “white” and the Latin word </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">emia,</span><span class="font21"> which refers to a “condition of the blood.” Hence, the name literally means “white blood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">As the name implies, leukemia results in an uncontrolled growth in the number of young, immature white cells in the blood. The overproduction of these cells can literally crowd out the other necessary blood components, such as red cells, platelets, and normal white cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Treatment of leukemia consists mainly of therapies that destroy the defective cells in the marrow that are producing these immature white cells. This treatment may also attack the cells that are producing the red cells and the platelets. Therapies to counteract these two conditions without requiring a blood transfusion are described in the following pages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">Page 920: &quot;The medical staff attending these patients spent several uneasy days watching the gradual decrease in the hemoglobin level. Even the simple test of obtaining a finger-stick hematocrit determination proved to be a major decision. But, as we cared for each succeeding patient, we became confident that patients could reasonably tolerate hemoglobin levels as low as 3 g/dl without significant difficulty. It is interesting to note that in all the cases presented, none of the children, whether they lived or died, had a significant change in outcome as a result of withholding transfusion therapy as compared with those given the benefits of transfusions. At the terminal phase of illness, transfusions might have altered the mode of demise, but death from the cancer could not be averted by any means available for any of the patients who died.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">&quot;When faced with the difficult conundrum of choosing between a short term medical risk and the long term risk of family disruption, many doctors tend to be guided only by medical priorities. .. . The short term medical risks, though hardly significant compared with the long term problems of family disruption, would have been the doctor's prime concern. The paediatrician would have been motivated by his standing with his peers, research workers, and lawyers, and not by the overall needs of the child. The child would have been serving the doctor’s professional needs.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">The fetus undergoes many changes that prepare it to live outside the womb. Infants born prematurely, depending on the gestational age, often experience health problems because their organs are not mature enough to fulfill body needs. For example, the lungs may have difficulty in absorbing oxygen; the bone marrow may not be mature enough to react properly to the oxygen-rich environment outside the mother; the immune system may have more difficulty fighting diseases, such as those transmitted by blood transfusions. Hospital care seeks to compensate for such deficiencies until there is normal development of body functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">For certain conditions, physicians may conclude that a blood transfusion is necessary. This section will discuss alternatives to treatment with blood.</span></p>

Clearly established indications for neonatal RBC transfusions, based on controlled scientific studies, do not exist.

<p><span class="font19">Hyperbilirubinemia is a condition in which the level of a substance called bilirubin is elevated. Bilirubin is a by-product of the destruction of red blood cells and is normally present to some degree. Bilirubin levels are usually at their highest in the newborn. Hyperbilirubinemia is associated with jaundice. Elevated levels of bilirubin cause the skin to have a yellow appearance.</span></p>

The procedure is associated with significant operative blood loss.... We report the case of a bleeding ampullary carcinoma in a Jehovah’s Witness who refused transfusion of all homologous blood products. Despite a preoperative hemoglobin level of 51 g/L, curative pancreaticoduodenectomy was successfully performed. The success of the procedure can be primarily attributed to careful surgical technique, intraoperative autotransfusion, avoidance of postoperative complications, minimization of perioperative phlebotomies, use of human recombinant erythropoietin, and, possibly, the use of the perfluorocarbon emulsion Fluosol DA-20%.”</span></p>

The common stages of treating the acutely injured are covered in the relative order of occurrence.

We report the case of a bleeding ampullary careinoma in a Jehovah’s Witness who refused transfusion of all homologous blood products. Despite a preoperative hemoglobin level of 51 g/L, curative pancreaticoduodenectomy was successfully performed. The success of the procedure can be primarily attributed to careful surgical technique, intraoperative autotransfusion, avoidance of postoperative complications, minimization of perioperative phlebotomies, use of human recombinant erythropoietin, and, possibly, the use of the perfluorocarbon emulsion Fluosol DA-20%.”</span></p>
