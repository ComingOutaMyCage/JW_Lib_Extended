<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Coming World Regeneration</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">WORLD REGENERATION is nothing religious. Were it dependent upon religion or religious powers, it would never come. But it will come,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">because it is promised by an unfailing Authority, fully able to bring it about. More than this, it is at hand! Let all honest men and women, therefore, who are in despair because of religion's failure throughout all centuries till now; let all lovers of righteousness and peace who sigh and cry because of the shocking and hypocritical things done in the name of religion and under religion's blessing, take fresh hope for a world of right and truth. A regenerated world of righteousness, impossible though it be for human hands to create in the postwar era, is the declared purpose of the Almighty Creator of heaven and earth. Never will he let his purpose fail. He will vindicate his word which he has given over his own name, and all lovers of righteousness will forever honor his name for it. His vindication will result in heart-satisfying blessings without end to all &quot;men of good-will&quot; on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">World regeneration, when correctly understood, is seen to be something far more stupendous than any peace conference, with delegates present from all nations and from all fields of human interest and activity, can undertake with success. Due to the aggressions and degrading practices of totalitarian powers, the fearful, heart-sickened people are crying out for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">regeneration</span><span class="font4"> of humankind. Driven underground in Europe, the newspaper Free Netherland (Vrij Nederland) continued nevertheless to print, and a recent issue thereof said as to a Nazified nation and its place after the total war:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Real conversion must be established.... The German</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">people need moral regeneration, which cannot proceed in an atmosphere of sentimental quackery. The reconstruction must be left entirely to the United Nations, as the Axis powers have forfeited every moral right to participate in the solution of the problems of the first stages of the postwar period. [New York Times, October 10,1943]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That sincere demand of courageous mouthpieces of an oppressed people leaves much to be desired, however. Even if attained, it falls so very far short of true world regeneration and its marvelous benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thoughtful men and women have been put in confusion as to the meaning of this wonderful subject, and religion has proved itself to be the chief cause of the confusion. Religion has announced its program to be the conversion of the world to its hundreds of different sects. Thus it has led the people of &quot;Christendom&quot; to think that world regeneration has been in progress for the last nineteen hundred years. Not in any spirit of ridicule, but seriously and earnestly for the good of the many millions who have been deceived thereby, there is here quoted a pronouncement made as late as Sunday, March 24, 1940. It was made by the chief religious head of &quot;Christendom&quot; that day in St. Peter's basilica at Rome, and, among other things, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We celebrate today the feast of Christ's rising again; may it be a principle of spiritual renewal in individual lives, as history affords clear proof that IT ACTUALLY GAVE BIRTH TO A NEW WORLD-ORDER Villages, towns, populous cities were awakened at this new dawning of light, were quickened by this new influence of love, and felt the need of a renewal.... If, then, as we have said (and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the annals of the church are proof of it), the triumph of Jesus Christ over death brought with it an amazing RESTORATION AND RENEWAL OF THE WHOLE WORLD, it should be the same with us now. [From the Homily Exsultet Jam Angelica; pages 655, 656 of Principles of Peace]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In wonderment at such words, the sincere persons who are faced with present-day conditions ask: 'Where after these nineteen centuries is this &quot;new world-order&quot; and this &quot;restoration and renewal of the whole world&quot; spoken of by that religious pontiff?'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If by such sanctimonious expressions the pontiff means that which religion and its organization of &quot;Christendom&quot; have done to all nations and people, then when he so speaks in the name of religion he brings great reproach upon the name of Christ and upon Jehovah God, who raised Christ from the dead to life divine. Examine the pages of genuine history of the so-called &quot;Middle Ages&quot; of Europe, when religion and state were wedded together, with religion as the higher spiritual power. Then ask yourself if the condition of the rulers and the ruled that then obtained was what Christ Jesus brought with his resurrection from the dead. Look today at those nations where religion is still united with the state and where religion and religious authorities are still the dominant forces in the lives of the masses of the people. Then ask yourself if the ignorance, superstition, illegitimacy, poverty and oppression among the common people is the practical expression of the &quot;amazing restoration and renewal of the whole world&quot; that accrued from Christ's resurrection. For the honor of the name of God and of his Christ, and in defense of the truth concerning the impending world regeneration, the answer must be an indignant No!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SCRIPTURAL MEANING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It was Jesus Christ himself who, in the language of some translations of the Bible, used the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">regeneration</span><span class="font4">. The things that happened leading up to his mentioning the subject help us to understand what he meant; and it becomes plain that the financial lords, the religious leaders of self-righteousness and the political rulers of &quot;Christendom&quot; will have no part in the regeneration of which the Master spoke. A young Jewish ruler who thought himself righteous and lawabiding came to Jesus. To quote from the very latest approved Roman Catholic translation of &quot;The New Testament&quot;, the rich young man said to Jesus: &quot;'Good Master, what good work shall I do to have eternal life?' He said to him, 'Why dost thou ask me about what is good? One there is who is good, that is God. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.' He said to him, 'Which?' And Jesus said, 'Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' The young man said to him, 'All these I have kept; what is yet wanting to me?' Jesus said to him, 'If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.' But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sad, for he had great possessions. But Jesus said to his disciples, 'Amen I say to you, with difficulty will a rich man enter the kingdom of heaven. And further I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The disciples, hearing this, were exceedingly astonished, and said, 'Who then can be saved?' And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, 'With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'&quot; (Matthew 19:16-26, Rom. Cath.) Admitting that, though very difficult, yet it is not impossible with the help of God for the rich man to enter God's kingdom; still, Jesus' words to the rich young man that he should sell all to follow Him show this: That if a man having much of this world's material goods does enter the Kingdom, it will not be by staying a rich man. The difficult test with him, as with the young man, will be as to his willingness to apply all his wealth in the service of the Lord as a follower of Christ. Following Jesus means more than a mere outward observance of the law and an appearance of righteousness. —Luke 18:18-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What Jesus had invited the rich young ruler to do, His apostles had done, even if not so many material possessions were given up. &quot;Then Peter addressed him, saying, 'Behold, we have left all and followed thee; what then shall we have? And Jesus said to them, 'Amen I say to you that you who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his glory, shall also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall possess life everlasting.'&quot; — Matthew 19: 27-29, Rom. Cath.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our attention is riveted on that word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">regenera tion</span><span class="font4"> . What did Jesus have in mind by it? When or to what does it apply? At the time that it is in operation, Christ Jesus must be acting as King upon his throne of heavenly glory; that much is certain. And then, also, his faithful apostles would reign with him, not with one of them down on earth on a man-made throne in the city of Rome and the others above, but all twelve of them in glorious thrones in the heavens with &quot;the King of kings, and Lord of lords&quot;. We are helped in getting at the meaning of the word in question by considering accounts of the same occasion by the Gospel writers Mark and Luke, and noting the form of the Lord's expression. Mark 10: 29, 30 recounts that Jesus said to Peter: &quot;There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in the world to come </span><span class="font4">eternal life.&quot; Luke 18: 29, 30 also does not mention the word </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">regeneration</span><span class="font4">, but reads: &quot;And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">in the world to come</span><span class="font4"> life everlasting.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Putting the several accounts together, you will note that they bring together the terms </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">regeneration</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the world to come</span><span class="font4">. It thus dawns upon us that the regeneration is not something that began at the time of Christ's resurrection from the dead, but that it was as far future from that resurrection day as the setting up of the kingdom of God. Just a few hours from his death Jesus, on trial for his life before the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, said to him: &quot;My kingdom is not of this world [</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kosmos</span><span class="font4">]: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.&quot; (John 18:36) Therefore the regeneration of which Jesus spoke could not be some moral change or a reformation of any or all of the political nations of earth. It is something future that is world-embracing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the Greek text of Matthew's Gospel account the word Jesus used is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">palingenesia</span><span class="font4">, made up of the two parts, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">palin</span><span class="font4">, meaning </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">again</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">anew</span><span class="font4">, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genesia</span><span class="font4">, meaning </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">genesis</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a being born</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">birth</span><span class="font4">. It is very striking how some modern translators render the word in the light of its context. The Twentieth Century New Testament translation reads, at Matthew 19:28: &quot;'I tell you,' answered Jesus, 'that at THE NEW CREATION, when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me shall be seated upon twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.'&quot;<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark5">1</a></sup></span><a href="#bookmark4"><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup></sup> </span></a><span class="font4">Notice, however, the way the well-known Moffatt translation reads: &quot;Jesus said to them, 'I tell you truly, IN THE NEW WORLD, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, you who have followed me shall also sit on twelve thrones to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.'&quot; And to this use of the expression THE NEW WORLD the Syriac Version<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark7">2</a></sup></span><a href="#bookmark6"><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup></sup></span></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font4">of the Scriptures agrees, for the apostle Matthew wrote his Gospel account first in the Syriac and then, it appears, made a copy directly in the Greek. Startling as these translations are, the entire Bible backs up the fact that the regeneration, at the time that the Son of man sits upon his glorious throne as reigning King, means no mere moral regeneration of a depraved nation or race. It means a new genesis, a NEW CREATION! It means WWORLD REGENERATION! It means a rebirth, the recreation of a world of righteousness!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In speaking of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">world</span><span class="font4">, let us understand clearly what the Sacred Scriptures mean here. In general conversation men of human affairs use the term </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">world</span><span class="font4"> to mean the entire human race or all the peoples and nations. Since the inspired writings after Christ were written in Greek, we might momentarily consider how the Greeks understood the term </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">world</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kosmos</span><span class="font4"> (Greek). The noted Greek philosopher Aristotle, of 384-322 B.C., in his writing &quot;On the World&quot; (Peri Kosmou), defines </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kosmos </span><span class="font4">thus: &quot;A system composed of the heaven and the earth, and of the creatures contained in them; otherwise the order and beautiful arrangement of the world is called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">kosmos</span><span class="font4">.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Apart, now, from what the Greek mind was on the subject, the mind of the divine Inspirer of the Bible upon the meaning of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">world</span><span class="font4"> as here considered is revealed through His Holy Scriptures. If we let the written Word of God interpret itself, by &quot;comparing spiritual things with spiritual&quot;, then what? This: when world regeneration is spoken of by the great Teacher Jesus Christ, the world meant is a world including leaven and earth, an earthly realm and the spiritual realm dominating it. Here the words of Isaiah, who prophesied seven hundred and fifty years before Christ, flash before us, saying: &quot;As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain. For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.&quot; — Isaiah 66: 22;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">65:17, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religious clergymen, political rulers and lords of business and finance are unequal to the task of straightening out or renovating the earthly situation. More so are they unable to do anything to change the present heavens, the dark invisible forces superior to man and which are the real power behind the rule of oppression and wickedness upon the earth. The creation of brand-new heavens and earth lies only within the power and competence of Jehovah, the Almighty God, to perform. Any looking to mighty men of the earth, and putting trust in them, to accomplish world regeneration is vain and is doomed to keen disappointment. In fact, it leads to destruction, just as Jesus warned, saying: &quot;If the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit. &quot;&nbsp;(Matthew 15:14, Am. Rev. Ver.) God's Word does not agree with the modern-day prophets of &quot;Christendom&quot; who predict enticing things for the peoples in the postwar period, such as the establishment of all mankind upon a better basis and the reformation of brutalized peoples and the setting up of a so-called &quot;new world order based on moral principles&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Confronted with such predictions, where there is a disagreement between the opinions of men and the written Word of God, the honest and wise person will take the side of God. The believer in God's Word will not now ignore or set aside the inspired warning therein addressed to every man of God: &quot;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: . . . and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.&quot; — 2 Timothy 3:15,12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Showing further that human attempts at regeneration, or reconstruction of mankind, and at bringing in a better, finer world with a durable peace will fail when least expected, God's inspired Word states to its faithful readers: &quot;But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:1-4) Therefore to escape the consequences of being deceived by the popular propaganda by men who have neither faith in God's Word nor any regard for His purposes now maturing, true believers and &quot;men of good-will&quot; are careful to abide by God's Word. They will accept no gilded substitute from men, but steadfastly look to the Creator of a new heavens and earth, and they rejoice to tell to others concerning the coming world regeneration by God's power and act.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ORIGINAL WORLD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Not only out of great mercy to humankind, but primarily for the vindication of his misrepresented name, Jehovah God recreates the world of righteousness. That very fact means . the end of &quot;this world&quot; with its present earthly organization and its dominating heavenly forces. Do not misunderstand this. The &quot;end of the world&quot; will be no calamity to righteousness nor any literal destruction of our earthly globe. To appreciate this fact, we must look back six thousand years. We can intelligently do so, because we have the true record of what existed then as regards our earth. A world of righteousness then held sway over our planet, and was God's creation. Being such, it was perfect. &quot;His work is perfect.&quot; &quot;The works of his hands are truth and justice; . . . they are done in truth and uprightness.&quot; (Deuteronomy 32:4; Psalm 111: 7,8, Am. Rev. Ver.) Having prepared the earth for man's everlasting habitation, and having created all the lower animal creation, Jehovah God then made the perfect man and placed him in suitable surroundings, the garden of Eden. As its name means, it was a delightsome place, and man could enjoy the privilege of living happily in it forever. Therefore, as showing that man was then righteous, and to direct man in the way of constant righteousness, his Maker said to him: &quot;Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot; — Genesis 2:16,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Then Jehovah God made woman, who was also perfect and righteous as a divine handiwork, and God presented her to Adam to be his wife. &quot;And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.&quot; (Genesis 1: 28, 31) This divine mandate to Adam and Eve gave them authority to fill the earth with a righteous race. Being perfect and righteous, it was possible for Adam and Eve to bring forth offspring in righteousness amid perfect surroundings, where full freedom from fear and from want and full freedom to worship Jehovah God their Creator prevailed. Their worship of him must be displayed by perfect obedience in doing their appointed work in the Edenic paradise and in not eating of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. It was not necessary to their living forever on earth; in fact, their eternal life depended upon their not eating of it, for by so doing they would keep their integrity toward God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Was that the complete original world of righteousness? No; it was merely the visible part of it: it was the earthly realm, in which man played his part. An invisible spiritual dominion was established over the earth and righteous man. The invisible spiritual organization of dominion was the righteous heavens over man, and it made up the unseen and more powerful and lofty part of that righteous world. Who occupied and was active in that heavenly organization over man? Holy spirit creatures, who were appointed by God from among all his heavenly hosts. The prophecy of Ezekiel discloses that the holy cherub Lucifer was in the garden of Eden, invisibly so. He was the head or chief one over this heavenly organization whose charge was the earth with man upon it. Describing Lucifer's beauty, wisdom and perfection at that time in the mountain or universal organization of God, Jehovah's prophet says: &quot;Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, . . . Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.&quot; (Ezekiel 28:12-15) Thus Lucifer and the righteous organization of spirit creatures under him were the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">heavens</span><span class="font4">, and perfect man and woman were the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">earth</span><span class="font4">, of the original righteous world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That world, mark you, was not the whole universe, but found its location in only a small part of God's boundless universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Had that righteous world continued unbroken, total war, with fear and want and persecution and human carnage, would not have marked this Twentieth Century. But the original world of which man was a part broke away from God's universal organization of righteousness. That came about by rebellion, to feed a totalitarian ambition; and such rebellion began in the superhuman part of that original world. The inspired prophet, Isaiah, exposes the iniquity that was found in Lucifer, man's invisible overlord, namely, the treasonable ambition of Lucifer for universal domination. Lucifer will never succeed in exalting himself to that place of supremacy; for the prophecy from God says: &quot;How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell [</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol</span><span class="font4">, the grave], to the sides of the pit.&quot; — Isaiah 14:12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To launch the revolt against the Most High God, unfaithful Lucifer betrayed the highest interests of man. To gain sympathizers for his rebellion he began working at the weakest part of that righteous world, the &quot;weaker vessel&quot;, woman. He lured woman on into rebellion against God's supreme law by deceptive religious promises of a better world. Then he used her to put pressure upon man, to stir up man's selfishness and provoke him to rebellion with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the entrance of such sin, the righteousness of that world ceased. God's curse upon the serpent which traitorous Lucifer had used, and His driving of Adam and Eve out of the garden of Eden as condemned sinners sentenced to death, were tokens that Jehovah God had dismissed them all from his righteous organization. Among the spirit creatures Lucifer, now transformed into Satan the Devil, was not alone in sin, for the Scriptures call him &quot;the prince of the demons&quot;. He drew other spirits of the heavenly organization under him into the uprising against God's universal sovereignty. Thus the invisible organization over mankind became that of demons. The righteous world, that is, the righteous original heavens and earth, passed away. A corrupt world took its place, and sin, condemnation, religion and death reigned therein. Satan's lie to Eve, 'Ye shall not surely die if ye disobey God,' that is, the so-called &quot;immortality of the human soul&quot;, became the foundation doctrine of all religion practiced by disobedient mankind to this day. (Genesis 3:4,5; Romans 5:12) Also man's supposed ability to improve the world by ignoring the word and commandment of Jehovah God has continued to deceive him and to lead him down a blind alley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You ask, Will a corrupt world be mankind's destiny henceforth and forever, seeing that man cannot restore the righteous world? No; for the God of righteousness is still supreme as universal sovereign. He will not permit corruption and wickedness to stain his universe and bring reproach upon his holy name forever. His time is now near to bring such things to an end. Six thousand years ago, at the very time of pronouncing sentence in Eden upon that old Serpent, which is Satan the Devil, Jehovah God declared his unchangeable purpose, saying: &quot;Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&quot; (Genesis 3:14,15) This was a promise, guaranteeing destruction to all corrupters of the world, and the regeneration of the world of righteousness. The Serpent and his wicked seed would fight against all the movements and preparations of God for world regeneration, but, in spite of all that, a new righteous world was absolutely certain to be established under the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;. The Seed is the holy One whom God brings out of his heavenly universal organization. God's &quot;woman&quot;, from the body of which He produces that Seed, is His heavenly organization. To that symbolic &quot;woman&quot; the Lord God says: &quot;For thy Maker is thy husband; Jehovah of hosts is his name.&quot; —Isaiah 54:5, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After man's expulsion from Eden and from God's righteous organization, an ungodly world grew up. Only a few men were not a part of it, such as Abel, Enoch, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Noah and his family. By means of demons, who materialized among men as &quot;giants&quot; or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Nephilim</span><span class="font4">, man's invisible overlord, Satan, caused the earth to be filled with violence. After sixteen centuries all humankind were grossly corrupt with religion, sin and violence, except eight persons, Noah and his household. Jehovah's name was in great reproach among men, who hypocritically used His name and misapplied it. — Genesis 6: 4; 4: 26.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>OLD WORLD WIPED OUT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Mark now the historical proof of Jehovah's power to destroy the corrupt world and to clear the way for a regenerated world of righteousness. Jehovah God ended his long-suffering with men and took action against the Devil's corrupt world. The inspired apostle Peter describes it briefly, saying: &quot;God . . . spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly.&quot; (2 Peter 2: 4, 5) Noah had walked with God, and he and the seven others of his household lived through the flood by taking refuge in the ark that God had commanded to be built. What a remarkable experience it was for them to survive the catastrophic end of the corrupt world that then existed and to come forth into new conditions on earth. Had the regenerated world of righteousness been then established, Noah and his family would never have died, but by continuing faithful they would have lived on till now and for all time without ever entering into the grave. That great miracle was not possible then, because it was not God's due time; but it will be possible for a great multitude of &quot;men of good-will&quot; now, because we are face to face with the regenerated world of righteousness. Let all lovers of life in righteousness arise to the wondrous opportunity. God's greatest prophet, Christ Jesus, declared that the great flood was a prophetic picture of the end of this present evil world. (Matthew 24:37) As God provided the ark for the flood survivors then, so today for &quot;men of goodwill&quot; who seek Jehovah God now he will provide protection and safe hiding in the great 'day of his anger', at the battle of Armageddon that steadily approaches. — Zephaniah 2: 3.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>THE HEAVENS AND EARTH NOW</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">After the Noachian flood eight righteous persons came forth from the ark of refuge, and for a time the population of the earth was all righteous in God's sight according to their faith and obedience. But the regenerated world of righteousness did not then set in. Why not? Because the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot; had not yet come and set up righteous new heavens and bruised the Serpent's head and destroyed all his reptilian brood. Noah was not that Seed, for Noah had not come down from heaven from God's &quot;woman&quot; or holy organization above. Noah was merely a type or prophetic figure of the coining Seed. Hence the Lord God restated to Noah and his sons and daughters-in-law the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth. This typified how in the new world Jehovah God by Christ Jesus will send forth to the multitude of goodwill persons surviving Armageddon the divine mandate to bring forth children in righteousness to fill the earth in the recreated world of righteousness. — Genesis 9:1, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Seed not having appeared, this meant that Satan and the demons were given further time to remain. The flood and the changed conditions following it placed a check upon them, but Satan the Devil reorganized his demon hordes and arranged them in a new organization to exercise world domination respecting the earth. As such, these wicked spirits formed the newly constituted heavens over man, which heavens have continued until now. The Scriptures picture this revised arrangement as a great red dragon in heaven. (Revelation 12: 3) The dragon organization then set out to corrupt the earth once again, and for a test of man's integrity God Almighty permitted the &quot;dragon&quot; to do so. Nimrod, the grandson of Ham the son of Noah, appeared, and Satan aided Nimrod to become exalted as 'the mighty hunter ahead of Jehovah'. Nimrod violated God's everlasting covenant forbidding wanton slaughter of beasts and men. Satan the Devil caused Nimrod to set up earth's first kingdom, at Babel or Babylon, and to regiment and organize the peoples that forsook Noah's God, Jehovah. This was the beginning of the symbolic &quot;earth&quot;, the corrupt earth that has remained till now. — Genesis 10:8-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">10, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thereafter God's men of faith, such as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (or Israel), were &quot;pilgrims and strangers&quot; to this present &quot;earth&quot; as constituted by Satan the Devil. (Hebrews 11:8-21) Then Jehovah God delivered the twelve tribes of Jacob's descendants from Egypt and organized them into a nation under Theocratic law and planted them in the promised land of Palestine. He permitted them to have a kingdom over them, and with a human king upon the throne to represent Jehovah their real king. The first human king over them to remain faithful to the Lord God was David. This king 'after God's own heart' made Jerusalem his capital and resided there in the citadel on Mount Zion. After David's death his son Solomon built the gorgeous temple to Jehovah God at Jerusalem. During David's reign the near-by nations opposed to the Theocratic kingdom were subdued and made tributary; and during the faithful years of Solomon's reign the Theocratic kingdom reached its greatest prosperity. Peace prevailed while the worship of Jehovah flourished, and the people enjoyed freedom from fear and want and rejoiced before the Most High God, whom they worshiped. During those days the kingdom of Israel under Theocratic rule was a type prefiguring the reign of the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot; in the New World of righteousness. — 1 Kings 4: 20,25, 29-34; 8: 64-66.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No political government on earth today has ever held the relationship that the nation of Israel had with Jehovah God. (Amos 3:2) Therefore no government ever on earth illustrates more clearly than does the kingdom of Israel the truth that it is impossible for governments run by even honest men to regenerate the nations or the world. The typical government of Israel, which started off with such men as David and Solomon, was corrupted and then overturned. Satan and his demons, who fight bitterly against all regeneration in truth and righteousness by any government whatsoever, were responsible. Because that kingdom of Israel was only typical and was not the real Theocratic Government of the woman's Seed, Jehovah God permitted it to be overturned. The corruption, followed by this overturning, was due to the sad fact that the nation of Israel abandoned the worship of Jehovah, the true and living God, and turned to religion. God said to Israel's last king of Solomon's line: &quot;I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.&quot; — Ezekiel 21: 25-27.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>THE COMING OF THE RIGHTFUL RULER</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Did God's solemn statement mean that the typical Theocratic kingdom was to be restored on earth? No. &quot;It shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him,&quot; meant that there should be no more a typical kingdom; but that when the time came for restoration of Theocratic rule respecting the earth the real Kingdom should come and the Rightful Ruler would be given the crown and diadem and power. That Ruler is the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nineteen centuries ago the woman's Seed, the Rightful Ruler, came in the flesh. Then he received the right to rule and he maintained that right by his uncorruptible integrity toward God down to the bitter death. At the time of his baptism and the descent of God's spirit upon him this beloved Son of God from God's heavenly organization was given the right, but not the power to rule. For the remainder of his earthly days he devoted himself to preaching, no, not political reforms, but preaching, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand; repent and believe the gospel.' (Matthew 4:17,23; Mark 1:15) This preaching was after he had turned down Satan's offer in the mount of temptation, where Jesus refused to take over all the kingdoms of this world and engage in political reform. He had received the right to the heavenly Theocratic kingdom over the New World of righteousness; and prophecy showed him that when he takes over the power of that kingdom at the time of regeneration he must dash all the nations of this world to bits. (Psalm 2: 8, 9) So he spurned Satan's bid for a compromise and to spare and politically reconstruct the nations. Hence to Satan's representative, namely, to Rome's governor, Pontius Pilate, Christ Jesus said: &quot;My kingdom is not of this world; . . . now is my kingdom not from hence.&quot; For such reason he did not then attempt regeneration of the world of righteousness, but let his life be taken from him by religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even at his resurrection from the dead it was not the due time for world regeneration, because it was not the appointed time for him to take power and reign. Remembering God's promise by his prophets from of old of a restitution or restoration of the kingdom, the disciples came to their resurrected Lord just before his ascension to heaven and asked: &quot;Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?&quot; (Acts 3: 20, 21; 1: 6) His departure from them and his ascent to the right hand of the Father in heaven gave them a most forceful reply. About thirty-seven years later the city of Jerusalem was utterly destroyed and the unbelieving people of Israel were scattered among all Gentile nations. The kingdom of the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot; is the only hope of such persecuted Israelites as will now honestly accept God's testimony and believe the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That the time had not fallen due nineteen hundred years ago, the apostle Paul bears witness, saying: &quot;But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.&quot; (Hebrews 10:12,13) The apostle was referring to God's prophecy, at Psalm 110:1, 2, 5, reading: &quot;Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. [Then] Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath.&quot; — Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thus the inspired Scriptures give the lie to the religionists who claim that the resurrection of Christ Jesus gave birth to a new world-order and began a restoration and renewal of the whole world. To the contrary, the resurrection of Jehovah's King sealed the doom of this present world to destruction at the time when the regeneration becomes due. (John 12: 31; 16:11) This wicked world under the invisible overlord Satan cannot exist and function at the same time with the New World of righteousness under God's kingdom. Therefore the regeneration means the end of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font4"> world and the rebirth of a world of righteousness. It is at the regeneration that Christ Jesus sits upon the throne of his glory; and it is at the &quot;end of the world&quot; that he is enthroned by his Father to rule with power. It is then that he comes into the Kingdom, which fact marks his promised second coming. That marvelous fact is now accomplished, beyond all denial. If any are inclined to deny, let them stand up to the King's answer to his disciples in reply to the question: &quot;Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?&quot; Then with the King's answer in mind, as recorded by Matthew (24), Mark (13),.and Luke (21), let them face the facts, beginning A.D. 1914, namely, the first World War experiment in the art of total war, the accompanying famines, pestilences, earthquakes, all the nations hating and persecuting genuine and sincere followers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Christ, then the preaching of the gospel of Kingdom Come to all nations for a testimony by Jehovah's witnesses, the League of Nations set up and standing in the holy place as a man-made substitute for the heavenly Kingdom, and everywhere the &quot;distress of nations, with perplexity; [humanity's] sea and the waves roaring; men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken&quot;. — Luke 21: 25, 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What can you make of such concurrent things but that they are the multiplied visible evidences of the coming of the King into his royal power and kingdom in A.D 1914? Those who do not permit their eyes to be blinded by religion, which belongs to this old doomed world, can see in such light of fulfilled prophecy that the King has come in his glory. The kingdom of God in the hands of the Son of man, Christ Jesus, has been born. Its birth was symbolically pictured, at Revelation chapter twelve, as God's &quot;woman&quot; giving birth to the man child which is caught up to God and seated in the throne, whereas the dragon organization is then shaken loose and cast down out of heaven to this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By that grandest event thus far of universal history the regeneration of the new world of righteousness began. The birth of The Theocratic Government is the most important and essential part of the regeneration, for it is the heavenly government that rules the new world. But with the birth of the new heavens and thereafter the resurrection of Peter and all others of Christ's faithful disciples to heavenly life to reign with Him in the Kingdom, the regeneration is not complete. The apostle Peter shows Why. Speaking of the world before the flood and of that afterward and then of the New World, he rebuts the religious scoffers of today, saying: &quot;The world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat. Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; — 2 Peter 3:6,7,12,13.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>COMPLETION OF REGENERATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The New World of righteousness will be complete only with a new earth as well as new heavens. We must yet look for the &quot;new earth&quot;; not a new globe, but a new, righteous organization on this earth. At present the political nations, backed by their fervently praying religious clergy, ignore God's ownership of this globe and they contest against him for the occupancy and domination of it. They now propose a global organization of international co-operation in order to hold down the earth as their own. The old heavens, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">invisible powers behind the ruling elements of this earth, are back of this international defiance of God's King and kingdom. But not for long into the postwar era will this continue. Jehovah's beloved Son, with Kingdom power, will come like a thief to the battle of Armageddon. (Revelation 16:14-16) There he will destroy the old &quot;earth&quot; from this globe by dashing the nations to pieces. He will do more than this. As the promised Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;, he will crush the Serpent's head and destroy entirely the old demonic heavens as by a devouring fire. Then first a &quot;new earth&quot; will function without hindrance, and the New World of righteousness will be complete. World regeneration will be finished to the everlasting glory of the Creator, Jehovah God on his throne, who says: &quot;Behold, I make all things new.... Write: for these words are true and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">faithful.&quot; —Revelation 21:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One question remains, and that is, Who will operate the &quot;new earth&quot; organization? It will be the visible representatives of the heavenly part of the regenerated world of righteousness. Those representatives were long ago prophesied to be the faithful and approved servants, prophets and witnesses of Jehovah God of olden times before Christ's death and resurrection, such men from Abel to John the Baptist, and of whom a brief account is given in Hebrews chapter eleven. The &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;, Christ Jesus, will become their &quot;Everlasting Father&quot; by raising them from the dead in a &quot;better resurrection&quot; than is due dead humankind in general, and he will bestow upon them the reward of everlasting life on earth in perfection. As King of the New World, the Prince of Peace will appoint them as his children to be &quot;princes in all the earth&quot;. (Isaiah 9:6,7; Hebrews 11:35; Psalm 45:16) There will be no political crookedness about them, nor any totalitarian ambitions, but they will represent untaintedly the &quot;new heavens&quot; and will rule in judgment and justice toward mankind. (Isaiah 32:1) Complete unity will exist between heaven and earth, and that without end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Such incorruptible rule of righteousness will overflow with unspeakable blessings to all humankind that survives the battle of Armageddon, and eventually to all the dead in the graves who are due to come forth &quot;unto the resurrection of judgment&quot;. (John 5: 28, 29, Am. Rev. Ver.) The earthly paradise will be restored and will be spread to the ends of the cleansed earth, to be the eternal home of the faithful and obedient subjects of the kingdom of heaven, the &quot;new heavens&quot;. Like the &quot;twelve tribes of Israel&quot; in the golden days of King Solomon, all the redeemed ones of humankind who then fear Jehovah God and honor his King will be delivered from sin, imperfection and death. Evermore they will rejoice in the Lord God Most High for all the blessings of his goodness flowing from the world regeneration. — Revelation 21:1-5.</span></p>
