<p><span class="font2">RADIO, TELEGRAPHY, AIRPLANE, INTERNATIONAL TREATY, WORLD COURT, GLOBAL POLICE FORCE — it will take more than all such earth-embracing things to produce ONE WORLD. In fact none of those things are needed. They do not supply the one fundamental thing. No; it is not religion. Nor is the Dumbarton Oaks Conference of 1944 a &quot;good beginning&quot; of it or a lead in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Builder of the only possible ONE WORLD and its ONE GOVERNMENT can supply the vital requirement, for man's unfading good. How He will accomplish it without fail, this booklet with documentation by the Best of Authority tells you briefly.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>One World, One Government</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">O</span><span class="font3">NE world, under one perfect and abiding Government of righteousness, is the certain destiny of all men of good-will. What is more, its realization is near at hand. That will mean a warless world, far removed from even a threat of bloody conflict and any need of being fully prepared for it. It will mean for our earth a oneness of all human creatures, all enjoying an abundance of life, with full confidence in the Government over them, and sharing the rich bounties of earth in unselfishness, harmony and joy. Heaven will be in tune with earth and will pour down righteousness; and the earth will respond and bring forth the fruits of righteousness, which fruits are justice, and peace, and good order, and equality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Impossible!</span><span class="font3"> a person familiar with the history of the nations will say to this. So much promised for a world at unity under one government fills him with grave doubts or with cynical skepticism. This is because the average person will imagine the world here spoken of to be the world of which men prominent in politics, religion and social affairs have recently been speaking. When an honest person considers the tremendous problems facing this world and then pits the human weaknesses, past failures, and inadequacy of men against such problems, he may well disbelieve that men can bring to pass such a desirable world. That men seem being pushed on irresistibly to the need of one world is beyond denying. The old setup of the races, nations and tongues of men is definitely a thing of the past. Due to air travel, all men have been brought to the physical relationship or geographical position where no one on earth is any farther away than three days' time at most. And the means of communication makes information available instantly and simultaneously all about the globe. Hence the conclusion is forced upon us that all men simply have to get along together as close neighbors. The hermit condition of any part of the earth is a relic of antiquity. War in any part is bound to affect all parts, and is therefore a concern of all and is a matter of attention by all and in the interest of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But whereas modern inventions have served to wipe out the elements of distance or space and time, scientific advance has not wiped out the traditional foundations upon which racial, national and religious groups rest, and upon which their several institutions are built, and according to which these many groups live, work, think, and worship. Modern progress toward the comfort and convenience of men, and also toward the greater destructiveness of war, has not wiped out the deep-seated and long-cultivated things which divide men and put barriers between them. These are the things that create the unsolvable problems for the wisest of the worldly-wise leaders. It is vain to hope that the passing of time, coupled with general education and the distribution of modern advantages to all, will wipe out these fundamental divisive factors. There are no valid grounds to hope for this any more than there are grounds for imagining that modern science and the practice of religion have caused men to grow unselfish and to apply the so-called &quot;Golden Rule&quot; of doing to others as you would be done by.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Despite the hopelessness of the outlook from the human angle, let this one thing be said here: There is no question of the coming of one world, with one Government; for that is definitely the Creator's purpose. In the first century of this era called the &quot;Christian era&quot;, an inspired servant of the Creator wrote these words to his fellow believers: &quot;Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; The Writer, the apostle Peter, foresaw the very things that are facing this old world, and he wrote this heartening statement for the benefit of us who see these very things coming to pass upon this generation. — 2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religious leaders have injected themselves into the discussion of the solution of the world's problems and have made expressions thereon publicly. Therefore we are fully entitled to comment on what these religionists say for public consumption. Since they profess to represent and speak for the Creator, God Almighty, we have a right to compare their speech with the written Word of God. A public address was broadcast over the Vatican's radio station on September 1, 1944, and was reported by the Federal Communications Commission of the United States. Let now the readers remember that the religious pontiff then speaking, pope Pius XII, claims to be the successor of the apostle Peter; and said he: &quot;History is passing through a grave hour, decisive for all humanity. An old world lies in ruins. To see a new world arise from these ruins — a healthier world, better directed and legally more in harmony with the needs of human nature — is the craving of martyred peoples. Who will be the architects? Who will draw up the basic plans for new institutions? Who will be the thinkers who will give it its definitive form?&quot; — New York Times, September 2, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In answer to the questions he himself raises, we listen in vain for the pope to take up some part of the argument of the apostle, whose successor the pope insists himself to be. We read laboriously through the FCC report of the pope's speech for a reference to the kingdom of God by his Christ, whose &quot;vicar on earth&quot; the pope protests that he is. But we fail to find even one single reference to it. Instead, the speech proves to be a slap at one of the United Nations and a lengthy defense of the right to private property, or capitalism. And this comes from a religious head who is the world's biggest capitalist and who pretends to be the vicegerent on earth of the Nazarene who on earth laid claim to no capital and who had not even where to lay his head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Very evidently the world whereof the Vatican pontiff spoke is not the world of which the apostle Peter wrote. Otherwise, the pope should have known that God Almighty will be the Creator of it, and the pope should never have raised his questions. But are we to imagine that this pontiff did not himself expect to be one of the architects of this proposed &quot;healthier world, better directed&quot;, and that he did not expect to have a part in drawing up the basic plans and to be one of the thinkers to give it its &quot;definitive form&quot;? The answer of all papal claims and of all Vatican history is No, to this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even while the Roman pontiff spoke there was assembled at Dumbarton Oaks mansion in Georgetown, a suburb of the American capital, Washington, D.C., a solemn secret conference of world statesmen. These many representatives from the world's four big powers, Great Britain, China, Russia, and the United States, why were they met together in this momentous conference that lasted for weeks due to the difficulties over world questions? The reported purpose was, in order to create &quot;a general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving states, and open to membership by all such states, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security&quot;. These men, or the governments which appointed them, quite evidently are determined to be the architects and planners to think out and design the &quot;healthier world&quot; of tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The government which they propose is to be charged with maintaining the peace and safety of the entire globe. It is to be a coalition government, representative of all the political states of the world, but dominated by the four most powerful in a political, financial and military way. Thereby they hope to make all the nations live at peace with one another and to take on the appearance of supporting &quot;one world&quot;. Political and economic thinkers, lecturers and authors have sought to make their contribution to the common reservoir of human schemes and ideas on the subject, and have declared that, for a united world of the future, there must be economic liberty as well as political liberty, economic internationalism as well as political internationalism. As in the case of the Vatican's defense of private-property rights, they make no mention or suggestion of the all-important need of the kingdom of Jehovah God by his Son Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An inspired wise man of long ago said: &quot;The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 1:9) This idea of one world created by human hands is not a new thing forced upon man by reason of the airplane, telegraph and radiocasting and global war. The idea of a man-made one world is hoary with the age of 4,000 years. It harks back all the way to the time of the founding of the city of Babylon, or Babel, which city was founded by the original </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fuehrer</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">leader </span><span class="font3">named Nimrod. Of that early time the Bible historian said: &quot;And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.&quot; (Genesis 11:1) Then the earth had lately passed through a global flood, destroying all but Noah and his family; besides which, prior to that flood, the peoples had been divided, the earth being filled with violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looking out for their common interests, and understanding one another through the medium of one language, what did those early members of human society propose? This: A central government, dominated by religion, and at a location which proved to be the site of Babylon. Note this purpose of theirs as they say: &quot;Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.&quot; (Genesis 11: 4) Their decision for a unified government and worship in order to prevent a break-up and a clash of self-interests was not inspired of God, nor for the glory of God. It was for making a reputation or name for men. It was for the establishment of a government over which religion should tower importantly and which should not be controlled by God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible is clear on the fact that this city and tower was not inspired by God or blessed by Him, but was inspired in men's minds by God's great adversary, namely, Satan the Devil. Hence, when Jehovah God observed the purpose of men, he said: &quot;Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.&quot; (Genesis 11:6) Their imagination of &quot;one world&quot; with a tower of religion and with a city of centralized government as a binder was not according to God's purpose of a new world wherein dwells righteousness. It was a scheme of Satan the Devil for the enslavement of humankind by totalitarian rule and religion. Therefore Almighty God broke up their unity and their organized strength. The Bible history says: &quot;So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city. Therefore was the name of it called Babel [meaning 'confusion']; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.&quot; — Genesis 11: 8, 9, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Babel was the symbol of authoritarian or dictatorial rule and of religion. It was founded by the bloody Nimrod, who seized control over the people and made himself the first king on earth and set up hero-worship, with himself being worshiped as the head of the state. Everyone in his territory that did not worship him as mightier than Jehovah and as above the Most High God was guilty of disloyalty and sedition against the state. About Nimrod the sacred historian writes: &quot;He began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.&quot; (Genesis 10:8-10, Am. Stan. Ver.) By Nimrod the earth was soaked with blood. He was the organizer of aggressive war for conquest, and the purpose was that Nimrod as a mighty military power should dominate the earth and its politics and commerce, and that with the blessing of religion. Those such as Noah and his son Shem who worshiped Jehovah God had nothing to do with the religion and world-scheme of Nimrod or Babylon. Noah looked for Jehovah God to bring forth a Seed or offspring from His Theocratic organization, and that such Seed should destroy the great Serpent, Satan the Devil, and all the Devil's crowd who do his works of religion and wickedness. Noah did not look upon Nimrod as the Seed of God's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font3"> or organization, and was not deceived by Nimrod's scheme of world rule. — Genesis 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bible prophecy shows that Babylon's scheme of world rule by religion and a centralized government would be attempted again in the great global crisis that marks the end of this world. Note, then, the prophetic picture in the very last book of the Bible concerning the attempted world-rule by the same old Babylon, but in modern political and religious garb. Note, too, Jehovah God's judgment upon it. By his angelic messenger God says: &quot;I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, ... So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, . . . and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication [with the political rulers and merchants]: and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&quot; — Revelation 17:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the symbolic &quot;woman&quot; represents the latter-day scheme of religious-totalitarian global rule, mark the further prophetic description of the religious-totalitarian organization Babylon in these words: &quot;And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads [of the scarlet-colored beast] are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are seven kings.&quot; Hence the &quot;seven mountains&quot; did not picture the seven hills of the literal city of Rome, but picture the kingdoms and political governments of this world. Thus the prophecy says: &quot;And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.&quot; Therefore the Babylonish organization of today is further pictured as sitting upon many waters in domination of all peoples. As it is written: &quot;And [the angel] saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore [Babylon] sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.&quot; — Revelation 17: 9,10,18, and 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Honest Catholics and others should not be deceived into thinking that the woman riding the beast is pagan Rome, and that the woman Babylon and the beast upon which she rides passed out of existence when the empire of pagan Rome was destroyed. Rome still is; and it exists as the center of religious-totalitarian power, and commits fornication or enters religious-political unions with all the kings and rulers of the globe, thereby to dominate all men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">such</span><span class="font3"> circumstances there is but </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font3"> conclusion for all of us to come to, and that is this: If there is to be a &quot;better world&quot; created by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">men's</span><span class="font3"> hands, and if peace, unity and harmony are to be tolerated in it, then it must be a Roman Catholic world. By this bold statement we do not improperly inject religion into the issue to create prejudice. Religion has already injected itself into the affair and has made itself a part of this world. This fact is so by the. Hierarchy's own statements. Also, please, remember that Vatican City is not only a religious center but also now a political state by virtue of the deal made with Fascist Mussolini in 1929, and thus she has taken her place among the worldly political states. She is no more sacrosanct and beyond discussion than other states. By encyclical letters and other pronouncements from the Vatican the Hierarchy has declared that there is no salvation for humankind apart from the Roman Catholic sect nor apart from subjection to the pope. Archbishop Ireland, at the anniversary celebration in Baltimore, Md., on November 10, 1889, cried out: &quot;We must make America Catholic.&quot; So, likewise, because of the basic teachings and beliefs of this religious sect, the Hierarchy will never let the earth rest, as long as the Hierarchy exists, until they have attained their global objective of making America and all the earth Catholic or Catholic-controlled territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Today man's earthly organization is undergoing the birth-pangs of producing a revised version of the League of Nations or an Association of &quot;peace-loving nations&quot; of sovereign equality. That Dumbarton Oaks conference was only a part of the birth process. The Roman religious Hierarchy claims the pope is the world's &quot;indispensable man&quot;, and has set its heart on dominating the organization for international collaboration and global control. Until it does so, men can never hope for any stability to such international organization for peace and security. At most, all other religions will be merely second-class associates with the Hierarchy in riding the back of this international creature, as pictured by the seven-headed scarlet beast of The Revelation. This stubborn fact is plain from what the late pope Pius XI said in his encyclical Ubi Arcano Dei, of December 23, 1922; and the stormy career and final downfall of the League of Nations of 1920 bears witness to the truth of that fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With its Jesuitical view of world peace, and seizing this greatest of opportunities to realize its own ambition, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as the mightiest of all religious organizations prepares to seat religion astride the back of the postwar partnership of the nations for world peace and security. In 1943, when the question was asked in the British Parliament whether the pope of Rome would be invited to sit in on the Peace Conference, what if the representative of the British Government did answer with a &quot;Good Lord, No!&quot; It is not necessary for the Vatican pontiff to sit as a political ruler at the Peace Table, if he has already supervised the important preliminaries to the sitting of the Peace Conference. What need is there for his sitting in on it, when the British prime minister has a three-quarter-hour audience with the pontiff on August 23, 1944, respecting the then pending peace? What need, when also the president's personal representative to the Vatican, namely, Mr. Myron Taylor, sees the pope more often than any other foreign diplomat, and which Mr. Taylor, as adviser to the State Department of the United States, helped to formulate the plan for world organization? (New York Times, September 6, 1944) What need, when also in Vatican City there is the largest aggregation of national representatives to be found in the world and during the years of global war more diplomatic missions have been accredited to the Vatican than ever before in its history, thus making the Vatican an international center? (New York Times, September 11, 1944) Even the American secretary of war went to see the Vatican pontiff, on no social visit, mind you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such dealings of this religious organization with the kings and rulers (spiritual fornication, as the Holy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Scriptures call it) led a noted writer on &quot;U. S. Diplomacy and the Vatican&quot; to say: &quot;All this adds up to the possibility that preliminary peace negotiations will take place on the neutral ground of the Vatican. It must not be forgotten that envoys from all the enemy nations are in Vatican City. Unofficial conversations could easily take place under such circumstances.&quot; And that is the reason why the writer thought it was of the utmost importance for Washington to have diplomatic relations with the Vatican. — Liberty magazine, Sept. 9, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What has been taking place before the world's eyes is very remarkable and can be understood only in the light of Bible prophecy. As to peacemaking arrangements after World War I the Vatican pontiff was excluded therefrom because of the known sympathic dealings of the Vatican with the Central Powers, and such particularly through the papal diplomatic representative who has since become pope. The Treaty of London was drawn up between Britain and Italy in 1915 and specifically barred the Vatican from the Peace Table. But in 1944, thirty years later, after the papacy's most notorious dealings with and support to the Nazi-Fascist enemies of the democratic Allied Nations, the Vatican becomes a mecca for diplomatic envoys, ministers and representatives of the Allied Nations in connection with the conduct of the global war and the negotiations for peace. Even mighty Russia courts the favor of the Vatican and makes concessions to religion, Greek Orthodox and other sects. It strongly appears that the international politicians have learned well the lesson that no international peace and stability is possible without the cooperation or dictation of the &quot;indispensable&quot; Vatican. Hence the cry of the politicians for &quot;more religion&quot; in the postwar world; and hence their willingness to let religion, as dominated by the Vatican Hierarchy, ride in the saddle on the back of the postwar creation for international tranquillity and security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such a postwar world with its exaltation of religion will be no fulfillment of Peter's inspired words: &quot;We, according to [God's] promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; It will not fulfill the requirements for the existence of &quot;one world&quot; under the rule of one Government. Before there shall exist &quot;one world&quot; of righteousness, religion must necessarily be destroyed, together with its author, Satan the Devil; and that destruction Jehovah God by his King Christ Jesus will bring about and be responsible for at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religion's busybodying in the affairs of the postwar &quot;new order founded on moral principles&quot; will merely fulfill the prophecy that the great whore Babylon will ride the international &quot;beast&quot; after it ascends out of the bottomless pit or abyss. Such fulfillment means that the rest of the prophecy of Revelation chapter 17 will be fulfilled. It means that whatever global peace may be then enforced will be only shortlived, and that suddenly religious Babylon and her beastly riding-mount will get on the outs. Almighty God Jehovah promises that He will cause the reasons for bitter disagreement to appear to the political and commercial powers and rulers who make up the sevenheaded, ten-horned beast. Then the enticing propaganda songs and the religious claims of the great whore Babylon will not save her as a religious organization. Her erstwhile lovers will turn upon her with disgust and will let her ride them no more. Says the prophecy of Revelation on what these international powers shall unitedly then do: &quot;And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire.&quot; — Revelation 17:16, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus Jehovah God will cause confusion to this modern Babylonish setup and will break it up, just as he did at the building of the tower and city of Babel. That will mark the beginning of the battle of Armageddon. But the action then of the ruling powers against religion will not put them on the side of or in favor of Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus, nor save them from destruction. They should have put themselves on the side of God and of his Christ as a result of the proclamation of the Kingdom of God which has been going on since 1914. They should never have permitted the old harlot Babylon to get on their back and drive them toward their doom. Hence the international organization that is created to provide men with the machinery, backed by force, for preserving the peace, safety and oneness of this world will go down into the bottomless pit, the abyss of destruction, and will go down to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fond dreams of worldly-wise and religious men for a world built by them for better living according to their selfish standards will thus be blasted. The dreamers shall perish with their deceptive dreams. But the vision of those who have studied the Word of God and believed its glorious prophecy of &quot;new heavens&quot; and a &quot;new earth&quot; of righteousness will then be realized. How this will be we now examine in the radiant light of the sacred Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religionists and their worldly allies, when speaking of this world, limit it to just this earth, that is, to just the nations and peoples and their organizations existing upon the earth. But in the Bible the expressions &quot;this world&quot; and &quot;the old world&quot; or &quot;the ancient world&quot; do not refer merely to things material, tangible and visible here upon our globe. The Bible expression &quot;world&quot; or &quot;kosmos&quot; refers to a spiritual organization as well as to an earthly organization dominated by such spiritual organization. That both a heaven and an earth comprise a world, the apostle Peter makes plain. Referring to the antediluvian world, Peter writes: &quot;God . . . did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others, when he brought the flood upon the godless world.&quot; Peter then assures us that as they laughed at Noah for preaching the end of that ancient world, so they would scoff today at Jehovah's witnesses for warning of the end of this world. Peter then tells us why, saying: &quot;For they wilfully ignore the fact that long ago there existed heavens and an earth which had been formed at God's command out of water and by water, by which also that world was destroyed, through being flooded with water.&quot; Then referring to this world as being a replacement of the ancient, ungodly world before the flood, Peter adds: &quot;But by the same command the present heavens and earth are stored up for fire, and are kept for the day when godless men are to be judged and destroyed.&quot; — Goodspeed translation of 2 Peter 2:4, 5 and 3: 5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is this world of the present heavens and earth that Jesus Christ meant when he told the politician, Governor Pontius Pilate: &quot;My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.&quot; (John 18: 36) That does not mean simply that Christ's kingdom is heavenly; it means also that Christ's kingdom has no origin in and has no part with the present heavens of this world. Christ Jesus the King straightforwardly said to his disciples: &quot;Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; . . . Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.&quot; (John 14:19, 30) That &quot;prince of this world&quot; is the mighty spiritcreature responsible for Jesus' death, namely, Satan the Devil; and he induced the political princes under him on this earth to join in the murder of Christ Jesus the King of the New World. These earthly princes of Satan's world did so in ignorance of the wisdom of God, which wisdom, to quote the apostle Paul, &quot;none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,&quot; — 1 Corinthians 2: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is Satan, the prince of this world, and all the spirit demons associated with him, that form the &quot;present heavens&quot;. Because these demonic heavens have the present earthly organization of all the nations under their control and dominate and make them fight against God and his faithful witnesses on earth, the apostle Paul writes to his fellow Christians, saying: &quot;You must put on God's armor, so as to be able to stand up against the devil's stratagems. For we have to struggle, not with enemies of flesh and blood, but with the hierarchies, the authorities, the master-spirits of this dark world, the spirit-forces of evil on high.&quot; (Ephesians 6:11,12, Goodspeed) Therefore, when Jesus said of his faithful disciples, &quot;They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world,&quot; he meant not simply that their hope is heavenly because of their call to the kingdom of heaven. He meant, too, that they have nothing to do with the heavens of Satan's rule, but, to the contrary, their chief fight is with those Satanic spirit-heavens. — John 17:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ Jesus and his faithful followers, when put in power as the &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot;, constitute an entirely &quot;new heavens&quot;. That signifies that the present heavens, which were responsible for Jesus' death and which are responsible for the persecution of all of Jehovah's witnesses from Abel's day down till this twentieth century, those murderous spirit-heavens, must go. With them must go the blood-stained earthly organization which the present heavens have dominated with religion and all manner of selfishness and wickedness. They will go out in complete destruction at the battle of Armageddon; and the Scriptures disclose that the devilish heavens will witness first the consumption as by fire of the present earthly organization in its postwar shape, after which the heavens themselves will be destroyed as by an all-consuming fire. This is what the apostle Peter means when he writes that &quot;the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word [of God] are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men&quot;; and that &quot;the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up&quot;. Hence he warns the true Christians that they are &quot;looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat&quot;. — 2 Peter 3:7,10,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That destruction makes way for the complete establishment of a new world. Such world will not be all spiritual, not just the &quot;kingdom of heaven&quot; and with no earthly subjects. It will include an earthly organization on this globe for representing the heavenly kingdom and for administering the affairs of the kingdom subjects. This is the new world, inclusive of heavens and earth, concerning which the apostle Peter writes. For, after describing the total destruction of this present wicked world, he shows where our hope is, saying: &quot;Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; — 2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That righteous new world will be &quot;one world&quot;, Why? Primarily because it will be under &quot;one government&quot;, and the Government will be Theocratic and invested with all power in heaven and in earth. The Government will be heavenly, being made up of Christ Jesus and his faithful &quot;body&quot; or church resurrected as a spirit body to heavenly glory. That Theocratic Government is the &quot;new heavens&quot;, and it wrests the control of this globe from the grasp of the present heavens of Satan the Devil. It is the Government of The Christ, the members of which Government all the power of Satan's world could not corrupt and turn away from the faithful worship of Jehovah God. And that such Theocratic Government or Kingdom will embrace all this earthly globe in its rule and domain, the prophecies assure us in these words concerning Christ Jesus the King: &quot;He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.&quot; — Psalm 72: 8, 9; Zechariah 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let none think that this means that the &quot;one government&quot; will be a visible super-state or supernational government, controlling a whole medley of politically divided states or nations on earth, such as an executive council and an assembly of sovereign-free nations in the postwar &quot;new order&quot;. Not at all: for that One Government will be above all politics and will permit no politics. It is dependent upon no political processes now distracting the earth. It does not derive its power from the people on earth to act as their servants, nor does it alter its form or membership at certain regular or irregular seasons because of deaths or because of democratic political elections. That One Government derives its power from the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah God, and it is His servant for vindicating His name and universal domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who compose his Theocratic Government, namely, Christ Jesus and his glorified footstep followers, Jehovah God clothes upon with immortality; which means there will never be death within their ranks and never need successors be appointed. This Government, the &quot;new heavens&quot;, abides forever by the power of Almighty God, who sets it up, and it will never have a successor. In support of this eternal fact the sure prophecy of God's Word says with respect to our days: &quot;And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.&quot; — Daniel 2: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Then politics will be out, and out for good. The politics that have divided men of all religions and caused them to shed rivers of blood for political systems and ideologies will be gone for all time. The One Government will not operate a Vatican City alongside Rome to carry on a game of international politics and to be the diplomatic center of all the kingdoms and republics of this world. When the kingdom of the God of heaven breaks in pieces and consumes all these kingdoms, then Vatican City and its triple-crowned king will be dashed to pieces. Also Rome, which that pontiff speaks of as &quot;the city that Mary, sacred to the Roman people, mother of divine love, protected in the hour of danger&quot; in June, 1944, will find no &quot;queen of heaven&quot; available to save it from destruction at Christ's hand. And all the nations of earth which do business with Vatican City and with organized religion will go down with that as-it-were &quot;Eternal City&quot;. Their postwar organization for international peace and safety and a &quot;better world&quot; will be ground to powder and blown into oblivion with them. Hence the New World will be completely new; as Jehovah God on his throne assures us, saying: &quot;Behold, I make ALL things new.&quot; &quot;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.&quot; (Revelation 21:5; Isaiah 65:17) Corrupt old-world politics, and the systems thereof, will not mar the righteous New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The battle of Armageddon, in which Jehovah God by his King Christ Jesus will bring this destruction of the political and religious oppressors of the people, will be the most colossal fight of the history of creation. It will be the universal war between God's organization under Christ on the side of truth and right and Satan's world organization on the opposite side. Nevertheless, the faithful survivors whom God's power will preserve through that fight to enter into the New World will not be burdened down with the debts of that war. The One Government of the postArmageddon New World will not load down the people with the costs of that war, requiring future generations to toil and slave and pay income taxes, sales taxes, and other taxations in order to relieve the government of its war debts. The war of Armageddon, and the liberation of the people of good-will which it brings, will be conducted without cost, yes, absolutely free of charge to those who survive the battle under God's protection. Neither will they have to take any part whatsoever in the violent destruction that will then wipe out the Devil's world. Says</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God's Word to those who become subjects of The Theocratic Government: &quot;The battle is not yours, but God's. Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of Jehovah with you.&quot; — 2 Chronicles 20:15,17, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Besides no war debts under that One Government, there will be no congressional, parliamentary or political debates over the reconversion of industry from wartime to peacetime conditions and requirements. Concerning the &quot;new heavens&quot; Government, which is exalted above all and which is symbolized by the city of Zion and Jerusalem, the prophecy says: &quot;Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem; and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they [the persons of goodwill who go up to symbolic Jerusalem] shall beat their [the enemies'] swords into plowshares, and their spears [those used by the destroyed enemies] into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it.&quot; (Micah 4:1-4, A.S.V.) The people of good-will, no matter of what nationalities, will enjoy this peace under the heavenly Government, and there will be no need of an international -police force, which requires men continually to learn the violent arts of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But if all national systems of government are to pass away at Armageddon, how will order and proper relations be maintained between earth's inhabitants thereafter? In this way: The One Government will provide its visible representatives upon the earth to properly administer the affairs of the people in harmony with Theocratic law from heaven. These representatives will not be angels from heaven materialized in flesh; neither will they be representatives appointed by the people by means of hotly-contested political campaigns and elections, in democratic fashion. The New World will be entirely Theocratic; that is to say, Jehovah God will rule by means of his Government in the hands of Christ Jesus his Son. And Jehovah, therefore, by his Theocratic Government is the only One to do the appointing of the Kingdom's earthly representatives. He and his Christ are the &quot;Higher Powers&quot; that can safely be trusted to make suitable appointments of men on earth to represent the Kingdom and care for its interests among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At Psalm 45, Jehovah God authorizes his Son Christ Jesus the King to make appointments of visible Kingdom representatives, saying: &quot;Thou shalt make princes in all the earth.&quot; Who will these be? The faithful prophets and forefathers of Christ Jesus, who died before his death, resurrection and ascension to heaven. Under the severest test of their integrity toward God down till the day of their death they kept faithful as witnesses of Jehovah, and proved themselves worthy to be put in places of trust under the kingdom of heaven. Christ Jesus shed his blood for them as well as for all believers toward Jehovah God and his Christ. Hence Christ Jesus the King will resurrect these faithful ones of old from the dead and bestow everlasting life under the Kingdom upon them, and thereby they will become his children, children of &quot;The Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace&quot;. (Isaiah 9:6) When they are thus restored to life on earth under the new heavens, then will be fulfilled the prophecy addressed to Christ Jesus: &quot;Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.&quot; — Psalm 45:16, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In their administrative positions these princes will make up the &quot;new earth&quot;, and thus, with both the new heavens and the new earth functioning, the New World of righteousness will be complete. Concerning the functioning thereof, the prophecy says: &quot;Behold, a king [Christ Jesus] shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.&quot; (Isaiah 32:1) Those princes of that new earth will faithfully represent the new heavens and hence be in absolute harmony and unity with them. Thus that will be &quot;ONE WORLD&quot; under &quot;ONE GOVERNMENT&quot;. Rebellion, such as committed by the first human pair, Adam and Eve, will never mar that &quot;new earth&quot; of those princely representatives of the kingdom of heaven. Hence all the people on earth as subjects of the one Theocratic Government will have a perfect and righteous administration which will mean everlasting life to all the obedient and faithful subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Never will that Government on high permit the thing that has been the greatest divisive force among the people to take root again in the earth. That is to say, religion, which was introduced in the garden of Eden by Satan the Devil in order to induce mankind to sin and so bring sorrow and death into the earth, will be abolished. Religious wars, blessed and backed by the clergy, will nevermore stain the earth with blood and carry on intolerance and inquisitions against those who worship Jehovah God and his Son in spirit and in truth. Instead, that which, above all, will bind the people together as subjects of the one Theocratic Government will be their worship of the one true and living God, Jehovah, the Builder of the New World of righteousness. True, this present wicked world has had one god, and concerning him the apostle Paul writes: &quot;The god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God [Jehovah], should shine unto them.&quot; (2 Corinthians 4:4) But, from this inspired statement, it is manifest that the one god whom this world has worshiped and served is the enemy of Christ and of the God of the New World, and is Satan the Devil, the &quot;prince of this world&quot;. As a result, this world has been practicing and still practices religion, and not the worship of the true God, Jehovah. Hence this present world has been a divided world, divided through selfishness in religious, political and commercial ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In order for one world to exist and endure, all religion must be destroyed from the earth; and it will be, for such is Almighty God's determination. Christ Jesus said to his followers: &quot;I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my GOD, and your God.&quot; (John 20:17) Jehovah is the God as well as the Father of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. (1 Peter 1:3) Christ Jesus, the Chief One of the new heavens, the King of kings in the kingdom of heaven, worships Jehovah as the Most High God, and all those seated with him there in the throne of the Kingdom likewise worship Jehovah, in oneness of worship. The visible representatives of the Kingdom, namely, the &quot;princes in all the earth&quot;, worshiped Jehovah down till their death, and they will continue to do so on being resurrected and installed into office in the New World. -Matthew 8:11,12; Luke 13: 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The worship of the Most High God, therefore, unites the new world in one; and it will likewise bring together in one all the people that gain life through Christ Jesus. Not only will the princes on earth be the children of Christ Jesus, &quot;The Everlasting Father,&quot; but all persons on earth who gain life in the New World will become his children. All must gain life through their King, who laid down his earthly life for them. As it is written: &quot;The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot; (Romans 6:23) Their King, the Head of the One Government, will be their Father, and all his subjects gaining everlasting life will be his children, and all these subjects will be brothers and sisters. The family relationship will bind them to one another and to their King, and present national and racial distinctions will be buried for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Together with their King, the princes and all His other subjects will be united in the worship of the great Creator of the New World and the Builder of the &quot;One Government&quot;, namely, Jehovah God. With such voluntary unity of worship prevailing on earth, due to true love and adoration of the Creator, there will be no more any rendering unto Caesar that which is Caesar's, and unto God that which is God's. Everything will be rendered undividedly unto God, whereas Caesar will be done for. No more will there be the exalting of the political state above God, but the one Theocratic Government will vindicate God's name and will exalt Him above all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To all persons now suffering because of putting Jehovah God above the state and seeking to live for the New World of unity and righteousness, God's own word comes through the prophecy: &quot;Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.&quot; — Zephaniah 3: 8, 9, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The day draws near when Jehovah rises up to the prey as the Almighty Warrior against this present world of wickedness, selfish disunity, oppression and religion. The fulfillment of his determination to destroy the religiouspolitical nations in fiery destruction at Armageddon comes on apace. The One World, ruled and blessed by the One Government, is soon upon us. Already Jehovah God, as a visible token of that coming unity of the One World, has turned to the peoples a pure language, not some basic or popular language invented and developed by men of this world, but the language of the New World. It is the language of the truth, unmixed with religion. Jehovah has already turned this language unto his peoples, namely, the remnant of his faithful witnesses and also the people of good-will who come forth out of all nations, kindreds, and races. Regardless of where Jehovah's consecrated people are scattered, regardless of what be their mother tongue or national language, they are all speaking the one and the same &quot;pure language&quot; which He has turned to them, and that is the language of the Kingdom truth. In every land and clime in which they are located, they are speaking and bearing witness to the truth of the Kingdom, the One Government of the United New World. In such manner they are all calling upon the name of Jehovah and worshiping him unitedly or &quot;with one consent&quot;. Religious and political controversies of this present world do not divide them; for they are not of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By the proclamation of the Kingdom in this pure language, Jehovah's witnesses extend to the lovers of truth and righteousness in every land the King's invitation to join in this unity of the worship of the Universal Sovereign, Jehovah God. Blessed are all those who heed and call upon the name of the Lord God and worship him with one consent before the fire of Armageddon bursts forth! They are the ones whom Jehovah God favors with hope of life eternal in the glorious New World, the world of righteousness united under the One Government of mankind's Deliverer and Redeemer, Jesus Christ the Messiah. — Zephaniah 2:1-3.</span></p>
