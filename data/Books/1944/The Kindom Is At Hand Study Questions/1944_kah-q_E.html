<p><span class="font11">HE conduct of the study meeting in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;</span><span class="font11"> should be as follows: At a fixed hour and on a set day, meet regularly, weekly if possible. Conduct the study for one hour. Someone competent should open the meeting with prayer to Jehovah God and in the name of Christ Jesus, the Teachers of Kingdom truth. During the hour make as much progress in the book as is possible by sticking to the study material for the occasion. To that end let each student come prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The study conductor should submit the questions on the lesson as set out in this booklet. Discuss one paragraph at a time. The conductor will ask the question on the paragraph. Any desiring to answer should raise the hand and, when called, answer to the point in their own words. The paragraph may include one or more Scripture texts cited, but not quoted therein. To get the full understanding and breadth of the paragraph the conductor should assign such texts to be read aloud, with what brief comment the readers may feel able to give, to show the bearing the texts have on the subject discussed. Then the study conductor will call for the Scripture texts to be read which are listed after the questions printed herein on the paragraph. The answer to the questions should be summed up by the reading of the paragraph in </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;The Kingdom Is at Hand&quot;.</span><span class="font11"> At each meeting a capable reader should be appointed to do the reading of all paragraphs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Having done with one paragraph, then follow the above procedure with each succeeding paragraph in turn through to the close of the hour. All comments or answers to questions should be as brief as proper coverage of the information asked may allow. Proper advance-preparation by each student will work to the liveliness, interest and helpfulness of the study meeting, and will obviate time-wasting hesitation about answering questions, and will thus make for the greatest advance in the study course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Apply the Scripture rule: &quot;Let him who is being orally instructed in the word have fellowship with him that is so instructing him, in all good things.&quot; (Galatians 6: 6, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Botherham)</span><span class="font11"> Thereby each one will contribute or communicate &quot;good things&quot; to the educational instructiveness of the meeting. This will aid in making clear to you and fellow students the truth and will build up in each one devotion to the Kingdom, that all may serve God with integrity, with benefit to all &quot;men of good-will&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">note to study conductor:</span><span class="font11"> At your first study meeting, read aloud the above foreword before beginning, that all present may be informed how the meeting will be conducted thenceforth.</span></p>
