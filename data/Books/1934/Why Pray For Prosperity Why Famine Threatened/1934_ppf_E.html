<p><span class="font5">Broadcast by Judge Rutherford, Sunday, August 12, 1934, over chain from WBBR</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">D</span><span class="font6">EPRESSION has been upon the world for five years, and now millions are confronted with starvation. In this time of dire extremity religious organizations, led by the Catholic St. Joseph’s Guild of New Jersey, has issued an appeal to all denominations, Jews and Gentiles, to join in prayer on certain days in September next that “this nation may be restored again to a condition of prosperity, peace and happiness”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If it is the will of Almighty God that the people should offer such prayer, then all should do so. If this “Prayer Movement.” is a frandulent scheme to further deceive and entrap the people, and to bring them into greater difficulties, then all should know the truth concerning the same and deport themselves accordingly. The only certain way for men to ascertain the will of Almighty God is to go to His Word, the Bible, and there learn what is His expressed will. I appeal to the people to now calmly consider the facts and the Scriptures and then determine what course you will take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At all times we must have in mind these, indisputable truths, to wit: That there is but one Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” and in whose hand rests the destiny of all nations; that He has one great Executive Officer, Christ Jesus, who is also the Savior of humankind, and in His name prayers must be made; that there is one arch adversary of Jehovah God, and man’s worst enemy, whose name is Satan, the Devil, and whose purpose is to turn all men away from God and lead them into destruction. Frand</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and deception are Satan’s chief means of accomplishing his wicked purpose. Often he induces men to put forward a scheme which on the face of it appears to he right but which in fact is a subtle, snare in which to entrap the unsuspecting ones. All of Satan’s representatives on earth, both the willing and the unwilling, are unrighteous, and God will nothear and answer the prayers of the unrighteous. (1 Peter 3;12) The prayers of such are notheeded by Jehovah, for the reason that the petitioners are evil; and for anyone to join with such in prayer would be worse than useless, because the same is an abomination in the sight of God. It is of vital importance to all of us just now to view this matter without passion or prejudice and to ascertain and follow the truth. In order Io do this it is important to consider some historical facts, because what has resulted in the past furnishes us a guide to determine what will be the result under similar conditions in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In March, 1933, St. Joseph’s Guild was launched, and now leads in the aforementioned “Prayer Movement”. Thereafter, on the 2d of April, 1933, the pope’s “Holy Year” began with the announcement that prayers would be made to the end ‘that a tide of religion would sweep the nations into peace and prosperity’. The “Holy Year” and its prayers have utterly failed, and depression and suffering continue upon the people. From Press dispatches appearing in Catholic Newspapers from Rome, England and America I quote: “The extraordinary year [the ‘Holy Year’] closes with a silence of the pope. ... A silence which the father told his sons thathe knew of nothing he could say to them.” Why? “Holy Year” has been a dismal failure, and that fact all must concede. The pope admits that &quot;Holy Year” prayers God has notheard or answered. The conditions are worse today than they were a year ago. There is no prosperity, and peace has not come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Admitting the failure of the Catholic “Holy Year” and its prayers, now the St. Joseph Guild by “Resolution<sup>1</sup>' calls upon “all who have confidence in God, the Almighty Father of all mankind, regardless of race, color or creed”, to join in prayer for the return of prosperity. Seeing that the prayers of the united </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic</span><span class="font6"> organizations who profess to believe on Christ have failed, then why now ask non-Catholics and nonChristians, and Jews, and those other organizations that deny Christ Jesus, to join in the “Prayer Movement”? Will the prayers of such add compelling force to wring from God’s hand the desired selfish prosperity? The failure of the “Holy Year” prayers ought to fully convince the people that there is something wrong about, these movements that attempt to bring prosperity, and this should cause the people to examine God’s Word and ascertain therefrom what is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The aforementioned Resolution calls for certain days of prayer to be had next September, but the Resolution does not mention Jehovah’s name, nor the name of Jesus Christ. Evidently this is because the appeal is addressed to anti-Christians, both Jews and higher-critic Protestant clergy, otherwise called “modernists”, and to others who deny Christ as the Redeemer. The language of the Resolution is: “To beseech our common Father in heaven,” which language could not apply to the Almighty God, because lie is not the common Father of all. Since the days of Adam’s sin in Eden Jehovah God is not the “Father of all men”. In His day Jesus said to the clergy of Israel: “Ye are of your father the devil” (John 8:44), and today Jewish rabbis and modernists, and Protestant clergy, reject Jesus Christ and His kingdom, and hence they could not be sons of God. The Scriptures of God’s Word declare that Jehovah, the Almighty God, is the Father only of those who believe on and honor Jesus Christ even as they honor God. (John 5:23) All men are born sinners. (Romans 5:12) The only way a man can be cleansed from sin and become the son of God is by faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus, a full devotion to Him, and the acceptance and begetting of that man by Jehovah God. (Acts 4:12; 1 Peter 1: 3, 4; James 1:18) From the Bible I quote these words: “The blood of Jesus Christ, [God’s] Son, clcanseth us from all sin.” (1 John 1:7) In John 9:31 it is written: “Now we know that God heareth not shiners: but if any man be a worshipper of God. and doeth his will, him he heareth.” Only those who have been cleansed by full faith in the blood of Christ Jesus does God count as righteous and acknowledge as His sons, and it is only these whose prayers are heard and answered; as it is written (1 Peter 3:12) : “For the eyes of the Lord arc over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.” (Acts 10:1-4) He who dishonors the Lord Jesus Christ dishonors Jehovah God, and God will not receive him or his prayers.—John 5: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the “Prayer Movement” news release I quote these words: “The prayer movement has the endorsement of postmaster general . . , United States senators . . . congressmen . . . governors . . . and other distinguished men from many parts of the United States.” What do these endorsements add, since the men mentioned do not worship Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as man’s Redeemer and the world’s rightful Ruler? The only prosperity the endorsement of such “distinguished men” will bring will be to those who receive the church basket collections. The endorsement of distinguished politicians and financiers of Satan’s organization will tend to swing into line for the “Prayer Movement” the overawed and unsuspecting people, because those “distinguished men” are highly esteemed among them; but in God’s sight such approval and endorsement is an abomination, as it is written (Luke 16:15): ‘That which is highly esteemed by men is an abomination in the sight of God.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The &quot;Prayer Resolution” says: ‘Unite in prayer, to beseech our common Father to inspire our leaders so that this nation may be restored again to prosperity.’ That language is a recognition of the politicians, financiers and clergy as the leaders of this world, and as &quot;the higher powers”, and hence the claim that such men are God’s instruments to lead the people, and which claim is contrary to the Scriptures. Jehovah says concerning Jesus Christ (Isaiah 55:4): &quot;Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.” Prayer for the inspiration of worldly leaders is wholly in vain. God answers the prayers of those only who are guided by His Word and who recognize Jehovah and Christ Jesus as the &quot;higher powers”.—Romans 13:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Are not these &quot;distinguished men”, who are designated by the Resolution as &quot;leaders”, a part of this world? and are not the clergy who have launched the &quot;Prayer Movement” also a part of the world and friends of the world? You will all answer, Yes, of course. Will God hear their prayers for personal and material prosperity? The answer is found in James 4:3,4, the authoritative Word of God, to wit: “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts. Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.” Jehovah God will not answer the prayers of His enemies, and this is conclusive proof that the &quot;Prayer Movement” fathered by St. Joseph’s Guild will fail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">According -to a poll of the clergy of the United States published by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The, Literary Digest</span><span class="font6"> the majority of the clergymen repudiate Christ Jesus and His blood as the means of saving mankind, and deny that Jesus is God’s anointed King to rule and bless mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning Jesus Christ Jehovah says (Matthew 12:18,21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font6"> margin): ‘‘Behold, my servant, whom X have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall [show] judgment to the nations. . . . And in his name shall the nations hope.” Could it be expected that Jehovah God would hear and answer the prayers of men who repudiate His Word arid who deny His anointed King, the Redeemer of mankind? Do the people now wish to be guided by selfish and imperfect men or do they want to trust in Jehovah God and Christ Jesus? By your course of action concerning the ‘‘Prayer Movement” you will answer that question. I insist that what I say is not an attack upon men, but I am merely laying the facts plainly before the people that they may receive the truth and then assume the responsibility of whatsoever course they take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures clearly show that with the beginning of the great World War in 1914 Satan’s uninterrupted rule of the world ended and that there Christ Jesus was enthroned by Jehovah as the world’s rightful ruler. (Matthew 24:3-8; Psalm 2:6) The Scriptures clearly point out exactly what would follow that date marking the end of the world, and concerning this it is written: “There shall be . . . upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea [the people] and the waves [commercial organizations] roaring [because of the depression or hard times]; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which arc coming on the earth world].” (Luke 21:25, 26) The “Prayer Resolution” completely ignores those scriptures concerning the end of Satan's world and the woes and troubles upon the people that would immediately follow. Who is the one that brings these woes upon the world? The “Prayer Resolution” ignores this point, but many of the clergy say that God has brought the woes upon the people; whereas the Scriptures definitely state that Satan the Devil is the one who brings these woes now upon humankind because he knows that it is only a short time until the final battle in which his organization will be destroyed.—Revelation 12:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God is in no wise responsible for the unhealthy so-called &quot;prosperity” that immediately followed the World War, and during which many men grew rich, arrogant and oppressive. Jehovah is in no wise responsible for the hard times or depression now on the world, nor will He hear the prayers of those who ask such former prosperity to be restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A safe guide is to follow the course of faithful Christians, the apostles of Jesus’ day. It was about the year A.D. 44 that the absence of rain brought a great famine upon the people of Palestine. The apostle Paul and other faithful Christians did not ask all creeds and denominations to unite in prayer for the restoration of prosperity; but, as the Scriptures state, those faithful Christians gathered food and distributed it amongst the poor, and did not try to increase the prosperity of the rich. (Acts 11:26-30; Romans 15: 25,26; 1 Corinthians 16:1-3) Mark the great contrast in the course of professed &quot;Christians” of this day. The greater portion of the grain-produeiug area of the country is burned up, and the public press announces that because of the scarcity of wheat the money value of the wheat crop will be the greatest in many years. More than ten million people are facing starvation; and at the same time the &quot;distinguished men” who rule the nation, and who endorse the &quot;Prayer Movement”, cause the price of bread to be raised and thus increase the burden of the poor. At the same time these &quot;distinguished men” and clergymen ask the people to pray that prosperity may return, which prosperity only the rich enjoyed prior to 1929. Do you believe that the God of mercy and comfort will hear such selfish prayers and bring prosperity to those who have lived wantonly and ruled in arrogance while the poor have starved and their burdens have continued to increase? Those are the men who speak scornfully of the name of the Most High, and concerning them it is written, in Proverbs 1; 32, 33 : “For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.” Thoughtful people know that the so-called “Prayer Movement” is a mockery of God and a snare of the enemy to entrap those who follow blind leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The United States is a part of “Christendom” and claims to be a Christian nation, and is therefore dutybound to obey and to follow the laws of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. The United States, with all other nations of “Christendom”, has violated God’s everlasting covenant concerning the sanctity of life by the unnecessary and wanton shedding of blood (Genesis 9:1-9); and God will nothear the prayers of such covenant-breakers, but, on the contrary, their fate is plainly stated, in Isaiah 24:3-5: “The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for the Lord hath spoken this word. The earth mourncth, and fadeth away; the world languisheth, and fadeth away; the haughty people of the earth do languish. The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.” This punishmenthere described God will inflict on the world at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, the Resolution calling for united prayer of all ereeds, and which has the endorsement of “distinguished men”, had its origin with clergymen in New Jersey, where the name of Jehovah God has been grossly reproached by clergy and officials, and where officials of that state have brazenly said: “Who is Jehovah?” “Jehovah may run heaven, but we are running New Jersey.” In that state recently hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses have been arrested, imprisoned, and woefully illtreated, merely because they were preaching the gospel of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus as commanded by the Lord. There Jehovah’s witnesses have been diligently trying to inform the people of the end of Satan’s reign, of the famine and pestilence and trouble that are coming upon the earth, and of God’s kingdom of righteousness under Christ, which is the only hope of mankind. Like the Jewish clergy in the days of Jeremiah, even so the Catholic hierarchy of New Jersey and their allies there have said and now say to the people; ‘Give no heed to these Jehovah witnesses; there will be no great trouble, you will not see famine, but you shall have peace and prosperity.’ Now in these days of distress, woe and perplexity these same clergymen ask all the people to join with them and the “distinguished men ” of the nation in prayer for material prosperity; but their prayers arc certain to go unanswered, for the reason, as stated by Jehovah through His prophet in these words (Jeremiah 11:14): “Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will nothear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN'S TRAP</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I do not say that St. Joseph’s Guild has knowledge that its Resolution is Satan’s scheme, but I do most emphatically charge that Sat.au is the father of the scheme and Satan has thus set a trap to ensnare the people and to turn them away from God; and the reason I so state is this: A part of the great question for determination now is, Can Satan cause all men to curse God and turn away from Him! Satan has challenged God to put men on earth who would maintain their integrity toward Him, and now Satan would prefer to see all men destroyed rather than to see one serve Jehovah. Satan has induced his earthly agents to believe and teach the people that God is responsible for the woes and sufferings that have come upon them. Now he would induce the people, together with the clergy and other “distinguished men’’ of the nation, to pray to God to relieve them from their sufferings and bring them prosperity, and, further, to pray that their earthly 'leaders may be inspired to lead the people into prosperity’. Satan well knows that, these prayers God will nothear or answer and that when people see that this so-called “Prayer Movement” is a complete failure, and that their prayers are not answered, and that their suffering increases, then the people will be greatly chagrined and disappointed. What, then, will be the tendency of those who have thus prayed and are disappointed? Satan expects them to say: “If God cannothelp us, and will not do so, then we will have nothing to do with God,” and that then they will turn away from Him and curse God. Thus the Devil will bring the people into his snare. Be it known unto you now that every one who follows this “Prayer Movement” scheme will be led into and ensnared by Satan’s trap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPER COURSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What, then, shall the people do? Quit following the instructions given them by selfish men, who make themselves the leaders of the people, and turn entirely to Jehovah God and to Christ Jesus, whom God has made Ruler and Leader of those who will receive His blessings. The Bible contains the full and complete information; and with the helps which the Lord has provided you can get this full and complete information for your guide.* Know this, that Satan’s world has ended and is rapidly going to pieces and at Armageddon, which is near, Satan’s world will be completely destroyed. The hope of the peoples of the world • See advertisement on back page.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is Christ Jesus’ kingdom, and there is no other hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Long ago Jehovah by His prophets said (Jeremiah 23:5; Isaiah 9:6,7): “Behold, the days come . . . that I will raise ... a righteous Branch, and a King [Christ Jesus] shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.” “And the government shall be upon his shoulder; and . . . of his government and peace there shall be no end.” Peace and prosperity can come to the peoples of the earth only by and through God's kingdom under Christ, and this will not come by the efforts of clergymen and politicians or other “distinguished men” of the world. Such men will have nothing whatsoever to do with the Kingdom nor witli the blessings it shall bring humankind.—Daniel </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font6"> 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPER PRAYERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It. is written in the Scriptures that Jehovah God hears the prayers of those that call upon Him in spirit and in truth. (Psalm 145:18; John 4:23) The political rulers and other “distinguished men” do not call upon the Lord in spirit and according to His Word of truth. His Word, the Bible, is the truth and the only proper guide for man, and Christ Jesus is the great exponent of the truth, (Psalm 119:105; John 17:17; 18: 37 ; 14: 6) Jehovah will nothear the prayers of those who reject His Word and His Son, Christ Jesus. Because the blessings of peace and prosperity and happiness can and will come only by and through God’s kingdom under Christ, Jesus instructed men how to pray. To them He said, at Matthew 6:9, 10: “After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it. is in heaven.” Is the call for “nation-wide prayer for prosperity” in line with these words of Christ Jesus? Most assuredly not. That. Resolution not only is selfish and asks for the return of the things that were once enjoyed by the rich, who have long oppressed the poor, but completely ignores God’s honor and His name, and the name and honor of Christ Jesus, does not ask that the will of God be done, completely repudiates the kingdom of God, and asks that the will of selfish men be done. There is a complete absence of any suggestion that’the people should pray that the will of God be done on earth as it is in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For more than twenty years the faithful followers of Christ Jesus in this land have told the people that God’s kingdom is near and that it is the hope of the world. They have been going about the land from house to house unselfishly and diligently trying to teach the people of and concerning God and His kingdom, and for doing this they have been hated and persecuted, Jesus said that this would be done to His faithful followers because they honor His name. (John 15:18-23) The clergy and their political allies, instead of hailing the kingdom of Christ with gladness, and urging the people to look to that kingdom for their relief and blessings, have conspired together to destroy Jehovah’s witnesses and to keep the people in ignorance of the truth concerning the Kingdom. Exactly as Jehovah’s prophet says in the 83d Psalm: 'The clergy and their allies have consulted together with one consent against the faithful followers of Christ Jesus.’ This they have done in these “last days’’, ‘They have taken counsel against God’s people and consulted against His hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being- a nation.’ In the execution of this cruel conspiracy against God and His kingdom under Christ the clergy and their allies, who now endorse the present-day 'prayer movements’, have committed many overt acts against the faithful followers of Christ Jesus. At much effort Jehovah’s witnesses have printed the message of God’s kingdom and have carried it to the people in book form. The clergy not only have opposed this message of God's kingdom, but have caused the people to gather together the books containing the Kingdom message and to burn them, and now these same men ask the people to join with them in prayer for their own selfish prosperity. Furthermore, they try to impress the people with the weight and importance of their &quot;Prayer Movement” by telling them that many &quot;distinguished” politicians endorse the movement. They are not deceiving God, and let no one who really loves God now be deceived. To aid you in avoiding such deception this speech is now made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has put His stamp of disapproval upon the &quot;Holy Year” and its prayers; and that is admitted. Next, the pontiff at Rome, according to a dispatch published in the New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Times</span><span class="font6"> of February </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font6"> 1934, asked the people to pray that Armageddon may be averted. That appeal of the pontiff is also certain to fail. Jehovah God has entered judgment against the world and its god, Satan. That judgment written is that Christ Jesus at Armageddon shall completely wreck and destroy the wicked and oppressive rule of this world. Concerning Armageddon Jesus says : 'It will be the greatest tribulation the world has ever known, and there will never be another,’ because that will mark the end of wickedness and the destruction of the wicked,—Matthew 24:21,22; Psalm 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has decreed that Armageddon shall come, which conflict He designates as ' ‘ the battle of that great day of God Almighty” (Revelation 16:14), and the combined prayers of creeds and organizations will not stop it. Jehovah says: &quot;I have purposed it, I will also do it. ” (Isaiah 46:11) The NRA and all like recovery schemes will certainly fail, and the prayers of the combined clergy in support of that and all other like schemes for prosperity will also fail, Such prayers will not be heard and answered by Almighty God, because He so states. Prayer uttered in accord with the St, Joseph’s Guild appeal will completely fail to bring peace, prosperity and happiness to the people. The people of good will who desire righteousness will no longer permit themselves to be deceived by such abortive schemes. Those who love God will pray not only during three days in September, but they will be praying constantly every day to Jehovah, in the name of Christ Jesus, in this manner: ‘Hallowed and vindicated be Thy name; Thy kingdom come, and Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.’ God knows of the things we have need of, and hence it is unnecessary and improper to ask for more than our daily bread, even as Jesus taught us to pray; and when the will of God is done on earth all oppression and depression will cease and there will then come to stay peace, prosperity and happiness, and these blessings will come only by and through the kingdom of God under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you would have your prayers answered, take your stand wholly on the side of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, His King, and then be guided by the Word which the Lord has spoken. To such, and to such only, Jesus says (Jolin 15:7): “If ye abide m me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.” The selfish ones of this world who ask for material prosperity and pursue a course contrary to God and His kingdom are not in Christ, nor does the Word of the Lord dwell in them; hence their prayers will not be answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world's darkest hour is just ahead. Satan will continue to bring upon the people one woe after another until God Imai's the cries of the poor. These cries will not be for prosperity, but that God will relieve them from oppressors. It is the rulers and “distinguished men” that have lived in ease, while Ihose who produce the bread have gone hungry. Instead of the prayers of such wanton and selfish men being heard by Jehovah, He says to them (James 5:4) : “Behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by frand, crieth: and the erics of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of [battle].” The God of battle will destroy such at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you would find refuge in that time of great tribulation, take your stand on the side of His kingdom, be taught by His Word of truth, and follow His way of righteousness, and ere long you are certain to emerge into the brilliant light of endless prosperity, peace and everlasting life, which you will receive at the gracious hand of Jehovah God by and through Christ Jesus.—Romans 6:23.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>FAMINE</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Chain 'broadcast from Brooklyn, Sunday, June 17, 1934, by Judge Rutherford</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">F</span><span class="font6">OB. some time the American people have heard of famines and pestilences that have devastated foreign lands. Now these hideous monsters of famine and pestilence threaten this continent, and even today much of North American territory has become a veritable waste. The long’period of economic depression is still upon the country. Added to this, in many of the states and in the provinces of Canada there is almost a total failure of crops, pastures are dead, and cattle are dying from starvation. The small amount of vegetation that has survived the burning rays of the sun and the destructive winds has been quickly devoured by the pest of grasshoppers. Vast fields that once blossomed and produced an abundance of food for man and beast arc now a desert waste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">America lias never experienced a real famine, but that this country is now threatened by famine and pestilence there is not the slightest doubt, millions of people are in dire distress and great perplexity, as indeed they have cause to be. With the greatest concern and anxiety many are now asking, Who is blamable for these perils? Others are saying, This is supposed to be a Christian land, and why should a just God permit famines and pestilences to afflict this land, where the people have always enjoyed the freedom of worship of Almighty God? Seeking an answer to their own inquiries, some charge that the present administration at Washington is responsible for the threatened disaster. Others charge that Almighty God has brought the suffering and distress upon the people by famine and pestilence as a punishment for their derelictions. 0 this erst hold that, because at the beginning of his administration the president stated thathe trusted in divine guidance for the administration of public affairs, the result now shows that God has guided the president and led him and the people into the present great distress and suffering; hence that Mr, Roosevelt and God arc responsible therefor, and that the famine and pestilence now threatening is a direct punishment from God because of an unwise course taken. The New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> on the 5th of June published this statement: “Already some critics of the pig-killing and bread-reducing acreage are wondering whether this drought is not God’s punishment for the destruction of foods when so many people are out of work.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Famine and pestilence are terrible scourges and entail upon the people indescribable suffering, and it would be very wrong to charge anyone with responsibility for such calamities unless the evidence in support of such charge is clear and convincing beyond a reasonable doubt. To magnify the mistakes or derelictions of men is not my purpose, nor would I indulge in the idle hope of influencing public officials to change their way in the administration of governmental affairs. My purpose is to bring to the attention of the common people the indisputable facts, that they may sec the real cause of the distress on earth and then that, they may find the only possible way for security and safety and, above all, that they might have a proper conception of Jehovah, the great Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It. is one thing to say, “I trust, in divine guidance,” and still a far different thing to be guided by the divine Almighty God. If a high official surrounds himself with men who arc wise in the wisdom of this world, even if those men are properly designated “the brain trust”, and if he is guided by their counsel, it is certain thathe is not being guided by divine wisdom, In the Scriptures it is written: “Hath not God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">made foolish the wisdom of this world?” Again says Jehovah, at Psalm 146: &quot;Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.” And again say the Scriptures: &quot;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”—Proverbs 3: 5, 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God has put in the Bible, which is His Word, the true guide for man who seeks divine guidance, and the only possible way to have such guidance is to know, rely upon and follow the Word of God; as it is written, in Psalm 119: &quot;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Furthermore the Scriptures declare: ‘The law of God is perfect; the testimony of Jehovah is sure, making wise the teachable.’ (Psalm 19) Men who have no faith in the Word of Jehovah God, and who ignore His Word and pursue a course according to human wisdom, are unsafe counselors. No man can disregard the word of Jehovah as it is written in the Scriptures and expect to be divinely guided.—Proverbs 1: 25-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In a sincere effort to pull the country out of a great economic depression the NRA was brought into existence, Is the NRA of divine origin ? Under it provision is made for reducing the production of wheat and corn, and for the destruction of domestic animals, in order to enhance the commercial value of that which remains; and could that be the result of divine guidance? The divine Word, by which He guides those who trust Him, gives a thundering answer, NO. Then it must follow that the &quot;recovery act”, so called, is the result of human wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God does not change at any time; hence, if He would guide men in one instance in the restriction of the production of food, and in the destruction of animals, to enhance the value of that which is not destroyed, He would do so on another occasion. As an example, Diocletian, the emperor of Pagan Rome, put in operation an economic system similar to the NRA. About the year 300 he issued an edict regulating wages and the price of goods, decreed the destruction of one-third of the vineyards, reduced the production of food and fixed the price thereof, taxed the people to the limit, and punished the violators of his edict with death and, says </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana;</span><span class="font6"> &quot;The result thereof was disaster.” It is certain that Jehovah God did not guide Diocletian, because he was a heathen who practiced the Devil religion, and who viciously persecuted Christians; and he having no faith in Jehovah God, and opposing Him, certainly God would not guide him.—Malachi 3:6; Psalm 25: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Catholic press has repeatedly published the claim that the principles of the NRA originated with the pope, who resides at Vatican City, near Rome, and the implied conclusion is that the people should accept the NRA as coming from the Lord. There is not the slightest evidence that it is in accord with the Word of Jehovah God, The fact that an old and strong religious organization advocates the same is no evidence whatsoever that it has Jehovah God’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The greatest of all international famines that afflicted the entire earth, for seven years, was during the time when Joseph was ruler in Egypt. The Scriptural evidence is clear and convincing that Jehovah God did guide and approve Joseph. (Hebrews 11: 22) The Bible record at Genesis shows that Joseph, acting upon specific instructions from Jehovah God, and being warned of the approaching famine, increased the production of food and during the plenteous years stored it up in the granaries, and by this means the people from all parts of the earth, during the famine, were fed. (Genesis, chapters 41-47) This record of divine guidance is exactly contrary to the practice of paying the farmers to let their fields lie idle and io kill their pigs in order to enhance the price of that which remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, the destruction of animals good for food, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">merely</span><span class="font6"> for the purpose of enhancing the price of that which is retained, is a direct violation of God’s everlasting covenant, as recorded in the ninth chapter of Genesis, and for the breaking of which God declares, at Isaiah 2-1, He will hold men and nations responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To tax one class of people to raise money and use it to pay the farmers to refrain from raising foodstuffs and to let their lands go untilled and grow up in weeds and thistles, begets idleness, slothfulncss and wastefulness. Idleness and slothfulncss breed crime. Such a course could not be according to the divine will, because it is written in the divine Word that, ‘man must earn his bread by the sweat of his face’; and God condemns idleness and slothfulness, as it is written (Proverbs 18:9): “He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.” Divine wisdom and guidance must be in harmony with God’s Word, and such guidance would encourage the people to produce all the food possible and store the surplus against an evil day, such as the world is now experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The question then is propounded: Is Mr. Roosevelt, the president of the United States, properly chargeable with the responsibility for the threatened famine in the land? Emphatically, No. It would be a great wrong to charge the president of the United States with the responsibility for such a thing. The threatened famine and pestilence is due to a lack of rainfall, the scorching hot winds, and numerous pests. That, calamity would have come just the same, regardless of who was president of the United States; and it cannot be charged to any political party. To charge it to the mistakes of men would be doing a great injustice to ourselves, as well as to others. What I have said about the reduction of crops and the destruction of animals is stated for the purpose of showing the people that such a course has not been taken under the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">guidance of Jehovah God,</span><span class="font6"> and this statement is made particularly to put in their minds the proper conception of the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What evil could possibly result by reason of the chief executive in the land claiming to have divine guidance and then not being guided divinely? Just this: Millions of people in the United States have put their trust in a man and, being induced to believe thathe was being guided by the Almighty, they have eagerly subscribed to such things as the NRA, trusting therein to bring them out of their depression; and when it is demonstrated that the NRA is a failure, and that, the acts performed thereunder have been attended with disaster and suffering, the people at once are inclined to lose confidence not only in man but. in Jehovah God, because they believe that God has led the ruler in the way that has brought grief upon them. Such a result is the very tiling that, the adversary of Jehovah God would desire.—Jeremiah 17: 5, 6; Psalm 118:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But is it not true, as the professional religionists now claim, that God is responsible for the lack of rainfall, and that He has sent the drought and the pestilence upon the people as a punishment, and that therefore God is responsible for the threatened famine? I answer, most emphatically, NO. Jehovah the Almighty God is in no wise responsible for the present threatened famine, nor has He sent the pestilence and distress upon the peoples of the world as a punishment at this time. When Jehovah purposes to punish the people He always gives full and fair warning beforehand, that the people who trust Him may seek a place of protection and safety. (1 Kings 17:1-8; Ezekiel 3: 17-21; Exodus 9:18-26) Furthermore, in some portions of North America the rainfall has been abundant and the crops arc in fairly good shape, while in other parts of the land they are devastated. The people in one part of the land are no better than those in the other part, and are no worse. The rains fall upon the just and the unjust; and concerning this it is written in the Scriptures: “Your Father which is in heaven . . . maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, ' and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.&quot; -—Matthew 5: 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">One of the great mistakes made by men who have attempted to rule the people and to bring prosperity to them is this: They have relied upon professional religious leaders to guide them as to spiritual things and have disregarded the Word of God. Professional religious leaders stand before the legislative bodies, and in a form of words invoke the divine blessing upon the nation; but both the speakers and the hearers of those words give no heed or consideration to divine instruction set forth in the Bible. It could not be expected that God would answer prayers of those who ignore His instruction. Political leaders are blind to God’s Word because they have not tried to understand it. Professional religious leaders arc blind to God's Word and purpose, because they have relied upon human traditions and the teachings of an organization. (Matthew 15:7-9; Jeremiah 23:18-22; Proverbs 1: 28-30) The people have been kept in ignorance of Jehovah’s purpose because they have been prevented from learning the truth of God’s Word. Now as an aid to the common people in this hour of perplexity, the warning is again sounded that the only sane and safe course to take is to disregard the theories of men and to learn and rely upon the Word of God. Since 1914 events have rapidly come to pass, which events, in the light of God’s Word, should fully convince thoughtful persons that there is a mighty change now taking place and that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">only hope</span><span class="font6"> for the people is in the kingdom of Jehovah God, which is now at hand. —Matthew 24: 3-34; Luke 21:28-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who, then, is responsible for the threatened famine and for the pestilences that now are devastating the land of this country and bringing great distress and perplexity upon the people? The Scriptural answer is that the one responsible therefor is God’s great adversary, the Deceiver, and man’s worst enemy, who is Satan the Devil. If now you will give heed I will prove this statement to the entire satisfaction of every man who really believes in divine guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Bible is an inexhaustible storehouse of knowledge, given for the instruction of everyone who desires to be guided by divine wisdom. (2 Timothy 3:16, 17) That divine record contains a superabundance of testimony proving that centuries ago Satan the Devil rebelled against. Jehovah God and challenged God to put on earth men who would be faithful and true to Jehovah, Satan claiming thathe could induce all men to turn away from and curse God. That challenge was accepted in order to afford an opportunity to demonstrate to all creation the supremacy of God, and in order to prove in due time that Satan’s boastful challenge is entirely wrong. Therefore to Satan God said, as recorded in Exodus nine: “For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they [my witnesses] may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Exodus 9:16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font6"> God fixed the time limit in which Satan would be permitted, without hindrance, to prove his boastful challenge, and which time limit marks the end of Satan’s world; and that time is now here. In that long period of waiting God has permitted men to choose either to obey His Word or to follow their own devices and to fall into the snares set by Satan. That Satan the Devil is a mighty spirit creature with power to produce storms, hurricanes, floods, famines and pestilences, is abundantly proved by the Scriptures, particularly at the book of Job, and in mauy other places. (Job 1:12-19; Acts 27:14-44; Revelation 12:12) It was Satan who raised the storm on the sea of Galilee for the express purpose of bringing about the destruction of Jesus and His faithful associates. (Matthew 8: 24) When on earth Jesus spoke a. prophecy in which He declared that Satan’s time limit to rule unhindered would be marked by a world war, in which nation would rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. In fulfilment of that prophecy Satan plunged the nations of “Christendom” into the war of 1914. God was not responsible for that war. That war, said Jesus, would mark the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">beginning</span><span class="font6"> of great sorrows upon the peoples of earth. Everybody can testify that from 1914 to this day the sorrows upon the nations have continued to increase. Among the sorrows to befall the world Jesus, in that great prophecy, said: ‘In divers places there shall be famines, pestilences and terrors; and upon earth distress of nations, with perplexity, men’s hearts failing them for fear of what they see coming upon the earth.’ (Luke 21:11, 25, 26, R.V.) Satan has brought such sorrows upon the world since 1918, and many nations are now afflicted thereby. Why, then, ignore these facts and the Scriptures? and why follow the wisdom of imperfect men ? Why not be diligent to ascertain the reason for these calamities, be guided by divine wisdom, and learn what course to take and what will be the result?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you would learn the real cause for these famines and distresses take your Bible now and turn to the eleventh chapter of Revelation and there read these words, to wit: ‘We thank thee, Lord God Almighty, that thou hast taken unto thee thy great power and reigned. And the nations were angry.’ The facts mark 1914 as the date of the fulfilment of that great prophecy, when the World War began. At the same time there was a war in heaven between Christ and the Devil, resulting in the casting of the Devil down to the earth, The Lord gives specific warning to the peoples of the earth in these words; “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knowetli thathe hath but a short time.” (Revelation 12:12) Here is the positive and indisputable evidence that the Devil is responsible for bringing all these woes upon the peoples of the earth at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With propriety you ask, Why should the Devil want to bring these great woes upon the people? The Scriptural answer is that for centuries Satan has been endeavoring to turn all men away from God in order to prove his own wicked challenge, and Satan would prefer to see the whole world perish rather than that any man should faithfully serve Jehovah God. lie knows that his time is short till the great battle of Armageddon, which will be the decisive conflict between wickedness and righteousness; and within that short time the Devil endeavors to cause all men to curse God and die. The Devil is a subtle and wily foe, and to accomplish his purposes he resorts to all manner of frand and deception, thereby overreaching men who have good intentions but who follow human devices and avoid divine instruction.—2 Corinthians 2:11; 11:13-15; 2 Thessalonians 2:9; Revelation 12: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Proverbs 29 it is written: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” The absence of an understanding or vision of God’s expressed purpose lays the people open to the deceptions of Satan, and following in the blind lead of human wisdom the people come into great grief. Therefore knowledge and understanding of God’s Word is now of greatest importance. In that same chapter of Proverbs it is written: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe.” The president, even though with the most sincere desire to aid the people, has permitted himself to be led, not by the divine Word, but, in economic matters, by the counsel of worldly philosophers, and in spiritual matters by worldly ecclesiastics. Acting upon this unsound counsel he launched the human scheme of recovery, ignoring the Scriptural reason as to why this depression is upon the world. Congressmen have feared to oppose the scheme, and hence have blindly supported it. The people put their trust in the president because they believe in his claim of divine guidance, and the people have feared to take any other course than to rely upon the NR A, and the result is that all have fallen into the snare. &quot;Whose snare? Not the snare of any man; but they have fallen into the snare of Satan the Devil, who subtly entraps men in this time of peril. The Scriptures, at 2 Timothy 3, specifically point out that this is a time of peril and mark out what shall come to pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the ecclesiastics or religious leaders know what is in the divine Word, their fear has caused them to avoid telling it. Had they believed and trusted God’s Word they would have told the officials and the peoples of America, and would tell them now, that the threatened famine and the pestilence and the distress and perplexity and the terrors upon the world have not come by reason of the fault of the president, or any of his official family, nor because of the derelictions of any other political party; that they have not come upon the peoples as a punishment from God, but that they have come by reason of the fact that Satan the Devil is now attempting to turn all people away from God and drive them into destruction. These plain truths arc now told as a warning and for the benefit of the people, and are certainly of the greatest public convenience and necessity at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Regardless of the honesty and good intentions of men to bring prosperity to the people by such means as the NRA, all such human schemes are doomed to certain failure. When the people are induced to believe that these human schemes of recovery have divine guidance, and when these schemes do fail, then millions of people who have heretofore thought they</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">were Christians, and who have put their trust in men, will lose all faith in men and in God, and will say: “If God permits such calamities to come upon us and will nothelp us, then wc do not wish to have Him for our God.” That is exactly what the Devil expects to accomplish. That fact has already been accomplished in Russia and in Germany, where infidelity holds sway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What, then, is the hope for the people? Jehovah God, at Matthew 12, gives answer to that question in these words: &quot;Behold my servant [Christ Jesus], whom 1 have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased ■ I will pul my spirit upon him, and he shall show justice Io Die [nations]. , . . And in his name shall the ] mil ions | m,i ' A rmagr ddon will mark the complete end of .'Ditnn 'h rule of the world. Why should the people put iheii mi i m Chri'il Jenis and His kingdom? The answer ITuiu (hid'ii Word is this, I hat Armageddon will demon ti.He to .ill emdton that Jehovah is the all-wise, jiml mid loving (lod, mid that His government for mankind, enluhlished with Christ Jesus as theinvisiblo head thereof, will bring to pass that which righteous men have long desired. At Armageddon, which is but a short lime in the future, Christ Jesus will completely rid the earth of all wickedness. Then the people will be rid of oppressors and oppression, and that will mark the end of sorrows, distress and perplexities. Wars will cease, and peace and prosperity will come to stay. Concerning this it is written in God’s Word that Christ is King and the government shall be upon His shoulder; His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God. the Everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace; and of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end.—Psalm 2: 6; Isaiah 9: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What could be of such great interest to the people as to know now these truths and to know that in the near future God’s righteous government shall take charge of the affairs of earth ? Who would be attempting to keep the people in ignorance concerning that great kingdom? Only Satan and those whom he can use. It ought to be apparent to all persons who think that those opposing the proclamation of this message from God’s Word are being used as instruments of Satan to accomplish his wicked purposes.—1 Thessalonians 2:</span><span class="font6"> 18; Romans 6 :16; Luke 11: 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this connection it is my duty to call your att ention to the fact that within many states of America a strenuous effort is now being made to enact laws to prevent the freedom of speech and press and freedom of worship of Jehovah God, and this for the purpose of keeping the people in darkness concerning the great truths that they now need to know. Those who are thus opposing arc playing exactly into the hands of the Devil whether they realize it or not. When I say these things I am not charging men with seeking to do injury to their fellow creatures, but I am stating most emphatically that the ecclesiastics, who have attempted to lead the people, are blind to the truth and, as Jesus declared, the blind are leading the blind, and the ditch awaits all who walk in that way. The time has come for the American people to arouse themselves and to insist upon an open and fair discussion and examination of the divine Word, in order that they might learn the way to true prosperity, life, liberty and happiness. Let them strenuously protest against any law that restricts the liberty of freedom of expression concerning God’s Word. The fact that some claim that their “susceptibilities are shocked” by a declaration of Bible truths is conclusive evidence that they are not in harmony with the Bible truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most perilous time the world has ever known is just ahead. The tribulations that are now upon the earth are great, but Jesus declares that the final end will witness the greatest tribulation that has ever afflicted the world; and we are rapidly approaching that</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FAMINE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">day of unprecedented tribulation. (Matthew 24:14, 21, 22; Jeremiah 25: 31-36; Joel 3: 9-16) I appeal to the common people of America to refuse longer to be led by blind guides, but to turn their attention to the Scriptures and examine these in the light of the present-day events and thereby to learn that Satan is your worst enemy and Jehovah is your everlasting Friend. Let every man who loves righteousness and hates iniquity be of sober mind, lay aside all prejudice, and with diligence study the Word of God. Therein will he learn that the only hope for the human race is the complete destruction of Satan’s organization and the complete establishment of God’s kingdom under Christ. The reign of Christ will make the earth a desirable place for men to live and will give to obedient men peace and prosperity, joy, health, strength, and life everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whether or not ecclesiastics can continue to hide behind their skirts and to induce public officials, under the forms of law, to imprison men and women who, as witnesses of Jehovah, are telling the people the truth they so much need, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font6"> whether these public servants of the people will cast away from them the evil influence of the ecclesiastics and demand the free and open proclamation of God’s Word of truth, remains to be seen. To know the truth now is of the greatest importance to man. Therefore I appeal to the people to arm themselves, not with instruments of destruction, but with the infallible knowledge of the Word of Almighty God, that they may know the only place of protection from threatened perils, and the only way to everlasting life. God’s kingdom is your refuge now. There is none other.</span></p>
