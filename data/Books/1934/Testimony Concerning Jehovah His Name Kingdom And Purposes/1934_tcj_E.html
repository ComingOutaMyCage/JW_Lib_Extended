<p><span class="font6">FOREWORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">This little booklet containing the lectures by Judge Rutherford which have been recorded upon phonograph records is prepared to assist those of good will to a better understanding of Jehovah's purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the lectures many Scriptures are referred to in support of the statements made. Questions will arise in the minds of the listeners. The Scriptures are listed at the end of each lecture, in order that the witness can • refer quickly to them and give scriptural answers to the questions. The small superior figures scattered through the text indicate the proper reference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After running a record or two a discussion of the subject matter naturally follows. With this aid the witness can call attention to the important points of the lecture i ~ and answer any further questions. A list of questions is ; also included which can be used in a further study of these very helpful talks. It is by discussing these mat-i . ters, and asking questions about them, and receiving sat-• i isfactory answers with scriptural proof that one learns of Jehovah’s wonderful purposes. This is an excellent manner of preaching the Kingdom message.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark26"></a>JEHOVAH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The name Jehovah applies exclusively to the Supreme Being. ’ He is the Most High, above all. </span><span class="font6">* His name Jehovah signifies His purpose toward His creatures. ’ He is the Almighty God, which means that He is the Creator of all things in heaven and in earth, and that His power is almighty and nothing can successfully resist Him. God created man and created the earth as a place for man to live. ’All men who will ever gain life everlasting must know and obey Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah provides two primary ways for man to gain a knowledge of Him: '(1) by man’s observing the things created, which of themselves silently tell of a supreme power, and ’(2) by His revealed Word, which is the Bible, otherwise called the Holy Scriptures. 'Jehovah God long ago caused faithful men to write the Bible at His dictation, and this divine record is made for the purpose of giving man needed information. 'The Bible is the truth, and for centuries has successfully resisted all efforts to discredit it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> ‘“All the human race are the offspring of one man, whose name was Adam and who was created by Jehovah God a perfect man. <sup>11</sup> That man disobeyed Jehovah and was sentenced to death, after which all of his children were born; and for that reason all the human race by inheritance are sinners. “ The Scriptures truly declare that Jehovah God is love, which means that He is unselfish and that He does good unto all creatures without any gain to himself. ” Every act of Jehovah is prompted by love or unselfishness, hence He is wholly devoted to righteousness. ” It is His will that His creatures be wholly devoted to righteousness. &quot;&nbsp;He has provided the means ’ for all men to gain a knowledge of the truth in order that they may learn the way of righteousness and live for ' ever in happiness. We have now come to the time when men are given greater opportunities than ever before to learn the way of righteousness and life.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> “Jehovah God is the giver of life; hence it is prop, erly said of Him <sup>11</sup> He is the fountain of life. “ His beloved Son is Christ Jesus, whose position in the universe - is next to that of Jehovah. “The purpose of Jehovah is to give life to obedient men by and through .the ministration of Christ Jesus when such men are fully obedient to <sub>r</sub> Him. ” For this reason Jesus said of Jehovah and for the benefit of men: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. ” (John 17:3) No man can get everlast-</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">a person who is willing to be taught. ’’Jehovah's promise to man is that He will teach the meek in the way that he . should go; ” hence if a man seeks knowledge, earnestly desiring the same, God will reward his efforts. “Jehovah has now brought to pass conditions in the world that make it possible for man to understand His name and His purpose, and for this reason He has supplied the • means for understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span><span class="font6"> “Jehovah commands that all men shall love Him , &gt;&nbsp;with a pure heart and must be obedient to His commandments in order to prove their love for Him. Such is not a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">•. . selfish command, but is entirely unselfish and for the special benefit of man. ” There are mighty creatures that . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are called gods, because </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">god</span><span class="font6"> means “mighty one”, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is but one Jehovah, the Almighty God. ” He is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Eternal One, and there is none other who can give life everlasting to man. It would be inconsistent for God to . give everlasting life to anyone out of harmony with Him, and therefore He tells man that if he desires to have everlasting life he must be obedient. “Jehovah also com-&lt; mands that man shall make no image and worship that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That requirement is for man’s best interests. If a man ■&gt; devotes himself to an image or thing, that tends to turn</span></p>

That which is of greatest importance to man is to, gain a knowledge of Jehovah as set forth in the Bible. ”“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">7. Since God created the first man perfect, and all men are the offspring of that first man, why is there so much sickness, distress and sorrow and death amongst the human race! Is Jehovah responsible for all this sorrow and suffering amongst men, including death! Jehovah is not responsible at all therefor. The Bible answer to the question as to why these disagreeable things have come to pass will be answered in another speech called &quot;Rebellion”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">When Jehovah God created the earth and placed man upon it He appointed His spirit creature Lucifer as overlord of the earth, including man.</span><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> It was the duty of Lucifer to obey God and to render aid to man in learning of the unseen things of God's universe. ’ Lucifer became ambitious to control the human race and have men worship him, that he might be one like unto the Most High. Lucifer became a traitor to God. ’ He rebelled against Jehovah's law and induced other spirit creatures to join him in that rebellion. <sup>4</sup> He also caused man to join in that rebellion and to. turn against Jehovah God. Prior to that time God had told Adam that a violation of His law would result in man’s death. ’Adam having willingly violated God’s law, and having joined Lucifer in his rebellion against God, man was sentenced to death. God had provided man with the power to produce his own kind, that is to say, to bring children into existence. • This power man did not exercise while perfect, but after he Was sentenced to death and before he died his children .' were born. ’ For that reason all of them inherited the result of Adam's sentence of death, and hence were born &gt;&nbsp;sinners or imperfect.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> After the rebellion Jehovah changed the name of • Lucifer, giving him four separate and distinct names, each one of which has a different meaning: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">‘Satan,</span><span class="font6"> meaning opposer of God; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>9</sup>Devil,</span><span class="font6"> meaning slanderer of God; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'“Serpent,</span><span class="font6"> meaning deceiver of creatures; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Dragon, </span><span class="font6">meaning one who tries to devour all who do right. ”At <sub>x</sub> the same time God sentenced Lucifer, now the Devil, to death, but He did not at that time execute His judgment against the Devil. ”A wicked challenge was made by Satan to Jehovah in which Satan claimed that Jehovah could not put men on earth that would remain true and faithful to Him under the test. That challenge involved the word and name of God; and in order that all creation might learn that the power of Jehovah is supreme, and that He is the only source of life and goodness, God accepted the challenge and <sup>14</sup> has permitted Satan to continue in existence during the many centuries since that he might have full opportunity to prove his wicked challenge. Had God killed the Devil at the beginning of his rebellion the other creatures of the universe would never have had opportunity to determine whether or not man can be true to God under a severe test.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> ’’Jehovah fixed a time limit during which Satan should have opportunity to do what he could to prove his wicked challenge, and ”at the same time God declared • that when that time limit expired He would then execute His judgment of death against Satan and destroy with him all of those who willingly put themselves on Satan’s side. ” Satan not only is the oppdser of Jehovah, but is man’s worst enemy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">4. ’’The time limit fixed for Satan to carry on his operations is now up, and within a very short time God will, by the hand of Christ Jesus, His Chief executive officer, fight the Devil and his forces at the battle of Armageddon, which will be the worst ever known, and in that • conflict Satan and his organization will be destroyed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">‘•That is the reason why the time is now here when people must hare opportunity to know about Jehovah and His purpose toward them. *° This affords all an opportunity to take their stand either on the Devil’s side or on Jehovah’s side. Only those who take Jehovah’s side will live. A detailed explanation of this matter will be found in the book called </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance,</span><span class="font6"> ’'and it is of vital impor-ance that you learn the truths therein contained.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font6"> ” The Devil endeavors to entrap every person who takes his stand on Jehovah’s side, and would succeed if not prevented by the Lord. It is written: ”“The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.” **If one is on Jehovah’s side and faithfully serves Him he may have the assurance that God will provide protection for him. “ No power can successfully resist Jehovah. ” But God does not exercise His power in behalf of anyone except those who diligently try to serve Him. &quot;&nbsp;Be assured, then, that your safety from the Devil depends entirely on your faithfulness to God. ”At the present time it is a great privilege to know how you may receive protection. ”Be diligent, therefore, to learn the truth that leads the way to life and happiness.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark31"></a>REDEMPTION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’Jesus is the Son of Jehovah God. </span><span class="font6">* He was the beginning of God’s creation ’and thereafter God used Him as His active agent in the creation of all things. ‘ In the beginning His name was Logos. ‘Jehovah by the exercise of His miraculous power caused the Logos to become a man and called His name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus,</span><span class="font6"> which means that He is the Savior of the world. ‘ The the chief purpose of Jesus’ being born a man and coming to earth was that He might vindicate Jehovah’s name. ’God made Jesus His witness to the truth, meaning that Jesus must bear testimony before men of the world. ‘When He was thirty years of age He began to go about amongst the people telling them the truth. * He was hated by the Devil and the clergy because He told the truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> The secondary purpose of Jesus’ becoming a man was that He might be the Redeemer or Savior of the human race from sin and death and afford man opportunity to live. &quot;All the human family are the offspring of the imperfect Adam, but it was the perfect man Adam who violated God’s law and was sentenced to death.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> ”God must be consistent; therefore He could not reverse His judgment and annul the sentence. ” His law upon which the judgment was based required the life of the perfect man. “God could be consistent, however, and permit another perfect man to pay the death penalty in the place and stead of Adam and to thereby provide means for Adam and all of his offspring to be released from death and the effects thereof. ”An angel could not redeem or buy the right to human life, because an angel is greater than a man. Nothing but a perfect man could give his life a ransom or corresponding price for perfect Adam; “ therefore God caused Jesus to be made a man and in the likeness of sinful man in order that He might meet the requirements of God’s law in the place and stead of Adam. ” For this reason it was written, in Hebrews: “But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour: that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.” ’&quot;This shows that the death of Jesus may result to the benefit of every man.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> ’&quot;Jehovah God was under no obligation to provide redemption for man, but His love for man prompted Him to do so; therefore it is written: ’““For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever belicvcth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” ”No person can believe a thing until he first has some knowledge of that thing. ” Men must learn that Jesus is the Redeemer of mankind. ” In order to give this information to man God has caused the truth to be told or preached by other faithful men from the day of Jesus until now. ” It is the will of God that the people be told about Jesus as the Redeemer, that they might accept Him as their Savior; therefore it is written in the Scriptures: ’’“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed! and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard! nnd how shall they hear without a preacher?” ” It is for the benefit of the tnen who desire to be saved that the truth is preached to the people. &quot;If anyone claims to preach the gospel but, instead of doing so, teaches the. doctrines of men and receives money therefor, he is doing a very great wrong.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font6"> Had not God made provision for the redemption of man from death and its effects the entire human race in time would perish for ever. Since nothing but the life of a perfect creature could satisfy the law of God, it follows that the one who redeems man must do so with his own lifeblood; hence it is written concerning the redemption of men: ’&quot;‘‘Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, (such] as silver and gold, . . . but with the precious blood of Christ.” &quot;Jesus Christ, by the will of God, having purchased the human race by His own blood, the race belongs to Jesus to do with mankind according to the will of God; therefore it is written that Jehovah said of Jesus: “‘‘Ask of me, and I shall give thee the (nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span><span class="font6"> ” To keep man in ignorance of redemption Satan causes many clergymen to teach that there is no value in the shed blood of Christ. Give no heed to their false teachings. A full explanation of this matter is set forth in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation.</span><span class="font6"> ” It is vital to you that you gain a knowledge of the truth as there set forth.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">’A creature that breathes, moves, is conscious, and thinks, is properly said to live. * Death is the very opposite of life, because a dead man does not breathe, cannot move, he is entirely unconscious, and Jtnows not anything. ’If a creature possessed the right to live he might live for ever. ‘Adam had the right to life, but he lost it because of his disobedience to God, and m due time he entirely lost life. ’ No one can get life except by the will of God; therefore it is written: &quot;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23) This text shows that life and death are exactly opposite to each other. God suffers or permits men to have a small mens-ure of life, even though they do not have the right thereto, * but in due time every man dies; hence it is written: “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.’’</span></p>

(Matthew 20:28) ’’There is no possible way for any man to get everlasting life except by faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus. ’’Since Jesus gave His life as a man for the redemption of mankind, it is the will of God that all men shall hear the truth and thus be given an opportunity to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and obey His righteous law and live.</span></p></li>

Satan’s earthly representatives are made up of three elements, according to the Scriptures: religious, political and commercial; and together they constitute the visible part of Satan’s organization. ’’All of these selfish and wicked ones hate Jehovah’s witnesses; hence Jesus says to these witnesses: ‘‘Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” Satan and his host hate everyone who takes his stand on the side of God; ” hence . it is written that Satan is gathering all the nations and rulers of the world unto the ‘battle of the great day of . God Almighty’ with the hope and expectation of destroying those who are on God’s side. The prophecy of Zechariah gives a detailed description of the preparation for this great battle, and the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Preparation</span><span class="font6"> makes the whole matter clear. It is to your great interest to acquaint yourself with what is contained in that book.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> “ The fighting in that battle will be chiefly by unseen warriors, that is, Satan and all of his host of wicked angels which constitute the invisible part of his army. “On earth there will be found on Satan’s side the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the Federal Council of Churches, and various other religious organizations which opperate for selfish gain, and which will be associated with the great men of commerce who use their money and power to oppress the people, and also the professional politicians who do the bidding of Big Business. Together with this unholy alliance will be joined the police power and army and navy, otherwise designated the ‘‘strong-arm squad”. All of these will be without faith in God and His King, and they will all boast of their own power. “On the side of Jehovah will be the , Lord Jesus and His host of holy angels constituting His army. ” In the Lord’s army will be found a little company of Jehovah’s witnesses, visible to human eyes, “and the only part that they will perform in that day of battle will be to sing the praises of Jehovah and His kingdom. “God will give the command, and Christ Jesus will begin the battle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> ” The result of that battle will be the greatest trouble ever known since the world began, and the greatest loss of human life. There will be such a terrible slaughter, and the dead will be so numerous, that the survivors cannot bury them. In that battle the religious</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6">leaders, and the principal men of their flocks, will find no way of escape, but all of which shall fall and be crushed to pieces. The twenty-fifth chapter of Jeremiah gives a brief description of that terrible fight. <sup>11</sup> The wicked rule of Satan will be destroyed, and that will be the end of all war and tribulation on earth. The new ruler, Christ Jesus, having destroyed the wicked rule, shall put in full operation His government of righteousness, all to the good of men and to the glory of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font6"> Concerning Christ it is written: “The government shall be upon His shoulder; He shall be called the Mighty Counselor, The Prince of Peace; and His government shall never end.’’ ” You should learn more about that righteous government and receive its blessings, because under it all who do right shall live for ever in happiness and peace.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark38"></a>SOUL - \</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Does every person possess an immortal soul! </span><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The only way to obtain a correct answer to that question is to read it in the Bible. What is contained in the Bible is the .truth, because it is the Word of God. The correct answer to the question clears up many other confusing doctrines. ’ The word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">soul</span><span class="font6"> means a living creature. Every living creature is a soul, and that includes men and animals. A man is a soul, but he docs not possess a soul. The body and the breath of life which animates the brain and other organs together constitute a soul or creature. In Genesis 2:7 it is written: “God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” This scripture says nothing about God’s giving man a soul.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> An immortal soul would mean one which is not subject to death and does not die. * When God created man He said to him: ‘In the day that you sin you shall surely die.’ God's law did not mean that merely the body would die, but that the man himself would cease to exist. In Ezekiel 18:4 it is written: “The soul that sinneth, it shall die;” and that alone is proof conclusive that the soul is not immortal. <sup>1</sup> It is written: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not sec death T shall he deliver his</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">soul from the hand of the gravel” There is not one text of the Bible that says that man has an immortal soul, but, on the eontrary, all texts bearing upon the matter show that man is a mortal soul or creature.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> The clergy teach that the soul is immortal. What is their authority for such teaching? “Satan, the Devil, is the author of the false teaching that the soul is immortal. “ The Scriptures declare that Satan is the father of lies and always resorts to lying. <sup>1</sup> He deceived Eve, the first woman, by telling a lie. It is written, in Genesis three, that Satan, that old serpent, said to Eve, in contradiction of God's law, “Ye shall not surely die.” “Satan’s purpose in telling that lie was to turn mankind away from God. Ever since then Satan has deceived men and caused religious teachers to tell the people that there is no death. Whenever you hear any company or organization of people teaching that there is no death you may know at once that Satan is the author of that teaching and that it is wholly false.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> * Satan himself is not immortal. God has sentenced Satan to death, and within a short time now God will destroy Satan, together with all other wicked ones.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">When the man Jesus was on earth He was not immortal, because it was written of Him that He was dead for three days and on the third day God raised Him up out of death. ” The angels are not immortal, because it is written in the Scriptures that there are wicked angels and that all the wicked God will destroy. ” Man is made lower than angels. We know from observation that men die. Who, then, is immortal? ’’The Scriptural answer is that God alone is immortal, without beginning and without end. ” When God raised Christ Jesus from the dead He gave to Jesus immortality, so that He cannot die again. ” No one will ever get immortality except those who are the true followers of Christ Jesus and who remain faithful unto death. To the Christians the Scriptures says: ‘Seek ye immortality.’ You know that a man</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">does not seek what hp already possesses. In addressing true Christians the Scriptures declare concerning the ' soul, that is, the man: “This mortal must put on immortality.” It would be entirely inconsistent for God to give every man an immortal soul and then require Christians to be faithful unto death in order to receive immortality as a reward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark39"></a>THE DEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Where are the dead? Would you wish that question , answered according to man’s theory, or to have the answer as pointed out in the Bible? You will say man’s answer would only be a guess, because no man has ever returned from the dead and told us where the dead are. The clergy teach the people that the dead are alive and conscious either in purgatory, in hell or in heaven. </span><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Such teaching is entirely false and is based upon Satan’s lie concerning the inherent immortality of all souls.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"><sup> 1</sup> The Scriptures declare that man is a soul and * the soul that sins shall die, ’and that when man dies he does not know anything, has neither feeling, hearing nor any other sense. It is written, in Ecclesiastes nine: “The living know that they shall die: but the dead know not anything. . . . Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">go-</span><span class="font6">est.” <sup>8</sup> In another scripture it is written: “For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?’’ ’“Like sheep they are laid in the grave.” ’“The dead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> Why, in the face of these plain scriptures, do the clergymen teach the people that the dead are alive? ’ The reason is the false teaching originated with the Devil, whose purpose is to reproach the name of Jehovah God and ’cause the people to walk in darkness, ’&quot;and the Devil has overreached the clergymen and causes them to teach false doctrines. &quot;&nbsp;Long ago he deceived men in the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">church organizations and caused these false doctrines to be taught concerning the dead; and upon the false assumption, that the dead are alive, is based the false doctrine concerning purgatory and eternal torment. ” If the dead are entirely unconscious, as the Scriptures show, and do not feel, and have no knowledge of any kind, then it would be impassible for them to be suffering in purgatory or in any other place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>t</sub></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">4. But why is it man dies at all! The Scriptures answer that question entirely in a satisfactory manner. ’’Adam, the first man, the father of the human race, sinned, and after he had been sentenced to death for such wrong, and while undergoing that sentence, being sick and imperfect, his children were conceived and born. For that reason all the human race inherited the imperfections of their father and were born imperfect or sinners. Jn Romans 5:12 it is written: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font6"> “ Ever since Adam’s day men have been dying, and no man could ever get life everlasting unless Jehovah had made provision for man to live. ” In making this provision Jehovah God sent Jesus to earth to redeem the human race by His own lifeblood, ’’and now God provides that every person who believes this great truth, and who obeys what is written in His law, the Bible, shall live and shall not die. ” For this reason it is written: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span><span class="font6"> “ The only way for man to get life is through Christ Jesus; hence it is written: ”“For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” In order for man to receive the benefits of the sacrifice of Jesus and gain life he must first have a knowledge of the truth as it is written in the Bible. ”Of course, Satan, by deceiving</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">' the clergy and causing them to teach false doctrines, keeps the people in ignorance, but now is God’s time to give the truth to those who really want to know it in order that they may get life. The Bible contains all these &lt;&nbsp;truths, and at this present time God has permitted books to be written and brought to you which explain the Bible, and by the use of these books, together with your Bible, you can learn exactly what you need to know.</span></p>

Not one of these has returned to earth, for the reason, they are entirely out l of existence; ” but God has provided that in due time all the dead in their graves shall be awakened and given a knowledge of the truth in order that they may choose to follow righteousness and live. Jesus said ‘all in their graves shall be awakened and come forth’. <sup>13</sup> The words of Jesus are true and constitute a safe guide for man.

<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark40"></a>PURGATORY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Catholic clergy in particular, and many Protestants, teach the people that those who died in sin are now in “purgatory” or torment. What is meant by “purgatory”! and who are there! “Purgation” means to “cleanse” or “make pure”; and the supposed “purgatory” is presumed to be a place for the cleansing of men from their sins, so that when a sinner dies he might be cleansed after being dead. The clergy claim that this may be done while he is dead. They also teach that the prayers of priests can be said for one in “purgatory” and thereby his term of punishment shortened and his release be much earlier. Many good people have paid large sums of money to Catholic priests to pray for their dead ones upon the theory that they could get them out of “purgatory”. It is therefore seen that the “purga-</span><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> tory” teaching has been used as a means of obtaining revenue.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> The doctrine of sinners suffering in &quot;purgatory” is wholly false and has brought a great reproach upon the name of Jehovah God. It would be a terrible thing if the Almighty God would commit men to “purgatory” and then permit other men to pray for them to get them out, and ttf receive a money consideration for so doing.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’As the Bible plainly teaches, those who have died are entirely out of existence and unconscious, not knowing anything. If we believe the Bible, then we must certainly know that there is no person in “purgatory”, and that there is no such place in existence. There is not one scripture in the Bible to support the “purgatory” theory. The false doctrine of “purgatory” began to be taught in the Roman Catholic organization some 1600 years ago, and since that time Catholic priests have continued to preach it and collect money for prayers upon the pretext of getting men out of “purgatory”. The people have paid their money and got nothing in return. ’ This is another false doctrine of Satan based upon his original lie, his purpose being to deceive the people and cause them to suffer both mentally and materially. Because this doctrine has been taught so many centuries doubtless many priests in the Catholic organization verily believe it to be true; but that does not make it true.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> Some will cite the case of the thief that was crucified the day that Jesus died. ’The thief said to Jesus: “Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.” Jesus replied: “I say unto thee today [that is, now), shalt thou be with me in paradise.” The word “paradise” means a garden or beautiful condition of the earth, and has no reference to a place of cleansing. ‘Jesus did not go to “purgatory” or any other place that day, because He was dead and in the grave for three days. ’After His resurrection He ascended into heaven. ’“Paradise” has reference to the beautiful earth which will be made so by Jesus during the time of Hi£ kingdom. The thief died that day and went into the grave, and is there yet. The meaning of Jesus’ words, therefore, is this: ’That because the thief exercised faith in Jesus he would be brought forth during the reign of Christ and have an opportunity to live on the beautiful earth. This matter is fully explained in the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reconciliation, </span><span class="font6">which you should read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> Furthermore, priests have no authority to say prayers for forgiveness of sins of those who have died. ’Only God can forgive sins, and prayers for the dead are not heard by Jehovah. ’No man’s prayers are heard until that person believes on God and Christ and then consecrates himself to do the will of God. To claim that men are suffering in “purgatory” and can be released by the prayers of others is not only a false doctrine, but a defamation of God’s name. The dead are in the tomb awaiting to be awakened out of death. “Jesus said: ‘Marvel , not: the hour is coming in which all that are in their graves shall hear His voice and come forth: they that ■ have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection by judgment. ’</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark43"></a>RESURRECTION *</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The word “resurrection” means a 'standing up again to life’. If, as claimed by the clergy, the dead are alive in “purgatory” or some other place, then it follows that there could be no resurrection; and yet there is no truth more clearly taught in the Bible than that of the resurrection of the dead. Death means the absence of life, and resurrection means awakening to life again. If the dead arc to live again, then they must be resurrected and God has provided that there shall be a resurrection. </span><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The basis for the resurrection of the dead is the sacrifice of Christ Jesus. ’All mankind were born in sin, and the death of the perfect man Jesus provided the purchase price for the right of man to live again, and in due time Jesus will awaken them out of death. Men had been dying for 4,000 years before the death of Jesus, and hence they knew nothing about the value of His death. Men have been dying in ignorance of the value of Jesus’ death for the past 1900 years. ’All of the dead in God’s due time shall be awakened out of death, that they may obtain a knowledge of the truth, and then each one for himself must choose to obey God and Christ and live, or else continue in sin and be forever destroyed. * Therefore it is written: “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> ’God has appointed a fixed time for the resurrection of the dead, and that time is during the reign of Christ as King of the world. ’His reign has now begun, but His first great act is to destroy Satan and his power, and that will be done shortly, at the battle of Armageddon. ’ Then ,will follow the resurrection of the dead. ’ The resurrec-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">tion of Christ Jesus is a guarantee that all who have died in ighorance must be awakened out of death and given a knowledge of the truth. ’ For that reason the Scriptural argument, as set forth in 1 Corinthians 15, is this: ‘If there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not . risen; and if Christ is risen, that is a guarantee that all • the dead shall rise.’</span></p>

You can do this just as well in your own home as anywhere else. Write The Watch Tower for a list of these books explaining these truths and you will receive such information free of charge.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">'Jehovah is the only true God. ’ Satan, the Devil, is the mimic god, the wicked one, and man’s worst enemy. * Every person serves either Jehovah or the Devil. The following words are written in the Bible, which is God’s . Word of truth, to wit (Romans 6:16) : “Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness!” Each person must determine whom he desires to serve, either God or the Devil; 'and the Bible declares that he who know</span><span class="font6">ingly serves Satan shall die, and those who gladly serve Jehovah shall live for ever in happiness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2. A</span><span class="font6"> few pointed examples will help you to understand who serves Jehovah and who serves the Devil. The National Broadcasting Company, and the Columbia Broadcasting System, together with other selfish men, have undertaken to say that only certain clergymen, whom they approve, shall be permitted to use their radio facilities to preach to the people, and that they must preach nothing that is not approved by them. Those same men attempt to control the politics of the country and engage in many commercial and political schemes, which oppress the people. They could not be serving Jehovah, but must be serving the Devil, ’because it is the expressed will of God that all men shall have the privilege of knowing what is in the Bible and freely telling others about it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> The German government under Hitler denounces and persecutes all persons who openly declare that they believe on and serve Jehovah God. Moses was a Hebrew, or Israelite, and one of God’s inspired prophets who wrote much of the Bible. ‘The prophecy written by Moses declares that Jehovah would raise up a Greater One, of whom Moses was a type, and that such Greater One would be the Messiah and become the world’s rightful Ruler and Jehovah’s Executive Officer. ’ Many other Bible texts prove that Jesus Christ is that Greater One, the Messiah. The Hitler Government denounces, persecutes and expels from that land Israelites or natural descendants of Abraham, confiscates their property, and denounces Jehovah God and His Word. The Hitler government has undertaken to say that only its state church and the Roman Catholic organization shall freely practice their religion in Germany and that all others in that land must comply with such fixed rules or else be severely punished. ‘ Pharaoh of Egypt likewise ill-treated Jehovah’s chosen people, and the Scriptures declare that Pharaoh was the special representative of the Devil. The Hitler government is in the same class with Pharaoh, and is certain to meet with the same fate at the hand of Jehovah.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> For years in Germany there have bccr» many earnest Christian people known as Bible Students or Jehovah’s witnesses who have been going about teaching the people the Bible and bringing comfort to those who are in distress. They have spent millions in that land to help the German people, and now in these times of great world distress those faithful Christian people are wickedly per-• secuted, arrested, driven through the streets under the lash of whips, thrown into prison, and some of them killed, merely because such people honestly serve Jehovah God and His King and tell the people about the kingdom under Christ that will bless all the world. It is certain that the Hitler government is not doing this by the will of Jehovah; therefore all must determine that it serves Satan.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">At a great assembly of Christian people held at Los Angeles on the 25th day of March, 1934, the following Protest was unanimously adopted and was at the same time broadcast over a coast-to-coast network of radio stations, which Protest is in these words, to wit:</span></p>

During the past year the German government without cause or excuse has wrongfully seized, confiscated and destroyed the Bibles, song books, furniture and other property of these faithful Christians, prohibited them to meet together and worship God according to His commandments, and has cruelly • persecuted and imprisoned many of them, and, like Pharaoh of old, that government has wickedly opposed Jehovah and defamed His name.</span></p></li></ul>

There are millions of persons who are subject to that, hierarchy but who have nothing to do with ruling the Catholic church organization. <sup>4</sup> Those millions of Catholics desire the truth, but have been kept in darkness by their rulers. My purpose is not to offend anyone who is a Catholic by this statement, ’ but it is to speak the truth from God’s Word that others may be informed. No man or company of men has the power to make anything holy by so declaring. The proclamation of the pope declaring 1933 a “holy year” was made without authority; and hence the year was not holy, nor did it bring peace and prosperity to the people, and everyone knows that fact now. Jhe Catholic hierarchy is not holy, for the reason, it is not devoted to God and His kingdom. It par-.ticipates in the political affairs of this world, and hence is a part df the world, and the friend of the world; and the Scriptures, at James 4:4, say that this world is God’s enemy. <sup>8</sup> Therefore, the Catholic organization serves the Devil, and not Jehovah. The pope now acknowledges that his “holy year” proclamation has failed to bring peace and prosperity, and in his alarm he calls upon all the people to pray that Armageddon may be averted. But his prayers in this behalf will also fail, because ’Jehovah God has declared that the battle of Armageddon shall destroy all worldly organizations to make way for God’s holy kingdom under Christ.</span></p></li>

If you would have God’s approval and escape the great tribulation of Armageddon and receive the blessings of His kingdom you must devote yourself to Jehovah, which means to be entirely separate from all human organiza-lions. It is written, in 1 Peter 1:16: ‘Be ye holy, saith Jehovah, for I am holy.’ You cannot be holy unless you separate yourselves from unholy organizations; and this is plainly declared in 2 Corinthians 6: 14-18. ’ You must study the Bible and find out for yourself what is the right way. Do not follow the teachings of men, because all men are imperfect and their teachings are imperfect, regardless of their good intentions. <sup>10</sup> Follow the teachings of God’s Word. Books arc now available which show how to study the Bible and how you can inform yourselves and learn what is the right way to go. ” The failure of the so-called “holy year’’ ought to be sufficient to open your eyes to the fact that doctrines taught by men cannot be relied upon unless those doctrines are entirely supported by God’s Word. And this you can determine only by gaining a knowledge of the truth as set forth in the Bible. <sup>12</sup> Your self-interest demands that you learn the truth and follow it.</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark59"></a>TRUTH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">* The truth is not what man may think, believe and teach, but the truth is what is contained in the Word of God as set forth in the Scriptures, or Bible. Concerning Jehovah it is written, at John 17:17: “Thy word is. truth.” Why! Because Jehovah is the ’Creator of heaven and earth, the source of life, and the Giver of every good and perfect gift. His Word of truth is man’s only safe guide, as it is written, in Psalm 119:105: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” Religion is not synonymous with truth, because religion consists of forms of worship and the doctrines of men. </span><span class="font6">’ There are many religions, and none of them arc wholly devoted to God and His kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"><sup> 4</sup> The Bible discloses the purpose of the Almighty Creator toward His creatures. ‘ It plainly teaches the origin of man, • tell why men become sick and die, ’why there is so much woe and suffering on earth, and * what will bring’about the end of all wickedness and unhappiness, and what is the hope of the peoples of earth. These things are particularly necessary to know in these * times of great distress. No one can possibly know the truth without having some knowledge of Jehovah and His purpose as set forth in the Bible; and <sup>10</sup> for that reason a knowledge and understanding of the Bible is of greatest importance to the people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> “ Man’s worst enemy is the Devil. His name </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Satan </span><span class="font6">means that he is the opposer of God. ” The purpose of Satan is to keep men entirely in the dark and ignorant • of the truth in order that they may not find the way to God, life and happiness. These facts are plainly written in the Scriptures. ” It is the will of God that men learn the truth, that they may then be free to follow whatsoever course they may desire. <sup>14</sup> Satan’s purpose is to prevent men from learning the truth. ” If there is an organization of men that keeps the people in ignorance of the Bible, it necessarily follows that such organization is serving Satan and is against God and His kingdom; and this is true regardless of what the men in these organizations may claim. The indisputable history of the Catholic hierarchy is that that organization • has kept the people from studying the Bible. That is the best evidence that the Catholic hierarchy is serving Satan and not Jehovah, and hence is an unsafe guide for the people. '&quot;The Catholic hierarchy has been and is chiefly interested in having the people pay into its coffers their hard-earned money and for which they get no valuable return. ” The word of truth is free, and no one has a right to commercialize anything in the name of God and Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">These things arc not said to offend the sensibilities of anyone, but that the people may see that ” their only hope is to know God’s truth and obey it; and they can know it only by gaining a knowledge of what is in the Bible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">.4.</span><span class="font6"> All the religious organizations of this world have agreed that they will say nothing about each other’s doctrines that might cause offense. That sounds nice, but it is really a trick of the Devil to keep the people in the dark. Such a course is out of harmony with God’s Word, because <sup>10</sup>it is written in the Scriptures: ‘Let the tmth be declared though it make all men liars.’ (Romans three). No one who desires to do right can become offended at the truth. If you are in the dark and going the wrong way and someone shows you the light and points out the right way, you are not offended, but you • z are glad. ” We are now in the last days, meaning the last days of Satan’s false and fraudulent rule. ” We are near the time when God’s kingdom under Christ shall rule the people in righteousness. <sup>11</sup> It is therefore God’s time and His will that the people shall have opportunity to learn the truth. To that end God has brought about facts in fulfilment of His prophecy to enable us to see what these present-day events mean. He has caused books to be published setting forth these facts alongside of His Word of truth as contained in the Bible, and these books are now available that the people may teach themselves.'If course, we must expect the Devil and all of his agents to oppose the circulation of these books; but let the people determine for themselves whether they want to longer be deceived or whether they want to know the truth.' “Jesus declared: “The truth shall make you free.” ' ’</span></p>

Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark60"></a>TRINITY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The so-called &quot;holy trinity” is one of the false doctrines taught by men. Priests of the Catholic hierarchy have become very angry when the people are told the truth about the &quot;trinity” doctrine. Some of them testified before the Congressional Committee at Washington that a criticism of the &quot;trinity” is so offensive to them that no man should be permitted to use the radio to tell the people about it. </span><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Error always objects to being exposed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">5. The doctrine of the &quot;trinity” had its origin with the Devil and was made prominent in the Satanic religions of ancient Babylon and Egypt. It was first introduced into the so-called &quot;Christian church” by a Greek priest in the fourth century. ’ It is a false doctrine because it is contradictory to God’s Word. The “trinity” doctrine is that there are &quot;three gods in one, the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, equal in power, substance and eternity”. The clergymen call it &quot;a mystery” because they neither understand it nor can explain it, and they therefore discourage the people in trying to find out the real truth about the doctrine. The clergy say, 'God is one, Jesus is one, and the Holy Ghost is one, and these three added together make one.’ That is a kind of mathematics no one can understand or explain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> The truth is reasonable, as shown by the Bible, to wit, ’ that Jehovah God is the Almighty One; that ‘Jesus • is the Son of God; and that ‘ the holy spirit is not a person, but is the invisible power of God operating the things of the universe. In Isaiah 45:5 God says: ‘ I am Jehovah;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">there is no God besides me.’ Jesus, the .beginning of God’s creation, says, at Proverbs 8:22: “Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way.’’ &quot;Jehovah used Jesus as His active agent in the creation of all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">’ When on the earth Jesus said (John 12:49): “I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment.” At Psalm 40:8 Jesus said: “I delight to do thy will, 0 my God.” At John 14:28 lie said: “My Father is greater than I.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> The word “ghost” appearing in the Bible is properly translated </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">spirit,</span><span class="font6"> and the original word shows that it means the power which is invisible to human eyes, exercised by Jehovah. For example: You see the power of electricity operating machinery, but you cannot see electricity. ’God moves the universe by His power, which is invisible to human eyes, that is, by His holy spirit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font6"> The reason for this false doctrine of the “trinity” is this: * Satan at all times has defamed God’s name and tried to turn all the people away from the true God.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> To that end he has deceived and defrauded the people; and the doctrine .of the “trinity” is one of his means of deception. <sup>11</sup> Satan disputes the supremacy of Jehovah and if he can induce the people to believe that there are two others that are equal to Jehovah in power, substance and eternity, as the clergy teach, then he indupes the people to believe that God is not supreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span><span class="font6"> The fact that the oldest church organization amongst men teaches the doctrine of the “trinity” does not make it true. ” We have now reached the end of the world, and the time is here when the truth is due to be understood and will be understood by all who with unprejudiced mind study the Bible and seek to know the . truth. “Jehovah God is the Eternal One, from everlasting to everlasting; “Christ Jesus is His first creature; and the holy spirit is His power. “ Soon He will exercise His power to destroy Satan’s organization, and “only those who believe and serve the truth will survive. If the clergy really believed God and the Bible their sensibilities would not be shocked when someone tells the people what the Bible says about the so-called “trinity”.. The fact that they are offended proves that their doctrine is false. It is to your interest to know the truth. &quot;Only Jehovah God can give everlasting life, aiifl this He gives through Jesus Christ, Ilia Chief Executive Officer. The harm resulting to men by teaching and believing the false doctrine of the “trinity” is to turn men away from the only source of life.

<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark62"></a>KEYS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Millions of good people have been led to believe that the Apostle Peter was the first pope, and that the popes in their regular order have succeeded Peter,and stand in his shoes, and have the sole authority to interpret the Scriptures and to exercise supremacy over the Christians of the world. To support that false claim the words of Jesus are improperly cited, when He said to Peter, ’“I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven.” ’ The Bible plainly shows that there have never been any successors to the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ. Peter was one of the twelve, and no one ever succeeded him; hence no man since Peter’s day has had the same power that the Lord bestowed upon Peter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> ’The word &quot;keys” used in the foregoing Scripture symbolically represents the privilege of unlocking, that is to say, understanding, the truth relating to the kingdom of heaven. * The prophets did not understand that mystery, but Jesus said to his faithful apostles, at Matthew 13:11: ‘‘It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.” ’Later Jesus said to Peter: ‘‘I will give unto you the keys of the kingdom of heaven”, meaning that he would permit Peter to have the first understanding of this mystery. The pope is the head of the Catholic church organization but he is not the head of the true church.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> The keys of understanding of the kingdom of heaven first given to Peter through the operation of the holy spirit made known that God was taking out of the world a people for His name, &quot;and that this favor was first extended to the Jews and later to all without regard to nationality who devoted themselves wholly to God and kept His commandments. The names of these faithful ones are not written in earthly books, but the ” Scriptures declare that they are written in heaven. “The Lord alone knows who they are. “ It is these faithful ones that receive an understanding of the mystery of the kingdom of heaven.</span></p></li>

There is absolutely no authority for such claim. You know that the pope as the head of the Catholic hierarchy participates in the politics of this world and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">i </span><span class="font6">is a friend of this world, and concerning this it is written in James 4:4, that he that is a friend of the world is God’s enemy, and hence could not be a successor to the Apostle Peter.

<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark63"></a>SANCTIFICATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">To be wholly devoted to God and His kingdom means sanctification. <sup>1</sup> When a person believes on the Lord Jesus Christ as the Redeemer whom God has provided </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font6"> man, and agrees to follow in the footsteps of Jesus by doing the will of God, he thereby makes a consecration. If he then faithfully carries out that agreement, he must become sanctified. How can he become sanctified! Church organizations teach that one to be sanctified must have some kind of a ceremony performed for him by a clergyman or preacher in the meeting house or church building. That is not the way the Scriptures say that sanctification is accomplished.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> ’The faithful apostles of Jesus had consecrated themselves to do the will of God and had followed Jesus for more than three years. ’Jesus had said to them: ‘ ‘ Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God.” <sup>4</sup>At the time He spoke to them the mystery was not revealed to them. * He told them that after He had ascended into heaven unto His Father, they would receive the holy spirit and then they would understand. ’Just before His departure, He prayed to Jehovah Concerning these faithful disciples, using these words:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">’ ‘‘Sanctify them through Thy truth, Thy word is truth. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.” Clearly these words mean that the disciples must know the truth and devote themselves </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">wholly</span><span class="font6"> to the truth in order to be sanctified.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"><sup> 7</sup> That same rule applies to all who have since believed on Christ Jesus. To participate in some formal ceremony performed by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">men</span><span class="font6"> could have nothing to do toward sanctifying you. 'According to the announced rule you must learn the truth as contained in the Bible, then devote yourself to telling others about the truth. That means that you ’ have taken your stand on the side of Jehovah God and His kingdom, *’ that you believe and recognize Christ Jesus as the Savior of the world and &quot;God’s appointed King, and that His kingdom is the only hope for the world. If you truly believe this you cannot fail to tell others about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">v/ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font6"> *’ This message will offend all who are teachers of / error such as the clergy, but you must not be disturbed by reason of that. ” You cannot be a man-pleaser and at the same time please God. All men who love and serve Jehovah God will be pleased because you tell the truth, but those who are under the control of Satan, the god of this wicked world, will be offended and will say all manner of evil things against you and persecute you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">5. <sup>14</sup> To the one who has made a consecration these v words of instruction are given in the Scriptures, to wit: “Study to show thyself approved unto God, sanctify yourselves and make yourselves meet for the Master’s t use.” ”The work of the great Master Christ Jesus is to vindicate Jehovah’s name, and to be meet for </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">His</span><span class="font6"> use £ you must be a witness participating in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. ” You must shun vain babblings or doctrines of men and learn and obey the truth of God’s Word. ” No one can gain the truth </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font6"> you, but you ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must acquire it for yourself by carefully studying the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">,, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth as set forth in the Bible. .</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> • days of great need to enable the people to find in the Bible these truths and to learn how to understand them. That is the reason for so many books now going into ihe . ■’ hands of the people. ” Every question that today arises ¥•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">concerning the sickness, suffering, oppression, woe, and distress of the peoples of earth is completely answered in the Scriptures. The only means of relief for the peo-* pie, their uplifting and blessing, is also stated in the ' • ■ Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">7. At once it becomes apparent that a knowledge and . understanding of God’s Word is not only </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span><span class="font6"> but it is the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font6"> means of sanctification. Learn His truth, obey His commandments, and you will rejoice. The man who finds understanding and wisdom is he who learns and obeys the Word of God. To such Jehovah graciously says: “Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding: For the merchandise of • “ it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; , and in her left hand riches and honor.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font6"> ’ There are some persons on earth who are wholly devoted to God and His kingdom and as followers of Christ Jesus these are the witnesses for Jehovah. ’ There are a large number of persons who are members of some so-called organization, and who, under the leadership of the clergy, indulge in cruel persecution of Jehovah’s r witnesses. For example, in New Jersey the clergy have caused the police to repeatedly arrest and imprison, faith,* ful men and women for no offense save that of preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom. In prison these witnesses have often been hungry and sick and their persecutors have continued to cause them to suffer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">3.</span><span class="font6"> Jesus foreknew that the cruel clergy and their allies whom He called goats would persecute His faithful followers, .and concerning this goat class he said: ‘“For I was an hungered,and you gave me no meat;I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked, and you clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.” Those are the goats. \ They asked the Lord when they had done such cruel things. ‘Then shall Jesus answer them, saying:’ ““Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as you did it not to one of j the least of these, ye did it not unto me. ’ ’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">4. *</span><span class="font6"> The persons of good will and kind heart form the company represented as sheep. They see men and women faithfully trying to help others by bringing to them the message of God’s kingdom. ’ Recognizing these faithful ones as the followers of Christ Jesus, they seek to do good unto them because they are the brethren of Christ. They are glad to give these witnesses of the Lord a cup of cold water, some food, and&gt;speak kind words to them, • and when they find them in prison they not only sympathize with the imprisoned witnesses of the Lord, but they do what they can to relieve their suffering.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">5.</span><span class="font6"> The words of Jesus to the people of good will, called sheep, are these: ““For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat;.I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in; naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came unto me.” These people of good will say to Jesus, “When did we do these good deeds unto you, Lord! and the King shall answer and say unto them, ““Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">6.</span><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup>At the present time the Lord is bringing the truth to the attention of the people thereby giving each an opportunity to place himself on the side of the Lord or against the Lord. When you see clergymen and others persecuting faithful men and women because they are preaching the message of God’s kingdom, and doing this by going from house to house, you may know that such persecutors have placed themselves on the side of the Devil, and to such goats Jesus says: <sup>11</sup>“Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels: These shall go away into everlasting punishment.” Such is their fate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">7. Those who love righteousness and who do good unto the Lord’s witnesses because they are preaching the gospel thereby show their love for the Lord, thus taking their stand on the side of the Lord; and they refuse to have any part with the persecutors. <sup>12</sup> To such sheep class the words of Jesus are: ‘‘Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.”</span></p></li>
<li>
