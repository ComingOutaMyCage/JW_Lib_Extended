<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark1"></a>PERMANENT GOVERNOR</span><br><br><span class="font0"><a name="bookmark2"></a>■ OF ALL NATIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">C</span><span class="font4">AN you imagine a world with a king over it who rules for the permanent benefit of all the people on earth and who does not need to be replaced or succeeded because he keeps on living forever? We mean a world with a permanent governor of all nations on earth. Such a governor must be a good and perfect one; otherwise his permanency in the rulership would become an insufferable burden to all the nations. You may think this is asking you to imagine a fond dream beyond being realized, because in the thousands of years of man’s history we have not had anywhere on earth a ruler even approaching to that described. But such kind of governor would be ideal and is most desirable. Our human race today is not capable of providing this desirable and needed governor from among its own ranks. That fact, however, does not stand in the way of his appearing and taking charge of all mankind’s affairs. Almighty God the Creator can provide him. What is more, he long ago promised to provide him for mankind. His promise stands good today despite the thousands of years since it was made, because God can never lie and he does not change from his good purpose. In connection with this governor he says: “I, Jehovah, change not.” (Malachi 3:6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.) </span><span class="font4">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">‘'Moreover the Glory of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man that he should repent.” (1 Samuel 15: 29, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font4"> All the world-gripping events since A.D. 1914, followed by problems that baffle and frighten all mankind, prove that God’s oft-repeated promise is close to realization. Before the end of this treatise the reason why will appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At various times during man’s history some nations and peoples have had a ruler that was considered good and whose long continuance in office and power was desired by theirt. His death and passing from the scene of activity where he could help the people was sincerely mourned. In the eleventh century before our so-called “Christian era” there sat a man upon a throne of power who was pronounced to be a man after God’s own heart. He was King David, who sat upon the royal throne at the holy city of Jerusalem and ruled over the nation of Israel with its twelve tribal divisions of territory. King David himself was of the tribe of Judah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The eyes of all Israel were fixed upon that tribe of Judah, because Jacob, the father of Judah, had made this divinely inspired prediction upon his deathbed: “Judah, thee sli/ill thy brethren praise: thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet [in birth], until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.” (Genesis 49:8-10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> David was'the first one of the tribe of Judah to sit upon the throne and to wield the royal scepter. Concerning David, the prophet Samuel, before anointing him to be the king over Israel, said: &quot;Jehovah hath sought him a man after his own heart, and Jehovah hath appointed him to be prince over his people.” (1 Samuel 13:14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> Would King David prove to be the One, therefore, of whom Jacob’s prophecy had spoken as “Shiloh” or “Peaceful One”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For the greater part of forty years David’s reign was not a peaceful one. It was marked by bloody wars and also by famine and pestilence, but it laid the foundations for Solomon’s peaceful reign to follow. God’s decree concerning that ancient kingdom of Israel did not lay upon it the task of world domination, and hence the kingdom did not set out on an aggressive career of world conquest as the Nazi-Faseist-religious combination of our century. King David, however, did finish up the conquest of the Promised Land that had been begun by Judge Joshua; and thus God brought all the territory that He had assigned to the nation of Israel under the rulership of King David and his successor, Solomon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David’s reign as governor of Jehovah God’s chosen people was a good reign, and the historical record says respecting him: “David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.” (2 Samuel 8:15) That was what the people wanted in ancient times, and that is what they want of a permanent rule^ for this twentieth century and the endless centuries to follow. David was held up as a model to all his successors in the throne, because he served Jehovah with a “perfect heart”; and the goodness of his reign was principally due to this trait of his. This is not to be understood to mean that David’s reign was a perfect one. As a royal governor he made mistakes, and the condition of the people was affected by it. Notwithstanding his being a man after God’s own heart, he was an imperfect man, who honestly confessed about himself: “Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.” For that reason, although he was the governor of a then mighty nation, he was humble enough to confess his sins to Jehovah God and to pray: “Behold, thou de-sirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” (Psalm 51: 5, 6,7,10) David’s heart devotion to tlod was the secret why his governorship was so blessed from heaven and was beneficial to the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It was only right that David should be devotedly attached to God, because Jehovah God was the real and invisible ruler of the nation of Israel and his sacred Word spoke of David as ‘sitting upon the throne of Jehovah’. David, seated there as visible representative of the divine Ruler, was a typical picture of the promised Governor of all nations who would sit with Jehovah God on his heavenly throne and rule for Him. No king or political ruler or religious ruler in all Christendom today can prove himself to be ‘sitting upon the throne of Jehovah’ in place of King David; and this failure on their part explains much concerning the troubles and distresses of all nations today. In spite of the modem conveniences of this “atomic age” civilization, the rule of none of these political and religious governors of Christendom is to be compared with David’s faithful reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David could not continue governing with benefit to his own nation nor with benefit to all other nations, because he was mortal, a man that had inherited the inward operations of death from our first human father, Adam. Like all other rulers David came under the deathdealing effects of Adam’s willful sin in Eden, concerning whom it is written: “Through one man sin came into the world, and death followed sin, and so death spread to all men, because all men sinned.” (Roman 5:12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font4"> King David, therefore, could not be the promised world-governor called “Shiloh” to whom the obedience of all peoples and nations must be rendered, because David was an imper-' feet sinner under the condemnation of death, and he could not rule indefinitely upon earth by reason of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David could not continue his reign in heaven over the nation of Israel and other nations, because he did not go to heaven at death. Over a thousand years after his death a converted Jew, the apostle Peter, said to a large audience of Pentecostal feasters at Jerusalem: “Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day. . . . For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord [Jehovah] said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.” (Acts 2:29-35) In this same speech the apostle Peter points out that, although David was not permitted to continue as a permanent ruler of God’s people on earth by reason of his death and burial, Jehovah God made a covenant with him concerning the permanent governor that was due to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">David did not want to reside in a palace better than the visible place of Jehovah's worship. He desired to build a glorious temple at Jerusalem, but the Lord God forbade him to do this because he had not been a peaceful king but had been a man of war and of blood for the full conquest of the Promised Land. It was at the time of forbidding this temple-building privilege to David that God made a covenant with him for the Kingdom. This covenant promised to David a dynasty of kings after him and that the permanent governor of all nations would at last come of his line of descent. Here is what God promised him according to the covenant: “I will subdue all thine enemies. Moreover I tell thee that Jehovah will build thee a house. And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever. ... I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.” (1 Chronicles 17:10-14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> David's being of the tribe of Judah, this covenant agreed with the fact that Shiloh must come from the loins of Judah. Jehovah’s promise to settle him in the kingdom forever and to establish his throne forever gives us a trustworthy and unbreakable guarantee of a permanent governor of all nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">King David was thus given to understand that the great Ruler of all time would be a descendant of his, a &quot;son”, so to speak; and yet David knew that this One would be greater than he liis forefather. For that reason David called him his Lord. Pointing to his heavenly exaltation to God’s own right hand, David spoke prophetically of him, saying, in Psalm 110: &quot;Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my flight hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. . . . Jehovah hath sworn, and will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.” (Psalm 110:1-4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> The promised governor was to be both a high priest and a king, thus combining two offices in one person. There is no room for question or doubt as to who this One must be and is: he is Christ Jesus the Messiah. In the speech to the multitude on the day of Pentecost the apostle Peter boldly identified him for the benefit of all nations from which that multitude had gathered. Peter referred to the covenant for the Kingdom made with David and also quoted David’s prophetic words of Psalm 110, and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Therefore being a prophet, and lino wing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption. This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses. Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the holy [spirit], he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear. Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.”—Acts 2: 30-33, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle Paul adds his weight of testimony to this, saying concerning God’s chosen people: “He raised up unto them David to he their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a fiian after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Savior, Jesus. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: but he, whom God raised again [from death], saw no corruption.” (Acts 13: 22, 23, 36, 37) At his resurrection from the dead Christ Jesus was given the power of an endless life at the right hand of the Most High God. Thus gifted, Christ Jesus is the only one from among men who is fully qualified to act as the permanent governor of all nations. In him the dynasty of kings of the line of David reaches its apex. It finds its end in him. He will never need, nor will he ever have, a successor, for he continues as righteous ruler forever by virtue of Jehovah God’s oath to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font4"> and also by virtue of his power of endless life. Here is a body of facts and truths over which all lovers of perfect, righteous government everywhere may rejoice, looking forward confidently into the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">DO THE UNITED NATIONS FIT IN?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At Psalm 117:2 it is stated.: “The truth of Jehovah endure th for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.” </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> And no truth stands out more clearly now on the pages of the Holy Bible than that Christ Jesus, the immortal Son of Jehovah God, is the One exclusively ordained of God to be the permanent governor of all peoples and nations. That truth has endured down till today and will endure for all time, for the Almighty God will fight for it to establish it. But in the face of the simple and understandable plainness of that truth in God’s written Word, do the rulers and nations of Christendom abide by that truth and order their public affairs according to it in this critical time for right decision? All the political and religious plans and arrangements of the rulers and of nations answer to the contrary. Today mankind is offered a political system of world ruler ship which it is the declared purpose and intention of politicians, financiers and religionists of fifty-eight nations to make permanent and enduring, namely, the organization of the United Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations was opened in the New York City Building on the afternoon of October 23, 1946, the president of America addressed the delegates of the then fifty-one member-nations and said, among other things: “The United States will support the United Nations with all the resources we possess. . . . The American people look upon the United Nations not as a temporary expedient but as a PERMANENT partnership—a partnership among the peoples of the world for their common peace and common well-being. It must be the determined purpose of all of us to see that the United Nations lives and grows in the minds and hearts of all peoples. May Almighty God, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, guide and sustain us as we seek to bring peace everlasting to the world. With his help we shall succeed.” (Quoted from the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> October 24, 1946) No one for one moment need question the sincerity of that prayerful wish of the president to the Assembly which had convened without any uttered prayer, but Christians faithful to God’s Word the Bible' ask: Was the president’s prayerful religious utterance in harmony with and in support of Jehovah’s covenant for the Kingdom with Christ Jesus'? If not, what, then, are we to understand? Will the Lord God Almighty in answer to the prayer of a politician of this world change, and will he set his Kingdom covenant aside and help the United Nations to succeed, and will he guide and sustain it to bring everlasting peace to this world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Also, in 1946 a world-renowned financier of America donated the $8,500,000 plot of ground in New York city for the site of the world capital of the United Nations. On accepting this site, by an overwhelming vote, the United Nations located the capital of the world organization in the midst of that great metropolis of seven and a half million people. Now note, too, the significant part, that religion has played and is playing in the establishment of the United Nations. On Sunday, April 13, 1947, the City of New York by its Roman Catholic mayor, with a Roman Catholic chairman of the Mayor's United Nations Committee beside him, turned over several tracts of land along the East River to the United Nations. The mayor said that on the “small plot of land” that New York was giving to the “peoples of the world” the “decisions will be made which will shape the destiny of the world” and that it was “hallowed ground.” In the formal ceremony on that occasion the future world capital was spoken of as the “center of the hopes, the aspirations and the ideals of all mankind’’; and the Roman Catholic cardinal, the archbishop of New York, initiated the ceremonies by offering his poetic religious invocation to ask God’s blessing. In his invocation the cardinal is reported as saying that “this portion of America” was now set apart to be “a temple of peace” and that “long centuries look down upon this hopeful hour.”—New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font4">April 14, 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A religious cardinal is a special representative of Vatican City. He is supposed to be able to call down God himself upon the altar of the mass, and it is only proper now to ask: Will Jehovah God hear and accept that religious prayer of the cardinal and recognize and bless the United Nations capital as “a’temple of peace”? and will God thus set aside his Kingdom covenant that Christ Jesus must be the great Shiloh or Peaceful One through whom alone everlasting peace on earth can come to “men of good will”'? In answer to religious clergymen who ally themselves with the political institutions of this world will Jehovah God now break his Kingdom covenant of three thousand years ago or alter it to fit in with this man-made organization of the United Nations? Back from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">14 PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">the Holy Scriptures comes God’s own unchangeable answer to these questions: “My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. Once have I sworn by my holiness: I will not lie unto David: His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as the faithful witness in the sky.” —Psalm 89: 34-37, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is now high time for all religious clergymen as well as all political, commercial and judicial backers of the United Nations to know one thing: namely, That as certainly as the sun and the moon continue to shine in the heavens, just that certainly Jehovah’s covenant for the Kingdom making Christ Jesus the sole permanent governor of all our earth and the only hope for an enduring peace stands unchanged and unbreakable to this day. It will continue to stand as long as the sun and moon- endure, which means forever!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Beligious clergymen are paid by the people and by Italy and other political states to study these things in the Holy Scriptures, and they should know them. Why., then, do they turn the people’s hopes and attention away from Jehovah’s covenanted kingdom by his Christ to an artificial human substitute of this twentieth century? Are they for God and Christ, as they claim to be ? or are they for this world of which the Bible says that Satan the Devil is the god? (2 Corinthians 4:4) Are they the friends of God and Christ? or are they enemies, according to the Scripture rule that “the friendship of the world is enmity with God; whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God” ? By their fruits we can know them, said Jesus Christ; and he also said that they cannot serve two masters and love them both. On the basis of this rule they cannot serve Jehovah's permanent Governor for all nations and at the same time love and serve a world political organization which is defiantly set up in competition as a permanent governing body for this earth and its peoples.—Matthew 6: 24;7: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is true that political organizations of men may continue on for centuries of time in spite of the death of their personnel, because men succeed one another in office. But no such political organization can claim God’s promise to endure as long as the sun and moon endure. All political systems are of this world. They will last only as long as this world of which Satan the Devil is god. Regardless of the religious blessings that clergymen of all denominations ask upon these political systems, they will not continue on as permanent fixtures upon this earth. The reason is simple: They did not originate with the Most High God. They are not ordained of God, and therefore they will not have his protection and survive the end of this world and. endure into his new world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is a mistake for worldly-wise persons to think that, because of its unity and because fifty-eight nations are members, including the most powerful nations, the permanence of the United Nations is assured. Combining religion with it, or even permitting organized religion to dominate it through Vatican City or otherwise, will not guarantee its permanence. For illustration we have but to remember the Holy Roman Empire. In its wider sense it began</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A.D. 800, when pope Lep lU at Rome crowned Charles the Great as Emperor of Western Europe. Under this Empire, religion which stemmed from Rome dominated the nations of Europe for a number of centuries. Notwithstanding the backing of the pope as the leading religionist of Christendom the Holy Roman Empire lasted after a fashion for only 1,006 years. It came to its end in fact, if not in theory, in 1806 due to the military aggressions of Napoleon. The restoration of this Holy Roman Em-gire was the aim of the late Nazi dictator, Adolf [itler, himself a Roman Catholic in religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have this on Roman Catholic authority. In 1940, less than a year after the outbreak of World War II, the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font4"> published this dispatch of February 16 from Washington, D.C., which reads: “The German war aims were outlined tonight as a re-establishment of the Holy Roman Empire by Dr. Edmund A. Walsh, regent of the Foreign Service School of Georgetown University [Jesuit], before a capacity audience in Memorial Continental Hall in the first lecture of his annual series. Dr. Walsh said that he had heard Adolf Hitler say that the Holy Roman Empire, which was a Germanic empire, must be re-established.”—New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> February 17, 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Hierarchy of Vatican City longs for the days of that Holy Roman Empire to return when Europe was religiously homogeneous. And one of Hitler's avowed aims was to wipe out the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, which divided Europe into Protestant and Roman Catholic sections; it was to unite Europe in one Holy Roman Empire under the domination of the one religion, that from Vatican City. Hitler’s effort, by the same aggressive military methods used by Charlemagne, the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, failed, despite all the blessings and religious support that priests and clergymen gave Hitler and his armies of aggression in the lands under his control. Evidently mindful of the millennial reign of the Holy Roman Empire, Hitler declared on May 10, 1940, the day when his forces invaded the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg: “The fight beginning today decides the fate of the German nation for the next thousand years. Do your duty now.” However, the fight begun that fateful day resulted in a final decision against the restoration of the Holy Roman Empire of a thousand years by force of Nazi military might. Are we now witnessing a veiled effort to re-establish that Empire by means of the United Nations, particularly by the creation of a western bloc of nations under the religious domination of the Vatican which has declared open war upon what it calls “godless communism” of Eastern Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Judged alone by human history of the past sixteen centuries, and aside from what God’s prophetic Word has to say, such a revitalized Holy Roman Empire of western nations must fail, even if armed with the atomic bomb. Yes, we add, even if under the religious guidance of an ecclesiastical leader who claims to be the vicar of the Son of God and the vicegerent of Jesus • Christ. From the start it is doomed to fail,'because such a claimed vicegerent is not the permanent governor of all nations according to Jehovah’s covenant for the Kingdom. What the peo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">18 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">pie of good-will all over the earth want is not a so-called vicegerent who dies like any other human sinner and has to be succeeded by another religionist. What the people of good-will want is the real heavenly permanent Governor of all nations, Christ himself, who has the power of an endless life and whose immortality does not require him to be followed by a successor in office! The people will never be disappointed in Him!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Religious politicians now offer to the God that they claim to worship the United Nations on a “silver platter”, and piously ask him to bless it. First they manufacture it according to their will and liking, without consulting His divine Word or Kingdom covenant. Then they expect him to approve this idol of their own creation and to let it stand as the means of permanently governing all nations. But what Almighty God has promised is not such an international political-religious setups which is entirely human and framed by humans, all of whom are imperfect, selfish, and dying under divine condemnation. Moreover, none of these human builders of a world government measure up to God’s commandment through the apostle John, which commands true Christians: &quot;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.” (1 John 2:15-17) True Christians are commanded not to love this</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">19 world, because it is under demon control, by wicked spirits in high places invisible, and not under divine control. The “god of, this world” is the “prince of the demons”, namely Satan the Devil. He blinds the minds of the people of this world lest the glorious gospel light concerning Jehovah’s kingdom by Christ Jesus should shine upon them and enlighten their minds to the truth.—Ephesians 6:12; 2 Corinthians 4: 3-6; Matthew 12; 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">WHOSE OFFER IS ACCEPTED?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In trying to perpetuate this world by unifying all the nations under one central politicalreligious organization, the world leaders are trying to keep the earth in the control of a doomed world-organization that God has decreed must and shall pass away. Such world leaders, and the misled people who back them up, are putting themselves and their politicalreligious organization in the way of God’s incoming kingdom by Christ. Thus they, despite the hundreds of religions which they practice, are pursuing an anti-Christ course. They are trying to permanently fasten upon all peoples and nations in this atomic age a world system of domination that has grieved all mankind with darkness, religious confusion, religious strife, bloody war, oppression, toil, poverty, want, loss of freedom, sorrow, suffering and death. They are standing directly in the path of a perfect and righteous Government which brings deliverance of all persons of good-will from these grievous things. They are fighting against God’s complete fulfillment of his covenant for the Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font4"> “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let no one permit himself to be deceived by religious leaders and politicians into thinking that religion, politics and commerce are unselfishly working together to pave the way for the coming of the kingdom of God. Do not let them persuade you to believe that God has made them his agents to build a “new world order”, to show what man can achieve by himself and which they can hand over to Christ Jesus at his coming, with credit to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The religious clergy have failed to tell the delegates to the U.N. that- Christ Jesus is not looking to the United Nations to choose him as world ruler. He will not accept the post of secretary-general of the U.N. or other post of control over the United Nations. He refused an offer of that kind nineteen centuries ago, and the inspired Bible speaks of him as “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever”. (Hebrews 13:8) In the first century of our era, just before he began his public ministry of proclaiming the gospel of God's kingdom, Jesus spent forty days of preparation and testing in the lonely wilderness. There Satan the Devil, “the god of this world,” came to him with a compromise offer. When announcing the coming birth of this Jesus the angel of God said to his earthly mother: “He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.” (Luke 1: 30-33) But now Satan the Devil offered to Jesus something different,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">21 something Satan considered a tempting offer. The Bible record tells us:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”—Luke 4:5-8; Matthew 4: 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the time of the Devil’s offer to him the Roman Empire was the dominant world power; and from this empire the nations of Western Europe and of the Americas have stemmed. Christ Jesus refused the governorship of all the kingdoms of the world, including the empire of Rome, because they were Satan’s organization and were all doomed to destruction by God’s power at the end of this world. Christ Jesus held onto God’s covenant which was for a Kingdom, a Government not of this present evil world, but of the righteous new world and which is approved by God to stand forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Down to the day of his death Jesus rejected Satan’s offer of the kingdoms of this 'world. When standing before Governor Pontius Pilate, Rome’s representative in Palestine, Jesus said: “My kingdom is not a kingdom of this world. If my kingdom were a kingdom of this world, my men would have fought to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom has no such origin.” (John 18: 36, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">An Amer. Trans.)</span><span class="font4"> Christ Jesus should not be judged by</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the conduct of the long line of religious rulers at Rome who have claimed to be the vicegerent of Christ. Let the pope at Vatican City bargain and compromise with the governments and politicians and the United Nations representatives to gain and exercise control over the kingdoms of this world; but Christ Jesus will not accept such worldly governments and kingdoms at the hands of the pope more so than from anyone else on earth. He has definitely said his kingdom is not of this world, and now at this late date he will not change on that score and make a compromise with the United Nations or other international bloc. He knows that whosoever does so must worship the Devil, “the god of this world,” and Christ Jesus strictly obeys the commandment: “Thou shaft worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.” In spite of their oft-repeated stale religious sayings, the nations of this world have, by their policies and programs, shown themselves to be the friends of this world, and hence the enemies of him and his God. No, Christ will never accept a political post from the hands of his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To the exact contrary, Jehovah God has said to him, by the prophecy of Psalm 110: “Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. The Lord at thy right hand will strike through langs in the day of his wrath. He will judge among the nations, he will fill the places with dead bodies; he will strike through the head in many countries.” (Psalm 110: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">2, 5,</span><span class="font4"> 6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> It would therefore be foolish for Christ Jesus to look to some democratic bloc of nations oi’ to the common people in general for the position of permanent governor. (John 6:15) He said to his faithful disciples: “Seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” And in one of his Kingdom parables Jesus pictured himself as going </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">far away from </span><span class="font4">the nations and people of this world, rather than </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font4"> them, in order to obtain his royal government post. We read:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.”—Luke 12: 31, 32; 19:11,12,14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By this nobleman Jesus meant himself; and like him Jesus went to the far country of his heavenly Father’s invisible presence “to receive for himself a kingdom” from the Supreme Ruler of the universe, and not from imperfect, sinful, dying men. Christ Jesus was hated by men when he left upon his heavenward mission, and the same parable shows he would be hated by men after he had received the Kingdom from God and had entered actively upon his governorship. Hence, after rewarding his faithful followers with Kingdom privileges and after recompensing the unfaithful, hypocritical Christians with a flat rejection of them, Jesus went on to say: “But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.”—Luke 19: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">STARTING HIM OFF IN OFFICE WITH A FIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because Jehovah God unerringly foresaw the future, he did not prophesy of any lining up of all nations in favor of Christ Jesus under a United Nations or other style of world government. In his Word he foretold, instead, a combining of all nations in opposition to the installing of his Son as the permanent governor of a new world of righteousness. But Almighty God is not afraid of a showdown fight with the international conspiracy for world domination. So he has put his Champion, his King, in the field, and, by what he says in the prophecy of Joel, he challenges and invites all nations of this world to put forward their international organization and fight for it and then see who wins out and whose appointee stays as victor in the field. Now through Joel’s prophecy, and also by his faith fid witnesses who preach his Word to all lands and countries, Jehovah God says: “Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war; stir up the mighty men; let all the men of war draw near, let them come up. Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together: thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah. Let the nations bestir themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat [meaning ‘Jehovah judges’]; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about. Put ye in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe: come, tread ye; for the winepress is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great. Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of decision,”—Joel 3:9-14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In a final revelation, given decades after his parable of the nobleman who went away to a far country, Christ Jesus himself showed he also did not expect the nations of Christendom or of the United Nations to range themselves up in favor of God’s kingdom and to welcome him gladly as permanent governor for this earth. The revelation that he gave agrees with Psalm 110 that he must rule at first, not among friendly nations, but in the midst of his enemies, and that finally he must destroy those who did not want him to reign over them. He gave the revelation to John, who says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns [to show his governorship to be superior to all human rulerships]; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron [to dash them to pieces]: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he 26 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.” That title means he is the Chief Kang and Chief Lord, higher than any ruler upon the face of tills earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As the vision shows, he is prepared to fight the nations. But does it come to an actual fight? Are not the nations, at least those of Christendom, shown to be glad to receive him as rightful governor of all nations and as savior of humankind? In a decidedly negative answer the apostle John goes on to say: “And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were east alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the feninant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.” (Revelation 19:11-16,19-21) That fight brings the end of this world and its nations. It brings the end of the religious organizations of the various nations, for all the religious organizations have patriotically gone along with the political nations in every war that they have fought and they will go along also with their respective nations in this final war against Christ Jesus the King of kings. The papacy and its hundreds of millions of adherents are certainly with the nations, and no one will seriously and honestly deny that the papacy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">27 rests upon the United Nations and is seeking to ride it through this atomic age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The presence of the false prophet with the nations in their opposition to Jehovah’s King of kings certainly bespeaks that a great deal of false, misleading political and religious prophesying would be given to the nations to set them against earth’s rightful Ruler and to keep them in a united resistance-front against him. For this reason we have done right in comparing what the political and religious leaders have said and prayed with what God’s Word says, to see if the two agree; and we have found that God’s Word brands the political and religious prophets as false. In other prophecies His Word shows that the “beast” to which the kings of the earth give support pictures a mighty, terrifying governmental institution that does not understand God and his purposes, no more so than a brute beast does; and it is like a beast which is “made to be taken and destroyed”, and is not meant for permanency. That beast symbolizes the man-made system of government for world domination. It has now reached its climax in the globe-encircling United Nations. By it the people look for a permanent peace, but it lines them up in a final war that spells the destruction of this world, not by the atomic-bomb warfare, but by the mightier power of Jehovah’s King of kings and Lord of lords. All the remnant of people who go along with the ruling factors of this world in their unscriptural program of action will suffer destruction with them at Christ’s hand of power; and they will not be given a decent burial, but shall be a prey to the beasts and birds of carrion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">BLESSED RESULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides being thus superior to anything that this earth has to offer, Christ Jesus’ ability to be the permanent governor of all nations is shown by John's prophetic vision also in this: He is the only governor over earth that is able to bind the “god of this world”, Satan the Devil, and to restrain him from further wicked operations over mankind. None of the human rulers on earth have been able to do this, or have even been willing to do so. They all have been anxious to compromise in order to gain and keep control over the people and to exercise world domination. After their systems of misrul'e and oppression are destroyed in the approaching war of Armageddon, then, so the book of Revelation shows, Christ Jesus in the fullness of his power and authority will bind all the invisible demons and Satan their prince in order that these may no longer deceive and mislead the nations and peoples to their destruction, (Revelation 20:1-10) The activity of these superhuman invisible powers, permitted for the past six thousand years, has blocked all reform efforts and peace aims of men for all that time and has tested the faith and integrity of all those who have tried to serve Jehovah God and his Christ faithfully. Full deliverance from these malignant spirits and from their control and interference in human affairs is near! It will come by Jehovah’s Mighty One, his permanent Governor according to his Kingdom covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Holy Scriptures, at Psalm 22, foretold how this Son of God would suffer on earth in order to prove himself worthy of the high office of governor in the endless new world. Then the psalm represents the triumphant Christ Jesus as speaking of the time of God’s established kingdom, in these words: “I will pay my vows before them that fear him. The meek shall eat and be satisfied; they shall praise Jehovah that seek after him: Let your heart live for ever. All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For the king* dom is Jehovah’s; and he is the ruler over the nations. All tlie fat [or prosperous] ones of the earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust [because of opposing the Kingdom] shall bow before him, even he that cannot keep his soul alive. A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation. They shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done it.” (Psalm 22:25-31, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.)</span><span class="font4"> The Kingdom, which brings such good times, belongs to Jehovah God and originates with him. But he will rule over the people of all nationalities on earth by the One whom he has found worthy and whom he has appointed to be permanent governor of all nations, Christ Jesus, the King of kings and Lord of lords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In view of this Kingdom message which Jehovah’s witnesses are now heralding to all nations, persons of good-will from the very ends of the earth are turning to Jehovah as their God and as their great Savior by Christ Jesus. They will continue to eat of God’s spiritual provision and to worship him. They are the only</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">30 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">ones that may entertain the hope of surviving the final war and entering alive into the righteous new world. All opposers of the Kingdom will eventually be forced to bow down in acknowledgment that Jehovah is the living and true God, and these will not be able to keep their souls alive when He by his Governor smites them dead in the war of Armageddon and clears the earth of such Kingdom opposers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Permanent Governor of all nations was born among men nineteen centuries ago at Bethlehem in Judah, but since his martyr’s death on the tree he has been resurrected and exalted to the heavens, to Theocratic Government service. Concerning this, God’s prophecy says for our assurance and guidance in this day of decision: “For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father [or. Father of Eternity], Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.” —Isaiah 9: 6, 7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Stan. Ver.,</span><span class="font4"> margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The name “Everlasting Father” or “Fathfer of Eternity” gives promise that he will always be a Father by always having a family. His family will be those of the human race who prove themselves of good-will to him and his government. For their good-will he gives them everlasting life on earth by virtue of his sacrifice laid down on earth nineteen hundred</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PERMANENT GOVERNOR OF ALL NATIONS </span><span class="font4">31 years ago in their behalf. He will thus be their permanent governor, but like a loving father; and the permanent increase of his government and of enduring peace will demonstrate his worthiness to the title “Prince of Peace”. With such a blessed prospect before us, let all men erf good-will of all nations today praise Jehovah God, whose unflagging, irresistible zeal brings all his glorious purpose to certain realization!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">You cannot vote the Permanent Governor Into office, for Jehovah God has already established hini there. But you can vote yourself into a share of living under his permanent governorship. Do It by voicing allegiance to him, then living up to his requirements. To meet them you must know them. To help you know them is the book “Let God Be True”. After doctrinal discussion clears away the confusion sown by hundreds of sects, the book pushes on to build faith in the Kingdom by proving that the Permanent Governor now reigns. Its 320 pages allow space for convincing proofs. As you read you will thrill to the blessings to come. Elect to share in them eternally by now becoming a loyal subject of the Permanent Governor.</span></p>
