<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HAT does that word mean to you! Do you immediately think of that world-wide Christian organization, the Wafc/i </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tower Bible and Tract Society,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> or its official magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower 1</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Do you visualize a group of sincere Christians, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah's witnesses,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> who function internationally as an organized body under direction of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Throughout the world </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> has that significance, but in Central Africa the word suggests to the minds of many certain indigenous native movements that are disobedient to laws and which have sprung up in Nyasaland, calling themselves “Watchtower&quot;, &quot;Watchman Society&quot; and the like, some of whose members are known to have carried the un-scriptural and anti-social doctrines and practices of these sects into parts of Northern and Southern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo. These indigenous so-called &quot;Watchtower&quot; movements have been linked with a number of native disturbances, but evidence has not been produced and cannot be produced to tie in the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, its missionaries, or Jehovah’s witnesses with such movements or their lawless acts. Every resident of Central Africa should be informed concerning </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the facts</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> that show the clear distinction between the two groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Because of the wrong doing of these indigenous native sects many false charges have been* made against the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, including the one that it was responsible for the well-known &quot;Native rising&quot; which took place in Nyasaland in 1916. The facts are, however, that even the native “Watchtower movement&quot; had no connection therewith. The extracts reproduced below are taken from the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">laws of Livingstonfa</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> written by W. P. Livingstone and which book concerns the life work of Dr. Robert Laws who played a prominent part in the life of Nyasaland in those days. John Chilembwe, the leader of the &quot;rising” and who founded what is known today as the Provident Industrial Mission (P.I.M.), was never at any time one of Jehovah's witnesses nor was he ever associated with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society nor the native so-called &quot;Watch* tower movement”. The extracts follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Page 157)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> When, after another sharp attack of fever, which caused grave concern to tho Committee, he received a cablegram from Mr. White, the convener, ‘Return home now,' he packed up, and he, Mrs. Laws, and Amy sailed from Bandawe In October 1801. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">took with him Yurala Chlrwa, a young Tonga teacher; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Charles Domingo,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> hla house boy; and another lad, with the purpose of leaving them at Lovedala (Union of South Afrlcal for training during hla absence in Scotland . . . </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Page 258)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Doctor went to Lovedale to leave the three native boys, and then visited all the leading Dutch churches In the Capa Colony, In order to Interest the members In their side of the mission work; and at Cape Town he had an Interview with Mr. Rhodes regarding the position of matters In the Nyasa district, and there he gave an address on Nyasa which had an unlooked-for result. Amongst the audience was one </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Joseph (Page 259) Booth,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> an exponent of the ‘Africa for the African* principle, who made up his mind that the country described would be a good land In which to carry on his propaganda. He appeared later Io the Shire Highlands, and, as will be seen, gave much trouble ere he was deported . . . </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Page 339)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> It was a new experience for the Doctor to whirl up from the lower Shire round the Cataract hills to Blantyre In </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">railway train . . . To his sorrow he came across </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Charles Domingo,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> who, In his ambition and folly, had left Ngonlland and become mixed In some degree with the Ethiopian movement. This had been Introduced by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Joseph Booth</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> who had heard the Doctor at Cape Town, and had carried out hla Intention of visiting the country. He had projected a scheme for an </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Industrial mission,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which for a time had official favour, . . . But his teaching Introduced that spirit of racial antagonism which, . . . always becomes subversive of orderly conditions, and he was deported. He took one of his disciples named </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chilembwe,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a Yao, to America and had him educated at a negro college, where he was ordained after three years' study. Returning to Nyasaland he carded on the same kind </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> prupagenoa, recruiting followers from the class of men with a grievance or those under discipline by the Missions, it was with Chllembwe that Domingo had dealings, but he never seems to have egreed wilh his extreme views, and when the Doctor met him he had broken with the sect, . . . and he made again for Ngoniland, where he established a pretentious church, . . . and gathered a following, hla Influence, unlike Chllembwe's, being for good. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Page</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 3521 Eady in 1815, what waa called a native rising' occurred In the Shire Highlands led by John Chllembwe and conllned to bls sect, which consisted in the main of raw and uneducated natives of the Anguru tribe. It was one of the ebullitions common enough In areas where white and black meet and mingle, where the latter suffer from treatment which they consider unjust, and where, as a result, some man better educated, more capable and more sensitive and resentful </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Page 353)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> than the rest Inflames racial and religious passions to an extent which cares for no consequences. As a rule, personal feeling will be found to lie behind moat uprisings of the kind. It was so in the case of Chllembwe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">His headquarters lay next to Magomero, the extensive property of Mr. A. L. Bruce, a nephew of Dr. Livingstone, whose policy was not to permit schools on hla estate. The relations of Chllembwe with the manager, who happened to be called Livingstone, were very unfriendly: whilst the letter's treatment of the natives tn his employment was often unduly harsh. The discontent In the district, fomented by Chllembwe, culminated In an attack on Livingstone's house. He and two others were murdered, and three women and live children were carried away. No articles were stolen, and the women were treated kindly and returned unhurt. The same night an attack was made on the Mandala store to secure arms and ammunition, but troops moved out, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. Chllembwe and several of flls lieutenants were killed In attempting to escape, and twenty of their followers were caught and executed, and others were sentenced io various terms of penal servitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Laws had always believed that Ethloplanlsm had a a germ of good In It which should have been recognized and wisely dealt with . . . Ethloplanlsm was simply the expression of a natural desire for responsibility, which, being unsatisfied, was exploited, by malcontents and developed Into a political movement ... It was In auch a spirit that In the Legislative Council he moved for a Commission to Inquire into the origin and atm of the outbreak. This was appointed. But In circles not favourable to missions the trouble was already attributed to the overeduca-tlon of the people, end Mr. Bruce made the reactionary proposal In the Council that all schools In the country under native teachers should be et once closed. Dr. Laws opposed the motion . . . (Pope 954) The motion was not pressed, the matter being referred to the Commission . . . </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I Page</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 355) The report of the Commission was lame and unsatisfactory and, as Dr. Laws slated to the Governor, a serious defect was Its silence as to the beneficial results of responsible mission work In the Protectorate. The Doctor sought to obtain a debate on It In the Council, but the Government temporized, and the whole matter was finally shelved and passed Into the category of things that ere best forgotten . . . the opinion of the older missionaries wee that had men like Sharpe or Manning been at the head of affairs the trouble would not have occurred . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Though unconnected with the rising, Charles Domingo went down In the general cataclysm. The writer saw him In 1920 at Mzlmba, where he was employed In the Government service . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It should be particularly noted that the “native rising** took place in 1915. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society had no resident representative in Nyasaland or the Rhodesias prior to 1925. By 1925 some of the Society’s publications had found their way into those countries, but there was no one, European or African, authorized to represent the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MOVEMENT DIFFERENT FROM SOCIETY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Toward the end of 1924 reports began to reach the Cape Town office of the Society that there were indigenous groups in Nyasaland and in the Rhodesias using the name Watchtower (not Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society) and who were teaching doctrines quite contrary to anything contained in the Society’s Bible commentaries and textbooks. Accordingly European representatives were sent up from the Union in 1925 to investigate the position. They travelled extensively in each country for more than a year and as a result of their enquiries the letter set out below was sent by the Society’s representative at Cape Town to the responsible Government officials in Nyasaland, and a similar one to the Rhodesias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society Cape Town</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">August 21 at, 1926.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Chief Secretary of Government Affairs,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Government House, Zomba, Nyasaland. Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">On behalf of the above Society 1 beg to inform you that our representatives in Nyasaland have been recalled and that for the time being we are discontinuing our work among the natives there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it nae never been our Intention to undertake a native mission movement In either South or Central Africa. Our reason for sending Mr. A.Mra. Hudson Into Nyasaland was due to the activities of certain self-styled native •'Watch Tower&quot; Churches. This movement we cannot endorse. It absolutely perverts the Society's teachings and In the main Its followers show no Inclination to submit to any direction or authority from us. We therefore entirely dissociate ourselves from It.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">There is now therefore no one In Nyasaland with any authority to represent the Society or teach end preach In Ils name, or In the name of the International Bible Students Association. If your government allows the movement calling Itself &quot;Watch Tower&quot; to continue It must do so upon Its own responsibility. The movement will have no support or encouragement whatever from ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the past, and In Ignorance of the true situation, books and literature (In English) were supplied to natives making application when money was sent. We now know that except In rare Instances these could not be properly understood or appreciated and were often misused. We will therefore discontinue to send books to natives In Nyasaland or the Rhodeslas except we have absoluie confidence In the bona Tides of the applicant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Thanking you for the courtesy and assistance extended by your department to our representatives when in Nyasaland,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">beg to remain, Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Yours faithfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">[Signed] T. A. Walder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Manager, South Africa Branch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Some years after the Society had made it clear that it had no connection with the native sects using the name “Watchtower” it became evident that there were those in Nyasaland and the Rhodesias who were genuinely interested in the educational work Jehovah's witnesses were doing under the direction of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and who desired to share therein. Applications to establish book depots in these countries under European supervision were accordingly made to the governments concerned. Nyasaland welcomed the suggestion and since 1934 the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has maintained an office in Nyasaland and the work of its genuine adherents, Jehovah's witnesses, has been carried forward under European supervision and control. These witnesses have obeyed the laws of the land, paid their taxes, lived clean lives, carried forward their work in an orderly manner, and lived at peace with their neighbours. They have done nothing by word or deed to merit the severe restrictions that were placed upon their freedom of worship by Government during the war years and it ia hoped that all such restrictions, some of which it is sad to say alill remain in force, will shortly be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">COPPER BELT DISTURBANCES</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The Rhodesias did not take the same position as Nyasaland but in 1934 refused the Society’s request to establish a depot and European control over its adherents in these countries. By this time some of the Society’s publications had been published in Cinyanja and when a strike of mine workers broke out on the Copper Belt in 1935, it was easy, in view of the fact that the Society had been denied representation, for the false charge to be spread that “agitators connected with the Watchtower movement were behind the strikers” and that &quot;the Watch Tower Movement originates in the United States of America. It appears . . . to consist of—Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society . . . International Bible Students’ Association”. It was qlso wrongly stated with reference to the native troublemakers that &quot;Jehovah’s Witnesses are the members of the Watch Tower Movement”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. P. J. de Jager, a European representative of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and aev-eral of Jehovah’s witnesses resident on the Copper Belt appeared before the Commission of Enquiry and gave evidence that no one of Jehovah’s witnesses took any part in the rioting or had any share in the instigation of it. At that time Mr. de Jager was requested to refer to passages In the Society’s publications which instructed Jehovah’s witnesses to obey the Government they are under. From publications prior to 1935 he made many quotations, included in which are the following that appear on page 49 of the official </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report of the Commission appointed to enquire into THE DISTURBANCES IN THE COPPERBELT NORTHERN RHODESIA October,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Supremacy,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> page 61, paragraph 2:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A man must always do right If ha pleases God. Every nation has laws and every citizen of such nation must obey those lawa unless the law la In direct violation or contravention of God's law. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">From </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Righteous Ruler,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> page 28:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Avoid all controversies and strifes. If riots and revolutions come, keep away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Commenting on Romans 18:7, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Watch Tower</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1928 states;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The words 'tribute' and 'custom' both refer to a commercial or financial obligation which the Government may ley upon those who reside thereunder to meet the Governmental expensea. Jesus and his dlaclplea paid such tax (see Matthew 22, verse 21).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 29 of the same article states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">For this reason the Christian obeys every law of the land that Is in harmony with God's law. He does not obey merely because U Is ths law of the land, but because to obey la right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Paragraph 02 statea:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Every law of every nation of earth that la In harmony with God's law should ba gladly obeyed by the Christian whether he be a citizen of that nation or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The evidence led by others, including Government officials, established the fact that it was the Wemba Who were the ringleaders and such men stated they had no connection with the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society or Jehovah’s witnesses. Government officials, who gave evidence before the Commission, made reference to the “indigenous Watchtower movement of the villages” as something different from Jehovah’s witnesses, and that the views held by the native Watchtower movement were certainly not those of the Watch Tower Bible and Traci Society. The Commission found “that the Immediate impelling cause of the disturbance at Mufulira was the sudden bawling out of the mine police in the evening that the tax was increased all around to 15s; and that it was the false announcement of the success of the strike at Mufulira, together with the challenge to the natives to show that they were not old women, which was the immediate impelling cause of the disturbances at Nkana and Luanshya”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In view of the refusal of the Northern Rhodesia Government to permit the Society to establish European control, representations were made by the Society, al the time of the Copper Belt disturbances, direct to the H. M. Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. Recommendations were then made by the Colonial Secretary to the effect that the Society’s request should be granted and since 1936 the Socicly has maintained a depot at Lusaka under European control. It has been possible since then for the Society to clearly differentiate between Jehovah’s witnesses and the indigenous “Watchtower movement”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">More recently a depot was established in Southern Rhodesia with European control. In Southern Rhodesia all war time restrictions on the Society's literature were removed 18 months ago and it is hoped that a similar position will shortly eventuate in Northern Rhodesia. Some relief has already been given and there does not appear to be any reason why Jehovah’s witnesses in that country should not have access to all their Bible study books and their official magazine </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Today Jehovah's witnesses are numerous in the Rhodesias, but happily the native “Watchtower movement” is practically dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In Nyasaland, however, the &quot;Watchman Society” and other native sects using the name &quot;Watchtower” and who engage in anli*socia) practices and refuse to pay taxes still exist. By the reading of this publication all who wish to be informed will see that such movements are not associated in any way with the Christian organization known as the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. The position is well known and understood by Government, and this was reassured in January 1848 when the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, Mr. N. IL Knorr, travelled from New York City to Zomba and interviewed the competent authority. But many Europeans and Africans in all of these countries do not know that there ia a difference, and it is hoped that this publication will clarify the position. The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and Jehovah's witnesses strongly condemn the anti-social practices and lawless attitude adopted by these native sects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO ARE JEHOVAH'3 WITNESSES?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">On this question everyone is entitled to hear the aide of Jehovah's witnesses. Jehovah's witnesses constitute a body or group of persons consecrated to do the will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Almighty God, under the leadership of hie Son, Christ Jesus. They have drawn together for the purpose of declaring that he whose name alone is JEHOVAH is the Universal Sovereign, and that he is the Author and Creator of earth’s permanent heavenly government of righteousness for which Christ Jesua taught his disciples to pray to Almighty God. To everyone they point out the only way to that kingdom which shall permanently lake the place of all earth’s present governments in God’s due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Although Jehovah G’od has had His witnesses on earth for about sixty centuries, only in modern times did they draw together for organized world wide work. In 1872 (A.D.), in America, at Allegheny near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charles Taz.e Russell began a Bible class that met regularly to study the Scriptures about Jehovah’s kingdom and the second coming of Christ Jesus. Within a few years thereafter similar groups of students of the Bible, having these same interests, were organized throughout the United States. In due time such Bible-study classes were established in other countries. By following the course of study outlined by the headquarters in the United States those classes were unified and the students became of one mind, throughout the world, on what Almighty God through his Word teaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In time printed courses of studies in the Scriptures used by such students were offered from door to door by special representatives in many lands for the purpose of spreading the understanding of the Bible among all peoples. As a result other schools or congregations of students were organized throughout the earth. Ever since Jehovah’s witnesses have been and now continue to be an international organization. They are to be found in every nation under the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1884 the legal servant body of this inlernntionul association was incorporated under Pennsylvania law. Thal non-profit corporation, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, aud the governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses have been inseparably associated ever since. In 1909 the corporate headquarters were transferred from Pittsburgh to New York (Brooklyn) and then an associate charitable corporation was formed and used for carrying on the world wide publishing work of Jehovah’s witnesses. It is a New York corporation now known as Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. In other lands other associate corporations are used, such as the International Bible Students Association in Great Britain and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses have a firm belief in the Bible, both the Hebrew and the Greek Scriptures. They regard the Bible as the true Guide for man and accept it as the highest authority in matters pertaining to Jehovah God and his purposes. Even the name </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jehovah's witnesses</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> is taken from the statement by the prophet Isaiah (43:10; 44; 8, American Standard Version), “Ya are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The method of teaching and preaching employed by Jehovah's witnesses is primitive. That is to say, they uso the original method of preaching instituted by Jehovah's Great Witness, Christ Jesus. He and his apostles preached publicly and from house to house. (Acts 201 20) Every true Christian minister of the gospel is commanded to follow in their footsteps and must do likewise. (1 Peter 2:21; Luke 24:48; Acts 1:8; 10:39*42) Jehovah’s witnesses establish free Bible studies in the people’s homes. They go even farther than that by providing the people with opportunities to receive the message in public places. Books and booklets are used by Jehovah’s witnesses in their preaching work for the convenience of the people. Such publications contain the truths of the Bible in a permanent form for study by the interested person at his convenience. Bible education is the work of Jehovah's witnesses, and it is important to all because the Bible contains the knowledge of God and Christ that is essential to gaining life, as stated al John 17:3: &quot;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&quot; In this way the work of Jehovah’s witnesses becomes and is a great service to all the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses have congregations or 'companies' throughout the world. To supervise the activities of these companies the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society appoints*qualified ministers. Additionally, the Society sends travelling ministers as special representatives of the Society to visit the various congregations regularly and to give instruction concerning the ministry. It is not a loose organization without control, but rather it is a highly organized ministerial association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">It is hoped, by increasing (he Society’s European representation, to control the work of Jehovah’s witnesses still more effectively in 1 he future and prevent any possibility of the misdeeds of tho native “Watchtower” sects being attributed to Jehovah's witnesses. In the Belgian Congo there is still much confusion in the minds of the people over the native movements, but every effort is now being made by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society to provide adequate European representation and control. The disintegration of the native “Watchtower&quot; movements In the Rhodesina since European representation was established by the Sooiety Is sufficient to indicate the fact that the solution to the problem in the Congo lies in the Government's granting permission to the Society's European representatives to enter the Belgian Congo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">To assist Government officials in Nyasaland to quickly distinguish between African witnesses of Jehovah and the indigenous “Watchtower&quot; movement, the former will in the future be known by and called only by the name </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jthovah's witnesies</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and not as representatives of the ‘Watch Tower Society’. They also carry a letter of identification. The name Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society will be used only when referring to the Society's established office at Blan-lyro and, of course, to the publishers of the literature used by Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The fact that some natives, more than 40 years ago, got hold of some of the Society's publications in English and began calling themselves “Watchtower&quot; or similar names while teaching and practicing things that have not the slightest resemblance to the Biblical truths set forth in the Society's publications is surely no reason why these publications should continue to be banned under the Penal Code and Jehovah’s witnesses in Nyasaland be denied the opportunity of reading and studying the material which their brethren in every other country in the world have access to and use in the exercise of their worship of the Most High God. Publications of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society cannot be condemned because of the indigenous &quot;Watchtower Movement&quot;, for which the Society ia not responsible, any more than the Bible Itself could properly be discredited and withheld from the people if the natives had possessed copies of the Bible and then proceeded to commit lawless acts under the name “Bible Movement*'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACEABLE SUBJECTS UNDER HUMAN GOVERNMENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">If the literature of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society is such aa will incite the people against Government, then Jehovah's witnesses would be found Instigating riots and revolutions all over the world, for they are on every continent and the isles of the sea; but the facta show that a study of the Bible together with the Society's publications has made Jehovah’s witnesses outstanding as conscientious Christiana and law-abiding citizens of whatever country they may reside in. Their position is clearly set out in the 1948 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah's witnesses, so </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">clearly that no one can possibly misunderstand it, least of all Jehovah’s witnesses themselves:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">These witnesses, no matter under what nationality or form of government they happen to be born, always comply with the rules and regulations of that nation. They pay their taxes; they apeak the language of (he nation; they accept the education of the nation through Its schools. They support all the laws of the lend that are In full accord with God’s principles of truth and righteousness . . ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Regerdleaa of the country in which any witness of Jehovah lives, he Is all-out for supporting God's kingdom and preaching It. He Is an ambassador for Christ In this respect. Being an ambassador In this old world, at the same lime being no part of It, he certainly Is not opposed to the present governments of the earth; nor will Jehovah's witnesses ever try to fight against them. Nor should they fight against such governments. They have no reason to do so . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">And from the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Let God Be True&quot;,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> which was published in 1946 and has had a circulation of more than 3j million copies in the English language alone, page 239, we quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah's witnesses are not subversive and do not engage In subversive activities within the nations where they dwell. They are not sedlllonlsts because they act within eucb nations as ambassadors for God's kingdom. All enlightened nations guarantee freedom to worship Almighty God, which worship requires that the true servant of Jehovah be a minister of His government. People of all Christian na-tlons have been taught to pray for the coming of God's kingdom to earth. Therefore those who, as ministers, advertise the answer of Almighty God to that prayer as being now near are not against the government of the nation wherein such preaching Is done. As activities of the worldly ambassadors of foreign governments do.not work agnlnst the Interests of the countries wherein they each, respectively, dwell, so also the works of Jehovah's witnesses are not against the government of any land where they reside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah’s witnesses are interested in promoting the pure worship of Almighty God throughout the earth. They enjoy complete freedom of worship and freedom to distribute their Bible literature in the United Kingdom, and throughout the British Commonwealth of Nations, as well as in Belgium, France and other nations throughout the world, except for certain African territories, Russia, Yugoslavia, and Spain, where full freedom is denied. Jehovah’s witnesses admit that there are technical disagreements with the orthodox religions as to the meaning of some statements made in the Bible, but it cannot De said that euch disagreements constitute any reason for denying fundamental rights of worship and freedom of press. Jehovah's witnesses believe in freedom of worship for all. Surely it is not too much to expect it for themselves.</span></p>
