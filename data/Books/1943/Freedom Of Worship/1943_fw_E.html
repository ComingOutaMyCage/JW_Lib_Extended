<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font21"><a name="bookmark1"></a>OF WORSHIP</span></h1>
<p><span class="font22">J</span><span class="font19">EHOVAH GOD'S main reason for permitting His witnesses, Christian ministers of His gospel, to remain in this present evil world is, as stated by the Lord Jesus, that ‘this gospel of God's kingdom must be preached in all this world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come'.—Matt, 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3</sup> Every person who has consecrated his life to the service of Jehovah God in His New World must preach the kingdom that will vindicate the name and worship Jehovah, Every such person is ordained to seek and find the Lord's “other sheep&quot; and feed and comfort those that mourn.—Isa, 61:1, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font19">-<sub>P</sub> Luke. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">4:</span><span class="font19">18-21; John 10:15,16; 15:14-16; 21; 1 Pet. 5:17 ; 1 Pet, 5:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup> There is no love between “Christianity&quot; and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">religion, </span><span class="font19">between the New World and the old world, between Jehovah God and Satan. All servants of Jehovah from Abel to John the Baptist were the targets of the Devil and of his demon-agents. Christ Jesus was persecuted and nailed on a tree because the Devil hated His preaching that the New World is the only hope of man. Jesus' faithful apostles and disciples were stoned, mobbed and torn asunder for advocating God's side of the issue of world domination and for refusing to yield to demonic pressure to stop their preaching.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Printed In the United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">Like persecution has been the portion of all loyal and faithful footstep followers of Jesus from the days of His apostles to the present. He said: “If </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">they</span><span class="font16"> have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.” (John 15: 20) The very fact that “this gospel of the kingdom” is preached in every nation of earth means world wide “persecution”, (Matt. 24:9,14) Persecution in all nations proves that Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ordained ministers on earth of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.—2 Tim. 3 :12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>4</sup> Satan’s postwar “new order” means ever-increasing .persecution and opposition to publishing the message of God’s kingdom. Oppression of God’s faithful servants will expand on a much wider scale than ever before. (Jer, 1:19; Matt. 24: 9; 2 Tim. 3:13; Ps. 92: 7) The increased privileges of service in the preaching of the gospel will come “with persecutions”, (Mark 10:28-30) Because servants of the Most High God firmly take their stand for his new world and reject a “new order” put forth by totalitarian-minded agents of the Devil, persecutions and afflictions are heaped upon them. Maintaining integrity in spite of all opposition makes for. them many true friends, people of good-will, upon whom they can rely to back them up in the righteous course of action that they take.—Esther 9:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>6</sup> The action of the prophets and apostles recorded in the Bible, in resisting and fighting the senurgings and persecutions inflicted at the hands of the enemy in centuries past, furnishes positive proof that it is Jehovah's will that his Christian ministers vigorously withstand every demonistie interference with the preaching of the gospel. In his due time Jehovah will remove for ever all opposition to the faithfulness of his servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>G</sup> It is the individual duty of each person in agreement with the Almighty to throw back vigorously all opposition. (Rom. 12:21) This he doess by preaching the gospel unceasingly, not because his brethren do so, not because there is no opposition in his community, but because it is right and in harmony with God’s commandments and makes glad</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">the heart of the Most High, (Psalm 149; Prov. 27:11; Mal. 3:4,17) He will perform his preaching obligation regardless of whether or not any other creatures do so. He must please Jehovah God, He, like the King, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">delights</span><span class="font19"> to do so, —Ps. 40:8,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>7</sup> Paul, a valiant minister and fighter for the Mew World, said that “our citizenship is in heaven”. (Phil. 3:20, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Hev.</span><span class="font19"> Ver.) He did not mean that the Christian is not a citizen of some nation of the present evil world. He recognized that the Christian, although </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">in</span><span class="font19"> the world, is not </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font19"> it. To his Father the Lord Jesus said: “I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.” (John 17:14-16) At Philippi, Paul claimed his Roman citizenship through birth as a refuge against mobsters, (Acts 16: 37) At Jerusalem, when in custody of officers, he asked, “Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?” (Acts 22:25) Paul’s immediate claim of protection for his legal right,s as a citizen hastened the centurion to the chief captain with this warning: “Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.” (Verse 26) Before this he claimed his right to speak to the people, thus: “I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.” (Acts 22:3) PauFs fighting thus faithfully shows clearly that the Christian should never hesitate to claim each and every right that belongs to citizenship, to aid him in preaching the gospel. (1 Tim. 6:12) </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Before</span><span class="font19"> leaving Egypt the Israelites borrowed from the Egyptians. Today Jehovah’s witnesses should not be reluctant to carrv with them the rights of citizenship to aid them in preaching the gospel in all the world as a witness unto all nations.-—Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16">is to provide Jehovah’s witnesses with a simple outline of proper conduct to help each to bear his own burden, (Gal. 6:5) This does not mean that brethren should not assist one another when difficulty is encountered. Indeed such is their Scriptural duty toward each other,—Neh, 4:14; Rom. 15; 2; Gal. 6:2; John 13: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>&amp;</sup> Conforming to these suggestions as nearly as possible will §void needless hardship and difficulty. Each will be helped to do his part in giving a true witness to Jehovah’s name and in defense of The Theocracy. These suggestions do not cover every conceivable kind of opposition. They arc designed to give “first aid” to Jehovah’s witnesses in emergencies, When opposition appears, immediately make a short, accurate report thereof to the Society’s Legal Desk. Then some other counsel not herein covered can be furnished to you when necessary and appropriate. Much needless correspondence and harmful delay will be eliminated by immediate reference to and following these suggestions when interference occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">STUDY NECESSARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>10</sup> Each witness, minister of the gospel, should regularly and repeatedly study these suggestions to become familiar with proper Christian conduct under difficulty. Do not put them away until trouble comes; for that will be too late. (Matt. 24:20; 1 Pct. 3:15) “Study to shew thyself approved unto God.” (2 Tim. 2:15) Each should carefully and diligently strive to learn the reasons for every suggestion herein given. He will absorb the substance thereof. Merely memorizing words and having no </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">understanding</span><span class="font16"> as to when and how to use knowledge stored up through reading and study does one little good, if any, and will result in confusion when before the enemy. Each one will make these suggestions a part of his equipment for use in Kingdom activity. When in doubt, refer to these suggestions and consult the “elder” (experienced or mature) brethren. Also communicate </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">promptly</span><span class="font16"> with the Lord’s ‘faithful servant’, the Society.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>11</sup> The primary and fundamental strength against the assault of the enemy is a </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">knowledge</span><span class="font19"> of God’s Word and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">ability</span><span class="font19"> in using such knowledge* Every good soldier of Jesus Christ wields readily and skillfully the &quot;sword of the spirit”, which is the Word of God.

Studying thus, each shall he approved unto God, The obligation of preaching from house to house, conducting studies, and public street witnessing cannot be overlooked. Christ Jesus said, &quot;But take heed to yourselves [prepare yourselves] : for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony</span><span class="font19"> against them,”—Mark 13: 9,13,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>1£</sup> One cannot give effective testimony in behalf of the Lord Jesus Christ and The Theocracy before those in con^ trol or in the field from house to house and on the streets unless he has diligently studied, prepared and armed himself for &quot;battle” as above indicated. (2 Tim. 2: 3-5; 1 Pet* 4:1; Isa. 28:5,6) One.cannot deliver an effective testimony before police officials and in courts unless he has studied diligently and has given an effective testimony previously in the &quot;field” service. The Lord through His apostle Peter says, &quot;But sanctify the Lord God [Isa, 8 ; 13, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver,,</span><span class="font19"> &quot;Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify”] in your hearts: and he ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">falsely accuse</span><span class="font19"> your good conversation [behaviour, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Roth</span><span class="font19">.] in Christ,”—1 Pet* 3:15,16.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>13</sup> Through misunderstanding of Mark 13:11* many of the brethren have erroneously concluded that the Lord will miraculously place words in their mouth, and make their defense Himself. This is not using the spirit of a sound mind and is manifestly slothfulness and neglect of duty. The Lord does not put words into the mouths of those who have not diligently studied and prepared their defense and made use of instruments He has provided through His “faithful and wise servant’<sup>7</sup>. Jesus himself gives the meaning of Mark 13:11 in his promise to his disciples that the comforter, the holy spirit, would <sup>4</sup>bring all things to their </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">remembrance’.</span><span class="font16"> How can one </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">remember</span><span class="font16"> without first having had knowledge! How can one have knowledge without study! (John 14:26; 16:12-15) Furthermore, the Lord’s servant states, “The heart of the righteous studicth to answer,’<sup>1</sup> (Prov. 15: 28) It is of utmost importance that constant study and thorough preparation be made in order to properly defend the gospel when the occasion demands.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ORDAINED</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>14</sup> Each one of Jehovah’s witnesses is an ordained minister of Jehovah God and of the gospel. One becomes ordained when he consecrates himself to do the will of Almighty God and is accepted of the Most High God through the Lord Christ Jesus. Such a one then publicly confesses or announces that consecration, of himself by being baptized, immersed in water, thus giving outward evidence before witnesses that he has entered into an unbreakable contract or agreement to preach and fully put himself in the hands of the Lord for His use. Consecration and the subsequent </span><span class="font16" style="text-decoration:underline;">imm</span><span class="font16">ersion in water is no idle, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">religious</span><span class="font16"> ceremony. It is the most serious and important event in one’s life. To be ordained, “anointed,” means to be commissioned or authorized by Jehovah God as His minister who thereafter serves</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">* Mark 13: 11, “But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate:</span><span class="font16"> but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the holy [spirit].” <a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark4">1</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#bookmark5">2</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Jehovah in accordance with such contract, regardless of opposition.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>1&amp;</sup> The fact that one has not yet been baptized in water does not prevent him from engaging in the work of preaching the gospel or attending Bible-study meetings. One who engages in preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom will be baptized. Such will be diligent to be baptized at the first opportunity after making bis consecration. Submitting to immersion in water is an act of obedience, and is necessary and right for all who have agreed to do the will of God. —Matt. 3:14,15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>16</sup> The primary ordination (authorization) of Jehovah’s ^witnesses comes from Almighty God. Each of such witnesses relies on the identical Bible authority that Jesus Christ cited. After Jesus’ baptism in the river Jordan and his forty-day study in the wilderness, he began his preaching activity, and in the synagogue at Nazareth, his home town, he quoted from Isaiah 61:1, 2, as follows: “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor^ he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord/’—Luke 4:17'19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>17</sup> Jehovah’s witnesses have earthly evidence of their Scriptural ordination. They possess credentials of ordination issued by God’s organization in the earth, the Society. That is the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">identification card.</span><span class="font19"> Jehovah’s witnesses speak of their ordination as did His apostles in Jesus’ day. (Mark 3; 14) Paul said, “I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle/’ (1 Tim, 2:7) Ordination to preach does not depend upon the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">age</span><span class="font19"> of the individual, except that the individual must have reached the age of discretion. One must be able to understand, to know intelligently, and make an agreement to do the will of Almighty God. Timothy was quite young and not yet of “full age” or mature years when he was ordained to preach and teach. (See 1 Timothy 4:11-13.) <a name="footnote3"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark6">3</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark7">4</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#bookmark8">5</a></sup></span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">He accompanied Paul and preached from house to house and publicly. The fact that a young child is not an ordained minister does not prevent him from accompanying his elders in preaching.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>18</sup> To be ordained does not require one to attend a seminary or parochial or divinity school. Jesus did not attend such a school. He was taught by his parents at home and afterward studied for forty days in the wilderness. Attending the Watchtower and other Bible-study meetings and home studies in the publications of the Society, with the Bible, is sufficient training to enable one to do the will of God as His minister, but it requires preparation,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font16">X <a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark9">6</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote7"></a><a href="#bookmark10">7</a></sup>&nbsp;Although Jehovah's witnesses do not attend such ecclesiastical schools set up by religious organizations, prior to their ordination to preach, they are ready to testify before any court or ruler that they have received a much higher training and schooling in the Word of God by attending Watchtower Bible schools or places of study, to qualify for their ordination. Jesus' apostles were “unlearned and ignorant men’' without training in a parochial or ecclesiastical school of their day. They were well educated in the popular language of the day, the laws of the land, and especially id the Word of God. The words “unlearned and ignorant men” in reference to Peter and John at Acts 4:13 mean that they were not learned in the original Hebrew language of the Scriptures j but they were well versed in the Word of God itself. The Aramaic was the common language and the spoken language of the Jews in the apostles* day. They studied the Scriptures in that language and were familiar with the prophecies and teachings of Christ Jesus. Just so today, Jehovah's witnesses are very familiar with the word „ of Almighty God as it appears in the Bible, although insofar as Latin, Greek and Hebrew are concerned they, too, are generally ‘ignorant and unlearned'; hut in order properly to instruct persons of good-will there is no requirement to be versed in a dead tongue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">EQUIPMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>20</sup> One who is wholly consecrated to do the will of God will not hesitate to take advantage of every opportunity to preach the gospel of God’s kingdom in the manner suggested by the Society. Before starting on such service mission one should first fix his mind on the Lord and go forward with fear and trembling lost he displease the great Jehovah God, but without any semblance of fear of man, which brings one into a snare. One who is a witness of Jehovah cannot be a man-pleaser, but must serve God from the heart. As to </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">equipment,</span><span class="font16"> Paul’s exhortation to ail true preachers, Jehovah’s witnesses, is in point: ‘‘Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. Put on the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">whole armour of God,</span><span class="font16"> that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For wc wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.’’—Eph. 6:10-12; sec also verses 13-17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>21</sup> On each occasion when starting in any part of the witness work the servant of God will pray to Him to direct the service so that God’s will shall be accomplished. As he continues in such work he will silently pray from time to time. &quot;Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints,” (Eph. 6:18) Each servant will always be properly equipped to carry on each assigned duty in harmony with the Society’s latest organization instructions, possessing his ordination credentials (neatly filled in and signed) as well as all other proper equipment. He will carefully follow all instructions in the Society’s publications as to the proper and current manner of preaching the gospel. An obedient servant will never substitute his own methods above or different from that recommended by the Society. These suggestions on proper behavior of a Christian minister are given in order that proper work may not be done in an improper manner. Acting on one’s own understanding often causes more harm than good, &quot;Trust in Jehovah with ail thy heart, and lean not upon thine own</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font19"><sup>22</sup> Lach ordained minister of Jehovah God will at all times and places behave himself in a manner befitting an ambassador. Love for the Lord, love for one’s brethren, and love for God’s kingdom, therefore, should induce each one to be clean in body, clean in apparel, clean in mind and clean in doestrine, so as to represent properly The Theocracy* He will transform from old world conduct to New World standards of behavior. Let all representatives of God’s G ov-emment, therefore, conduct themselves in this respect as is becoming to “able ministers”, ambassadors of Christ the King. Kindness, neatness and cleanness in conduct and appearance, with sincerity, are primary requisites of the Theocratic minister. The apostle says, “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ,<sup>77</sup> (2 Cor, 5:20) Also, “Praying . * * that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, for wli’ieh I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.<sup>77</sup> (Eph. 6:18-20) To be bold dues not mean to be rude. An attitude of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">courtesy</span><span class="font19"> to police and religionists included, with fear of God and not of man, should be maintained at all times. “The fear of man brings th a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in Jehovah shall be safe.”—Prov. 29 : 25, Aw* </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC TACTFULNESS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>23</sup> In approaching the people of good-will the Kingdom publisher should not start off “on the wrong foot”. He will use his knowledge of the Bible to comfort those that mourn. He avoids arguments with “goats<sup>77</sup>. He should never be rude or abrupt to anyone. Rather, when before the enemy he is tactful. “I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.<sup>7</sup>’—Ps. 39:1; Jas. 3: 2-i.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>24</sup> Tactfulness is best understood by studying illustrations taken from God’s Word, showing tact used by Eis ministers <a name="footnote8"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark11">8</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote9"></a><a href="#bookmark12">9</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote10"></a><a href="#bookmark13">10</a></sup>&nbsp;in times past.

He set an example for his faithful followers today. “A fool uttereth all his mind: hut a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.” (Prow 29:11) “Quick trigger” action, “smart talk” remarks, being “sassy”, going around with “a chip on one's shoulder” in dealing with officers, has caused, much trouble and difficulty. Let such be avoided ai all times. “A soft answer turncth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.”—Prov. 15: 1*</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESENTING THE MESSAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>25</sup>In the presentation of the Kingdom message the publisher doess well to advise the people that he is a </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">minister</span><span class="font19"> of the gospel, preaching the message of God’s kingdom by distributing the news in printed form, publicly and from house to house; that bo is leaving with them Bible helps to encourage home Bible study. When presenting literature, the publisher should always make known to the inquisitive one or the police officer that he is not selling anything and. is not a canvasser or peddler or solicitor; that he is a </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">minister. </span><span class="font19">State to one who desires literature that it is his privilege to contribute (or donate) a reasonable amount; that if one is mi' able to contribute the sum set by the Society, any sum he is able and willing to contribute toward the Kingdom work will be accepted, provided he promises to study the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3fi</sup> Each publisher should introduce the literature with the phonograph (if he has one), employing the doorstep method described in the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Informant.</span><span class="font19"> Each one should present the identification-testimony card to persons at the door if the phonograph is not used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>27</sup> When one being witnessed to advises plainly and definitely that he is not interested or asks the publisher to leave the premises, or orders the publisher off the place, he should promptly and courteously leave. Do not remain or argue</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">25. On approaching the people what does the minister make known ? 2(1 What means arc used tn preaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">27. What is the minister’s attitude toward the uninterested and opponents?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">or make any sarcastic reply. Avoid persistence in dealing with goatlike individuals*</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">APARTMENT BUILDINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>25</sup> Persons living in apartment houses, boarding houses, company “Owned towns, trailer courts, and similar places, have the same right as those in private homes to hear the Kingdom message. No owner, manager or custodian has authority to order the publisher to leave the premises, as long as the publisher is conducting himself in an orderly and proper manner while witnessing to tenants. In every instance all individual tenants have the privilege of accepting or rejecting the message of truth thus brought to t/iew, but neither a tenant nor the manager, nor any other person, has authority to prevent the publisher from calling on the other tenants. (See paragraph 30 below.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>29</sup> If the publisher is ordered to leave the premises, the publisher should kindly and calmly advise the objector that he is a. minister of the gospel and is calling on the people of good-will residing in the building (or the camp or court). The publisher should courteously explain that the tenants have the constitutional right to hear the truth and to entertain visitors, and that the purpose in calling on such tenants is to bring to them this life-giving message. It will be proper to agree to reduce the sound-volume of the phonograph so that it will not be too loud and disturb any. Often much tact will be required to avoid a controversy with a manager or other objector; but the publishers will be diligent to sec that a minimum of their time is taken in controversy, so that the maximum of time can be de voted to publishing the gospel.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>30</sup> As to whether it is prudent to leave (so as to return later) or to remain on the premises, each publisher will decide for himself, using the spirit of a sound mind in the particular circumstances. It may be advisable to withdraw and then come back later. Unless there is likelihood of avoiding the difficulty by returning later, it may be advisable to continue.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>31</sup> The minister’s purpose is to comfort those that mourn, not to cause arrests. When a course of action can be taken that will avoid an arrest, it is proper to take such step unless it means to discontinue preaching the gospel as commanded by Jehovah or otherwise violate the covenant to serve Him. When man commands the discontinuance of the preaching of the gospel in a community, the course of action taken by Jesus’ faithful apostles serves as wise counsel. “Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5: 29) This bold stand taken in harmony with God’s law is the only course for Jehovah’s witnesses, regardless of consequences. When a conflict arises, the Christian fears only God and places his entire ease in the hands of the Wonderful Counsellor.—Isa. 9:6; John 4:23,24.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16">32 ’When trouble occurs, the first point the publisher should make known is that he is aw </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">ordained minister</span><span class="font16"> preaching the gospel in obedience to the commandments of Jehovah God. (Isa. 61: 6) Then explain how and why he is a minister and why he goes from house to house or upon the streets with the message concerning The Theocracy. “God hath not. given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind,” (2 Tim. 1: 7) Exercising such spirit of a sound mind, and of Zora (1 John 5:3; 4:17,18), the Theocratic minister will have the Lord’s assistance. At times the publisher might feel that he is justified in giving a sharp retort, making a slighting remark or a blunt statement; but such practice should be avoided in favor of a kind attitude of friendship. (Prov. 16:32) In many instances a lack of tact causes unnecessary trouble and otherwise spoils a good defense.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>33</sup> When accosted by an officer and asked what be is doing, the publisher should immediately show his identification card, </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">briefly</span><span class="font16"> explain that he is </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">an ordained minister</span><span class="font16"> of Jehovah God preaching the gospel under direction of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society and in harmony with God’s commandments, which are supreme; that «uch commandments must be obeyed in preference to the commands</span></p></li>

The publisher should advise the officer that he is not violating any constitutional local law. If thereafter the officer demands that the publisher cease the work or orders him to leave town, he should courteously say that such order cannot be complied with. If threatened with arrestj the officer should be informed by the publisher that he does not desire to be arrested, but that he cannot stop preaching, because to do that would result; in his everlasting destruction at the hand of Almighty God. If the officer arrests him because of his refusal to discontinue his lawful activity, such arrest will be in violation of the Constitution and of the law of Almighty God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>34</sup> If the officer is honestly seeking information and suggests that the publisher accompany him to the police station to discuss the matter with his superiors, without putting the publisher under arrest, it is proper to comply with such request. At the station explain the work and give further testimony to the officials. If the publisher discerns, however, that the officer is not sincere, or that his request is aimed to entrap the publisher or to interfere with the work, then he should be kindly told that unless an arrest is made the publisher will not accompany him to the police station. Then, if arrested, ask with what offense the publisher is charged. The officer should not be resisted, nor any argument be made by the publisher, who should voluntarily go along when arrest is made. It is not necessary to tell about the activity of any other witness for Jehovah in the community. Do not aid the police to wrongly arrest your other brethren by giving information concerning them; speak for yourself only.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">S4. (a) Under what circumstances should the minister go with the police otficer? (b) Concerning whom should information be given?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>35</sup> On arrival at police headquarters and when before the superior officer there, the publisher should again give a courteous explanation of his preaching<sup>1</sup> activity, show his identification card, and explain the method of carrying on the Kingdom work? Just as he did to the policeman who arrested him. Such may result in a discharge then- If any legal decisions are at hand, use them to show that the activity of Jehovah’s witnesses has been approved by the courts. Invite the police official to have the city’s attorney examine the copy of the legal decision, if you have such to leave with him. Request that the householder making the complaint be required to </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">sign</span><span class="font19"> the charges. Refusal to sign may cause police to discharge the publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>sy</sup> If the publisher is booked and charged with an offense, immediately request (1) a copy of the complaint, and (2) a copy of the ordinance or law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>J7</sup> If the police do not have such copies, then find out who can provide copies, and obtain them. Usually the city clerk can provide copy of the ordinance. If such copies are refused, the publisher should ask permi-isioTi to make copies himself. Thev need not be certified, but should be </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">accurate •v;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">and complete copies. When such have been obtained, immediately send them to the Society’s Legal Desk, together with a complete report of the arrest. Do not neglect to do this as soon as possible after your release, and keep for your own file a copy of each paper. If not released, then make report from JaiL Merely advising the Society about an 'arrest for selling books without a permit<sup>1</sup>? or similar incomplete information, is entirely insufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORT PROMPTLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>S8</sup> Prompt report is necessary, so that specific advice can be given by the Society when needed, to aid in the defense of the case. Give all facts: (1) what the publisher was doing when arrested, and everything that happened; (2) what action was taken by the police; (3) what action can be expected in the future; (4) name of the court where the trial</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">will be held and, if possible, name of court to which appeal can be taken in event of conviction; (5) any newspaper clippings on the arrest; and (6) any other pertinent information, The Society cannot give proper advice without a complete report- In case of an arrest of a company publisher the company servant or his assistant will supervise the report to the Society, see that it is timely made, and sign the same, with or for the publisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">PROVIDING BOND</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3$</sup> As soon as the publisher is booked at police headquarters he should ask to be released without bond or on his promise to return for trial. When so allowed to go he is said to be h'clcascd on his own recognizance’. If that request is refused, he should communicate at once with some capable brother or person of good-will, by telephone or messenger, to obtain aid in securing bond. Any such person owning property will gladly sign an appearance bond for trial, as it is his privilege to aid thus in resisting encroachments of the enemy. When bond cannot be obtained locally after diligent effort, advise tbe Society by telegraph, giving dear report of charges made and amount of bond demanded. Cash bond should not be posted if other bonds are available, because usually the fine will be taken out of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">cash</span><span class="font19"> bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">L<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>40</sup> Persons who expect to sign a bond should come prepared to present their latest paid bill for taxes on and the deeds to their property, to show that they can qualify as bondsmen. The one arrested should carefully read the bond posted for his release and determine when he will be required to appear for trial. Be certain to appear at the time and place fixed for trial, to avoid forfeiture of the bond.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>41</sup> The police, for protection of the one placed in jail, keep all valuables and papers, to be returned on release from jail. Police have a right to take portions of the literature being distributed, to be used as evidence. It might be suggested to them that two copies of each publication be kept by them.

<p><span class="font19">phonograph, and other things that arc not directly related to the charges made, should be relinquished by the police when the publisher is released for trial. In event the police wrongly keep such, a vigorous protest should be lodged against such action of the police, promptly. Such instruments arc needed by the publisher to carry on his preaching activity. Obtain a receipt for any property left with the police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">SUFFERING FOR FUGHTEOUSNESS' SAKE</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">*<sup>2</sup> When incarcerated, the true worshiper will not shew the spirit of retaliation, but joyfully suffer as did Christ Jesus, for righteousness* sake. (Jas. 1: 2-4; 1 Pet. 3:14,15; Matt. 5:10-16) He will not indulge in berating other prisoners or the jailer, but will remain calm and diligently, thoughtfully use every opportunity to explain to everyone with whom he associates while within prison walls as to why <sub>T </sub>he was arrested, and otherwise give a bold witness to Jehovah's name, &quot;with meekness&quot; and fearing only God. If possible, let the one arrested take literature with him into the jail. Thus the comforting printed message of the Kingdom can be given to others to whom the minister also is </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">sent</span><span class="font19"> to preach. (Isa. 61:1; Acts 16:25-34) The faithful minister will not miss any opportunity to give a witness, and to do good.—Gal. 6:9,10.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">*<sup>3</sup> The work of Jehovah’s faithful ministers is a continuous one. Threats of man do not move them to discontinue their preaching activity. (Acts 5: 42) God's command to Isaiah (6:8-12) applies to Jehovah's witnesses continuously until His &quot;strange work&quot; is declared by Jehovah to be finished. (Consider Isaiah 28:5,6,21.) No faithful follower of the Lord Christ Jesus will agree to discontinue any part of the preaching activity pending the settlement of a case against him or any of his brethren in the courts. When released on bond the witnessing activity should continue as usual. Threats by officials to continue arrests will not deter the faithful minister in gathering and feeding &quot;other sheep&quot; of the King. If actual arrests are repeated many times so</span></p>

Usually, if one represents himself he will be better enabled to give a witness and testimony to the court By thoroughly studying and following suggestions contained herein and any special instructions from the Legal Desk, little if any difficulty will be experienced in making a good presentation to the court, and attorney fees can be avoided. When the case is put into an appellate court, then an attorney may be employed,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>45</sup> After obtaining release on bond or when making first appearance before the court the publisher should be sure to ask for and obtain a postponement (continuance or adjournment) of the case for three weeks. This is to allow for full preparation for trial and communication with the Society’s Legal Desk, The publisher can explain to the judge that he must communicate with his headquarters to obtain counsel and to prepare complete defense, which will require that the trial be delayed for approximately three weeks. If postponement is refused, let the publisher proceed to prepare his own case for trial by following closely the suggestions outlined herein.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">** Before the case is tried the publisher should prepare to have with him at the trial his phonograph (if used at time of arrest) and all literature he was using, together with his identification card and any other material he used while preaching the gospel. Other brethren and people of goodwill should be advised as to time and place of trial, so that those desiring can attend.

<p><span class="font14">50. Under what circumstances should a jury be requested?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">gospel by distribution of literature it is not necessary to request that a jury be empaneled to bear the case* Such cases usually involve matters of law which are for determination by a judge, whether a jury is or is not requested* Unless the Society advises in any particular case to obtain a jury, brethren will proceed with their trials before the judge without a jury. In event a jury trial is advised the demand for the jury must be made to the judge before the case is called for trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">PROPER CONDUCT ON THE STAND</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>51</sup> The attitude of the faithful minister who is on trial for preaching the gospel should always be one of courtesy and respect to the presiding judge and to the prosecuting attorney. There is nothing wrong in this* One should be bold in giving testimony concerning God's kingdom, keeping in mind always that he is an ambassador for Christ and The Government, and that the judge, prosecuting attorney and others connected with the court are merely human, “Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee liefor^them?' (Jer* 1; 17) An attitude of sincere kindness should be maintained by the Theocratic minister throughout the trial, remembering that “ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font19"> u </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">testimony</span><span class="font19"> against them”* (Mark 13:9) The primary purpose of being in court, therefore, is to give a witness and testimony to the honor of Jehovah's name, with the courtesy and boldness of an ambassador for Christ*</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>52</sup> The appearance in court by the Christian minister he should regard as a friendly visit to some honest men to tell them about God's kingdom and the reasons and methods for carrying on his ministerial work in their community. He testifies not for </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">his own</span><span class="font19"> sake, not to escape punishment, but to inform and help every willing listener present* He speaks calmly, clearly, so that </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">every one</span><span class="font19"> can hear, and without fear of man, which brings a snare* The witness will be given* Leave the punishment by the court or deliverance therefrom entirely in the hand of Jehovah God. “The angel of Jehovah cncampeth round about them that fear him, and dejivereth them*” (Ps, 34:7, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.;</span><span class="font19"> Acts </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">bl-53. What is the attitude of the faithful Christian at the trial and on the witness stand, and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">5:19-21; 12:5-17; 16:23-34) “Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospers th in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. . . . For evil-doers shall be cut off; bat those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the earth,” (Ps. 37; 7-9, Jm. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Rev.</span><span class="font19"> Pen, margin) “For the Lord Jehovah will help me; therefore have I not been confounded i therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be put to shame.”—Isa. 50; 7, Am. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Rev. Ver.;</span><span class="font19"> see also Ezekiel 3: 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5a</sup> If the living God does not deliver one from punishment, the Christian can confidently conclude that it is God’s will to have the case go to a higher court for a further witness. —Dan. 3 :16-18, 23-30; 6:10-28; Esther 9:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>5</sup>* In some courts it is customary to require all to rise when the judge enters. This does not appear to be within the prohibition mentioned at Exodus 20:1-6. Here rising and standing at attention may be regarded merely as an act of recognition shown under rules of the court by everyone in the room at the moment the judge enters. Paul, when being heard before the visiting king, Agrippa, was interrupted by Festus. Paul tactfully said “most noble Festus”. (Acts 26:1-3,7,13,19,24-26) This seems to indicate that it is not objectionable to use similar expressions of address, such as the individual speaking may choose, namely, “Sir,” “May it please the court,” “Your honor,” and similar ordinary and usual words of address to the judge presiding,</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>115</sup> Likewise there is no objection to the Christian^ taking the customary oath and being “sworn in” as a witness. It is nothing more than an agreement to tell the truth on matters that the court is entitled to know. Provision is made in the law for those with objections to an oath to affirm.</span></p>

The arresting officer will testify as to what the defendant was doing at the time of arrest.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>57</sup> The right to cross-examine, ask questions of each witness who takes the stand for the prosecution, is guaranteed the defendant. There are no hard and fast rules about cross examination. If any witness testifies to a glaring untruth, he might be asked a few pointed questions to establish the lying, if any, of the witness. Cross examination of the prosecuting witnesses will depend entirely on the circumstances, but as a rule it should be sparingly and cautiously used,</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>c4</sup> “I am an ordained minister of Jehovah God, an authorised representative of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, a charitable corporation organized under the New York and Pennsylvania corporation laws, with headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, The sole purpose and business of such society, and my primary occupation, is to preach the gospel of God's kingdom by distributing literature containing printed sermons on Bible subjects relating to presentday world events, I am one of its ministers who carry on such work. The society makes and distributes to me, and also to other ordained ministers throughout the earth, books, pamphlets and literature.

The literature is not sold, but is distributed on the terms of the one receiving it. The contributions received are used to print and distribute more like literature. No one makes any commercial profit. In fact, the contributions do not nearly cover the cost of publication. The cost of publication is borne chiefly by general voluntary contributions made by persons interested in getting the good news to the people. I engage in this work solely because I have given my life as a minister to God’s service, and it is my duty to tell the people of God’s gracious provision for man’s protection and salvation and that His kingdom is the only hope for suffering humanity.

Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his Efe; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.’ If an ordinance requires me to ask for a permit to do this work, my defense is that no state or municipality has any authority to enact or enforce an ordinance that is contrary to the Constitution or what God commands in His law, and the enactment and attempt to enforce such ordinance comes clearly within God’s declaration at Psalm 94: 20 with reference to ‘framing mischief by law’.

It can also be pointed out that the apostle Paul and other apostles at times engaged in secular work to maintain themselves* Jolin 21:2-7 shows Peter, Thomas, James and John engaged in fishing, and this </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font19"> they had been called to be apostles* Paul worked with his hands so as to be selfsupporting and not dependent upon others for sustenance* (Acts 18:3,4; 20:33,34; 1 Cor. 4:12; 2 Cor. 12:14; 1 Thcss, 2:9; 2 Th ess* 3:8-10) By religionists even Jesus was recognized not as a minister, but as a carpenter.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SUMMARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>se</sup> The undisputed evidence shows that defendant at the time of arrest was acting pursuant to duties as an ordained minister of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>87</sup> Contributions received by Jehovah’s witnesses are identical with free-will offerings received by the clergyman when </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font16"> contribution plate is passed. No reasonable person would contend that in church the hearer '‘bought’’ or “purchased” a sermon when thus contributing to the preacher; nor can it be contended that anyone “bought” the </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">printed</span><span class="font16"> sermons distributed by defendant. The defendant did not “sell” as that term is understood in commercial transactions. A commercial business could not last long if operated on the principles or by the methods employed by Jehovah’s witnesses. The reason that Jehovah’s witnesses carry on as they do in</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">SG, ST. (a) Contributions received for th&amp; literature are comparable to what; and why is preaching not commercial? (b) In what way is the deficit in We cost of preaching taken care of?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">spite of the loss to them financially is that their entire life is devoted to Jehovah God and the declaration of His kingdom gospel. Each has pledged all to see that the people receive God's Word concerning the complete establishment of God's kingdom in the near future. Each considers it a privilege to devote energy, time and money toward bringing the message to the people, even if it costs him his liberty or life; therefore, financial loss is a small thing compared with other hardships they gladly endure for the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Jehovah’s witnesses themselves keep the deficit suffered in their operations made up by voluntary contributions </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">themselves</span><span class="font19"> and do not depend upon any on the </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">outside</span><span class="font19"> to bear their burdens. Therefore their work is entirely charitable and it cannot be honestly or fairly contended to be commercial. The evidence does not support a conclusion here that the transactions are commercial or mon cy- m aking,</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>3S</sup> The fact that some of Jehovah’s witnesses are unable to work full-time as ministers but- must spend part of their time to earn their Jiving through secular trade or calling and not through the work of ministration does not prevent their being properly considered as ministers of the gospel, duly ordained. If such requirements were insisted upon, the disciples of Christ Jesus were not qualified to be His ministers* All of them had some secular callings; none were graduates of theological seminaries* Paul was educated as a lawyer; other apostles were fishermen and <sup>{i</sup>unlearned”* Even Christ Jesus was a carpenter*</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">Secular avocations of some of Jehovah’s witnesses do not negative their fitness to preach the gospel of the kingdom of God nor prevent their being considered worthy of legal recognition as ministers* </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">In re Cain,</span><span class="font19"> 39 Ala. 440, 441, holds that *'a minister of religion includes a minister belonging to a sect of religionists who perform ministerial labor gratuitously and rely on secular employment as a means of subsistence”* Thousands of urban clergymen enjoy large incomes from their ministry, while many rural preachers of “recognized” religions must engage in farming and other occupations during the v<sup>r</sup>eek so as to preach in the pulpit of the country church on Sunday*</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">The law In question when properly construed does not include cfefendatit'B activity of preaching the gospel of God's kingdom by dissemination of Sible literature containing Information and opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>S1</sup> Throughout the entire United States during the past several years this type of ordinance and similar laws have been wrongly applied to the activity of Jehovah's witnesses. Many convictions have been appealed to the higher courts and such courts of various states have held, consistently that the duty falls upon such courts to construe those commercial laws so as to exclude the non-eommereial preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses. This the courts have done in spite of the fact that the evidence clearly showed that money contributions were received and that the complaining witnesses in many cases testified that they “bought” literature from Jehovah’s witnesses involved and that Jehovah’s witnesses were “selling” literature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16"><sup>93</sup> Not every activity which involves a ‘monetary incident<sup>3 </sup>is commercial or merchandising.

It is proper and</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">. 90-92. What have many courts held as to the application of commercial laws to the work of Jehovah’s witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">93. Is it necessary to have money to defray expense of preaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">necessary to receive contributions to help defray the cost of such dissemination; for if literature were always required to be given away free of charge or a permit fee paid, the “four freedoms” would he only very short-lived,</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>S4</sup> To confuse the commercial business of selling fruit, vegetables, dry goods, etc., with the kind of activity carried on by defendant disregards major emphases which distinguish charitable activity from Wool worth's, the political party from ‘‘Wall Street”. What Jehovah’s witnesses do Is the very antithesis of commercialism, retail “business”, “retail sales,” or peddling goods, wares or merchandise. There was no gainful activity directed toward </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">private</span><span class="font19"> profit As used for purposes of the challenged ordinance, “peddling” and “business” mean to have an “object of gain, or benefit for private advantage”. These elements are absent here. The transactions were not for profit or livelihood either to defendant or the benevolent publishing corporation, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. The commodity, literature, was not commercial; the way of working was not commercial, and the purpose or objective was not commerce. No “business” could survive under such a plan on sueh basis as conducted by Jehovah's witnesses. In short, their activity is neither “sales” nor “business”. Defendant’s work was essentially the distribution of literature containing information and opinion on the terms of the receiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>a3</sup> In the ease of </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Shreveport</span><span class="font19"> v. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">Teague^</span><span class="font19"> 200 La. 679, 8 S. 2d 640, concerning one of Jehovah’s witnesses, it is said: “It seems quite obvious to us from a mere reading of the above quoted section that the acts done by relator do not constitute a violation of the ordinance. Relator is neither a solicitor, peddler, hawker, itinerant merchant or transient vendor of merchandise. He is admittedly an ordained minister of a religious sect, who, instead of voicing his views from a pulpit, travels as an Itinerant preacher from house to house. [If] The fact that relator, as an incident to his preachings, attempts to sell literature which is conformable with his religious beliefs doess not alter the nature of his ' profession or make him a solicitor, hawker or itinerant merchant. ... .[fl] To hold otherwise, we would be com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">04. How is preaching confused with commercial activity?.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">96. Ifow does Shreveport v. TtfUffue describe the preaching of Jehovah's witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">pellcd to attribute to the City Council of Shreveport the intention of declaring that the visitation into homes (without previous invitations) by priests and. ministers of all religious denominations, accompanied, by the sale of Biblical literature, constitutes a nuisance and a misdemeanor. This we will not do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">For the reasons stated above, the law upon which the prosecution is based doess not apply. Therefore on the undisputed evidence and facts a finding of <sup>4i</sup>not guilty” should be made and the complaint and prosecution ordered dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">97 Point Two</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The law is unconstitutional as construed and applied to defendant's activity because it abridges and burdens defendant's exercise of the rights of freedom of speech, press and worship of ALMIGHTY GOD, guaranteed to the people by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and the similar provisions tn the Constitution of this State, .n</span></p>

Whether such visiting shall be permitted has in general been deemed to depend upon the will of the individual master of each household, and not upon the determination of the community. . &lt;&nbsp;. [If] While door to door distributers of literature may be either a nuisance or a blind for criminal activities, they may also be useful members of society engaged in the dissemination of ideas in accordance with the best tradition of free discussion. The widespread use of this method of communication by many groups espousing various causes attests its major importance, , ♦ . Many of our most widely established religious organizations have used this method of disseminating their doestrines, and laboring groups have used it in recruiting their members. The federal government, in its current war bond selling campaign, encourages groups of citizens to distribute advertisements and circulars from house to house. Of course, as every person acquainted with political life knows, door to door campaigning is one of the most accepted techniques of seeking popular support, while the circulation of nominating papers would be greatly handicapped if they could not be taken to the citizens in their homes. Door to door distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed causes of little people, [fl] Freedom to distribute information to every citizen wherever he desires to receive it is so clearly vital to the preservation of a free society, putting aside reasonable police and health regulations of time and manner of distribution, it must bo fully preserved.”</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font16">870 (decided May 3, 1943), being eight cases of Jehovah’s witnesses, Mr. Justice Douglas, speaking for the court, declared unconstitutional an ordinance of Jeannette, Pa., applied against Jehovah’s witnesses. He said: ‘‘Petitioners spread their interpretations of the Bible and their religious beliefs largely through the hand distribution of literature by full or part time workers. They claim to follow the example of Paul, teaching ‘publicly, and from house to house’. Acts 20: 20, They take literally the mandate of the Scrip* tures, ‘Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.’ Mark 16:15. In doing so they believe that they are obeying a commandment of God. [1J] The hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of missionary evangelism—as old as the history of printing presses. It has been, a potent force in various religious movements down through the years. This form of evangelism is utilized today on a large scale by various religious sects whose colporteurs carry the Gospel to thousands upon thousands of homes and seek through personal visitations to win adherents to their faith. It is more than preaching; it is more than distribution, of religious literature. It is a combination, of both. Its purpose is as evangelical as the revival meeting. This form of religious activity occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits. It has the same claim to protection as the more orthodox and conventional exercises of religion. It also has the same claim as the others to the guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, til J ■ ■ • <sup>e</sup> only Mid that spreading one’s religious beliefs or preaching the Gospel through distribution of religious literature and through personal visitations is an age-old type of evangelism, with as high a claim to constitutional protection as the more orthodox types. ... (51 ■ ■ ■ But the mere fact that the religious literature is ‘sold’ by itinerant preachers rather than ‘donated’ does not transform evangelism into a commercial enterprise.

<p><span class="font19">membered that the pamphlets of Thomas Paine were not distributed free of charge. It is plain that a religious organization needs funds to remain a going concern. But an itinerant evangelist, however misguided or intolerant he may be, does not become a mere book agent by selling the Bible or religious tracts to help defray his expenses or to sustain him. Freedom o£ speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion are available to all, not merely to those who can pay their own way. As we have said, the problem of drawing the line between a purely commercial activity and a religious one will at times be difficult. On this record it plainly cannot be said that petitioners were engaged in a commercial rather than a religious venture. It is a distortion of the facts of record to describe their activities as the occupation of selling books and pamphlets?<sup>1</sup></span></p>

The Society is an organization for Jehovah’s witnesses, an evangelical group, founded upon and drawing inspiration from the tenets of Christianity. The Witnesses spread their teachings under the direction of the Society by distributing the books and pamphlets obtained from the Society by house to house visits.

It is unnecessary to determine whether the distributions of the publications in question are sales or contributions. The mayor issues a permit only if after thorough investigation he ‘deems it proper or advisable’. Dissemination of ideas depends upon the approval of the distributor by the official. This is administrative censorship in an extreme form. It abridges the freedom of religion, of the press and of speech guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.”</span></p>

Frauds may be denounced as offenses and punished by law. Trespasses may similarly be forbidden. If it is said that these means are less efficient and convenient than bestowal of power on. police authorities to decide what information may be disseminated from house to house, and who may impart the information, the answer is that considerations of this sort do not empower a municipality to abridge freedom of speech and press.”</span></p>

But those considerations are no justification for the license tax which the ordinance imposes. Plainly a community may not suppress, or the state tax, the dissemination of views because they arc unpopular, annoying or distasteful.

Her conviction and the convictions of Tavlor and Cum-mings, for advocating and teaching refusal to salute the flag, cannot be sustained, [fl] The last mentioned appellants were also charged with oral Leachings and the dissemination of literature calculated to encourage disloyalty to the state and national governments. Their convictions on this charge must also be set aside, [fl] The statute as construed in these cases makes it a criminal offense to communicate to others views and opinions respecting governmental policies, and prophecies concerning the future of our own and other nations* As applied to the appellants it punishes them although what they communicated is not claimed or shown to have been done with an evil or sinister purpose, to have advocated or incited subversive action against the nation or state, or to have threatened any clear and present danger to our institutions or our government* What these appellants communicated were their beliefs and opinions concerning domestic measures and trends in national and. world affairs.</span></p>

The court should be requested to allow time and opportunity to the defendant to employ an attorney to perfect the appeal.

<p><span class="font19"><sup>i:;o</sup>In preparing appeal papers, </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">do not overlook</span><span class="font19"> attaching a copy of the ordinance or law under which the arrest and prosecution was had.</span></p>

<p><span class="font19">161 When the trial is completed an immediate report should be made to the Society’s Legal Desk as to what occurred and as to whether an attorney has been obtained locally to assist in handling the appeal.

If, as and when the case reaches the higher appellate court of the state, which court requires printing of the record and briefs, the local attorney handling the same can be advised that the Society’s counsel will prepare and file the printed briefs required and arrange for the printing of the record so as to hold expenses to the minimum and to insure the most effective presentation of the appeal.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MOBS</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>153</sup> In ancient times the faithful servants of Jehovah were persecuted. Lot’s visitors were mobbed (Gen. 19:4-10); Joshua and Caleb were threatened with stoning by a mob (Num. 14: 6-10) ; Christ Jesus was mobbed. (Luke 4:14-30; 22: *17-54; 23:1/2) In Jerusalem and elsewhere the apostles were mobbed, beaten and foully persecuted hy the demonized populace of that day who, like their “father the devil”, took the law into their own hands. Stephen was mobbed and killed bv stoning. (Acts 7: 54-60) Many times Paul was mobbed. (Acts 14:19; 17:2-7; 19:28-41; 21:26-36; 2 Cor. 11: 24-26) “The whole world lies in the power of the evil one” (1 John 5:19, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, and human</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">creatures are almost without exception subject to the demons even as in the days of Noah. (Luke 17: 26) Such men submitting themselves to the demons are like beasts. They cowardly gather themselves together in groups to bluff and bully those who do not yield themselves to their demands. Stand up against such a host, trusting entirely in Jehovah God. Headed for Jerusalem, where be knew a mob awaited his arrival, Paul said: ‘And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: . . . but none of these things move me, neither count I my Efe dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I havd received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God . . . for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”—Acts 20 : 22-24; 21:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">154 Threats of mob violence are not grounds for stopping the proclamation of the Kingdom message. Often these</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font14">153. Is mob assault a modern thing, and what was the apostle's attitude toward threats of such? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font14">154, 155. What steps should the Christian take in dealing with jaiabs? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font19">threats are mere bluffs. When surrounded by a mob the servant of God should advise them that he is preaching the gospel of God^s kingdom as commanded by God<sup>J</sup>s Word,, the Bible, and that if they harm him his blood will be upon their heads (Jen 26:14,15); that they are the law violators by taking the law into their own hands, thus showing contempt for the flag of the country and that for which it stands. In all this remember the counsel and comfort contained in the Scriptures written aforetime for our use in such a crisis, and trust entirely in the Lord for strength and deliverance. (Josh. 1:9; </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font19"> Chron. 20:15,17; Ps. 29:11; Isa. 26:3,4; 50:7; Ezek. 33 : 8, 9; Phil, 1: 27-29) If the mob does not disband after an effort to reason with them, move away from them and try to avoid them. If forced to use selfdefense, do so. </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">(The Watchtower</span><span class="font19">, Sept. 15, 1939) There is no need to arm oneself and go about looking for trouble. Avoid such. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">L</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>155</sup> In a place where mob violence is </span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">repeatedly</span><span class="font19"> stirred up against the Kingdom service it may be advisable to alternate the time for doing street witness work so as to frustrate the plans of the mobsters. If conditions continue so as to warrant a drastic change, communicate with the Society for advice. When a mob gathers one of the brethren should communicate with the local officials and ask that assistance and protection be given. If the officials refuse, then look solely to the Lord for protection. Keep in mind the experiences of Paul and other faithful servants who endured like sufferings as good soldiers of Jesus Christ,—</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font19"> Tim. 2: 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">ALWAYS REPORT LAW VIOLATIONS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19"><sup>156</sup> When assaulted or mobbed see the local prosecutor. Give him the names of the guilty ones and insist that they be prosecuted for violating the local state laws. When a mob is permitted by the local officials to gather and assault one, he should make a clear, brief, comprehensive report of all the facts, naming as many individuals as possible who par* ticipated therein, together with names of local officials who refused to give protection, stating that such conduct requires action by the United States Government under Sections 51 and 52 of Title 18 of the United ^States Code. Send the report to the Department of Justice, Civil Rights Section,</span></p></li>

Such reports need not be sworn to before a notary public. In event such assaults and mobbings are repeated, an attempt should be made to have the local magistrate and justice of the peace place the mobsters and assaulters under a </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">peace bond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FINES</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>15T</sup> The apostles did not pay fines; likewise today Jehovah’s witnesses should not do so when convicted for preaching the gospel. If the court assesses a fine, an appeal should be taken. If the appeal is lost, then the fine should be discharged by going to jail instead of paying the fine. The New World publisher should remember that ha is sent forth by Jehovah God to be a witness, and if it is the Lord’s will that he go to prison and there give further testimony, after failing on appeal of his case, that should bo joyfully done, trusting in Jehovah for protection, guidance and deliverance. The prophets and apostles likewise suffered, Christ Jesus endured persecution and left some of it behind to be filled up by His faithful followers in this day. (Phil. It 29; Col. 1:24; 2 Tim. 1:8) It is a blessed privilege to have a small part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name by proving the Devil to be a liar, by maintaining integrity and preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom at all times regardless of opposition.—Prov. 27 ? 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">DAMAGE SUITS</span></p>
<p><span class="font16"><sup>1Ss</sup> Damage suits should not be instituted except in unusual cases, and then not without first submitting the facts to the Society and being advised what course, to take. Jehovah’s “faithful and wise servant” has a commissioned work to do and cannot take time out to press charges for “filthy lucre” in the courts, except where it is necessary to make our own defense in behalf of the work we are commanded to do: ‘Preach this gospel of the Kingdom.'</span></p>
