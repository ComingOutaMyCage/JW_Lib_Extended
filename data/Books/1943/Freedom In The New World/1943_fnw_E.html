<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>FREEDOM in the New World</span></h2>
<p><span class="font7">T</span><span class="font3">HE FREE WORLD comes only from the hand of Almighty God. It is at the door, and no power in heaven or in earth can turn back the hand of the all-powerful Creator from building it and offering it in all its glory to worthy creatures. It is to be a world totally of sons of God, wherein the Fatherhood of God will be true toward all creatures of good-will. His household is a family of free creatures, each one in the image of their life-giving Father, who is in the bondage of slavery to none. True freedom in its fullness is and ever will be that of the sons of God. Their almighty Father will make this earth free for the eternal life and enjoyment of his children. It is not his will that his sons should be subject to tyrants or dictators, but that all should be members of his free organization, all acknowledging the universal domination of the Most High God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The free world God creates does not come without the cost of blood, the precious blood of the greatest freedom-lover that ever trod this earth. That price paid makes the new world a sure prospect, though there be yet many and mighty enemies in the way. The world of perfect freedom will come, therefore, though not without the din of a gigantic battle and the shedding of yet more blood, the blood of all human enemies of freedom, in the &quot;battle of that great day of God Almighty&quot;, the war that ends all wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This present world is not free. What wonder, then, that the whole creation groans! In desperation it struggles to make itself free by its own exertions and schemes, but to this day all such have come to nought. The oppression upon the entire race grows heavier. As thoughtful persons observe the long path of human history strewn with the broken promises of politicians, the false, unsatisfying comfort of religion which always goes along with the politicians, and the continual blocking and overreaching of all man's attempts at human reform and betterment, they turn their hopes away from men of clay. In their despair they trust that there is a God of righteousness and that he sees conditions and will act in vindication of righteousness and will bring in lasting relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A man who was a champion of the liberty of the sons of God and who had a part in the writing of that great Book of Freedom and Charter of Liberty, the Bible, aptly described the long experience of human creation when he wrote: &quot;Indeed, the earnest expectation of the creation longs for the revelation of the sons of God. For the creation was made subject to frailty, (not voluntarily, but by him who placed it under;) in hope that even the creation itself will be emancipated from the slavery of corruption, into the FREEDOM of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together till the present time.&quot;<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark5">1</a></sup></span><a href="#bookmark4"><span class="font3"> </span></a><span class="font3">Not all men are in such expectation and longing for that free world, because not every man believes in emancipation for all men that live; nor does every man yearn from the heart for a righteous world, because not all men desire to practice righteousness. A great many prefer that the present world should continue, for their own self-satisfaction. Such haters of liberty and righteousness must and will be cleared out. Despite them, the day is near when earthly creation shall cease its groaning, because the glorious freedom of the sons of God will have been brought in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The very fact that world statesmen and lovers of democracy speak incessantly about the &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; for all nations proves that the world is in fetters. Make no mistake, however. The freedoms of worship and of speech, and the freedoms from fear and want, are not all that is necessary to create a free world where righteousness dwells. It will take vastly more than this global war and the postwar international setup to establish even those four desirable things. It is not the voice of pessimism and defeatism to say that human hands cannot bring in that quartet of freedoms world-wide and cannot bring in a millennium of peace for all men and nations. It is the voice of courageous faith in God and his purpose. It is the voice of knowledge of His truth; for such knowledge makes one free from the follies and vain imaginations of ignorant men. To no men will go the credit for the building of a new world and for the globe-girdling freedom which will then be enjoyed by men of good-will. Men who imagine they can accomplish these things with credit to themselves and their political party and religious sect do in reality put themselves in the way of God's purpose. In spite of all their good intentions, if any, they become opposers of Almighty God, and the greatest hindrances to lasting human welfare.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LOSS OF LIBERTY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Liberty of the human children of God vanished first from the earth six thousand years ago, due to the aggressions of a wicked schemer for universal domination, Satan the Devil. Adam &quot;was the son of God&quot;. (Luke 3: 38) Jehovah God established a free world for this &quot;son of God&quot;, then gave him a wife, and laid upon them both the divine mandate to multiply their kind and fill the earth with a free and righteous offspring. At once Satan the Devil grasped after the absolute control of the human race from its fountainhead on. To do so he must take away their liberty as God's children and make them his subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Their freedom and very existence were conditioned upon their perfect obedience to the Theocratic law of their Creator. Making them lawbreakers like Satan would of itself force them out of the family of God's children and onto the Devil's side. Deceit must therefore be employed. Appearing as an angel of light the Devil promised them greater freedom than they had. By what means? Read and study the account of the temptation, in Genesis, chapter three, and you will see that it was by means of religion. The acceptance of that which denies the word of God, and then acting thereafter in disobedience to the word and command of God, is religion. The Devil introduced religion to Adam and Eve to make them, as he said, 'wise and godlike'; but their taking up with religion resulted otherwise. Because the issue of universal domination was here raised, Jehovah God did not deprive Adam and Eve of freedom of religion and of speech which reproached Jehovah's name. Our first parents did lose immediately freedom from fear and from want, being driven out from the paradise garden of Eden as religionists and rebels, followers of Satan, 'the father of lies.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Measure now how great a loss of freedom the entire human family suffered. Our first parents bartered away cheaply far more than the freedom from fear and want. They sustained the loss of that which is impossible for the political, commercial and religious powers of this modern age to replace or restore. They parted with freedom from sin and its penalty, namely, death, with its attendants of imperfection, passion, sickness, fatigue, accident, old age, and the grave. They forfeited the service of God within his free organization and became the servants of sin and of man's greatest oppressor, the adversary of God. Cocksure of his grip on humankind, Satan reproached God as being unable to put a man on earth who under the test at Satan's hands would choose to serve Jehovah God and remain faithful to Him. Such a challenge foreboded the exercise of religious intolerance by Satan and his religious dupes on earth, and that they would deny, as far as possible, the freedom of anyone to worship Jehovah God in spirit and in truth. The first victim of religious intolerance was Abel, who died as Jehovah's first witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A corrupt world was then built up. Man's invisible overlord, Satan, drew other spirit creatures to his side and organized them into a powerful body of demons to fight against Jehovah's universal rule and to aid Satan in controlling the human race. In the third generation from Adam religion was organized, when men began calling themselves or false gods by the name of the Lord. Demonic interference in human affairs followed; race contamination was introduced; ungodliness increased with gross self-indulgence in eating, drinking, marriage and other activities, and indifference was shown to the message of Jehovah's witnesses. A reign of violence spread over the corrupt earth. Human power was wholly inadequate to break the oppression of the demon heavens upon the earth. No human liberator could deliver any savable portion of mankind from that ungodly old world and transfer them into righteous conditions and peace. Only the destruction of that world by the almighty power of God gave humankind a new birth of freedom. Just eight persons were accounted as righteous in God's sight and not in the service of Satan and religion. Those eight, Noah and his household, were carried alive through the end of the &quot;world that then was&quot;. — 2 Peter 2: 5; 3: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That old world was about sixteen hundred and fifty-six years of age when the mighty Flood put an end to its corruptness and violence and defamation of the name of Jehovah God. Another world followed. Has it been any improvement on the former? Today it is older in human degeneracy. It is longer in its record of religion allied with politics and commercialism, forty-three centuries having passed since the Flood. From many lips the cry now goes up for freedom and for a finer and better world. To whom is the cry directed? To the political leaders of the nations, to the religious clergy, and to the commercial and economic wizards. To mere men, in all cases! Said one prominent clergyman of New York city recently as to the postwar needs: 'The war-weary world is waiting for RELIGION &quot;to start something&quot;; presumably a modern-world crusade.' — New York Times, June 14, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Are men crying for the destruction of this present evil world and its politics, selfish commerce and religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not at all; but simply for the &quot;transformation of this old world beyond recognition&quot;, as one says. Will such manmade transformation bring to humankind the freedom of the sons of God? Will a veneered old world escape or ward off the destruction to which it is doomed? Mere human reasoning as based on man's past history must answer No! With still greater conviction, faith in God, whose Word gives the correct explanation of man's present predicament and the only remedy, answers No! A man-made &quot;new world order&quot; with its alluring promises of humanly guaranteed freedoms will prove to be a deception. It will simply put men more completely under the power of the &quot;god of this world&quot;, Satan, and will throw them off guard against the most destructive catastrophe ever to visit the earth. Said the Son of God, who is the One that shed his blood for the New World and who is its sure Foundation: &quot;As the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.&quot; — Matthew 24: 37-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the days before the deluge men persuaded themselves that the religious, social and governmental constitution of things was fixed and permanent. So they scoffed at the warning of the end of the world as delivered by Jehovah's faithful witness, Noah, and his companions, his household. History will repeat. In the &quot;new order&quot; after this total war, the official propaganda that will go forth from the backers of the postwar arrangement will persuade the common people that the better, finer world has then been ushered in to stay; that human hands have created it, and that human hands will preserve it, with an international police force. Great will be the prospects of world freedom that will be held forth, and religion will claim that this is the new world of which men have long dreamed and that it has religion's blessing and must endure. But pause and ask yourself: Why have the blare and propaganda for a new world created by politicians and religionists suddenly broken forth since, particularly, A.D. 1918? and who is back of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the Fascist and Nazi dictators had concluded their concordats with the religious head of Vatican City in 1929 and 1933, respectively, they launched their joint program of world aggression by declaring their purpose to be the establishment of a new world order, to last a thousand years. The Roman pontiff also prayed that a new order of things should be set up, which prayer the Axis powers accepted as meaning that the religious pontiff understood their aspirations and aims. (November 24, 1940) The aggressions of the Axis powers led to global war. The powers valiantly resisting the aggressors have rallied together under a counter-slogan: the building of a new world in which the Four Freedoms will sway the earth. The propaganda for such a democratic world is pushed amid the heat of total war, and by it the mobilized people are spurred into an all-out effort for a victory that will win the peace to follow. The prophecy of Daniel, chapter eleven, foretold this world conflict waged by the totalitarian &quot;king of the north&quot; and his allies against the democratic &quot;king of the south&quot; and his united nations. The inspired prophecy declares that this proves the world is in its &quot;time of the end&quot;, an end which includes the destruction of all totalitarian rule, from Satan and his demons on down to men.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>PLAYING WITH MAN'S FREEDOM</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">You notice that &quot;Christendom&quot;, because in a crisis, has lifted up the standard of liberation for the people by a man-made world of a new pattern. Will the aroused hopes of the people be realized? Sacred history, which was written aforetime for the learning and guidance of men of faith upon whom the end of the world should come, answers with a warning example. Religious &quot;Christendom&quot;, in this &quot;time of the end&quot;, exactly reflects ancient Jerusalem at the time when Jehovah's vengeance against her religious hypocrisy was being declared against that unfaithful city, and her doom was sealed and her end was in sight. King Zedekiah made a desperate effort to appease the people and hold them to him. He &quot;made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them&quot;. This denoted no inward heart change in the rulers and religious and economic masters of the people. Why not? Because, shortly following that release, which was due the people according to God's law, the rulers &quot;turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That was an act of treachery against the people's interests and committed in God's name by the religious, political combine. Therefore Jehovah God, by his witness Jeremiah, sent this message to them: &quot;Thus saith the LORD, Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, TO THE SWORD, TO THE PESTILENCE, AND TO THE FAMINE; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. . . . I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life.&quot; (Jeremiah 34:1-22) Hypocritical, religious Jerusalem deceived the Jews with her freedom program, but in vain. Shortly she was destroyed completely for the vindication of Jehovah's holy name and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Christendom,&quot; like that Jerusalem, claims to be in relationship with God. In place of keeping covenant with him by measuring up to his law and commandments set out in the Bible, the true Book of Freedom, &quot;Christendom&quot; practices religion. She pays and supports religion for its blessing upon her plans for world domination. Jehovah's witnesses have long proclaimed to her that the time of the Kingdom era of freedom for the people of good-will is here, according to God's law and appointment. The present global war, and the preceding World War and its famines, pestilences, earthquakes and persecution of Jehovah's witnesses, prove that. Why? Because it fulfills the prophecy of the Son of God and testifies that the final end of oppressive &quot;Christendom&quot; and all of Satan's organization is near. The destruction thereof will come from the hand of the glorious God of Freedom, Jehovah, to clear the way for his New World with Christ Jesus as Theocratic King. Why, then, should &quot;Christendom&quot;, which claims to represent God, work up her own program of a man-made new world with liberation of the people from their oppressors? It is in order to keep the hope of the people pinned to men, men who have failed, and to blind the people further and hold them away from the 'new heavens and new earth' which Almighty God promised in his Word long before this global war. — Jeremiah 34:1-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Like King Zedekiah and his nobles under war pressure, the proposed new world order, concerning which many attractive promises are now made, will begin with some actual efforts and arrangements for the freedoms of humankind. But as certain as Satan is &quot;the god of this world&quot;, a free world by man's hand will not materialize. God's Word plainly serves notice that the postwar international creature that will arise will not bring freedom from Satan's demon organization. His organization is symbolized by &quot;Babylon&quot;, and is visibly represented on earth by &quot;Christendom's&quot; spiritual adviser, &quot;organized religion.&quot; From Eden on religion has been the adversary's tool for holding the people in bondage to sin and death. When the &quot;new order&quot; creature makes its debut at the close of international hostilities, then organized religion </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">will </span><span class="font3">&quot;start something&quot;. According to her present plans she will seat herself as mistress on that scarlet-colored creature. There is one religious organization that dominates all organized religion of the earth. With the craft and skill born of centuries, that one will use its influence for the making of the new order a total one. Revelation, chapter seventeen, foretells this; and it will not fail, for God's Word shall not return unto him void and unfulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religion and her political and commercial allies will attempt to extend indefinitely their domination of the earth, in defiance of the New World of righteousness which it is Jehovah God's appointed time to establish. Nothing else awaits the peoples who trust in the new order than to be brought into greater bondage to the &quot;god of this world&quot; and to sin, which means opposition to Jehovah God. The expected freedoms will not be realized nor endure, because that abominable makeshift for God's kingdom by Christ will not have Jehovah God's blessing. The only freedom that He will proclaim for it is, as stated, &quot;a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine&quot;; which was ancient Jerusalem's appalling fate. Then woe betide religion! Revelation's prophecy is now understandable, that before the final end of the postwar order, the political, military and commercial ruling elements will awake to the realization that organized religion has been a deadly snare to them and has drawn them in her noose toward destruction at Armageddon. In bitterness and contempt they will turn upon organized religion and will expose her and tear her sanctimonious organization to pieces. Madly they will continue their fight against Jehovah and his King of the New World. All peoples, except the comparatively few who believe Jehovah's promise and look to him for the New World of life and freedom, will be regimented into war against the world's Rightful Rulers, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus. None of such opposers of the Theocratic New World will survive. Mindful of that sure end of the backers of the man-made new order, let men of goodwill take heed to their own way now. — Revelation 17:12-18; 19:19-21.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>THE ONLY DEPENDABLE PROMISE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In the distant past the Lord God foretold the building of the New World and its blessed freedoms, and men of faith believed in its coming. They did not feel that God was slow about fulfilling his promise. They did not assume that his promise therefore authorized them to take matters into their own hands and set up the. promised world themselves and take the glory, praise and credit for it unto themselves. No; they waited for God's appointed time when he will build it. In the meantime they lived in preparation for that glorious world of righteousness and acted as Jehovah's witnesses in bearing testimony to its coming. Among such were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and concerning them it is written: &quot;By faith [Abraham] sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise: for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth. For they that say such things declare &quot;plainly that they seek a country. And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.&quot; — Hebrews 11: 9,10, 13-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle Peter was another who was not deceived by the alluring promises that men make concerning this world for the reform and improvement of which they claim to be working. Calling attention first to the fate of the former world that perished in the Flood, and then to the destiny of this world, and finally to God's promised new world, the apostle writes: &quot;Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: but the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. Nevertheless we, according to [God's] promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; (2 Peter 3:6,7,13) Therefore Peter entered into no political deals or concordats with the imperial, dictatorial or totalitarian rulers of this world, either to seat himself on top of them as their spiritual adviser and super-national power, or to convert this world and save it from its destruction. Peter devoted himself undividedly to Jehovah God's work of 'taking out from among the nations of this world a people for God's name', that these might be made ready for life in the heavenly kingdom of the New World of God's establishment. — Acts 15: 7-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The FREEDOM IN THE NEW WORLD is clearly described in God's Word and is thereby irrevocably guaranteed by Him. It will be a world ruled by a free Government, a heavenly Government, and hence it will be governed from above, and not from the people on the new earth. That Government is the glorious &quot;city&quot; which Abraham and his fellow heirs of God's promise looked forward to by faith. It is pictured under the symbol of the heavenly Jerusalem. The apostle Paul was begotten of God the Father to be a member or citizen of that heavenly Government. When writing to other Christians who are in line for the kingdom of heaven Paul said: &quot;But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.&quot; She stands in direct contrast with ancient Jerusalem which came into bondage through religion, so that she rejected and killed the King of the New World and was therefore destroyed by the imperial Roman armies in A.D. 70. On the other hand, the Anointed One, whom religious Jerusalem nailed to the tree for refusing to bow in servitude to her religion, now reigns free as King in the New Jerusalem, which is above. The New Jerusalem shall never be trodden down by the Gentile nations or suffer destruction, but shall rule for ever as the bulwark of the New World of freedom and righteousness. &quot;So then, brethren,&quot; concludes the apostle Paul, &quot;we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.&quot; — Galatians 4:25,26,31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Government constitutes the &quot;new heavens&quot;, and before it &quot;the heavens and the earth which are now&quot; must flee away. That fact guarantees to all persons of good-will a most fundamental freedom, and one which politicians and religionists and human reformers can not dare guarantee nor establish. Why so? Because the setting up of the postwar new order will still leave humankind groveling under the wicked tyranny of the author of sin and religion, Satan the Devil. That wicked one and his</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">demon hordes were cast out of heaven from and after A.D. 1914, when Jehovah God enthroned his Son as King and the Government of the New World was born. The Devil and his demons were cast down to the earth. Hence all human promises of better times under postwar arrangements will prove false; for God's Word says: &quot;Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.&quot; As long as he is loose, and since there is no earthly organization, religious or political, with power to bind the Devil, the survivors of the global war may look, not for larger liberties, but for increased regimentation and oppression of the people to hold them under the &quot;god of this world&quot; and to turn them into faithlessness and religion and thereby against Jehovah and his Kingdom. In all such total regulation of the peoples and the progressive narrowing down of their freedom the Devil's main target will be those proclaiming and standing for Jehovah's righteous rule by Christ Jesus, namely, the remnant of the children of Jerusalem which is above and which is free. God's Word warns: &quot;And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.... And the dragon was wroth with the woman,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot; — Revelation 12:1-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is certain that the present fight of Jehovah's witnesses and their companions of goodwill for freedom to worship, serve and praise God and his King must and will go on into the postwar new order. The fight will reach its climax in the battle of Armageddon. Jehovah's great Angel of deliverance, Christ Jesus, will intervene in the fight and will restrain the greatest antagonist of all freedom. As God's Revelation describes it, in symbol: &quot;And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.&quot; Satan's loosing after the righteous world has been in operation for the thousand years will fail to corrupt and overturn the new heavens and new earth. That wicked one will then be wiped out as by the fires of Gehenna that burn up all the refuse and purify the universe. — Revelation 20:1-3, 7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The King of the New Jerusalem, when on earth as a man and known as &quot;the Son of man&quot;, said: &quot;Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.&quot; (John 8:34-36) The postwar &quot;Christendom&quot; cannot but fail to free the people from sin just as certainly as she will fail to free the nations of their invisible overlord, Satan the Devil, and all his wicked demons. It matters not that &quot;organized religion&quot; will ride and steer the new order and that &quot;more religion&quot; will be put on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How can those who are themselves slaves emancipate other slaves? The religionists and their political, commercial and judicial allies are themselves all servants of sin, unable to overcome sin in themselves and likewise unable to legislate sin and selfishness out of this world. Being servants, and not free sons, they shall not abide for long. Hope of freedom by them, as long as this world lasts, is vain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The King of the New World is the sinless Son of God and is free. He will be the &quot;Everlasting Father&quot; to all his obedient subjects, and will make them his sons and daughters. When he makes them free, they shall in reality be &quot;free&quot;. Although shapen in iniquity and conceived in sin as a result of their natural descent from Adam and Eve, they will, by reason of their good-will and devotion to God's kingdom, be adopted by the King of the new heavens and he will regenerate them. He is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world, and in that New World he will free his children-subjects from the condemnation of sin and from all disability due to it before the Lord God. All the wicked men and demons being removed at Armageddon, no interference with their service of Jehovah God and obedience to his King will be permitted. Every aid to works of righteousness will be afforded them. By the regenerative processes of their &quot;Everlasting Father&quot; they will be freed from the imperfections and the inherited 'law of sin&quot; in their members and will actually master sin and become perfect and truly righteous before God.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>VISIBLE RULERS IN THE NEW EARTH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">No politicians, or usurpers of dictatorial power over men, will be there to frame mischief by law against those who render to God all that is God's. Imperial Caesar and his capital Rome and his ally, Vatican City, will no more encroach upon that which is God's. They will be gone, FOR GOOD. Even now the &quot;men of good-will&quot; who have become companions of Jehovah's witnesses join with them in repeating the words of prophecy because of the freedom they already enjoy by reason of the truth, and gratefully to Jehovah they say: &quot;LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us. O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name. They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.&quot; (Isaiah 26:12-14) No political or religious rulers will then claim to be the &quot;higher powers&quot; &quot;ordained of God&quot;. Instead, the King of freedom will utter his voice and all the faithful prophets and patriarchs of old will hear and will come forth &quot;unto the resurrection of life&quot;, a &quot;better resurrection&quot;, unto human perfection. These shall be installed as &quot;princes in all the earth&quot;. As visible representatives of their heavenly Life-giver and King, they will receive the heavenly judgments and will execute justice among all men. &quot;Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.&quot; (Isaiah 32:1; John 5: 28, 29; Psalm 45:16) For their faith and faithfulness toward God and his righteousness those men of old endured all manner of privations and hardships and afflictions at the hands of the religionists, &quot;not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection.&quot; Hence their installation in princely office on earth under the heavenly Theocracy gives added assurance that this will be an earth free from graft, boodle, oppression and conspiracy against the people's interests. — Hebrews 11:32-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With Christ Jesus and his faithful followers and joint heirs in the royalty of heavenly over-lordship over mankind, and with these faithful princes in office upon the cleansed earth, that world of justice and equity will indeed be a &quot;new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness&quot;. No democratic electioncampaigns, mud-slinging and expenses, and no revolutions will cause turmoil in that world. The Government that Jehovah God sets up &quot;shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever&quot;. And the people thereunder shall ever rejoice and be content. — Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That Government shall stand as a guardian against all fear. Militarism can and will be completely dispensed with, and no international police force needs to be maintained to enforce the decrees of the Government and to prevent some son of a religious organization from arising and acting as a &quot;sword of that religious sect&quot; and grabbing after dictatorship and world domination. Power politics, diplomacy, secret alliances and pacts, shall no more cause unsettlement between the peoples. With the battle of Armageddon all divisive national boundaries will be wiped out; all trade barriers and tariffs, all colonial exploitation, all racial prejudices, distinctions and inequalities, will be erased. There is no respect of persons with the King Christ Jesus; his salvation is for all good-will persons of all nationalities. Each and all must equally receive life as a gracious gift from him and become his children, the earthly human family of the Redeemer. It will be then as it is now within his true church; concerning which it is said: &quot;There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.&quot; — Colossians 3:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What a great aid unto love of man to man this will be! This will mean freedom from hate, which is murder. Love of man's neighbor, which is according to the second commandment, will be crowned by man's love of Jehovah God with all his heart, mind, strength and soul; which is according to the first and greatest commandment. Such love, perfected in man's heart, will cast out all fear; for fear has torment and has no place in the new world of freedom. — 1 John 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Satan, who is the 'father of lies', is bruised under the feet of the King at Armageddon, then his lies, which are the basis of religion, will cease with him. The period of free circulation of lies and religious blasphemies against God will have ended, and no lying by religious clergymen and their misinstructed parishioners will be permitted longer at large. Why not? Because lies bring men into bondage, whereas the world to come will be one of freedom. License to false testimonies and untruths will not be granted, but entire freedom of the speech of truth will exist. Traditions of men, of demons and of religion will have vanished before the revealing light of truth, and that truth is in the Word of God. His King, Christ Jesus, said: &quot;If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.&quot; (John 8: 31, 32) His judgment rule concerning the new world and its Theocratic Government reads: &quot;The fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.&quot; — Revelation 21:8, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The law which shall then be willingly and lovingly kept by the free people on earth is stated thus: &quot;These are the things that ye shall do: Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates.&quot; (Zechariah 8:16,17; Ephesians 4:25) The earth shall be filled with truth, and all ears will hear and all tongues speak it without censorship and suppression, and error shall blind no eyes. As the prophet has said: &quot;Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be FREE.&quot; (Isaiah 35: 5, 6, Douay) Religious schools and seminaries, &quot;science falsely so called,&quot; and all ignorance will be made impossible. In the &quot;battle of that great day of God Almighty&quot; he will rise up and make all creatures in existence know he is Jehovah and is supreme and is alone in the universal domination. &quot;For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; (Habakkuk 2:14, Am. Rev. Ver.) That knowledge means everlasting life to all who bathe in it and who are cleansed by it. The fear of the Universal Ruler and Builder of the &quot;world without end&quot; will be upon all humans, with this result: &quot;They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; —Isaiah 11:9, Am. Rev. Ver.; John 17:3.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>INSURANCE AGAINST DEATH AND GRAVE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Freedom from all unemployment problems will arrive with the New World. The divine mandate will be restated to men of good-will at the beginning of the thousand-year reign of Christ Jesus. Obediently these survivors of the battle of Armageddon will respond as did Noah's sons and their wives after the great flood, and they will have a part in carrying out the mandate to fill the earth with a righteous offspring. No need will then exist for a government &quot;social security&quot; program with insurance &quot;from the cradle to the grave&quot;. Those fulfilling the divine mandate will bring forth children in righteousness, but not for trouble nor with danger of death's invasion of the cradle. They will safely rear their children under healthful and righteous surroundings, &quot;in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.&quot; These continuing to walk in such admonition in joyful service to God and his King, they will not experience declining age or weight of years and totter at last into the grave. Their perfect obedience under test, and especially under the final test that arises for a time at Satan's short-term loosing, will insure them the reward of everlasting life in human perfection at the hands of the King, their &quot;Everlasting Father&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Peace.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Room for employment of all will be found in subduing the earth and making it everywhere a paradise; and the work of their hands will not be in vain, but shall remain. How grateful will be the freedom from the exhaustion due to present human imperfection! and all who actively serve God in faith and devotion will thus enjoy a perpetual sabbath, a jubilee without end. (Isaiah 65:17-25) The King, Christ Jesus, during his few days spent upon earth, healed all that sought him in faith. Now in heavenly Kingdom power, he will take care of the health of all his obedient and faithful subjects, his children, upon the earth, far beyond what any public health insurance program or subsidized medicine of any present government could offer or accomplish. The great Royal Physician, who died for the redemption of his subjects, will insure them full freedom from sickness, old age and death itself. By no plastic surgery or face lifting or other human expedients, but by the creative power which he had when God said to him, &quot;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,&quot; he will repair broken-down, imperfect, aging humankind and will rejuvenate them and build them up to the loveliness and strength of perpetual youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time that the King trod our earth as a man, he not only cured the sick, restored the crippled, and released the demonized, but also raised the dead. Under his Kingdom the fulfillment of the divine mandate will not overpopulate the earth; neither will it be beyond the Creator's power to command, &quot;Let more dry land appear.&quot; When the divine mandate has been carried out, which means also that paradise will be spread to the ends of the earth, then all the &quot;rest of the dead&quot; in the graves shall receive the benefits of the King's ransom sacrifice. Miracle-working power will restore such ones from the graves, and they &quot;shall come forth; . . . they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment&quot;. (John 5: 28, 29, Am. Rev. Ver.) They will be judged according to the works they then do on earth. Obedience will gain for them the healing, restorative, uplifting, perfecting ministrations of their King and Judge. At the end of the thousand years, when the great tempter is loosed for a little season, if they maintain their integrity during this heart-searching test, they shall live on, justification to everlasting life being then awarded them by their Judge. All those on earth who fail to retain their integrity toward God during that &quot;little season&quot; of final testing shall be punished with everlasting destruction, even as Satan also will. — Revelation 20: 5, 7-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fulfillment of the divine mandate and the resurrection of the earthly dead will not disturb or destroy the New World's complete freedom from want. No food problems will be caused thereby, and no permanent World Food Office or Commission will have to sit continually on the job and issue ration books and make allocations of food supplies to various sections of the earth. Under God's blessings the paradise earth will yield her increase. Want, famine, drought, blight, insect plagues and pestilences, yes, even the fear of such things, will never mar the earth again. Jehovah's kingdom by Christ is likened to an immovable mountain, and concerning the blessings it has begun to drop down in this day of Jehovah upon those who will be the free inhabitants of the New World divine prophecy declares:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering [of mourning] that covereth all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations. He hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord JEHOVAH will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for JEHOVAH hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is JEHOVAH; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.&quot; — Isaiah 25: 6-9, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Men of good-will&quot; now coming to the knowledge of the truth will not permit themselves to now be deceived into the wrong course. They will wait upon Jehovah God and his King Christ Jesus. The foregoing is no imaginary Utopia dreamed by some religious &quot;saint&quot;, but is God's written Word sworn to over His own name and is true. Accept and believe his Word now and let it henceforth be your life-guide and hope and comfort. If you do so, it means for you the gaining of the heritage of life everlasting and</span></p>
