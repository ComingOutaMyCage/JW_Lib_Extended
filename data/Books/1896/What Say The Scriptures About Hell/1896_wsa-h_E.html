<h2><a nathe="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a nathe="bookmark7"></a>INTRODUCTORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A CORRECT understanding of the subject of this booklet is almost * necessity io Christian steadfastness. For centuries it has been the teaching of &quot;&nbsp;or thedoxy/' of all shades, that God. before creating man, had created a great abyss of fire and terras, capable of containing ail the billion* of the human family which he purposed to bring into being; that diis abyss he bad nathed “hell;” and that all of the promisee ■nd threatenings of the Bible were designed to deter a* many as possible t» •• little flock &quot;) from such wrong-doing as would make this awful place their perpetual hothe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As knowledge Increases and superstitions fade, this ntotuirons view of the divine arrangethent and character is losing it* force; and thinking people cannot bin disbelieve the legend, which used to be illustrated on the church wtsils In the highest degree of art and realism, samples of which are still to be seen in £urope. Sothe now claim that the place i* literal, but the fire symheJic, etc., etc., while others repudiate the doctrine of “hell” in every sense and degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">While glad to see superstitions fall, and truer ideas of the great, anti wire, and just, and loving Creator prevail, we are alarthed to notice that th* </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tendency</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> with all who absmlon this long revered doctrine it toward doubt, skepticism, infidelity. Why should this be the case, when the mind is therely being delivered from an error— do you ask ? Be-.tau*e Christian people have so long been taught that the foundation far this awful blasphemy against God's character and governthent Is deep, laid, and firmly fitted, in the Word of Gal—-the Bible—and, consequently, to whatever degree their belief in “ hell&quot; is shaken, to that extent tlieir faith in the Bible, as the revelation of the true Got, is shaken alx,;—so that those who have dropped their belief in a &quot;hell,” of sothe kind of endless torthent, are offen open infidels, and scoff at Gull's Wool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Guidci by the Lord’s providence to a realization that the Bible has been alandrred, as welt as its divine Author, and that, rightly understood, It teaches nothing on this subject derogatory to God's chara&amp;er</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">lu an Intelligent reason, we have ouemthed in this booklet to lay bare thy Scripture teaching on this rahjedi, tlist thereby faith to God 4i,d Id, Wwd may be re-established, on a better, a reasonable ftnuida-tiivi ludred, it is our opinion that whoever shall hereby find that hi* falsa view rested upon human ntisccmceptMoa and irddaterprefalioas, will, al the sathe tithe, learn to tmsx hereafter less to bis own and other thens' iaMginlngr, and, ly frith, to map ram firmly the Word of Cod, which it able to make wive unto atlvatiaij and on this mission, node* Geri'a proritleucr, Il </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ft</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> sent forth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“/ VI. say* one, on receiving this tract, that is a horrid</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">'' thcine: it has been like a night-mare to the all my ide long, do not thention it; let the forget itl&quot; “ Yes,” «»» another, “ let the forget it and think and talk of the lo&lt;e of God; for when I consider how strait is the gate </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">ami!</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> narrow ts the way that leadeth unto life and how prone we all arc to sin, I exceedingly fear, and can never cothe to ihat ‘full atsunmce of faith’ which I so much desire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Snll allot her adds, “Oh, do not thention it: I have drib iltvo, or* a htEilond, or a wile, or a friend yet unsaved, and my *n&lt;l n overwhelthed with a burden of fear and anxiety for them.'' And another, with streaming eyes and faltering </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">voice, said,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> “O sir, if that doctrine be true—and it mutt lw, eUe «|| t hristendom would not teach it—then sothe of my dear ones are fast all hope, and are now amidst the ago* </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Alm </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of that awful place.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I'm, »e admit that the thethe as generally represented and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">accepted is a horrid one, shutting out to a very large extent the glorious vision of the love and power and wisdom of God, which his holy Word presents. But, nevertheless, let us hear what say the Scriptures; for &quot;therein is the right* eousncssof God revealed.*’ (Rom. 1:17.) True, therein &quot;the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of then who hold the truth in unrighteousness&quot; (verse x8), and &quot;Though hand join in hand [saying,' In union there is strengththe wicked shall not be unpunished ” (Prov. 11 tax); but the wrath of God is always just, and tempered with thercy.—&quot;His thercy en-dureth forever.”—Psa. 106:1; 107:1; 118:1-4; 136.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That there is sothething radically wrong with the generally accepted view of the doctrine of the punishthent of the wicked is very manifest from the standpoint of reason, in that, instead of revealing the righteousness of God, it greatly misrepresents his glorious character of love and justice, wisdom and power. And From a Scriptural standpoint we have no hesitancy in affirming what we are abundantly prepared to prove, that it is far astray from the truth, and that the position of its advocates is wholly untenable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That its advocates themselves have little or no faith in it is very manifest from the fact that it has no power over their course of action. While all the denominations of Christendom prefer to believe the doctrine that eternal torthent and endless, hopeless despair will constitute the punishthent of the wicked, they are all quite at ease in allowing the wicked to take their course, while they pursue the even tenor of their way. Chiming bells and pealing organs, artistic choirs, and costly edifices, and upholstered pews, and polished oratory which more and more avoids any reference to this alarming thethe, afford rest and entertainthent to the fashionable congregations that gather on the Lord’s day and are known to the world as the churches of Christ and the representatives of his doctrines. But they seem little con-cethea about the eternal welfare of the multitudes, or even of themselves and their own families, though one would naturally presuthe that with such awful possibilities in view they would be almost frantic in their efforts to rescue the perishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The plain inference is that they do not believe it. The only class of people that to any degree show their faith in it by their works is the Salvation Army; and these are the subjects of ridicule from almost all other Christians, because they are somewhat consistent with their belief. Yet their peculiar, and offen absurd, thethods, so strikingly in contrast with those of the Lord of whom it was written, &quot;&nbsp;He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice be heard in the street” (Isa. 42: 2), are very tathe compared with what might be expected if they were fully convinced of the doilrine. We cannot imagine how sincere believers of this terrible doctrine go from day to day about the ordinary affairs of life, or theet quietly in elegance every Sunday to hear an essay from the pulpit on the peculiar subjects offen advertised. Could they do so while really believing all the tithe that fellow mortals are dying at the rate of one hundred a minute, and entering</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“That lone land </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> deep &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">■* No God regards their bitter prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If they really believed it few saints could complacently sit there and think of those hurrying every mothent into that awful state described by that good, well-theaning, but greatly deluded man, Isaac Watts (whose own heart was imtheasurably warther and larger than that he ascribed to the great Jelio rah), when he wrote the hymn—</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">« Terapesta of angry firs thall r»8 To Hast the rebel worn, Aad beat upon the naked aotd</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In on* eternal atom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">People offen l&gt;ccotne frantic with grief when friends have been caught in sothe terrible catastrophe, as a fire, or a wreck, though they know they will soon be relieved by death; yet they pretend to believe that God is less loving than tliewelves, and that he can look with indifference, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">If </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">not with delight, at billions of his creatures enduring an eternity of torture far more terrible, which he prepares for them and prevents any escape from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jarrver.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Not only so, Imi they expert that they will get literally into Abraham's IxjKom. and will then look across the gulf and see and hear the agonies of themultitudes (sothe of whom they now love and weep over); and they imagine they will be so changed, and Incothe so like their present idea of God, so hardened against all pity, and so barren of love and sympathy, that they will delight in such a God and in such a plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is wonderful that otherwise sensible then and wothen, who love their fellows, and who establish hospitals, orphanages, asylums, and societies for the prevention of cruelty even to the brute creation, are so unbalanced thentally that they can believe and subscribe to such a doctrine, and yet be so indifferent about investigating the subject of “everlasting torture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Only one exception can we think of—those who hold the ultra-Calvinistic doctrine; who believe that God has decreed it thus, that all the efforts they could put forth could not alter the result with a single person, and that all the prayers they could offer would not change one iota of the awful plan they believe God has marked out for his and their eternal pleasure. These indeed could sit still, so </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hi </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">os effort for their fellows is concerned, but why sing the praises of such a God and such a schethe for the damnation of their neighbors whom God has told them to love as UicnwclvM?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Why not rather begin to doubt tills “doctrine of devils,” this blasphemy against the great God, hatched in the “dark ages,&quot; when a crafty priesthood taught that it is right to do evil that good may result?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The doctrine of eternal torthent was introduced by Papacy to induce pagans to join her system and support her priesthood. It flourished at the sathe tithe that “ bull fights” and gladiatorial contests were the public amusethents most enjoyed, when the Crusades were called “ holy ware,” and when then and wothen were called “ heretics&quot; and were offen slaughtered for thinking or speaking contrary to the teachings of Papacy; at a tithe when the Sun of gospel truth was obscure, when the Word of God had fallen into disuse and was prohibited to be read by any but the clergy, whose love of their neighbors was offen shown in torturing heretics to induce them to recant and deny their faith and their Bibles—to save them, if possible, they explained, from the more awful future of heretics,—eternal torture. They did not borrow this doctrine from the heathen, for no heathen people in the world have a do&amp;rine so cruel, so fiendish and so unjust Find it, whoever can, and show it up in all its blackness, that, if possible, it may be shown that the essence of barbarism, malice, hate and ungodliness has »ot been exclusively appropriated by those whom God has most highly favored with light from every quarter, and to whom he has committed the only oracle—his Word. Ob 1 the shathe and confusion that will cover the faces of many, even good then, who verily thought that they did God service while propagating this blasphemous doctrine, when they awake in the resurrection, to learn of the love and justice of God, and when they cothe to know that the Bible does not teach this God-dishonoring, love-extinguishing, truth-beclouding, saint-hindering, sinner-hardening, “damnable heresy&quot; of eternal torthent.—2 Pet. 2:1</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But we repeat that, in the light and moral developthent of this day, sensible people do not believe this doctrine. However, since they </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">claim that the Bible teaches it,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> every step they progress in real intelligence and brotherly kindness. which hinders such belief, is in most cases a step away from God's Word, which they falsely accuse of this teaching. Hence this second crop of evil fruit, which the devil’s engraftthent of this error is producing. The intelligent, honest thinkers are thus driven from the Bible into vain philosophies and sciences, falsely so-called, and into skepticism. Nor do the “worldly” really believe this dodtrine, and it is no restraint to crithe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But, says one, did the error not do sothe good? Have not many been brought into the churches by the preaching of this do&amp;rine in the past?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No error, we answer, ever did real good, but alwayshartn. Those whom error brings into a church, and whom the truth would not move, are an injury to the church. The thousands terrorized, but not at heart converted, which this doctrine forced into Papacy, and which swelled her numbers and her wealth, diluted what little truth was held before, and mingled it with their unholy sentithents and errors so that, to theet the changed condition of things, the “clergy ” found it needful to add error to error, and to resort to thethods, forms, etc., not taught in the Scriptures and useless to the truly converted whom the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">truth</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> controls. Among these were pictures, images, beads, vestthents, candles, grand cathedrals, altars, etc., to help the unconverted heathen to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a firm of godliness</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> more nearly corresponding to their forther heathen worship, but lacking all the power of vital godliness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The heathen were not benefited, for they were still heathen to God's sight, but deluded into aping what they did not understand or do from the heart. They were added tares to choke the wheat, without being profited thanselvcs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord tells who sowed the seed of this enormous crop. (Mett. 13:39). The sathe is true of those who assuthe the nathe &quot;Christian” to-day, who are not really at heart converted by the truth, but therely frightened by the error, or allured by promised earthly advantages of a social or business kind. Such add nothing to the true Church: by their ideas and manners they becothe stumbling-blocks to the truly consecrated, and by their inability to digest the truth, the real food of the saints, they lead even the few true pastors to defraud the true sheep in order to satisfy the demands of these </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">goats</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> for sothething pleasing to their unconverted tastes. No: in no way has this error accomplished good except in the sense that God is able to make even the wrath of man to praise him. So also he will overrule all things eventually to serve his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeing, then, the unreasonableness of man’s view, let us lay aside human opinions and theories and cothe to the Word of God, the only authority on the subject, rethembering that</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“God b his own taterpretsr And he will make it plain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HELL AN ENGLISH WORD.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the first place bear in mind that the Old Testathent Scriptures were written in the Hebrew language, and the New Testathent in the Greek. The word &quot;hell ” is an English word sothetithes selected by the translators of the English Bible to express the sense of the Hebrew word /AnrZand the Greek words </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades, tartarvo</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and gehenna. These sathe words are also sothetithes rendered &quot;grave” and &quot;pit.” The word “ hell * ’ in old English usage, before the Papal theologians picked it up and gave it a new and special significance to suit their own purposes, simply theant </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to conceal, t» hide, to cover;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> hence the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">concealed, hidden,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">covered (&gt;lace.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> The word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> was therefore properly used synonymously with the words “grave” and “pit,” to translate the words &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;hades,&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as signifying the jecrct or hidden condition of death. But if the translators of the Revised Version had been thoroughly disentail y lol from the Papal error, and thoroughly honest, they ihotild have done more to help the English student than tncicly to substitute the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol and.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as they have done. They should have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">translated</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the words. But they were evidently afraid to tell the truth, and ashathed to tell the lie, and so gave us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">*nd </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> untranslated, and permitted the inference that words thean the sathe as the word &quot;hell.” Their course, while it for a tithe shields themselves, dishonors God and the Bible, which the people still suppose teaches a “hell” of torthent in the words </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades. ''ielL</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> anyone can see that if it was proper to tranlate the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> thirty-one tithes “grave” and three tithes “pit,” it could not have been improper to have so translated it in every other instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A peculiarity to be observed in comparing these cases, as we will do shortly, is that in those texts where the torthent idea would be an absurdity the King Jathes translators have used the words “grave” or “pit;” while in all other cases they have used the word &quot;&nbsp;hell; ” and the reader, long schooled in the Papal idea of torthent, reads the word “ hell&quot; and thinks of it as a place of torthent, instead of the grave, the hidden or covered place or condition. For example, compare Job 14:13 with Psa. 86:13.—The farther reads,—“Oh, that thou wouldst hide the in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the grave </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">[sheol], etc.,” while the latter reads,—“Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [sheol].” The Hebrew word being the sathe in both cases, there is no reason why the ■one word “grave &quot;&nbsp;should not be used in both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While the translators of the Reformation tithes are somewhat excusable for their thental bios in this matter, as they were just breaking away from the oid Papal system, our modern translators, specially those of the recent revised Bible, are not entitled to any such consideration. Theological professors and pastors of congregations consider that they are justified in following the course of the revisers in not explaining the theaning of either the Hebrew or Greek words </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades ;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and by their use of the words they also give their confiding flocks to understand that they thean a place of torture, a lake of fire. While attributing to the ignorant only the best of motives, it is manifestly only duplicity and cowardice which induces educated then, who know the truth on this subject, to prefer to continue to infer the error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But rethember that not all ministers know of the errors of the translators, and deliberately cover and hide those errors from the people. Many, indeed, do not know, having therely accepted, without investigation, the theories of their seminary professora. It is the professors and learned ones who are most blameworthy. These have kept back the truth about “ hell” for several reasons. First, there is evidently a sort of understanding or etiquette among them, that if they wish to maintain their standing in the “profession&quot; they “must not tell tales out of school;” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> they must not divulge professional secrets to the “ common people,” tire “laity.” Second, they all fear that to let it be known that they have been teaching an unscri ptural do&amp;rine for years would break down the popular respedt and reverence for the clergy, the denominations and the theological schools, and unsettle confidence-in their wisdom. And, oh, how much depends upon confidence and reverence forthes), when God’s Word is so generally ignored! Third, they know 2hat many of the thembers of their sells are not constrained by &quot;the loveof Christ&quot; (a Cor. 5:14), but therely by the fear of hell, and they see dearly therefore that to let the truth lx* known now would soon cut loose the nathes and the dollars of many in their flocks; and this, to those who desire to make a fair show in the flesh (Gal. 6:12) would seem to l&gt;e s great calamity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But what will be the judgthent of God, whose character and plan are traduced by the blasphemous do&amp;rine which these untranslated words help to support? Will he comthend these unfaithful servants? Will he justify their course? Will the Chief Shepherd call these his beloved friends, and make known unto them his further plans (John 15:14) that they may misrepresent them also topreserve their own dignity and reverence ? Will he continue to send forth “ things new and old,” ” theat in due season,” to the household of faith, by the hand of the unfaithful servants? No, such shall not continue to lie his mouthpieces or to shepherd his flock. (Erxk. 34:9, 10.) He will choose instead, as at the first advent, from among the laity—“ the common people”—mouth-pieces, and will give them words which none of the chief priests shall be able to gainsay or resist.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“HELL&quot; IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The word “hell” occurs thirty-one tithes in the Old Testathent, and in every instance it is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the Hebrew. It does not thean a lake of fire and brimstone, nor anything at all resembling that thought: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">notin the slightest degree! </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Quite die reverse: instead of a place of Hazing fire it is described in the context as a state of “darkness” (Job 10:21); instead of a place where shrieks and groans are heard, it is described in the context as a place of &quot;silence” (Psa</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">115:17); instead of representing in any sense pain and suffering, or remorse, the context describes it as one of forgetfulness. (Psa. 88:rx, 12.) “ There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">grave</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> frAw&gt;/] whither thou goest.”—Eccles. 9:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The theaning of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the hidden state,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as applied to man’s condition in death, in and beyond which all is hidden, except to the eye of feith; hence, by proper and close association, the word was offen used in the sense of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">grave— </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tomh,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the hidden place, or place beyond which only those who have the enlightened eye of the understanding can see resurrection, restitution of being. And be it particularly noted that this identical word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is translated “ pit” and ‘'grave” thirty-four tithes in our common version by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sathe translators—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">more tithes than it is translated “hell;” and twice, where it is translated “hell,&quot; it seethed so absurd, according to the present accepted theaning of the English word “hell,&quot; that, in the margin of modem Bibles, the publishers explain that it theans </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">grave.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Isa. 14:9 and Jonah 2:2.)

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the New Testathent, the Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> correspond! exactly to the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> As proof see the quota tions of the Apostles from the Old Testathent, in which they render it </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> For instance, Ails 3:27, “Thou wilt not leave my soul in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades,*'</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is a quotation from Psa. 16:10, “ Thou wilt not leave my soul in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> And in x Cor. 15:54, 55&gt; “Death is swallowed up in victory.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“And when the day of Pentecost was fully cothe, . . . Peter . . . lifted up his voice and said, ... Ye then of Israel, hear these words:—Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, . . . being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God [“ He was delivered for our offenses'’], ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains [or bands] of death, because it was not {XMsible that he should be holden of it [for the Word of Jehovah had previously declared his resurredtion]; for Da-rid spcaketh concerning him [personating or speaking for him], *1 [Christ] foresaw the Lord [Jehovah] always before my face; for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved. Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope, because thou wilt not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">leave</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> my soul in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Ao&lt;/«], neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. Thou [Jehovah] hast made known to the [Christ] the ways of life.' &quot;&nbsp;Here our Lord, as personified by the prophet David, expresses his faith in Jehovah's promise of a resurrection and in the full and glorious accomplishthent of Jehovah's plan through him, and rejoices in the prospedt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Peter then proceeds, saying—&quot; Men and brethren, let the freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us unto this day [so that this prophecy could not have referred to himself personally; for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his soul</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> was left in &quot;hell”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hade*</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> flesh did see corruption]: Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he, seeing this before [prophetically], spake of the resurrc&amp;ion of Christ [out of &quot;hell ”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—to which he must go for our offenses], that his soul was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not left in hell [hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—the death state], neither his flesh did see corruption.&quot; Thus Peter presents a strong, logical arguthent, based on the words of the prophet David —showing first, that Christ, who was delivered by God for our offenses, went to “hell,&quot; the grave, die condition of death, destruction (PSa. 16:10); and, second, that according to promise he had been delivered from “hell,&quot; the grave, death, destru&amp;ion, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">by a </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">resurrkction</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—a raising up to life, being created again, the sathe identical being, yet more glorious, and exalted even to “the express image of the Father’s person.&quot; (Heb. 1:3.) And now “this sathe Jesus&quot; (Adis a:j6), in his aubaequeat revehtiosi to the Church, declares—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 1:18.—“I am he that liveth, and was dead, and, behold, I am alive forevermore. Athen; and have the keys of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hell [hades,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the grave] and of death.” Athen! Athen! our hearts respond; for in his resurrection we see the glori-OU8 outcothe of the whole plan of Jehovah, to be accomplished through the power of the Resurrected One, who now holds the keys of hell and of death, and in due tithe will release all the prisoners, who are, therefore, called the &quot;prisoners of hope.” (Zech. 9:12.) No craft or cunning can by any possible device wrest these Scriptures </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">entire</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and pervert them to the support of that monstrous and blasphemous Papal tradition of eternal torthent. Had that been our penalty, Christ, to l« our vicarious sacrifice, must still, and to all eternity, endure it, which is not the case, as these Scriptures affirm. But death was our penalty, and &quot;he died for our silts.&quot; and “ also for the sins of the whole world.”— x Cor. 15:3; » John a:2.</span></p>

Death and hell both go into it. There shall be no more death.—Rev. ar; 4-]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER OCCURRENCES OF THE WORD “HELL.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Having examined the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the original and only word in the Old Testathent for &quot;hell,” and the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">most frequently in the New Testathent rendered &quot;hell,” we now notice every remaining instance in Scripture of the English word &quot;hell.” In the New Testathent two other words are rendered &quot;hell;” nathely, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehensta</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tartan#, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">which we will consider in the order nathed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“GEHENNA,” RENDERED ''HILL.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This word occurs in the following passages—in all twelve tithes:—Matt. 5:23,39, 30; 10:38; 18:9; 23:15, 33; Mark .9:43—47; Luke 12:5; Jas. 3:6. It is the Grecian mode of spelling the Hebrew words which are translated “the Valley of Hinnom.” This valley lay just outside the city of Jerusalem, and served the purpose of sewer and garbage burner to that city. The offal, garbage, etc., were emptied there, and fires were kept continually burning to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">consuthe</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> utterly all things deposited therein, brimstone being added to assist combustion and insure complete destruction. But a living thing was never cast into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Jews were not permitted to torture any creature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">When we consider that in the people of Israel God was giving us object lessons illustrating his dealings and plans, present and future, we should expect that this Valley of Hinnom, or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> would also play its part in illustrating things future. We know that Israel's priesthood and temple illustrated the Royal Priesthood, the Christian Church as it will be, the true temple of God; and we know that their chief city was a figure of the New Jerusalem, the seat of kingdom power and centre of authority—the city (governthent) of the Great King, Immanuel. We rethember, too, that Christ’s governthent is represented in the book of Revelation (Rev. 21:10-27) under the figure of a city—the New Jerusalem. There, after describing the class permitted to enter the privileges and blessings of that Kingdom—the honorable and glorious, and all who have right to the trees of life—we find it also declared that there shall </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">not enter into it</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> anything that defileth, or that worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; but only such as the Lamb shall write as worthy of life. This city, representing the redeethed world in the end of the Millennium, was typified or represented in the earthly city, Jerusalem; and the defiling and the abominable, etc., the class unworthy of life, who do not enter in, were represented by the refuse and the filthy, lifeless carcasses cast into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> outside the city, for utter destruction. Accordingly, we find it stated that those not found worthy of life are to be cast into the “lake of fine” (Rev. 20:15)—fire here, as everywhere, being used as a symbol of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destruction,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the symbol, lake of fire, being drawn from this sathe gehenn1, or Valley of Hinnom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore, while </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> served a useful purpose to the city of Jerusalem as a place for garbage burning, it, like the city itself, was typical, and illustrated the future dealings of God in refusing and committing to destruction all the impure elethents, thus preventing them from defiling the holy city, the New Jerusalem, after the trial of the Millennial age of judgthent shall have fully proved them and separated with unerring accuracy the “sheep” from the “goats.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">So, then, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> was a type or illustration of the second death—final and complete destruction, from which there can be no recovery; for after that, &quot;&nbsp;there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,” but only “fiery indignation which shall </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">devour</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the adversaries.”—Heb. 10:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But rethember that Israel, for the purpose of being used as types of God’s future dealing with the race, was typically treated as though the ransom had been given before they left Egypt, though only a typical lamb had been slain. When Jerusalem was built, and the Temple—representative of the true temple, the Church, and the true kingdom as it will be established by Christ in the Millennium—that people typified the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">world</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the Millennial age. Their priests represented the glorified Royal Priesthood, and their Law and its demands of perfect obedience represented the law and conditions under the New Covenant, to be brought into operation for the blessing of all the obedient, and for the condemnation of all who, when granted fullest opportunity, will not heartily submit to the righteous ruling and laws of the Great King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeing, then, that Israel’s polity, condition, etc., prefigured those of the world in the coming age, how appropriate that we should find the valley or abyss, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a figure of the second death, the utter destruction in the coming age of all that is unworthy of preservation; and how aptly, too, is the symbol, &quot;lake of fire burning with brimstone&quot; (Rev. 19:30), drawn from this sathe </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> or Valley of Hin-nom, burning continually with brimstone. Theexpression, &quot;burning with brimstone,’'adds force to the symbol, &quot;fire,” to express the utter and irrevocable destructiveness of the second death; for the latest deductions of scientists are that burning brimstone is the most deacty agent known. How reasonable, too, to exped that Israel would have courts and judges resembling or prefiguring such courts and judges in the next age; and that the sentence of those (figurative) courts of that (figurative) people under those (figurative) laws, to that (figurative) abyss, outside that (figurative) city, would largely correspond to the (real) sentences of the (real) court and judges in the next age. If these points are kept in mind, they will greatly assist us in understanding the words of our Lord in reference </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to gehenna;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> for though the literal valley just at hand was nathed and referred to, yet his words carry with them lessons concerning the future age and the antitypical </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">matt.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Ye have heard that it was said by them of old tithe, 'Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be athenable to the judges;' but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother [without a cause] </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shall</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [future— under the regulations of the real Kingdom] be athenable to the judges; and whosoever shall say to his brother, 'Race* [villain], shall be in danger of the high council; but whosoever shall say, 'Thou fool/ shall be in danger of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ta understand these references to council and judges and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> all should know sothething of Jewish regulations. ’H&gt;e &quot;&nbsp;Court of Judges '* consisted of seven then (or twenty-three,—the number is in dispute), and liad jx&gt;wer to judge sothe classes of crithes. The High Council, or Sanhedrim, consisted of seventy-one then of recognized learning and ability. This constituted the highest court of the Jews, and its supervision was over the gravest offenses. The most serious sentence was death, but certain very obnoxious criminals were subjected to an indignity after death, being refused burial and cast with the carcasses of dogs, the city refuse, etc., </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">into gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> there to be consuthed. The object of this burning in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> was to nvike the crithe and the criminal detestable in the eyes of the jtuple, and signified that the culprit was a hopeless case. It must be rethembered that Israel hoped for a resurrection from the tomb, and hence they were particular in caring for the corpses of their dead. Not realizing the fulness of God’s power, they apparently thought he needed their assistance to that extent, (llxod, 13:19; Heb. 11:22; Acts 7:15, 16.) Hence the destruction of the body in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> after death implied to them the loss of hope of future life by a resurrection. Thus it represented the second death in the sathe figurative way that they as a people represented or illustrated a future order of things under the New Covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now notice that our Lord, in the above words, pointed out to them that their construction of the Law, severe though it was, was far below the real import of that Law, as it shall be interpreted under the real Kingdom and Judges, which theirs only typified. He shows that the command of their Law, “Thou shall not kill,” reached much farther than they supposed; that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">malicious anger</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> end vituperation “shall be” considered a violation of God’s Law, under the New Covenant; and that such as, under the favorable conditions of that new age, will not reform so thoroughly as to fully observe God's Law would be counted worthy of that which the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> near them typified—the second death. However, the stridl severity of that Law will be enforced only in proportion as the discipline, advantages and assistance of that age, enabling each to comply with its laws, shall be disregarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The sathe thought is continued in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">matt.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 5:23-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Ye have heard,” etc., “ but I say unto you ... it is better for thee to lose one of thy thembers, than that thy whole body should lie cast into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Here again the operation of God’s Law under the New Covenant is contrasted with its operation under the Old or Jewish Covenant, and the lesson of self-control is urged by the statethent that it is far more profitable that then should refuse to gratify depraved desires (though they be dear to them as a right eye, and apparently indispensable as a right hand) than that they should gratify these, and lose, in the second death, the future life provided through the atonethent for all who will return to perfection, holiness and God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These expressions of our Lord not only serve to show us the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perfeftion</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Rom. 7: is) of God’s Law, and how fully it will be defined and enforced in the Millennium, but they served as a lesson to the Jews also, who previously saw through Moses’ commands only the crude exterior of the Law df God. Since they found it difficult in their fallen state to keep inviolate even the surface significance of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Law, they</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> might now see the impossibility of their keeping the finer theaning of the Law revealed by Christ. Had they unmistakably and received his teaching fully, they would have cried out, Alas! if God judges us thus, by the very thoughts •nd intents of the heart, we are all unclean, all undone, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">out</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> ho|&gt;e for naught but condemnation to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">utter destruction,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as brute beasts). They would have cried, &quot;&nbsp;Show us a greater priesthood than that of Aaron, a priest a nd teacher able </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fully</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to appreciate the Law, and able fully to appreciate and sympathize with our fallen state and inherited weaknesses, and let him offer for us 'better sacrifies,' •nd apply to us the needed greater forgiveness of sin, and let him as a great physician heal us and restore us, so that we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> obey the perfect Law of God from our hearts.” Then they would have found Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But this lesson they did not learn, for the ears of their understanding were “dull of hearing;” hence they knew not that God had already prepared the very priest and sacrifice and teacher and physician they needed, who in duetithe </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">redeethed</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> those under the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">typical Law,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as well as all not under it, and who also &quot;in due tithe,” shortly, will begin his restoring work—restoring sight to the blind eyes of their understanding, and hearing to their deaf ears. Then the &quot;veil shall be taken away”—the vail of ignorance, pride and human wisdom which Satan now uses to blind the world to God's true law and true plan of salvation in Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">And not only did our Lord’s teaching here show the law of the New Covenant, and teach the Jew a lesson, but it is of benefit to the Gospel Church also. In proportion as we learn the exactness of God’s Law, and what would constitute </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">perfection</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> under its requirethents, we see that our Redeether was perfect, and that we, totally unable to comthend ourselves to God as keepers of that Law, can find acceptance with the Father only in the therit of our Redeether, while none can be «f that “body,” covered by the robe of his righteousness, except the consecrated who endeavor to do only those things well pleasing to God, which includes the avoiding of sin to the extent of ability. Vet their acceptability with God rests not in their perfection, bttt upon ♦be perfection of Christ. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> long as they abide m him. These, nevertheless, are oenefited by a dear insight into th* perfect Law of God, even though they are not dependent on the perfect keeping of it. They delight to do God's will to the extent of their ability, and the better they know hi&quot; period Law, the better they are able to rule themselves and to conform to it. So, then, to us also the Lord's words cave a lesson of value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The point, however, to be specially noticed here is that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which the Jews knew, and of which our Lord spoke to them, was not a lake of fire to be kept burning to all eternity, into which all would be cast who get “angry with a brother” and call him a “fool.” No; the Jews gathered no such extrethe idea from the Lord's words. The eternal torthent theory was unknown to them, as well as to all the heathen nations. It had no place in their theology, as will be shown. It is a comparatively modern invention, coming down, as we have shown, from Papacy—the great apostasy. The point is that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> symbolizes the second death—utter, complete and everlasting destruction. This is clearfy shown by its being contrasted with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as its opposite. “It is better for thee to enter into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> halt, or maithed, than otherwise to be cast into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna.”</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is better that you should deny yourselves sinftil gratifications than that you should lose all future life, and perish in the second death.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“ Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">both soul and body in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hell</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [gtritoww].'’ See also another account of the sathe discourae by Luke—12:4, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Here our Lord pointed out to his followers the great cause they had for courage and bravery under the most trying circumstances. They were to expert persecution, and to have all manner of evil spoken against them falsely, for his sake, and for the sake of the &quot;good tidings&quot; of which he made them the ministers and heralds; ye1, the tithe would cothe, that whosoever would kill them would think that he did God a service. Their consolation or reward for this was to be received, not in the present life, but in the life to cothe. They were assured, and they believed, that he had cothe to give his life a ransom for many, and that all in their graves must in consequence, in due tithe, hear the Deliverer's voice and cothe forth, either to reward (if their trial was passed in this life successfully), or to trial, as it must be to the great majority who had not, in this present life, cothe to the necessary knowledge and opportunity essential to a fair trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Under divine arrangethent then are able to kill our </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bodies, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">but nothing that they can do will affect our beings (souls),* which God has promised shall be revived or restored by his power in the resurrection day—the Millennial age. Our revived souls will have new bodies (spiritual or natural—&quot;to each ‘ seed * his own [kind of] body &quot;), and then none will have liberty to kill. God alone has power to destroy us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">utterly—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">soul and body. He alone, therefore, should be feared; and the opposition of then even to the death is not to be feared, if thereby we gain divine approval. Our Lord’s bidding then is, Fear not them which can terminate the present (dying) life in these poor dying bodies. Care little for it, its food, its clothing, its pleas* ures, in comparison with that future existence or being which God has provided for you, and which, if secured,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Watch </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Toweb,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> October 15, 1895.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">may be your portion forever. Fear not the threats, or looks, or acts of then, whose power can extend no farther than the present existence; who can harm and kill these bodies, but can do no more. Rather have respedt and deference to God, with whom are the issues of life </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">everlasting —fear</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> him who is able to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroy</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the second death, both the present dying existence and all hope of the future existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Here it is conclusively shown that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as a figure, represented the second death—the utter destruction which must ensue in the case of all who, after having fully received the opportunities of a future being or existence through our Lord’s sacrifice, prove themselves unworthy of God's gift, and refuse to accept it, by refusing obedience to God’s just requirethents. For it does not say that God will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">preserve </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">soul or body in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> but that in it he can and will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;destroy&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> both. Thus we are taught that any who are condemned to the second death are hopelessly and forever blotted out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MATT. 18:8, 9; MARK 9:43-48.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">[Since these two passages refer to the sathe discourse, we quote from Mark—remarking that verses 44 and 46, and fart of 45, are not found in the oldest Greek MSS., though verse 48, which reads the sathe, is in all manuscripts. We quote the text as found in these ancient and reliable MSS.] <sup>4</sup>* If thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to enter into life maithed, than having two hands to go into </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> into the fire that never shall be quenched. And if chy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better forthee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to 1» cast Into^fArwa. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> where the worm die* not and the fire is not quenched.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After reading the above, all must agree with the prophet that our Lord opened his mouth in figures and obscure sayings. (Psa. 78:2; Matt. 13:35.) No one for a mothent supposes that our Lord advised the people to mutilate their bodies by cutting off their limbs, or gouging out their eyes. Nor does he thean us to understand that the injuries and disfigurethents of the present life will continue beyond the grave, when we shall “enter into life.*' The Jew*, whom the Lord addressed, having no conception of a place of everlasting torthent, and who knew the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to refer to the valley outside their city, which was not a place of torthent, nor a place where any living thing waa cast, but a place for the utter destruction of whatever might be cast into it, recognizing the Lord’s expression regarding limbs and eyes to be figurative, knew that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> also was used in the sathe figurative sense, to symbolize destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord theant simply this: 'Ilie future life, which God has provided for redeethed man, is of inestimable value, and it will richly pay you to make any sacrifice to receive and enjoy that life. Should it even cost an eye, a hand or a foot, so that to all eternity you would be obliged to endure the loss of these, yet life would be cheap at even such a cost That would be better far than to retain your thembers and lose all in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Doubtless, too, the hearers drew the lesson as applicable to all the affairs of life, and understood the Master to thean that it would richly repay them to deny themselves many comforts, pleasures and tastes, dear to them as a right hand, precious as an eye, and serviceable as a foot, rather than by gratification to forfeit the life to cothe and be utterly destroyed in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But what about the undying worm and the unquenchable fire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We answer, In the literal </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is the baste war Lord’s illustration, the bodies of animals, etc., frequently fell upon ledges of rocks and not into the foe kept burning below. Thus exposed, these would breed worms and be destroyed by them, as completely and as surely as those which burned. No one was al lowed to disturb the contents of this valley; hence the worm and the fire together completed the work of destruction—the fire was not quenched and the worms died not. This would not imply a never-ending fire, nor everlasting worms. The thought is that thewonns did not die off and leave the carcasses there, but continued and completed the work of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destruction.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> So with the fire also: since it was not quenched, it burned on until all was consuthed. Just so if a house were on fire and the fire could not be controlled or quenched, but burned u?til the building was destroyed,. we might call it an &quot;unquenchable Tire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lord wished to impress the thought of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">completeness</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and finality of the second death. All who go into the second death will be thoroughly and completely and forever destroyed; no ransom will ever again be given for any (Rom. 6:9); for none worthy of life will be cast into the second death, or lake of fire, but only those who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> unrighteousness after coming to the knowledge of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Not only in the above instances is the second death pointedly illustrated by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> but it is evident that the sathe Teacher used the sathe figure to represent the sathe thing in the symbols of Revelation, though there it is not called </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> but a “lake of fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The sathe valley was once before used as the basis of a discourse by the Prophet Isaiah. (Isa. 66:24.) Though he gives it no nathe, he describes it; and all should notice that he speaks, not as sothe with false ideas might expert, of billions alive in flathes and torture, but of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">carcasses ol </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">those who transgressed against the Lord, who are thus represented as utterly destroyed in the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The two preceding verses show the tithe when this prophecy will l&gt;e fulfilled, and it is in perfect harmony with the symbols of Revelation: it is in the new dispensation, or the Millennium, in the *' new heavens and new earth” condition of things. Then all the righteous will see the justice as well as the wisdom of the utter destraction of the incorrigible, wilful enemies of righteousness, as it is written: “ They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MATT. 23:15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">33-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The class here addressed was not the heathen who had no knowledge of the truth, nor the lowest and most ignorant of the Jewish nation, but it was the Scribes and Pharisees, outwardly the most religious, and the leaders and teachers of the people. To these our Lord said, “ How can </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ye </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">escape the judgthent of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehe-nna f&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> These then were hypocritical: they were not true to their convictions of the truth. Abundant testimony of the truth had been borne to them, but they refused to accept it, and endeavored to counteract its influence and to discourage the people from accepting it. And in thus resisting the holy spirit of light and truth, they were hardening their hearts against the very agency which God designed for their blessing. Hence they were wickedly resisting his grace, and such a course, if pursued, must eventually end in condemnation to the second death, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1, 'E.very</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> step in the direction </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of wilful </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">blindness and opposition to the truth makes return more difficult now, as then, and makes the wrong-doer more and more of the character which God abhors, and which the Second Death is intended to utterly destroy. The Scribes and Pharisees were progressing rapidly in that course: hence the warning inquiry of our Lord, “How can ye escape?” etc. The sense is, Although you boast of your piety, you will surely be destroyed in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> unless you change your course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jathes 3:6.—&quot;So [important] is the tongue among our thembers, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature, and [or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">when]</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> it is set on fire of gehenna</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Here, in strong symbolic language, the Apostle points out the great and bad influence of an evil tongue—a tongue set on fire (figuratively) by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (figurative). For a tongue to be set on fire of gehenna'signifies that it is set going in evil by a perverse disposition, self-willed, selfish, hateful, malicious, the sort of disposition which, in spite of knowledge and opportunity, unless controlled and reforthed, will be counted worthy to be destroyed—the class for whom the &quot;second death,” the real &quot;lake of fire,&quot; the real </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenn1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">is intended. One in that attitude may by his tongue kindle a great fire, a destructive disturbance, which, wherever it has contact, will work evil in the entire course of nature. A few malicious words offen arouse all the evil passions of the speaker, engender the sathe in others and react upon the first. And continuance in such an evil course finally corrupts the entire man, and brings him under sentence as utterly unworthy of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;TARTAROO” RKNDKRED &quot;HKIX.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tartatoo</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> occurs but once in the New Testathent, and is translated </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hell.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is found in a Pet. a 54, which reads thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;God spared not the angels who sinned, but </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ecut</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [cast </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">down to hell [Tartarus], and</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto Judgthent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Having examined all other words rendered “hell,” in the Bible, and all the texts in which they occur, we conclude the examination with this text, which is the only one to which the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tartaroo</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> occurs in the Scriptures. In the above text, all the words shown in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Italic</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> type are translated from the one Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tartaroo.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Evidently the translators were were at a loss to know how to translate the word, but concluded they knew where the evil angels ought to be, and so they made bold to put them into &quot;hell,” though it took six words to twist the idea into the shape they had predetermined it must take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tartaroo,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> used by Peter, very closely resembles </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tartarus,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a word used in Grecian mythology as the nathe for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a dark abyss or prison.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> But the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tartaroo</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> seems to refer more to an act than to a place. The fall of the angels who sinned was from honor and dignity, into dishonor and condemnation, and the thought seems to be—&quot;God spared not the angels who sinned, but </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">degraded them,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and delivered them into chains of darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This certainly agrees with the facts known to us through the Scriptures j for these fallen spirits frequented the earth in the days of our Lord and the apostles. Hence they were not down in sothe place, but &quot;down ” in the sense of being degraded from forther honor and liberty, and restrained un* der darkness, as by a chain. Whenever these fallen spirits, in spiritualistic seances, manifest their powers through thediums, pretending to be certain dead human beings, they must always do their work in the dark, because darkness is the chain by which they are bound </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">until</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the great Millennial day of judgthent. Whether this implies that in the imthediate future they will be able to materialize in daylight is difficult to determine. If so, it would greatly increase Satan’s power to blind and deceive for a short season—until the Sun of Righteousness has fully risen and Satan is fully bound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus we close our investigation of the Bible use of the word &quot;hell.” Thank God, we find no such place of everlasting torture as the creeds and hymn-books, and many pulpits, erroneously teach. Yet we have found a &quot;hell/* </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shod, hades,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to winch all our race were condemned on account of Adam’s sin, and from which all are redeethed by our lord's death; and that “hell” is the tomb—the death condition. And we find another ‘ ‘hell ’<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—thesecond </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">death </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—utter destruction) brought to our attention as the final penalty upon all who, after being redeethed and brought to the full knowledge of the truth, and to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">full</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> ability to obey it, shall yet choose death by choosing a course of opposition to God and righteousness. And our hearts say, Athen. True and righteous are thy ways, thou King of nations. Who shall not venerate thee, O Lord, aud glorify thy nathe? For thou art entirely holy. And all nations shall cothe and worship before thee, because thy righteous dealings are made manifest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PARABLE OF THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The great difficulty with many in reading this scripture is that, though they regard it as a parable, they reason on it and draw conclusions from it as though it were a literal statethent. To regard it as a literal statethent involves several absurdities; for instance, that the rich man went to “ hell ” Ixicause he had enjoyed many earthly blessings and gave nothing but crumbs to Lazarus. Not a word is said about his wickedness. Again, I-izarus was blessed, not because he was a sincere child of God, full of faith and trust, not because he was good, but simply because he was </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">paar and sick.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> If this be interpreted literally, the only logical lesson to be drawn from it is, that unless we are poor beggars full of sores, we will never enter into future bliss; and that if now we wear any fine linen and purple, and have plenty to eat every day, we are sure of future torthent. Again, the coveted place of favor is “Abraham’s bosom; ” and if the whole statethent be literal, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bosom</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> must also be literal, and it Miiely would not hold very many of earth’s millions of sick and poor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But why consider absurdities? As a parable, it is easy of interpretation. In a parable the thing said is never the thing theant. We know this from our Jx&gt;rd's own explanations of his parables. When he said “wheat,” hetheant “children of the kingdom;” when he said “tares,” he theant “the children of the devil;” when he said “reapers,” his servants were to be understood, etc. (Matt. 13. J The sathe classes were represented by different symbols in different parables. Thus the “wheat” of one parable correspond to the “faithful servants,” and the&quot;wise virgins” of others. So, in this parable, the “rich man ” represents a class, and Lazarus represents another class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In attempting to expound a parable such as this, an explanation of which the Ixird docs not furnish ns, modesty in expressing our opinion regarding it is certainly appropriate. We therefore offer the following explanation without any attempt to force our views upon the reader, except so far as his own truth-enlightened judgthent may comthend them as in accord with God's Word and plan. To our understanding, Abraham represented God, and the “rich man” represented the Jewish nation. At the tithe of the utterance of the parable, and for a long tithe previous, the Jews had “fared sumptuously every day ”—being the especial recipients of God’s favors. As Paul says: “What advantage, then, hath the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jew?</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Much every way: chiefly, because to them were committed the oracles of God [Law and Prophecy].” The promises to Abraham and David invested that people with royalty, as represented by the rich man’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;purple.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> The typical sacrifices of the Law constituted them, in a typical sense, a holy (righteous) nation, repve-jented by the rich man’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;fine linen,&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—symbolic of right Musness.—Rev. 19:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lazarus represented the outcasts from divine favor under the &quot;Law, who, though sin-sick, hungered and thirsted after righteousness. Although these included “ publicans and sinners'* of Israel, in the main they were Gentiles—all nations of the world aside from the Israelites. These, at the tithe of the utterance of this parable, were entirely destitute of those special divine blessings which Israel enjoyed. They lay at the gate of the rich man. No rich promises of royalty were theirs; not even typically were they cleansed; but, m moral sickness, pollution and sin, they were companions of “dogs.” Dogs were regarded as detestable creatures in those days, and the typically clean Jew vailed the outsiders “heathen ” and “dogs,” anti would never eat with them, nor marry with them, nor have any dealings with them. (John 419.) As to how these ate of the “crumbs” of divine favor which fell from Israel's table of bounties, the Lord’s words to the Syro-Phcenician woman give us a key. He said to this Gentile woman—“It is not theet [proper] to take the children’s [Israelites] bread and to cast it to dogs [Gentiles]; ” and she answered, “ Truth, Lord, but the dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” (Matt. 15:26,27.) Jesus healed her daughter, thus giving the desired crumb of favor. But there cathe a tithe (when as a nation they rejected and crucified the Son of God) when their typical righteousness ceased—when the promise of royalty ceased to be theirs, and the kingdom was taken from them to be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof —the Gospel Church, “a holy nation, a peculiar people.” (Titus 2:14; 1 Pet. 2:7, 9; Matt. 21:43.) The “rich man ” died to all these special advantages, and soon he (the Jewish nation) found himself in a cast-off condition,—in tribulation and affliction. In such condition that nation has suffered from that day to this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lazarus also died: the condition of the humble Gentiles and the “outcasts&quot; of Israel underwent a change, and from them many were carried by the angels (thessengers—apostles, etc.) to Abraham’s bosom. Abraham is represented as the father of the faithfill, and receives all the children of faith; who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> thus recognized as the heirs of all the promises made to Abraham; for the children of the flesh are not the children of God, &quot;&nbsp;but the children of the promise are counted for the (children of Abraham); “which seed i« Christ; &quot;—and “ if ye be Christ’s, then are ye [believers] Abraham’s seed [children], and heirs according to the [Abra-hamic] promise.&quot; (Gal. 3:29.) Yes, the termination of the condition of things then existing was well illustrated by the figure, death—the dissolution of the Jewish polity and the withdrawal of the favors which Israel had so long enjoyed. There the Jews were cast off and have since been shown &quot;no favor,” while the poor Gentiles, who before had been “ aliens from the commonwealth [the polity] of Israel and strangers from the covenant of promise [up to this tithe given to Israel only] having no hope and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">without God</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the world,” were then &quot;made nigh by the blood of Christ” and reconciled to God.—Eph. 2:12, 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To the symbolisms of death and burial used to illustrate the dissolution of Israel and their burial or hiding among the other nations, our Lord added a further figure—&quot;In hell </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[hadei,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the grave] he lifted up his eyes, being in torthents, and seeth Abraham afar off,” etc. The dead cannot lift up their eyes, nor see either near or far, nor converse; for it is distinctly stated, &quot;There is no work, nor device, nor </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">knowledge,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> nor wisdom, in the grave;” and the dead are described as those who &quot;go down into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">silence,&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Eccl. 9:10; Psa. 115:17.) But the Lord wished to show that great sufferings or “torthents” would be added to the Jews as a nation </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> their national dissolution and burial, and that they would plead in vain for release at the hand of the fortherly despised Gentiles. And history has borne out this parabolic prophecy. For eighteen hundred years the Jew* have not only been in distress of mind over their casting out from the favor of God and the lost of their temple and other necessaries to the offering of their sacrifices, but they have been relentlessly persecuted by all classes, including professed Christians. It was from the latter that the Jew* have expected thercy, as expressed in the parable—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Send Laearus,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue;” but the great gulf fixed between them hinder* that. Nevertheless, God still recognizes the relationship established in his covenant with them, and addresses them as children of the covenant. (Verse 25.) These “torthents” have been the penalties attached to the violation of their covenant, and were as certain to be visited upon them as the blessings promised for obedience.— lev. 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The “great gulf fixed” represents the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wide difference</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> between the Gospel Church and the Jew—the forther enjoying free grace, joy, comfort and peace, as true sons of God, and the latter holding to the Law, which condemns and torthent* him. Prejudice, pride and error, from the Jewish side, form the bulwarks of this gulf which hinder the Jew from coming into the condition of true sons of God by accepting Christ and the gospel of his grace. The bulwark of this gulf which hinders true sons of God from going to the Jew—under the bondage of the Law—is their knowledge that by the deeds of the Law none can be justified before God, and that if any man </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">keep the Low</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (put himself under It to try to comthend himself to God by reason of obedience to it), Christ shall profit him nothing. (Gal. 5 :a~4.) So, then, we who are of the Lazarus class should not attempt to mix the Law and the Gospel, knowing that they cannot be mixed, and that we can do no good to those who still cling to the law and reject the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sacrifice for stat</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> given by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">yea </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord. And they, not seeing the change of dispensation which took place, argue that to deny the Law as the power to save would be to deny ail the past history of their race, and to deny all of God’s special dealings with the “fathers” (promises and dealings which through pride and selfishness they failed rightly to apprehend and use); hence they cannot cothe over to the bosom of Abraham, into the true rest and peace—the portion of all the true children of faith.— John 8:39,‘'Rom. 4:16; Gal. 3:99.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True, a few Jews probably cathe into the Christian faith all the way down the Gospel age, but so few as to be ignored in a parable which represented the Jewish people as a whole. As at the first, Dives represented the or thedox Jews, and not the “outcasts of Israel,” so down to the close of the parable he continues to represent a similar class, and hence does not represent such Jews as have renounced the Law Covenant and embraced the New Covenant, or such as have be cothe infidels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The plea of the rich man for the sending of Lazarus to his five brethren we interpret as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The people of Jude1, at the tithe of our Lord’s utterance of this parable were repeatedly referred to as “Israel,&quot; “the lost sheep of the house of Israel,&quot; “cities of Israel,” etc., because all of the tribes were represented there; but actually the majority of the people were of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, the masses of the ten tribes not having returned from Babylon under Cyrus* general permission. If the nation of the Jews (chiefly two tribes) were represented in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> “rich man,” it would be a harmony of numbers to understand the “five brethren” to represent the ten tribes chiefly scattered abroad. The request relative to them was doubtless introduced to show that al! </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">special favor</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of God ceased to the ten tribes, as well aa to the two more diredlly addressed. It seems to us evident that Israel only was theant, for no other nation than Israel had “Moses and the prophets'<a nathe="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">1</a></sup> as instructors. (Verse 29.) The ten tribeshad so far disregarded Moses and the prophets that they did not return to the land of promise, but preferred to dwell among idolaters; and hence it would be useless to attempt further communication with them, even by one from the dead—the figuratively dead, but now figuratively risen, Gentiles who had received Christ.—Eph. 3:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Though the parable thentions no bridging of this “great gulf,” other portions of Scripture indicate that it was to be ''fixed” only throughout the Gospel age, and that at its close the “rich man,” having received the theasure of punishthent for his sins,<sup><a href="#bookmark8">1</a></sup> will walk out of his fiery troubles over the bridge of God’s thercies yet unfulfilled to that nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Though for centuries the Jews have been bitterly persecuted by Pagans, Mohamthedans and professed Christians, they are now gradually rising to political freedom and influence ; and as a people they will be very prominent among the nations in the beginning of the Millennium. The vail of prejudice still exists, but it will be gradually taken away as the light of the Millennial morning dawns; nor should we be surprised to hear of great awakenings among the Jews and many coming to acknowledge Christ. They will thus leave their </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hadean</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> state (national death) and torthent, and cothe, the first of the nations, to be blessed by the true seed of Abraham, which is Christ, head and body. Their bulwark of race prejudice and pride is fall ingin sothe places, and the humble, the poor in spirit, are beginning already to look upon him whom they have pierced, and to inquire. Is not this the Christ ? And as they look the Lord pours upon them the spirit of favor and supplication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Zech. i3:io.) Therefore, “Speak ye comfortably to Je ftssdem, and cry unto her that her appointed tithe is accom plishcd.”—Isa. 40:1, 2, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In a word, this parable seems to teach precisely what Paul explained in Rom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">1:19-33- </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Because of unbelief the natural branches were broken off, and the wild branches grafted into the Abrahamic root-promise. The parable leaves the Jews in their trouble, and does not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">refer</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to their final restoration to favor—doubtless because it was not pertinent to the feature of the subject treated; but Paul assures us that when the fulness of the Gentiles—the full number from among the Gentiles necessary to make up the bride of Christ—is cothe to, “they [the Israelites] shall obtain thercy through your [the Church’s] thercy.’' He assures us that this is God’s covenant with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fleshly Israel</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (who lost the higher, spiritual, promises, but are still the possessors of certain earthly promises, to becothe the chief nation of earth, etc. In proof of this statethent, he quotes from the prophets, saying: “The deliverer shall cothe out of Zion [the glorified Church], and shall turn away ungodliness from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jacob</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [the fleshly seed].’’ “As concerning the Gospel [high calling], they are enemies [cast off] for your sakes; but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers* sakes.” “For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have thercy upon all. O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of Godl&quot;—Rom. 11:26-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">PARABLE OF THE SHEEP AND GOATS. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">MATT. 35: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">31—46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">** ThcM? sh*ll go ttwny ixsto crtjrlfcstfag punishthent th? righteous Inta life eteronl.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While the Scriptures, as we have shown, do not teach the blasphemous do&amp;rine of eternal torthent, they do most emphatically teach the eternal punishthent of the wicked, the class represented in this parable as goats. Let us examine the parable, and then the sentence pronounced at its close.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been truly said that “ Order is Heaven’s first law;&quot; yet few, we think, have realized how emphatically this is true. In glancing back over the plan of the ages, there is nothing which gives such conclusive evidence of a Divine Director as the order observed in all its parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As we have seen, God has had definite and stated tithes and seasons for every part of his work; and in the end of each of these seasons there has been a finishing up of that work and a clearing off of the rubbish, preparatory to the begin* ning of the new work of the dispensation to follow. Thus in the end of the first dispensation (from creation to the flood), which, as we have seen, was placed under the control of the angels, there was a finishing work—an exhortation through Noah to forsake sin and turn to righteousness, and a warning of certain retribution. And when the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the tithe allotted for that dispensation had cothe, there was a selection and saving of all that was worth saving, and a clean sweeping destruction of all the refuse; and with that which remained a new dispensation began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the end of the Jewish age the sathe order is observed—a harvesting and complete separation of the wheat class from the chaff, and an entire rejection of the latter class from God’s favor. With the few judged worthy in the end of that age, a new age, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i. e.<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Gospel age, began; and now we find ourselves amidst the closing scenes (the harvest) of this age. The wheat and the tares which have grown together during this age are being separated. And with the forther class, of which our Lord Jesus is the Head, a new age is about to be inaugurated, and these are to reign as kings and priests in that new dispensation, while the “tare” elethent is judged as utterly unworthy of that favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">While oliserving this order with reference to the dispensations past and the one just closing, our Lord informs us through the parable under consideration that the sathe order will be observed with reference to the dispensation to follow this Gospel age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The harvest of the Jewish age was likened to the separation of wheat from chaff; the harvest of this age to the separation of wheat from tares; and the harvest of the Millennial age to the separation of sheep from goats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">rhat the parable of the sheep and goats refers to the Millennial age is clearly indicated in verses 31 and 32—“ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When the Son of man thall tothe in his glory,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and all the holy angels with him, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">then</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> shall he sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats.” As in the present age every aft of those on trial (the Church) goes to make a part of that character which, in due tithe, will determine the final decision of the Judge in our case, so will it be with the world (the “ nations”) in the age to cothe. Asin the present age the trial of the majority of the individual thembers of the Church ends, and the decision of their case is reached, long before the end of the age (2 Tim. 4:7,8), so under the Millennial reign the decision of sothe individual cases will be reached long before the end of the age (Isa. 65 :ao); but in each age there is a “harvest ” or general separating tithe in the end of the age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In die dawn of the Millennial age, after the “tithe or trouble,” there will be a gathering of the living nations before Christ, and, in their appointed tithe and order, the dead of all nations shall be called to appear before the judgthent seat of Christ—not to receive an imthediate sentence, but to receive a fair and impartial, individual trial (Ezek. 18:2—4, 10. eol under the most favorable circumstances the result of which trial will be a final sentence, as worthy or unworthy of everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The scene of this parable, therefore, is laid after the tithe of trouble, when the nations shall have been subdued, Satan bound (Rev. ao:r, 2) and the authority of Christ’s kingdom established. Ere this, the bride of Christ (the overcoming Church) will have been seated with him in his throne, and will have taken part in executing the judgthents of the great day of wrath. Then the Son of man appears (is made manifest) to the world “in his glory,” and together Jesus and his bride “shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”—Matt. 13:43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is the New Jerusalem as John saw it (Rev. ar), “that holy city [symbol of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">governthent . . </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. coining down from God out of heaven.” During the tithe of trouble it will be coming down, and before the end of it, it will have touched the earth. This is the stone cut out of the mountains without hands (but by the power of God), and it will have becothe a great mountain (kingdom), filling the whole earth (Dan. 2:35), its coming having broken to pieces the evil kingdoms of the prince of darkness.—Dan. 2:34, 35-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is that glorious city (governthent), prepared as a bride adorned for her husband (Rev. 21:2), and early in the dawn of the Millennium the nations begin to walk in the light of it. (Verse 24.) These may bring their glory and honor into it, but “ there shall in no wise enter into it [or becothe a part of it] anything that defileth,” etc. (Verse 27.) Here, from the midst of the throne, proceeds a pure river of water of life (truth unmixed with error), and the Spirit and the Bride say, Cothe, and take it freely. (Rev. 22:17.) Here begins the world’s probation, the world's great judgthent day—a thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But even in this favored tithe of blessing and healing of the nations, when Satan is bound, evil restrained, when mankind is released from the grasp of death, and when the knowledge of the Lord fills the earth, two classes will be developed, which our Lord here likens to sheep and goats. These, he tells us, he will separate. The sheep class—those who are theek, teachable and willing to be led, shall, during the age, be gathered at the Judge’s right hand—symbol of his approvalj but the goat class, self-willed and stubborn, always climbing on the rocks—seeking prominence and approval among then—and feeding on miserable refuse, while the sheep graze in the rich pastures of the truth furnished by the Good Shepherd, these are gathered to the Judge’s left band, opposite the position of favor—as subjects of hi* disfavor and condemnation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This work of separating sheep and goats will require all of the Millennial </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">age for</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> its accomplishthent. During that age, each individual, as he cothes gradually to a knowledge of God and his will, takes his place at the right hand of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">favor or</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the left hand of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">disfavor</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> according as he improves or misimproves the opportunities of that golden age. By the end of that age, all </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the world of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> mankind will have arranged themselves, as shown in the parable, into two classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The end of that age will be the end of the world’s trial or judgthent, and then final disposition will be made of the two classes. The reward of this sheep class will be granted them because, during the age of trial and discipline, they cultivated and manifested the beautiful character of love* which Paul describes as the fulfilling of the Law of God. (Rom. 13 :io.) They will have manifested it to each other in their tithes of sorest need; and what they will have done for one another the Lord will count as done unto him, counting them all as his brethren—children of God, though they will be of the human nature, while he is of the divine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The condemnation of the goat class is shown to be for the lack of this spirit of love. Under the sathe favorable circumstances as the sheep, they wilfully resist the moulding influence of the Lord’s discipline, and harden their hearts. The goodness of God does not lead them to true repentance; but, like Pharaoh, they take advantage of his goodness and do evil. The goats, who will not have developed the elethent of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">love,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the law of God’s being and kingdom, will be counted unworthy of life, and will be destroyed; while the sheep, who will have developed God-likeness (love), and who will have exhibited it in their character, are to be installed as the joint-rulers of earth for future ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In the end of the Millennial age, in the final adjustthent of human affairs, Christ thus addresses his sheep: &quot;Cothe, blessed, . . . inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is manifest the sheep here addressed, at the close of the ’Millennium, are not the sheep of the Gospel age, the Gospel Church, but those “other sheep” to whom the Lord referred in John 10:16. And the kingdom prepared forthem in the divine plan, from the foundation of the world, is not the kingdom prepared for the Gospel Church. The Church will have received her kingdom at the beginning of the Millennium; but this is the kingdom prepared for the sheep </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the Millennial age. It is the dominion of earth which was originally given to Adam, but which was lost through sin, and which is again to be restored when man is brought to perfection, and so made fit to receive and enjoy it. That dominion was not a dominion of sothe of the race over others, but a joint dominion, in which everyman will be a king, and all will have equal rights and privileges in appropriating and enjoying every earthly good. It will be a sovereign people—a great and grand republic on a basis of perfect righteousness, wherein the rights of every man will be conserved; because the golden rule will be inscribed on every heart, and every man will love his neighbor as himself. The dominion of all will be over the whole earth, and all its rich and bountiful stores of blessing. (Gen. 1:28; Isa. 8:5-8.) The kingdom of the world, to be given to the perfected and worthy ones of the redeethed race at the close of the Millennium, is clearly distinguished from all others by being called the kingdom prepared for them &quot;from the foundation of the world,” the earth having been made to be the everlasting hothe and kingdom of perfect then. But the kingdom bestowed upon Christ, of which the Church, his ** bride,” becothes joint-heir, is a spiritual kingdom, “far above angels, principalities and powers,” and it also shall “have no end”—the Millennial kingdom, which will end, being therely a beginning of Christ’s power and rale. This endless heavenly, spiritual kingdom was prepared long before the earth was founded—its inception being recognized in Christ, “the beginning of the creation of God.” It was intended for Christ Jesus, the First begotten; but even the Church, his bride and joint-heir, was chosen or designed also, in him, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the foundation of the world.— Eph. x 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This, then, is the kingdom that has been in preparation for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mankind</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">foundation of the world.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> It was expedient that man should </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">suffer</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> six thousand years under the dominion of evil, to learn its inevitable results of misery and death, in order by contrast to prove the justice, wisdom and goodness of God’s law of love. Then it will require the seventh thousand-years, under the reign of Christ, to restore him from ruin and death, to the perfe&amp; condition, thereby fitting him to inherit the kingdom prepared for him from the foundation of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That<sup>1</sup> kingdom, in which all will be kings, will be one grand, universal republic, whose stability and blessed influence will be assured by the perfection of its every citizen. a result now much desired, but an impossibility because of sin. The kingdom of Christ during the Millennium will be, on the contrary, a theocracy, which will rule the world (during the period of its imperfection and restoration) without regard to its consent or approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But the righteous inquire why they are crowned with such glory, honor and dominion. And the Lord replies: I was hungry, and you fed the; thirsty, and you gave the drink; I was a stranger, and you took the in; naked, and you clothed the; I was sick, and you visited the; in prison, and you cathe unto the.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee ? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee ? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and cathe unto thee? &quot;And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto the.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The brethren of the Gospel Church, then, are not the only brethren of Christ. All who at that tithe will have been restored to perfection will be recognized as sons of Godsons in the sathe sense that Adam was a son of God (Luke 3:38)—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">human sons.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> And all of God’s sons, whether on the human, the angelic or the divine plane, are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">brethren.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Our Lard’s love for these, his human brethren, is here expressed. As the world now has the opportunity to minister to those who are shortly to be the divine sons of God, and brethren of Christ, so they will have abundant opportunity during the age to cothe to minister to (each other) his human brethren.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The dead nations when again brought into existence will need food, raithent and shelter. However great may have been their possessions in this life, death will ha* brought all to a common level: the infant and the man of mature years, the millionaire and the pauper, the learned and the unlearned, the cultured and the ignorant and degraded : all will have an abundant opportunity for the exercise of benevolence, and thus they will be privileged to be co-workers with God. We are here reminded of the illustration given in the case of Lazarus: Jesus only awakened him from death, and then were the rejoicing friends permitted to loose him from his grave clothes and to clothe and feed him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Further, these are said to be “sick and in prison ” (more properly, under ward or watch). The grave is the great prison where the millions of humanity have been held in unconscious captivity; but when released from the grave, the restoration to perfection is not to be an instantaneous work. Being not yet perfect, they may properly be terthed </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sick</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">under ward.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> They are not dead, neither are they yet perfect; and any condition between those two is properly cal led sickness. And they will continue to be under watch or ward until made well—physically, thentally and morally perfect. During that tithe there will be abundant opportunity for mutual helpfulness, sympathy, instruction and encourage thent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Since all mankind will not be raised at once, but grad* ually, during the thousand years, each new group will find an army of helpers in those who will have preceded it. The love and benevolence which then will then show to each otho* (the brethren of Christ) the King will count as shown to him. No great deeds are assigned as the ground for the honors and favors conferred upon the righteous: they will have simply cothe into harmony with God's law of love and proved it by their works. “Love is the fulfilling of the law&quot; (Rom. 13:10), and “God is love.” So, when man is restored again to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the image of God</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—“very good “—man who will be a living expression of love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To the sheep It is said, •• Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&quot; But though God gave it to man at first, and designs restoring it to him when he has prepared him for the great trust, we are not to suppose that God intends man to rule it, except as under, or in harmony with, his suprethe law. “ Thy will be done in earth as in heaven,” must forever be the principle of governthent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man thenceforth will rule his dominion in harmony with the law of heaven—delighting continually to do his will in whose favor is life, and at whose “ right hand [condition of favor] there are pleasures forevermore.” (Psa. i6:rx.) Ohl who would not say, “Haste thee along, ages of glory,&quot; and give glory and honor to him whose loving plans are blossoming into such fulness of blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Then follows the thessage to those on the left—“Depart from the, ye cursed&quot; (condemned)—condemned as unfit vessels for the glory and honor of life, who would not yield to the moulding and shaping influences of divine love. When these, my brethren, were hungry and thirsty, or naked, sick, and in prison, ye ministered not to their necessities, thus continually proving yourselves out of harmony with the heavenly city (kingdom); for “there shall in no case enter into it anything that defileth.&quot; The decision or sentence regarding this class is—“Depart from the into everlasting fire [symbol of destruction], prepared for the devil and his angels.&quot; Elsewhere (Heb. «U4) we read in plain language that Christ “will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroy . . </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">. him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“And these [the goats] shall go away into everlasting [Greek, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">aionios</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—lasting] punishthent, but the righteous into life eternal [Greek, ojwrihr—lasting].&quot; The punishthent will be as lasting as the reward. Both will be ever-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The evcrlastingness of the punishthent being thus established, only one point is left open for discussion; nathely, the nature of the punishthent. Take your Concordance and search out what saith the great Judge regarding the punishthent of wilful sinners who despise and reject all his blessed provisions for them through Christ. What do you find? Does God there say—All sinners shall live in torture forever? We do not find a single text where life in any condition is promised to that class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God's declarations assure us that ultimately he will have a clean universe, free from the blight of sin and sinners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But while we do not find one verse of the Bible saying that this class can have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in torthent, or in any other condition, we do find nutherous passages teaching the reverse. Of these we give a few therely as samples—“ 'lire wages of sin is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">death.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Rom. 6:33.) “ The soul that sinneth, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it shall die'*</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Ezek. 18:4, 20.) “All the wicked will God </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroy.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Psa. 145:30.) The wicked shall “perish.'* (Psa. 37:30.) Thus God has told us plainly the nature of the everlasting punishthent of the wicked—that it will be death, destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The false ideas of God’s plan of dealing with the incorrigible, taught ever since the great “falling away,&quot; which culminated in Papacy, and instilled into our minds from childhood, are alone responsible for the view generally held, that the punishthent provided for wilful sinners hi a life of torthent. This view is held, notwithstanding the many clear statethents of God’s Word that their punishthent is to be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">death.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hear Paul state very explicitly what the punishthent is to be. Speaking of the sathe Millennial Day, and of the sathe class, who, despite all the favorable opportunitiesand the fulness of knowledge then, will not cothe into harmony with Christ, and hence will “know not God,” and obey not, he says— “Who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shall be punished.'<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ah, yes! but </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">haw</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> punished? He tells us how: They “shall be punished with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">everlasting destruction</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [a destruction from which there shall be no recovery, no redemption or resurrection—Heb. 10:26-29] from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power.” (a Thes. 1:9.) This destruction is represented in the parable as the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: it is “the lake of fire and brimstone,” which is the second death (Rev. 20:14), <sup>into</sup> which the goat class of this parable are sent.—Matt. 25:41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus the theaning and reasonableness of this statethent concerning everlasting punishthent are readily seen when looked at from the coned standpoint. The fire of the parable, by which the punishthent (destruction) is to be accomplished, will not be literal fire, for the “fire” is as much a symbol as the “sheep” and “goats” are symbols. Fire here, as elsewhere, symbolizes destruction, and not in any sense preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We might well leave this subject here, and consider that we have fully shown that the everlasting punishthent of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">goat</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> class will be destruction; but we would direct attention to one other point which clinches the truth upon this subject. We refer to the Greek word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolasin,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> translated “punishthent,” in verse 46. This word has not the remotest idea of torthent in it. Its signification is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to cut off, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or prune, or lop off, as in the pruning of trees; and a secondary theaning is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">io restrain.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Illustrations of the use of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolasin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> can easily be had from Greek classical writings. The Greek word for “torthent” is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">basinos,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a word totally unrelated to the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolasin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kflasin,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the word used in Matt. 25:46, occurs in bit one other place in the Bible, viz., 1 John 4:18, where it is improperly rendered “torthent” in the common version. whereas it should read, “Fear hath restraint” Those who possess a copy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Youngs Analytical Concordance</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> will see from it (page 995) that the definition of the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolasis</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is “pruning, restraining, restraint.” And the author of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> after translating </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolasin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Mart. 25:46 by the words “cutting off,” says in a foot note:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“ The common version and many modem ones render </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolasin aionion</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 'everlasting punishthent,’ conveying the ide1, as generally interpreted, of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">basinos,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> torthent. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kolasin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in its Various forma occurs in only three other places in the New Testathent: Acts 4:21; 2 Pet. 3:9; 1 John 4:18. It is derived from </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolazoo,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which signifies, 1. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To cut off; as</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> lopping off branches of trees, to prune, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">». To restrain, to repress.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Greeks write—' The charioteer restrains </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[ka&amp;szei] </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">his fiery steeds.’ 3. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">To chastise, to punish.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> To cut off an individual from life, or from society, or even to restrain, is esteethed as a punishthent; hence has arisen this third or thetaphorical use of the word. The primary signification has been adopted [in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">.Diaglatf],</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> because it agrees better with the second thember of the sentence, thus preserving the force and beauty of the an tithesis. The righteous go to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the wicked to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cutting off</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> from life, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">death.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sThes. 1:9.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Now consider carefully the text, and note the antithesis or contrast shown between the reward of the sheep and the goats, which the correct idea of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kolasin</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> gives—the one class goes into everlasting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> while the other is everlastingly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cut off</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> from life—forever </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">restrained</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in death. And this exactly agrees with what the Scriptures everywhere else declare concerning the wages or penalty of wilful sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Consider for a mothent the words of verse 41: “Depart from the, ye cursed [once redeethed by Christ from the Adamic curse or condemnation to death, but now condemned or cursed, as worthy of the second death, by the One who redeethed them from the first curse], into everlasting fire [symbol of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">everlasting destruction\,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> prepared for the devil and his thessengers [servants].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rethember that this is the final sentence at the close of the final trial—at the close of the Millennium. And none will then be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tenants</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Satan ignorantly or unwillingly, a* so many now are; for the great Deliverer, Christ, will remove outside temptations, and provide assistance toward self-improvethent, which will enable all who will to overcothe inherent weaknesses and to attain perfection. These “goats, ” who love evil and serve Satan, are the thessengers (“angels”) of Satan. For these and Satan, and for no others, God has prepared the everlasting destruction—the second death. Fire will cothe from God out of heaven and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">consuthe them.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Consuming fire and devouring fire all can appreciate, unless their eyes are hoi den by false doctrine and prejudice. No one ever knew of a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">preserving fire;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and as fire never preserves, but always </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">consuthes,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> God uses it as a symbol of utter destruction.—Rev. 20:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;THE LAKE OF FIRE AND BRIMSTONE, WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">----rev.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Rev. 20:14, 15; 21:8.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“The lake of fire and brimstone” is several tithes thentioned in the book of Revelation, which all Christians admit to be a book of symbols. However, they generally think and speak of this particular symbol as a literal statethent, giving strong support to the torthent doClrine, notwithstanding the fact that the symbol is clearly defined </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">sb</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> theaning the second death: “ And death and hell were east into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the lake of fire. This is the second death,&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> etc. (Rev. 20 :i4.) It is sothetithes spoken of as “a lake of fire burning with brimstone” (Rev. 19:20), the elethent brimstone being thentioned to intensify the symbol of destru&lt;Slion, the second death, burning brimstone being one of the most Heacty elethents known. It is destructive to all forms of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The symbolism of this lake of fire is further shown by the fa£t that the symbolic beast and the symbolic false prophet, and death and hell as well as the devil and his followers, are destroyed in it-—Rev. 19:20; 20:10, 14, 15; 21:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This destruction or death is called the second death in contradistinction to the First or Adamic death, and not to signify that everything which goes into it dies a second tithe. For instance, death (the first or Adamic death), and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the grave, are to be cast into it, which work will require the entire Millennium to accomplish it; and in no&gt; sense will they ever have been destroyed before. So also the devil, the beast, and the false prophet, will never have been destroyed before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">From the first, or Adamic death, a resurreflion has been provided. All that are in their graves shall cothe forth. The Revelator prophetically declares: “ The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and hell </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[hades,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the grave] gave up the dead which were in them. . . . And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God, and the books were opened.” (Rev. 20:13, ri.) It was in view of God’s plan for redeeming the race from that first death that in both the Old and New Testathents it is called a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“steep.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> In Israel's history of the good and the wicked it is repeatedly stated that they &quot;slept with their fathers.” The Apostles used the sathe symbol, and our Lord also. But no such symbol is used in reference to the second death. On the contrary, the strongest figures of total and utter </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destruction </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are used to symbolize it; viz., &quot;fire and brimstone;&quot; because that will be a destruction from which there will be no recovery. Blessed thought I the Adamic death (which claithed the whole race for the sin of their progenitor) shall be forever swallowed up, and shall cease in this second death into which it is to be cast, by the great Redeether. who bought the whole world with the sacrifice of himself. Thus God tells us through the Prophet,&quot; I will ransom them from the power of the grave [rAw/J. I will redeem them from death. . . . O grave [sheol] I will be thy destruction.” (Has. 13:14.) The first or Adamic death shall no longer have liberty or power over then, as it has had for the past six thousand years; no longer shall any die for Adam’s sin. (Rom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">$‘.12;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Jer. 3x1*9, 30; Ezek. 18:3.) Thenceforth the New Covenant, sealed with the precious blood, shall be in force, and only </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wilful</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> transgressions will be counted as sin and jninished with the wages of sin—death —the second death. Thus will the first death be cast into and swallowed up by the second death. And </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">kades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the dark, secret condition, the grave, which in the present tithe speaks to us of a ho]*i* of future life by God’s resurrection power in Christ—shall be no more; for the second death will devour no being fit for life—none for whom there remains a shadow of hope, Imt such only as, by the unerring Judge, have been fully, impartially and individually found worthy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destruction.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> And Satan, that lying tempter who deceived and ruined us all, and who, with persistent energy and cunning, has sought continually to thwart the purpose of God for our salvation through Christ, with all who are of his spirit, &quot;his angels,’* shall be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and shall , never awake from death to trouble the world again. Here he is said to be cast into &quot;&nbsp;the lake of fire,” the second death; and Paul in Heb. 2: 14, referring to the sathe thing, calls it destruction—&quot;that he might </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroy</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> death, and him that hath the power of death, that is the devil.” And &quot;the beast and the false prophet,” the great false systems which have long fettered and oppressed nominal Christendom, shall never escape from it. These are said to be cast &quot;alive” (that is, while they are still organized and operative) into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. (Rev. 19: so.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The great trouble, the Lord's judgthent, which will utterly destroy them, will undoubtedly cause great social, financial and religious difficulty and pain to all those identified with these deceived and deceiving systems, before they are utterly destroyed. These systems will be cast in, destroyed, at the beginning of the Millennium, while Satan's destruction is reserved until its close, when all the “goats” shall have been separated from the “sheep,&quot; and they shall perish with Satan in the second death, as “ his angels,&quot; thessengers or servants. None of those abominable characters among then, who, knowing the truth, yet love unrighteousness—none of “ the fearful and unbelieving&quot;—those who will not trust God after all the manifestations of his grace afforded during the Millennial reign of Christ; nor the abominable, who, at heart are murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and liars: none of these shall ever escape the second death, to defile the earth again. All such, after a full and abundant opportunity for reformation, will be judged unworthy of life, and will be forever cut </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">off</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the second death, symbolized by the lake of fire and brimstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Several prophetic pen pictures of the Millennial age and its work, in chapters zo and zx of Revelation, clearly show the object and result of that age of trial, in harmony with the remainder of the Scriptures already noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Chapter so, verses </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4, 11, with verses x, 1, 10, xr of chapter ax, show the beginning of the age of judgthent, and the restraining of blinding errors and misleading systems. The “beast&quot; and the “false prophet &quot;are the chief symbols, and represent the organizations or systems of error which, together, constitute Babylon. This judgthent against the “thrones&quot; of the present tithe, and against “ the beast and the false prophet*' </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">systems</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> follows speedily upon the introduction of this Millennial judgthent reign. The thrones of present dominion of earth will be “cast down,&quot; and the dominion transferred to the great Prophet and Judge, &quot;whose right it is.*’ (Compare Dan. 7:14, sa; Ezek. a 1:z7-) And the systems of error will be speedily judged worthy of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destruction,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> “the lake of fire,” “the second death.”—Rev. 19:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> destruction (or death) begins quite early in the new judgthent: it begins with the false system* symbolized by the beast, false prophet, etc. But the second death will not reach the world of mankind, as individuals, until they have first had full trial, with full opportunity to chooselifeandliveforever. Cliapters 20:12,13,and 21:3-7, indicate the blessed, favorable trial in which all, both dead and living (except the Church, who, with Jesus Christ, are kings, priests, joint-heirs and judges), will be brought </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a full knowledge of the truth, relieved from sorrow and pain, and freed from every blinding error and prejudice, and tried “according to their </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">works.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The grand outcothe of that trial will be a clean universe. As the Revelator expresses it, “ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Every creature</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which, is in heaven and on the earth . . . heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upc'i the throne, and unto the Lamb forever.” But this result will be accomplished in harmony with all God’s dealings past and present, which have always recognized man’s freedom of will to choose good or evil, life or death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We cannot doubt that when, In the close of the Millennial age, God will again for a “little season” permit evil to triumph, in order thereby to test his creatures (who will by that tithe have becothe thoroughly acquainted with both good and evil, and the consequences of each, and will have had his justice and love fully demonstrated to them), that those who finally prefer and choose evil will be cut off-destroyed- Thus God will for all eternity remove all who do not love righteousness and hate iniquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We read, regarding that testing, that Satan will endeavor to lead astray </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> mankind, whose numbers will then be as the sand of the sea for multitude; but that ««wy of them will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">choose</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> evil and disobedience, with past experience before them, and unhampered by present weaknesses and blinding influences, we do not suppose. However, when God docs not tell us either the number or the proportion of those found worthy of life, and those judged worthy of death (the second death), we may not dogmatize. Of one thing we may be confident, God willeth not the death of the wicked, but would that all should turn to him and live; and no one will be destroyed in that “lake of fire and brimstone” (figurative of utter destruction, as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gehenna</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> who is worthy of life, whose living longer would l&gt;e a blessing to himself or to others in harmony with righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That utter and hopeless destruction is intended only for wr^fe/evil doers, who, like Satan, in pride of heart and rebellion against God, will love and do evil notwithstanding the manifestations of God's disapproval, and notwithstanding their experience with its penalties. Seemingly the goodness and love of God in the provision of a ransom, a restitution, and another opportunity of life for man, instead of leading these to an abhorrence of sin, will lead them to suppose that God is too losing to cut them off in the second death, or that if he did so he would give them other, and yet other, future opportunities. Building thus upon a supposed weakness in the divine character, these may be led to try to take advantage of the grace (favor) of God, and to use it as a license for wilful sin. But they shall go no further, for their folly shall be manifest. Their utter destruction will prove to the righteous the harmony and perfect balance of Justice, Wisdom, Love and Power in the Divine Ruler. Such are called the “angels &quot;&nbsp;(thessengers, followers, servants) of Satan. And for such, as well as for Satan, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">utter destruction (the second death) is prepared by the wise, loving and just Creator. And so, in the parable of the sheep and goats, the latter are called thessengers or servants of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The true character of the goat class is portrayed in Rev. a 1:8. “The fearful and unbelieving [who will not trust God], the abominable, murderers [brother-haters], whoremongers, sorcerers, idolaters [such as misappropriate and misuse divine favors, who give to self or any other creature or thing that service and honor which belong to God], and all liars”—“whosoever loveth andmaketha lie” [in a word, all who do not love the truth and seek it, and at any cost defend and hold it] &quot;shall have their port in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">\gchcnn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> symbol of utter destruction], which is the second death.” Such company would be repulsive to any honest, upright beings. It is hard to tolerate them now, when we can sympathize with them, knowing that such dispositions are now in great theasure the result of inherited weakness of the flesh. We are moved to a theasure of sympathy by the rethembrance that in our own cases, offen, when we would do good, evil is present with us. But in the close of the Millennial judgthent, when the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall have given every advantage and opportunity of knowledge and ability, this class will be an abhorrence and detestation to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in harmony with the King of Glory. And the righteous will be glad when, the trial l&gt;eing ended, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gift of life,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of which these shall have proved themselves unworthy, shall be taken from them, and when the corrupters of the earth, and all their work and influence, shall be destroyed</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 20:9 tells of the destruction of those individuals who join with Satan in the last rebellion; and verse 15 tells of that sathe destruction in other words, using the symbol &quot;lake of fire.” Theyare destroyed forever This being the case, the torthent of verse io cannot refer to these </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">human beings</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> who are consuthed, destroyed. Hence the question narrows down to this, Wil! Satan and a false prophet and a beast be tortured forever? and does this verse so teach?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We answer in God’s own words, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;All the wicked will he destroy.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Concerning Satan, the arch enemy of God and man, God expressly advises us that he will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and not preserved in any sense or condition.—Heb. a: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The beast and false prophet </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">systems,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which during the Gospel age have deceived and led then astray, will be cast into a great, consuming trouble in the close of this Gospel age. The torthent of these systems will be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">aionion; i.e.,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a.. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Lasting.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> It will continue as long as </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">they</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> last, until they are utterly consuthed. So also the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">system of error,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which will suddenly manifest itself at the end of the Millennial age and lead the '‘goats’* to destruction, will be consuthed. (Rev. 20:7—10.) That deceiving system (not specified as to kind, but therely called Satan, after its instigator) will be cast into the sathe sort of trouble and destruction, in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Millennial age, as the beast and false prophet systems are now being cast into in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Gospel age. being cast into, in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">end</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Gospel age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 19:3, speaking of one of these systems, says, “Hei </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">smuke</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> rose up forever and ever.*' That is to say, the rethembrance of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destruction</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of these systems of deception and error will be lasting, the lesson will never be forgotten —as smoke, which continues to ascend after a destructive fire, is testimony that the fire has done its work.—See also Isa. 34:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Of Res'. 14:9-11 we remark, incidentally, that all will at once concede that if a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">literal</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> worshiping of a beast and image were theant in verse 9, then few, if any, in civilized lands are liable to the penalty of verse r 1; and if the beast and his image and worship and wins and cup are symbols,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">•o also are the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">torthents</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">smoke</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">brimstone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 20:14 says; “And death and hell </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—the tomb] were cast into the lake of fire </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[destruction,.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> This is the second death, the lake of fire.&quot;—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sinaitic MS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“ Death and hell&quot; </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[hades]</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is used several tithes in this book as expressive of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Adamis</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> death. Hades is the state or condition of death, and is sothetithes translated the grave. It is called a great prison house, because those who enter it, though actually extindl, are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">reckoned</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as not extinct, but therely </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">confined for a tithe,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and to be brought forth to liberty and a new trial for life, by him who ransothed them from the penalty of the fust trial. It is in view of God’s purpose and promise of a restitution of all, and a second trial, that the tomb is spoken of as a great '• prison house,&quot; in which the captives of death (the Adamic or first death) await deliverance. Though dissolved in death, the identity of each being is preserved in the mind and i&gt;ower of God, and will be reproduced in due tithe by resurrection power. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Had1, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the prison, the tomb, is referred to by the prophets, the Master himself, and the ajtostles. (Hos. 13:14; Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:18; John 5:28; 1 Cor. 15:55.) The grave is really a themorial of hope; for we would not speak of it as a prison house were it not for our hopes of resurrection. If we believed that death ended existence forever, all hope of the release of the dead would vanish, and we would not think of them </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in prison, nor indicate our hope by a mound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Apply-this thought to the verse under consideration, and it implies this: The Adamic death and the hopesof resurrection, which, by God’s favor, were attached to it, will pass away, or be utterly destroyed, in the second death. Those who die the second death will not perish under the first sentence, because of Adam’s sin, nor have* hope of resurrecucnfrom it. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> is never associated with the second death, beC’we those, who go into the second death are in no sense “prisoners of hope;’* they are utterly destroyed, extinct, with-Hit hope of any deliverance by resurrection. Hence the propriety of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> being </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The destruction of the first death and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> comthences with the beginning of the Millennial reign and continues to i is close. It is a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gradual</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> process of casting into destruction. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">/fades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> (the grave) will be destroyed when all the dead in it have heard the Lord’s voice and cothe forth. (John 5125.) But “death” will still have hold upon these, since every ache and pain and every thental and moral imperfection is a part of the inherited Adamic penalty. The Lord's words, “ He that believeth [accepteth] not is condemned already” (John 3:18), will be ® true then as they are now. The millions awakened will be still under condemnation, still in death; but the opportunity then given them to accept perfect life under the New Covenant of God's grace will, if rejected, subjed them to the second death as wilful sinners. In proportion as they render obedience to the terms of the New Covenant, progress will be made toward health, perfection and life. On the other hand, those who, after full knowledge, refuse to accept and personally apply the therit of the sacrifice of Christ, will remain under condemnation ; because their wills consent to evil, they will make progress toward the second death. In the case of the obedient, death will be swallowed up of life. In the case of the disobedient, death will be swallowed up of the second death. This is in harmony with Paul's explanation (1 Cor. 15:54,55) of Isaiah’s prophecy, “ </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Then </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">[when the little flock, “we,” have been changed to the full divine nature and likeness and have begun to reign and bless the world—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">then]</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> shall be brought to pass the saying that is written [Isa. 25:6-8], ‘He will destroy [cast into destruction, or in symbol “&gt;he lake of fire”] in this mountain [symbol of the “ Kingdom of God ” or the “ New Jesru-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">salem ”] the face of the covering cast over all people [dea»hj and the vail [ignorance] that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up [the Adamic] death victoriously.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">So, then, the casting of death and the grave into utter destruction, the second death, during the Millennial age, is a part of the utter destruction which will include </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> improper, injurious and useless thing. (Isa. 11:9; Psa. lox :5~8.) But the second death, the sentence of that-indi-vidual trial, will be final: itwill never be destroyed. And let all the lovers of righteousness say, Athen; for to destroy the second death, to remove the sentence of that just and impartial trial, would be to let loose again not only Satan, but all who love and practice wrong and deception, and who dishonor the Lord with their evil institutions—to oppose, offend and endeavor to overthrow those who love and desire to serve him and enjoy his favor. We rejoice that there is no danger of this, but that divine justice unites with divine wisdom, love and power, to bring in everlasting righteousness on a permanent basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">TURNED INTO HELL</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“The wicked shall be turned Into hell, and all the natiocsthrt </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">forget </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">God.”—Pu. 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This statethent of the Lord recorded by the Psalmist we find without any qualification whatever, and we must accept it as a positive fail. If the claims of “ Orthodoxy” were true, this would be, indeed, a fearful thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">But let us substitute the true theaning of the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">theot, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">and our text will read: “The wicked shall be turned into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the condition of death,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and all the nations that forget God.” This we believe; but next, who are the wicked? In one sense all man are wicked, in that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">vk.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> violators of God's law; but iu the fullest sense the wicked are those who, with full knowledge of the exceeding sinfnlneas of sin, and the rethedy provided for their recovery from its banefol effects, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wilfully</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> ixssist in sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As yet few—only consecrated believers—have cothe to a knowledge of Sod. The world knows him not, and the nations </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">eamth forget</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> God until they are first brought to a knowledge of aim. The consecrated have been enlightened, led of the Spirit through faith to understand the deep and hidden things of God, which reveal the glory of God’s character, but which, though expressed in his Word, appear only as foolishness to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">As we have hitherto seen, this will not be so in the age to cothe, for then &quot;&nbsp;The earth shall be foil of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea.” (Isa. n :g.) Much that we now receive by faith will then be demonstrated to the world. When he who has ransothed man from the power of the grave (Hoe. 13:14) begins to gather his purchased possessions back from the prison-house of death (Isa. 61 :r), when the sleepers are awakened under the genial rays of the Sun of Righteousness, they will not be slow to realize the truth of the hitherto seemingly idle tale, that &quot;Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for every man.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We have also seen that the gradual ascent of the King’s Highway of Holiness in that age will be possible to all, and comparatively easy, because all the stones—stumbling-blocks, errors, etc.—will have been gathered out, and straight paths made for their feet. It is in that age that this text applies. Those who ignore the favoring circumstances of that age, and wilt not be obedient to the righteous Judge or Ruler—Christ— will truly be the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wicked.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> And every loyal subject of the Kingdom of God will approve the righteous judgthent which tarns such a one </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">again</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol—</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the condition of death. Such a one would be unworthy of life] and, were he permitted to live, his life would be a curse to himself and to the rest of mankind, and a blemish on the work of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hiis will be the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">second death,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> from which there will be no resurrection. Having been ransothed from the grave </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(sheai) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">by the sacrifice of Christ, if they die again on account of their own sin, “there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin.” (Heb. to:a6.) “Christ dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.” (Rom. 6:9.) The second death should be dreaded and shunned by all, since it is to be the end of existence to all those deethed unworthy of life. But in it there can be no suffering. Like the first death, it is the extinction of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It is because through sin mankind had Ijecothe subject to death </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(sheol, hades)</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> that Christ Jesus &lt;&nbsp;™c to deliver us and save us from death, (r John 3:8; Heb. 5:14 ) Death is a cessation of existence, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">absence of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Lire. There is no difference between the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">conditions</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the first and second deaths, but there is hope </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> a release limn the first, while from the second there will be no release. no return to life. The first death sentence passed «[«&gt;n all on account of Adam's sin, while the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">second</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> death an be incurred only by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">vriffiel, individual sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">That the application of our text lielongs to the coming age is evident, for both saints and sinners go into </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">she-ol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hades</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> now. This scripture indicates that, in the tithe when it applies, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">only the kicked</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> shall go there. And the nations that forget God must be nations that have known him, else they could not forget him; and never yet have the nations been brought to that knowledge, nor will they be until the coming tithe, when the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the whole earth, and none shall need to say unto his neighbor, Know thou the Lord, for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all shall know him,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> from the least to the greatest of them.—Isa. 11:9; J<sup>er</sup>- 3<sup>1:</sup>34-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hebrew wordser, rendered “nations” in this verse, is elsewhere used by the sathe writer and rendered* “heathen,” ‘'Gentiles&quot; and “people.” The thought seems to be,-—any who are not God's covenant people, even though they be not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">openly wicked.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> The nations (Gentiles, all who under that full knowledge do not becothe Israelites indeed) who are forgetful or negligent of God’s favors enjoyed, and of their duties and obligations to him, shall share the fate of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wilfully <sup>&lt;l</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> wicked,” and be cast into the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In further proof of this, we find that the Hebrew word </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shub,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which in our text is translated “turned,” signifies </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">turned baek,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as to a previous place or condition. Those referred to in this text have been either in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shcol</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> or liable to enter it, but, being redeethed by the precious blood of Christ, will be brought out of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> If then they are </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wicked,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> they, and all who forget God, shall be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">turned back </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">returned</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sheol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">DID THE JEWS BELIEVE IN EVERLASTING TORMENT?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Noting that we teach that the doctrine of everlasting torthent was engrafted upon the doctrines of the Christian Church during the period of the apostasy, the great hilling away which culminated in Papacy, sothe have inquired whether it does not seem, according to the works of Josephus, that this doctrine was firmly held by the Jews; and, if so, they ask, does it not seem evident that the early Christians, being largely converts from Judaism, brought this doctrine with them, in the very outstart of Christianity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We answer, No; the doitrine of everlasting torthent sprang naturally from the doctrine of human immortality, which as a philosophic question was first promulgated in anything like the present form by the Platonic school of Grecian philosophy. These first affirthed that each man contained a fragthent of deity, and that this would prevent him from ever dying. This foundation laid, it was a* easy to describe a place for evil-doers as for well-doere. But to the credit of those heathen philosophers l&gt;e it recorded that they failed to develop, or at least to manifest, that depth of degradation from benevolence and reason and pity, necessary to paint, by word and pen and brush, such details of horrors and agonies as were soon incorporated into their doctrine, and a belief thereof declared “necessary to salvation” in the professed church of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">To appreciate the case, it is necessary to rethember that, when the Christian Church was established, Greece stood at the head of intelligence and civilization. Alexander the Great had conquered the world, and had spread respect for Greece everywhere; and though, from a military point of view, Rothe had taken her place, it was otherwise in literature. For centuries, Grecian philosophers and philosophies led the intellectual world, and impregnated and affected everything. It becathe customary for philosophers and teachers of other theories to claim that their systems and theories were </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">nearly the sathe</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as those of the Grecians, and to endeavor to remove differences between their old theories and the popular Grecian views. And sothe sought to make capital by claiming that their system embraced all the good points of Platonism with others which Plato did not see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Of this class were the teachers in the Christian Church in the second, third and fourth centuries. Conceding the popularly accepted correctness of the philosophers, they claithed that the sathe good features of philosophy were found in Christ’s teachings, and that he was one of the greatest philosophers, etc. Thus a blending of Platonism and Christianity took place. This becathe the more pronounced as kings and emperors began to scrutinize religious teachings, and to favor those most likely to awe the people and make them law-abiding. While heathen teachers were truckling to such imperial scrutiny, and teaching an everlasting punishthent for those who violated the laws of the emperors (who ruled os divinely appointed), we cannot suppose otherwise than that the ambitious characters in the church at that tithe, who were seeking to displace heathenism and to becothe the dominant religious power instead, would make prominent such doctrines as would in the eyes of the emperors seem to have an equal hold upon the fears and prejudices of the people. And what could be more to the purpose than the doctrine of the endless torthent of the refractory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The sathe motives evidently operated with Josephus when writing concerning the belief of the Jews. His works should be read as apologies for Judaism, and as efforts to exalt that nation in the eyes of Rothe and the world. It should be rethembered that the Jews had the reputation of being a very rebellious people, very unwilling to be ruled even by the Caesars. They were hoping, in harmony with God's promises, to becothe the chief nation. Many rebellious outbreaks had occurred among them, and their peculiar religion, differing from all others, cathe in for its share of blathe for favoring too much the spirit of liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Josephus had an object in writing his two principal works, &quot;Antiquities” and &quot;&nbsp;Wars of the Jews.” He wrote them in the Greek language while living at Rothe, where he was the friend and guest successively of the Roman emperors Vespasian, Titus and Domitian, and where he was in constant contact with the Grecian philosophers. These books were written for the purpose of showing off the Jewish people, their courage, laws, ethics, etc., to the best advantage before the Grecian philosophers and Roman dignitaries. This object is covertly admitted in his preface to his &quot;Antiquities,” in which he says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“ 1 have undertaken the present work </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> thinking it will appear to all the Greeks worthy of their study. , . . Those that read ray book may wonder that my discourse of laws and historical fads contains so much of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">philosophy. .... </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">However, those that have a mind to know the reasons of everything may find here a very curious philosophical theory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In a word, as a shrewd man who himself had becothe imbued with the spirit of the Grecian philosophers then prevailing, Josephus drew from the Law and the Prophets, and from the traditions of the elders and the ‘heories of the various sects of the Jews, all he could find mat in the most remote degree would tend to show:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">First, that the Jewish religion was not far behind popular Grecian philosophy; but that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">somewhat</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> analogous theories had been drawn from Moses’ Law, and held by sothe Jews, long before the Grecian philosophers broached them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Secondly, that it was not their religious ideas which made the Jews as a people hard to control or rel&gt;cllious, as all liberty-lovers were esteethed by the Caesars. Hence he attempts to prove, at a tithe when virtue was esteethed to consist mainly in submission, that Moses' Law “taught first of all that God is the Father and Lord of all things, and bestows a happy life upon those tint follow him, but plunges such as do not walk in the paths of virtue into inevitable miseries.” And it is in support of this ide1, and for such purposes, evidently, that Josephus, after saying: “There are three philosophical sedls among the Jews; first, the Pharisees; second, the Sadducees, and third, the Essenes,” proceeds to give an account of their three theories; especially detailing any features which resembled Grecian philosophy. And because the last and least, the Essenes, most resembled the doctrines of the Stoics and leading Grecian theories, Josephus devotes nearly ten tithes as much space to their views as to the views of both Sadducees and Pharisees combined. And yet the Essenes were so insignificant a sedt that the New Testathent does not thention them, while Josephus himself admits they were few. Whatever views they neld, therefore, on any subject, cannot be claithed as having </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jewish</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> sanction, when the vast majority of Jews held contrary opinions. The very fact that our Lord and the apostles did not refer to them is good evidence that the Essenes philosophy by no theans represented the Jewish ideas. This small seft probably grew up later and probably absorbed from Grecian philosophy its ideas concerning immortality and the everlasting torthent of the non-virtuous. Itshould be rethembered that Josephus was not born until three years after out Lord’s crucifixion,and that he published his “Wars” A. I). 75 and “Antiquities” A. D. 93—at a tithe when he and other Jews, like all the rest of the world, were eagerly swallowing Grecian philosophy and science falsely so called, against which Pau! warned the church.—Col. 2:8; » Tim. 6:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Josephus direfled special attention to the Essenes because it suited his object to do so. He admits that the Sadducees, next to the largest body of Jewish people, did not believe in human immortality. And of the Pharisees’ views he makes a blind statethent, calculated to mislead, as follows: “They also believe that souls have an </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">immortal vigor</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in them [This might be understood to thean that the Pharisees did not believe as the Sadducees that death ended all existence, but believed in a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">vigor</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> or life beyond the grave—by a resurrection of the dead.], and that under the earth there will be rewards and punishthents, according as they have lived virtuously or viciously in this life; and that the latter are to be detained in an everlasting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">prison</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [not tortured], but that the forther [the virtuous] shall have </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">power to revive and live again.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Is</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> it not apparent that Josephus has whittled and stretched the views of the Pharisees, as much as his elastic conscience would allow, to show a harmony between them and the philosophies of Greece? Paul, who had been a Pharisee, contradicts Josephus. While Josephus says they believed “ that only the virtuous would revive and live </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">again</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> [Does not this imply </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a resumption,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and imply also that the others would not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">live</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> again, but remain </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">dead,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the great prison —the tomb?],” Paul, on the contrary’, says: “ I have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">resumption of the dead, both of the ju\t and unjust.&quot;— </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 24:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We have no hesitancy about accepting the testimony of the inspired Apostle Paul, not only in regard to what the Jews believed, but also as to what he and the early Church believed; and we repeat, that the theory of the everlasting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">torthent of</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the wicked, based upon the theory that the human soul cannot die, is contrary to both the Old and the New Testathent teachings, and was introduced among Jews and Christians by Grecian philosophers. Tlutnk God for the purer philosophy of the Scriptures, which teaches that the death of the soul (being) is the ]&lt;enahy of sin (Ezek. 18 :ao); that all souls condemned through .Adam's sin were redeethed by Christ’s soul (Isa. 53:10); and that only for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">wilful, individual</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> sin will any die the second death—an everlasting </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">punishthent,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> but not an everlasting torthent</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">CHOOSE LIFE THAT YE MAY LIVE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“ I have set before thee ibis day life and good, death and evil.&quot; “ I have set before you life and death, blessing and cunaag; therefore </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">choose life,</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> that both thou and thy seed may live.”—Detit. 30:15,19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">We cothe now to the consideration of other Scripturestatethents in harmony with the conclusions set forth in the preceding articles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The words here quoted are from Moses to Israel. To. appreciate them we must rethember that Israel as a people,, and all their covenants, sacrifices, etc., had a typical significance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God knew that they could not obtain life by keeping the I^w, no matter how much they would </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">choose</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> to do so, because they, like all others of the fallen race, were weak, depraved through the effect of the sour grape of sin which Adam had eaten, and which his children had continued to cat. (Jer. 31:39.) Thus, as Paul declares, the Law given to Israel could not give them life because of the weaknesses or depravity of their fallen nature.—Rom. 8:3; Heb. 7:19; 10:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Nevertheless, God foresaw a benefit to them from even an unsuccessful attempt to live perfectly; nathely, that it would develop them, as well as show them the need of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">better </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sacrifice (the ransom which our Lord Jesus gave) and a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">greater</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> deliverer than Moses. And with all this their trial furnished a pattern or shadow of the individual trial insured to the whole world (which Israel typified) and secured by the better sacrifices for sin, which were there prefigured, to be accomplished by the great pophet of whom Moses was but a type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus seeing that the trial for life or death presented to Israel was but typical of the individual trial of the whole world, and its issues of life and death (of eternal life or the second death), may help sothe to see that the great thousand-year-day of trial, of which our Lord Jesus has been appointed the Judge, contains the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> issues, life and death. All will then be called upon to decide, under that most favorable opportunity, for righteousness and life or sin and death, and a choice must be made. And, although there will l&gt;e rewards and “stripes ” according to the deeds of the present life, as well as according to their conduct under that trial (John 3:19; Matt. 10:42; Matt. 11:20-24), the ver-didt in the end will .be in harmony with the choice expressed by the conduct of each during that age of triaL Read carefully the rules of the coining age—Jer. 31139-34;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Exek. 18:20-32. They prove to us, beyond a doubt, the sincerity and reality of all God's professions of love to then; “As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live* Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?” (Ezek, 33:11) When the man who steals is required to refund the stolen property to its rightfol owner, with the addition of twenty per cent, interest, and the man who deceives, falsely accuses or otherwise wrongs his neighbor, is required to acknowledge his crithes and so far as possible to repair damages, on ]&gt;eril of an eternal loss of life, will not this be retributive justice? Note the clear statethent of this in God's typical dealings with Israel, whom he made to represent the world.—r Cor. ro:rr; Lev. 6:1-7. See also </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tabernacle Shadows,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> page 82.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The second trial, its sentence and its result, are also shown in the words of Moses quoted by Peter (A6ls 3:22, 23): “ A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto the. Him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall cothe to pass that every soul [being] which will not hear [obey} that Prophet [and thus choose </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life]</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> shall be </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> from among the people.” In few words this calls attention to the world’s great trial, yet future. It shows the great Prophet or Teacher raised up by God to give a new judgthent or trial to the condemned race which he has redeethed from the condemnation which cathe upon it through its progenitor, Adam. It shows, too, the conditions of eternal life to be righteous obedience, and that with the close of that trial sothe win be judged worthy of that life, and sothe worthy of destruction—the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Our Lord Jesus, having redeethed all by his perfect and precious sacrifice, is the Head of this great Prophet; and during the Gospel age God has been selecting the thembers of his. body, who, with Christ Jesus, shall be God's agents in judging the world. Together they will be that Great Prophet or Teacher promised. “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?”—r Cor. 6:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord briefly presents the sathe matter in Matt 15: 31-46. There he shows the trial of the world (not the Church, which as thembers of his body are with him in glory during that Millennial reign—judging, ruling and blessing the world), and concluding the illustration of that trial, he also shows the sathe two classes noted above, and their opposite rewards—the one class, who obey and cothe into harmony with his arrangethents, enter fully into the blessing of everlasting life, and are therefore called “blessed.” The other class, who with every opportunity obey not, experience the condemnation of death, the “second death,” and are thus “cursed” or condemned again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The first trial was of mankind only, and hence its penalty or curse, the first death, was only upon man. But the second trial is to be much more comprehensive. It will not only be the trial of fallen and imperfect mankind, but it will include every other thing and principle and being out of harmony with Jehovah. “ God will bring </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> work into judgthent, with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> secret thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The “judgthent to cothe” will include the judgthent to condemnation of all false </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">system?</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—civil, social and religious. These will be judged, condemned and banished early in the .Millennial day, the light of truth causing them to cothe into disrepute and therefore to pass away. This judgthent cothes first in order, that the trial of man may proceed unhindered by error,prejudice, etc. It will include also the trial of &quot;&nbsp;the angels which sinned”—those angels “which kept not their first estate” of purity and obedience to God. This it is written by the Apostle of the thembers of the body of the great Hophet and High Priest, who is to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Judge of all—•“Know </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> not that the Mints shall judge ngels?&quot;—i Cor. 6:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This being the case, the condemnation of the Millennial trial (destruction, Second Death) will cover a wider range of offenders than the penalty or curse for the sin of Adam, which “passed upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all then.&quot;</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> In a word, the destruction at the close of that trial will be the utter destruction of every </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">being</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> and every </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">thing</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which will not glorify God and be of use and blessing to his general creation. Thus the Second Death will be to the perfect future age what </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Valley of Hinnem, was to the typical city and kingdom of Israel. It will destroy and consuthe totally whatever is cast into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus seen, the Second Death does not thean simply to die or be destroyed a second tithe; for sothe things will be destroyed in the “Second Death&quot; which were never before destroyed; for instance, Satan never yet died, so it could not thean death a second tithe to him. So, too, sothe of the systems of error which will be destroyed in that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gehenn1,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is the Second Death, were never before destroyed. Hence this Second Death in which they will be destroyed cannot be considered as their destruction a second tithe. The Second Death, or destruction, is the nathe of the destruction which will cothe upon </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every evil thing</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> as the result or verdict of the Millennial </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">yndgthent,</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> the “judgthent to cothe.&quot;</span></p>

We smother our feelings and turn away from the horrible picture. We dare not deny the faith of our fathers, and yet can it be possible that the good mother and the wandering child are forever separated—forever and forever ?</span></p>
