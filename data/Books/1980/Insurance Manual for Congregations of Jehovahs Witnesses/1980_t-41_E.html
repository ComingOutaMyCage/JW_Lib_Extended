<h1><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark4"></a>KEY FACTS ABOUT CONGREGATION INSURANCE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">(All references below are to the manual, &quot;Insurance for Congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses.&quot;)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">PROTECTING YOUR KINGDOM HALL</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No insurance covers </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span><span class="font4"> damage or expenses. Insurance provides only a measure of the protection you need. The rest you must provide yourself, protecting your property </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">as if you had no insurance at all</span><span class="font4">. To do this, it is advisable for the elders to select a committee of brothers who will be able to give permanent attention to your hall. The ones assigned should do the following (for details, see section &quot;I. PROTECTING YOUR KINGDOM HALL,&quot; p. 1):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Consider seriously whether you need </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">flood insurance</span><span class="font4">. (See I.H.5, p. 8) Make a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">complete</span><span class="font4"> inspection of your Kingdom Hall on a regular basis. (See</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I.F and I.G, p. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Analyze your Kingdom Hall's </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">security</span><span class="font4"> needs. (See I.B, p. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Make frequent preventive maintenance checks. (See I.C, p. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Determine whether your congregation is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">paying</span><span class="font4"> anyone who works on your Kingdom Hall. Take appropriate steps to have them covered by insurance. (See I.H.l, p. 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Verify that all contractors you hire have necessary Workmen's Compensation and Public Liability insurance. (See I.H.l and I.H.2, p. 7-8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remove </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">cash</span><span class="font4"> from the Kingdom Hall after </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font4"> meeting. (See I.E.l, p. 3) Check your roof for seasonal problems. (See I.C.l and I.C.2, p. 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">f</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">IF YOU HAVE A &quot;LOSS&quot; OR &quot;ACCIDENT&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A &quot;loss&quot; means </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">damage to your Kingdom Hall</span><span class="font4"> or to property owned or being used by the congregation (including cases of theft)• An &quot;accident&quot; means </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">injury to some</span><span class="font4">one or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">damage</span><span class="font4"> to his property (</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> property the congregation is using.) A </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">lawsuit</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">threatened lawsuit</span><span class="font4"> is reported as an &quot;accident.&quot; This includes lawsuits brought by persons upset over judicial actions. (See V.C.3, p. 36.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ALWAYS REPORT EVERY LOSS OR ACCIDENT TO THE SOCIETY, even if you are in doubt as to whether or not your insurance will cover it. You are entitled to the full benefit of the insurance you pay for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IF YOU HAVE A </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">LOSS</span><span class="font4">, FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">AS SOON AS YOU DISCOVER IT</span><span class="font4">. (See instructions in section &quot;IV. LOSSES,&quot; beginning on page 25.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Report</span><span class="font4"> theft, vandalism, or vehicle damage </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">to the police</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Telephone the Society</span><span class="font4"> at (212)625-1240 to report the loss </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">IF</span><span class="font4"> the damage creates a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">hazard</span><span class="font4"> to property or safety or is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">very severe</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Protect your property from further damage or break-ins. Make </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">temporary</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A NONPROFIT CORPORATION </span><span class="font4">repairs, but do not make permanent repairs until the adjuster sent by your insurers has inspected the damage.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">4. WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER YOU DISCOVER THE DAMAGE OR LOSS, send to the Society: (a) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">bills or written estimates</span><span class="font4"> you obtain for all repairs or replacement made necessary by the loss, and (b) the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Loss Report Form</span><span class="font4"> from your congregation file. IF YOU CANNOT DO THIS WITHIN 30 DAYS, write the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. Be prepared for the visit of the adjuster from your insurance company. Be prompt in your dealings with him. Contact </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">the Society</span><span class="font4"> in following up on your claim.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">IF YOU HAVE AN </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">ACCIDENT</span><span class="font4">, FOLLOW THE STEPS BELOW </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">AS SOON AS YOU LEARN ABOUT IT</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(See instructions in section &quot;V. ACCIDENTS,&quot; beginning on page 35.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">you are sued</span><span class="font4">, or if an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">elder</span><span class="font4"> or other member of the congregation is sued because of his assigned work on behalf of the congregation, report the matter as outlined below. Do not hire your own attorney. If you are uncertain what to do, contact the Society. (See V.C.3, p. 36.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If someone has been injured or has had damage to their property, tell them that you do have insurance and that you will report their accident to the insurance company.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Report the accident to the insurance company and the Society, using the Liability Accident Notice form in your congregation file. If you cannot find the form, write the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Send to the Society any legal papers, letters from attorneys, medical bills, or other documents you receive in connection with the accident or lawsuit.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">GENERAL INFORMATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Any congregation</span><span class="font4"> of Jehovah's Witnesses can obtain insurance through the Society. (See II.B, p. 12.) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">If you mortgage<sup>1</sup> your Kingdom Hall</span><span class="font4">, you can still obtain coverage through the Society. If you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">want to insure</span><span class="font4"> a new Kingdom Hall or obtain insurance through the Society, contact the Society. (See II.D, p. 13.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">sell your Kingdom Hall</span><span class="font4">, write the Society immediately to cancel coverage. (See II.I, p. 16.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you want to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">increase the amount of coverage</span><span class="font4"> on your Kingdom Hall, your insurers have arranged to do this automatically. (See II.G, p. 15.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Every building</span><span class="font4"> you own or build (Kingdom Hall, tool shed, house, etc.) must be </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">separately insured</span><span class="font4">. (See II.F, p. 14.) If you acquire land, see II.H, p. 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">make renovations</span><span class="font4"> in your present Kingdom Hall or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">build</span><span class="font4"> a new one, see the pages indicated below to find out:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What to consider when designing your new hall or in planning renovations</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(see I.K, p. 9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When to insure a new hall (see II.D, p. 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What kinds of insurance you may need during construction (see III.C, p. 21;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I.H.1-2, p. 7-8; III.F, p. 23)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What you should do during the construction or renovation to protect the workers and your property (see I.L, p. 10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What to do when you have finished renovations (see II.G, p. 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">INSURANCE FOR CONGREGATIONS OF JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES (For the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This manual contains basic information about insurance for congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses and their Kingdom Halls. This manual has two purposes: (1) for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span><span class="font4"> congregations, it suggests how you can protect persons and property from risks of all kinds, both with the use of insurance and in other ways; (2) for congregations which are insured under the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Society's</span><span class="font4"> group insurance arrangement, it gives procedures and spells out the provisions of your insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since this manual is detailed, your main use of it will be to look up facts and procedures when you need to know them. However, you should give attention to the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">first section</span><span class="font4"> of this manual right away. This section (called &quot;PROTECTING YOUR KINGDOM HALL&quot;) deals with ways that you can protect your Kingdom Hall and the brothers in your congregation. It suggests ways to minimize vandalism, theft, weather damage, fire and injuries. The second section, which explains </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">who can obtain insurance </span><span class="font4">through the Society, and the third section, which lists the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">insurance services</span><span class="font4"> the Society's insurance arrangement offers, should also be useful to most congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This manual is not an insurance policy. It does not try to cover every provision of the Society's group insurance arrangement, but it does give answers to many common insurance questions and problems that you may encounter. It also tries to protect you from common dangers and mistakes, but it does not lay down rules or tell you what decisions to make. You should use your own judgment and your own knowledge of local circumstances when reading everything that follows. If you have a question about legal matters, it is best to consult with someone who can advise you on your local law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We hope that this information will assist you in safeguarding the interests of both the brothers and the property committed into your care.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark13"></a>I. PROTECTING YOUR KINGDOM HALL</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Buying insurance is only the first step in protecting your Kingdom Hall. No insurance will pay for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span><span class="font4"> of the unplanned expenses you will have. In addition, you always pay for what you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">do</span><span class="font4"> receive from the insurance company in future increases in your premiums. Most important, insurance cannot </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">prevent</span><span class="font4"> damage, theft, or injury, or compensate you for the extra work, inconvenience, and pain resulting therefrom. Consequently, in protecting your property your main concern should be to try to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">reduce</span><span class="font4"> the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">risk of accidents and damage</span><span class="font4"> to prevent their occurrence in the first place. The purpose of this section is to help you to use planning and foresight to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Note: When the following refers to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">coverages</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">exclusions</span><span class="font4">, it applies only to congregations which are insured through the Society.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Responsibility for Kingdom Hall Protection</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The body(ies) of elders in your Kingdom Hall have the final responsibility of protecting and maintaining the hall. Although all elders should feel a personal responsibility in this regard, it is advisable to select a committee which will be able to give special attention to this. Such a committee is usually called a &quot;Kingdom Hall operating committee.&quot; Section II.0. of this manual, on page 19, gives further suggestions regarding the makeup of such a committee and its duties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. The Kingdom Hall </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">operating committee</span><span class="font4"> should care for the matters outlined in parts </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">B through G</span><span class="font4"> of this section. The committee should get the help of any other brothers who have skills or knowledge which they may need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">body(ies) of elders</span><span class="font4"> for the Kingdom Hall should consider and follow through on the information in parts </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">H through L</span><span class="font4"> of this section. (Obtain the recommendations of your Kingdom Hall operating committee.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">f &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">B.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Protect Your Kingdom Hall from Crime</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Determine </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">what is valuable</span><span class="font4"> in your Kingdom Hall to a potential thief. Examples are sound equipment, appliances, tools, cash. Lock up, secure, or remove what is valuable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Look at </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">what is vulnerable</span><span class="font4">, either to vandals or to thieves who might want to gain entrance. A criminal will look for the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">weakest point</span><span class="font4"> in your Kingdom Hall's defenses, so you cannot neglect any of them. Examples are windows without bars or electronic alarm system connections, exposed air conditioning units,.roof or cellar openings without sturdy doors, bars, or locks. Protect what is vulnerable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Do you need additional locks or alarm systems? You may, if what you installed when your Kingdom Hall was built is no longer adequate </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">now</span><span class="font4">. Improved security may be well worth the cost. Before you buy, consider the following factors:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Limitations and cost - Do not buy locks or alarm systems that are more extensive or costly than you need. Remember, all locks and alarm systems have some limitations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. Installation - If you install new locks, make sure that you do so only on doors that are sound. (See &quot;Doors,&quot; item 10, and &quot;Locks,&quot; item 11, on page 5 of this section.) Make sure that the installation itself is solid and properly done. If you can, have a professional locksmith do it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. You know best whether your Kingdom Hall needs an electronic alarm system. However, if you are considering installing such a system, the Society has some additional brief information about the different types of such systems available.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Floodlight the exterior of your Kingdom Hall. Improved lighting often deters vandalism and can be a relatively inexpensive way of improving your hall's security. (See &quot;Exterior lighting,&quot; item 5, on page 4 of this section.)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">C.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Preventive Maintenance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Plan regular preventive maintenance on your Kingdom Hall. Most repairs can be kept simpler and less expensive if done when first noticed. Your insurance does not pay for accumulated wear or gradual deterioration. (See below and &quot;G. Inspection Standards,&quot; p. 3, for maintenance checks.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Be alert to the danger of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">roof collapse</span><span class="font4"> resulting from heavy accumulations of ice and snow. (See G.6, p. 4.) Clear out roof drains regularly and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately</span><span class="font4"> remove snow and ice from roofs. Give special attention to this because: (1) to save energy you may have added extra roof insulation, and since less heat can escape through such roofs, snow does not melt as rapidly and may build up until the roof collapses; and (2) unusually heavy ice and snow storms have occurred in areas where roofs are not constructed to withstand them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Roofs</span><span class="font4"> should be checked one to two months </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">before winter</span><span class="font4"> for bubbles or cracks. Immediately after any </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">hailstorm or</span><span class="font4"> heavy or prolonged accumulation of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">snow</span><span class="font4"> and ice, make a thorough check for cracks or holes. If these go unnoticed until rain or melting snow seeps through the roof insulation, furniture, walls, etc., may be damaged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Carpets</span><span class="font4"> can become loose and develop tears and holes, which can cause persons to trip and fall unless repairs are made promptly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Heating, air conditioning and electrical equipment</span><span class="font4"> should be visually checked for signs of wear and rust. Also check hot water heaters for signs of leakage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. For </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">perimeter electronic alarm systems</span><span class="font4">, visually check the taping on exterior windows weekly. On a monthly basis, test system by opening different doors, windows, etc. Check batteries every 3-6 months.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">D.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Safety During Maintenance Work</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Those assigned to care for Kingdom Hall maintenance should: (see &quot;L. Safety . . . During Construction Work,&quot; p. 10)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Never work alone. It is always best to have two brothers at the Kingdom Hall at the same time in case an accident occurs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Be qualified to do the particular job to which they are assigned, to the extent possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Make sure that tools are in good condition, are properly used, and that power tools are properly grounded. No one should ever try to clean, oil or unjam a power tool or power equipment, including a lawn mower, without first turning the equipment </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">off</span><span class="font4"> and disconnecting the power.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">E.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> After-Meeting Inspections</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Have an established procedure for a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">brief inspection</span><span class="font4"> of the Kingdom Hall every time it is used. Such an inspection might include the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Cash picked up from contribution boxes, literature, and magazines (and deposited promptly in bank) (Note: Your insurance does not cover cash. Also, since burglars will smash any locked box which they suspect of containing something of value, you may consider leaving </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">unlocked</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">open</span><span class="font4"> any contribution box from which the money has been removed.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Windows closed and locked</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Heating/air conditioning, sound and appliance equipment turned off</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Restrooms, storage rooms, and all other potential hiding places checked to make sure that no one has intentionally remained behind in Kingdom Hall in order to commit theft or vandalism after everyone has left</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. Doors, including side and rear doors, locked</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. Alarm systems turned on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: From time to time, check to make sure that necessary procedures are being consistently followed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">F.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Annual Inspection of Your Kingdom Hall</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. At least once a year, make a thorough inspection of the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. During the inspection, make a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">written note</span><span class="font4"> of any unsafe or potentially dangerous situation which you find. Promptly make routine repairs and give a report of any major problems to the body(ies) of elders in your Kingdom Hall, along with recommendations for resolving them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. During the inspection, ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. What can we do to protect the Kingdom Hall from theft and vandalism?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. What possible safety hazards do we have?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. Are there fire hazards?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">d. Is the Kingdom Hall vulnerable to flooding or runoff?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">e. Have necessary repairs been neglected? During the coming seasons, could serious damage result?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">G.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Inspection Standards</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In making your inspection, determine whether your Kingdom Hall meets local codes and the standards shown below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">(NOTE: Consider first the restrictions of your </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">local</span><span class="font4"> building, fire, and zoning </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">codes</span><span class="font4">. These codes should be viewed as a protection and not merely as a restriction. In the event that your local codes do not treat in detail some specific area of design, you may wish to refer to the national code which forms the basis for your local code, such as the Uniform Building Code or the BOCA Building Code. Where the national code and your local code differ, it is generally beneficial to apply whatever code provisions are the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">more restrictive</span><span class="font4">. (See M.6., p. 11, in this section.))</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Fences (if your Kingdom Hall has such): in good repair, with solid gates and properly working hinges.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Grounds: ladders and garden hoses </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span><span class="font4"> put away (so that they cannot be used in vandalism or burglary attempts and so that no one will trip over them); no movable materials left near or in Kingdom Hall grounds, including trash cans and incinerators, which could be used in scaling fence or climbing to roof of Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Trees: inspected regularly to confirm they are not diseased; check to make sure limbs are not diseased or damaged by storms, so that they do not fall on automobiles in parking lot, onto property of neighbors, or on Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Sidewalks and parking areas: in good repair, without holes, cracks, or uneven surfaces which would cause someone to slip or fall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. Exterior lighting: sufficient to light whole exterior of Kingdom Hall (not obstructed by trees) and for those walking to and from parking facilites at night; mercury or sodium vapor lamps preferred; plastic or heat-tempered globes or other vandal-resistant enclosures; mounted out of reach of vandals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. Roofs: any roof openings (such as air conditioning vents, skylights, ventilation ducts, roof access hatches, etc.) secured either by strong covers or by bars or grillwork, and by adequate locks and latches, and tied into electronic alarm system if you have such; designate brothers to be prepared to come immediately to Kingdom Hall during times of heavy snowfall to aid in removal of accumulated snow froih roof (as applicable to climate and roof construction). NOTE: In some high-crime areas, Kingdom Halls with flat roofs have had burglars gain entrance by cutting a hole in the roof. Ultrasonic burglar alarms with vibrators in the ceiling on the structure could detect such an attempt.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">7. Exterior steps: secure handrails (where necessary); steps not broken or cracked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">8. Mail slots: It is suggested that no mail slots be used. (Arsonists or vandals have used mail slots to put burning materials, water hoses, etc., in interior of Kingdom Hall.) If a mail slot is used, some protection could be obtained by attaching an enclosed box to the inside of the door so that it completely covers the slot. A mail </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">box</span><span class="font4"> is required for receiving mail, since the post office will not deliver mail without some kind of mail receptacle. (See </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font4">, September, 1979, under &quot;Announcements.&quot;)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">9. Exits: in accordance with local fire regulations; doors clear of obstacles, operate easily and open outward; good-quality panic devices (with no secondary locks) on emergency exits (depending on your local fire regulations and whether or not your main entrance door is usually locked while your Kingdom</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Hall is in use, you may want to install panic devices on </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span><span class="font4"> exit doors); if panic devices are used, installation by experienced installer, a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">locksmith</span><span class="font4"> if possible; (NOTE: generally, key-in-the-knob locks are not suitable for exit doors); exits are clearly marked with lighted signs, and exit signs and lights have emergency power source in case of power failure; landings or platforms outside exits clearly lighted; fire escapes, if any, are usable and safe.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">10. Doors: roll-up gates, in addition to doors, in high-crime areas; door frames strong and securely in place; doors installed with protective metal strip to cover up gap between door and frame (astragal strip); no thin wood or glass panels in door or beside door which are accessible to lock; doors are solidcore wooden type, 1-3/4&quot; thick (or metal doors), where possible; hinges have </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">non-removable</span><span class="font4"> hinge pins. Give cellar doors special attention, since burglars often try entry this way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">11. Locks: (NOTE: high-security, good-quality cylinders are worth the added expense.) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">dead-bolt locks</span><span class="font4"> with a circular or rectangular dead-bolt, if possible. (No spring locks on any outside door.) Locks protected by </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">cylinder guard plate</span><span class="font4"> fastened to the door with round head bolts that cannot be removed with a screwdriver. Locks securely mounted, and bolt constructed so it cannot be cut, extending at least one inch into the receiving plate; locks fit closely with the receiving plate (striker plate); hinges or lock hardware cannot be disassembled from outside of building. (See &quot;Exits,&quot; item 9.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">12. Keys: number of keys limited to those actually needed, and no keys unaccounted for. (If one key is lost, change or re-pin lock cylinders.) &quot;Restricted keys&quot; used if merited by number of keys outstanding and security problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">13. Windows: (35-45% of all reports of losses from Kingdom Halls include damage to glass) all windows have locks. (NOTE: window locks have a very limited usefulness unless windows are also tied in to an electronic alarm system. However, they do provide some crime deterrence against casual attempts to gain entry. If locks are used, key or pin locks are best.) In high-crime areas, windows that are easily accessible have gratings or bars on exterior or interior. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">If warranted by past losses</span><span class="font4"> or cases of vandalism, you might consider:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. WHERE LIGHT IS NEEDED: transparent plastic-type panels such as polycarbonates, instead of glass (polycarbonates resist smashing, as by vandals, but do </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> resist </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">cutting</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">drilling</span><span class="font4">, or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">burning</span><span class="font4">, which a burglar might use to gain entry)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. WHERE LIGHT IS NOT NEEDED: colored steel-laminated panels instead of glass (panels provide protection against vandals, but the window </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">frame </span><span class="font4">could be vulnerable to burglars.) Alternatively, windows could be blocked in.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">14. Curtains: made of fire-retardant fabric or treated with commercial flameproofing liquid.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">15. Electrical systems: all wiring in compliance with the National Electrical Code; no frequent replacement of fuses or resetting of circuit breakers, which indicates overloading of electrical circuits; electrical cabinets kept closed; extension and appliance cords in good condition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">16. Heating/air conditioning systems and appliances: if located on roof, protected by structure housing all around equipment (to protect from vandals); if separate from Kingdom Hall, protected by screen block wall higher than unit (consider maintenance requirements); all electric motors kept clean and adequately ventilated to reduce overheating; appliances grounded; air conditioning and heating equipment cleaned and serviced annually by a competent serviceman before turning on the equipment for the season when it will be used; all heating equipment, including flues, pipes, and ducts, properly insulated and separated from combustible material by a safe distance; heating equipment enclosed in a separate room with fire-resistant walls, doors and ceilings, according to local fire codes; electrical, heating, and air conditioning rooms free of any combustible material, and doors to such rooms locked and marked &quot;Authorized Persons Only.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">17. General housekeeping: combustible trash stored in covered metal containers, disposed of frequently and not accumulated; flammable liquids (paints, varnishes, cleaning solvents, and gasoline for lawn mowers) kept to a minimum and stored in Underwriters Laboratories-approved safety cans (observe local fire department regulations); oily rags disposed of promptly after use; closets, storage and supply rooms kept orderly and free of flammable materials, including oily mops and rags.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">18. Fire protection: one fire extinguisher easily accessible, within 100 feet of any point on </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">each floor</span><span class="font4">, serviced annually and tagged with the date of the last servicing; extinguisher should be type designed for kind of fire which might occur in that portion of Kingdom Hall—use multiple purpose extinguisher if electrical or gasoline fire is possible; automatic extinguishing systems (as in kitchens) serviced semi-annually; fire hoses, fire alarms, or automatic sprinklers tested and inspected annually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">19. Electronic alarm systems (if your Kingdom Hall has such): checked by competent service personnel at least yearly; all brothers who do lock-up familiar with procedure to activate; system has back-up batteries in case of power failure, or has automatically recharging battery system.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">20. Water pipes: all pipes well insulated to protect against freezing, with extra insulation during periods of extreme cold (if applicable to your area). Special attention given to pipes (1) in ceilings, (2) in outside walls, or (3) below ground level without adequate earth cover.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">21. Bathroom plumbing: where connected to drains or city sewer system, backwater valves installed to prevent water backup. (Note: your insurance does not cover backup from drains or sewers.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">22. Kitchens (as applicable): </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">over stoves</span><span class="font4">, overhead hood and duct work cleaned on a regularly scheduled basis to eliminate accumulated grease and dirt to reduce possibility of fire.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">23. Interior stairs: secure handrails; secure tiles with rubber treads or other anti-slip surface with safety nosings, or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">secure</span><span class="font4"> carpet with no holes; adequate lighting; doors to stairs kept closed when stairs are not in use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">24. Storage of sound equipment: (almost all burglaries involve attempts to take the microphones, amplifier, turntable, and related equipment) store sound equipment in closed cabinet with lock (see &quot;Locks&quot; item 11 in this section). Location of cabinet should not be obvious. Amplifier and turntable should, if possible, be permanently attached to cabinet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">25. Literature and congregation records: not stored on floor, if possible, since may be damaged by flooding in rainstorms, flooding by vandals, or backup of sewers into Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">26. Identification of movable appliances, sound equipment, etc.: &quot;Insurance&quot; file in your congregation files should contain an inventory of all Kingdom Hall furniture, sound equipment, appliances, tools, valuable reference works in library, and anything else of unusual value. Inventory should show model number and year (approximate), description of item. (Cost need </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> be necessarily included, since what you would receive in the event of a loss would be determined by the current replacement cost, not the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">original</span><span class="font4"> cost to you.) One method of taking such an inventory is by photographing the entire interior (and exterior, if applicable) of your Kingdom Hall. Copies of the inventory in whatever form may be kept at some place other than the Kingdom Hall so that the inventory would not be lost in the event of a fire. Often available from your police department, an etching pen can be used to mark appliances, sound equipment, etc., with the congregation name and some other identification in the event the article should be stolen.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">27. Termite protection: yearly inspection by licensed exterminators to confirm that no termite or similar insects have caused damage to Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">28. Flood protection: gutters or surface trenches maintained to minimize possible damage to property of Kingdom Hall or neighbors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">29. Storage sheds and other buildings on Kingdom Hall property: check items 1-28 above, as applicable.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">H.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Insurance and Contractors</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">(Note: &quot;Contractors&quot; may include any independent businessmen you hire to do a specific job or provide a service, such as exterminators, roofers, fuel oil suppliers, plumbers, general contractors (for construction), and others.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Your insurance does </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">NOT</span><span class="font4"> cover'injuries to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">any person or contractor who is paid</span><span class="font4">. Only </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">volunteer</span><span class="font4"> workers are covered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">If a paid worker is injured while working at your Kingdom Hall, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">his employer </span><span class="font4">must pay the cost of treating the injury. If </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">your congregation</span><span class="font4"> is the employer, you must buy Workmen's Compensation insurance to cover such workers. (See III.F., p. 23.) If a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">contractor</span><span class="font4"> is the employer, he should have Workmen's Compensation insurance or accident insurance with comparable benefits to cover his employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: Most employers, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">including your congregation</span><span class="font4">, are required </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">by law</span><span class="font4"> to buy Workmen's Compensation insurance for their paid workers. If your congregation hires anyone who does not carry the insurance the law requires, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">you</span><span class="font4"> may be held responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, you should obtain a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">certificate of insurance</span><span class="font4"> from all contractors you hire to work at your Kingdom Hall showing that they have Workmen's Compensation insurance. If a contractor is not required by law to have Workmen's Compensation insurance, obtain a copy of the accident insurance policy for his employees. As soon as you receive such policies or certificates of insurance, forward a copy of them to the Society.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">contractor</span><span class="font4"> damages your Kingdom Hall during his work there, the cost of repairs may have to be paid </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">by the contractor</span><span class="font4">, not by your insurance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, you may want to require that your contractors have public liability insurance. If you require such insurance, obtain a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">certificate of insurance </span><span class="font4">from your contractors.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. If your congregation owns any vehicles used on public roads, they should be covered by liability insurance and any other coverage required by the laws of your state. (See III.G., p. 24.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. If there is an apartment located on the Kingdom Hall premises or if any insured building has temporary or permanent tenants, the personal possessions of the tenants are </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not covered</span><span class="font4"> by your insurance. (See VI.C.13., p. 44.) Property now owned by the congregation or being used by it can be covered by a &quot;Homeowners' Tenants Policy&quot; purchased by the one living on the Kingdom Hall property.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. Your insurance does not cover damage from </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">floods</span><span class="font4"> or rising water. If your Kingdom Hall is located in a low-lying area where such a danger exists, see III.D., p. 22.)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">I.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Getting the Help of Others</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Neighbors of Kingdom Hall: develop friendly relations with neighbors. Using discretion and your knowledge of local circumstances, visit neighbors to ask whether they have any problems with traffic, noise, parking, or other problems related to the Kingdom Hall, and to ask how you can resolve them. You may leave with neighbors telephone numbers of local elders, with encouragement to call them if anything suspicious is noted at the Kingdom Hall. Use discretion in this. (Note: neighbors may not be inclined to call </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">police</span><span class="font4"> on our behalf, since they may not want to get involved in making a report to the police.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">In cities</span><span class="font4">, if adjoining buildings are vacant, and if there is possibility of someone's gaining entry to Kingdom Hall through the wall or from the roof of an adjoining building, make effort to contact owner of building. If no response from owner, make effort to contact city authorities to report situation and have them remedy problem. (At the same time, if the problem cannot be resolved, you may want to give consideration to installing an alarm system suitable for this situation.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Patrols of Kingdom Hall by congregation members: on nights when there is no meeting (this procedure is often followed in those cases where (a) repeated acts of vandalism or burglary have taken place; (b) threats against the Kingdom Hall have been made; or (c) a construction project is under way and equipment and materials on the worksite cannot be locked up or removed after working hours). Carried out by several different members of congregation, if possible; checks made on all nights of week, at different times of night.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Local fire and police departments: take the initiative to develop friendly relations with local fire and police departments. Ask tactfully what suggestions they have to improve security and fire prevention standards of Kingdom Hall. Some departments will be glad to send a representative to inspect the Kingdom Hall. Police may be asked if the Kingdom Hall could be included in their regular patrols.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">J.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Emergency Planning</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">As you consider appropriate to your circumstances, give attention to what contingency plans you might make to deal with emergencies which might occur during meetings or which might threaten the Kingdom Hall at other times. Such emergencies might include the following: power failure, bomb threat, riot (including disturbances during strikes by police or firemen), flood, fire, hurricane or tornado, earthquake. You may want to have a brief (generally not more than two or three minutes) review on the Service Meeting of procedures to follow in case of fire or other emergency (such as, attendants alert to keep exits unobstructed, audience remain calm and orderly, follow direction by one on platform and attendants).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">K.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Kingdom Hall Design</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">When you are building a new Kingdom Hall or making renovations on your present one, among your </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">first considerations</span><span class="font4"> should be safety and security. These begin with design, not just with use. The various elements of safety engineering and planning for maximum security should be considered at the very beginning of your project, not just added at the last minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cost is an important factor in design decisions. However, one incident of severe damage or one incident of arson or vandalism could cost hundreds of dollars and much time before your Kingdom Hall could be used again. Even insured losses are reflected in increased premiums. Do not jeopardize your considerable investment in your Kingdom Hall by trying to save money on the very things that will protect that investment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Adherence to codes is also necessary. Fire, building, and zoning codes represent accumulated professional judgment on design standards. As such, they are valuable and should be viewed as a protection, not a hindrance. (See the comments regarding codes at the beginning of section &quot;I.G. Inspection Standards,&quot; pp. 3-4.) Taking into account all factors, consider the following questions from the viewpoint of accident prevention and crime protection:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Are there any unguarded stairways or changes in floor level which are not obvious? If so, a severe fall could result. Railings should be of adequate strength and height; balusters should be placed close enough together to protect small children from falling through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Is lighting sufficient? Bear in mind that interior and exterior lighting contribute much to safety and to crime protection. Give special attention to passageways and stairs. Have you planned an emergency lighting system for building exits (and other key points, such as stairs, if necessary)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Does the placement of entrances and exits recognize them for what they are—potential weaknesses in your Kingdom Hall's security? For example, hidden windows and recessed exits out of public view could shelter a potential vandal or burglar seeking to gain entrance to the Kingdom Hall. Have the door and window frames, the kind of doors, the lock hardware specified, and the installation of all of these been done with a view to good quality and protection from crime? Will the funds allocated for these be sufficient for these purposes, rather than just enough to buy the least expensive types available? Have you installed wiring conduits for burglar alarm systems for all doors and windows? By incorporating them in your design, you can install such systems at a later date with a minimum of expense and effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How can you protect sound equipment from theft? Can it be stored and operated out of sight? Can equipment be (1) attached to walls or counters, (2) stored in lockable cabinets with good quality locks, or (3) installed in a separate room?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have you considered the proximity of nearby buildings and fences and the possible ways that a burglar or vandal could use them to gain entrance to your building or its roof? Have you taken steps to prevent such?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To what extent will windows be necessary for light, and could such be eliminated? (Of course, the elimination of windows may entail the installation of a more extensive mechanical ventilating system.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Have you carefully checked your local building, fire, and zoning codes for their requirements for structural integrity, number and placement of exits, interior and exterior fire resistance of building materials, provision for the handicapped, and so forth?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">L.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Safety and Security During Construction Work</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Construction or remodeling work involves many potential dangers, and all persons connected with such work need to be concerned with safety and security. Following are suggestions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. In construction or remodeling projects, select one brother to care for safety and security. Select a brother who is knowledgeable in construction matters and who will be working regularly on the job. (NOTE: Be practical in applying the following suggestions. Do not spend unreasonable amounts of time in safety instruction or make long lists of rules for work. Instead, help the workers on the project to be conscious of safety.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. No one should work </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">alone</span><span class="font4"> on the construction site. Brothers should coordinate their schedules so that there will always be someone else on the site with them. In case of accident, someone may be needed to provide basic first aid, call for help, or take an injured person to a hospital.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">For the same reason, a nearby public telephone or an automobile should always be available to the workers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Keep work area clean and orderly; keep tools in place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Do not leave construction materials and equipment unprotected on the construction site, since your insurance does not cover theft if such items </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">can</span><span class="font4"> be locked up. After work is finished for the day, lock up tools, equipment, and ladders or take them. Thoroughly tie down anything you cannot lock up or take away after work. Schedule the delivery of materials so that a minimum will be stored on the worksite overnight. In high-crime areas, or according to the judgment of the construction committee, you may want to post brothers as watchmen around the clock at the worksite overnight.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. Provide protective clothing (hard hats, safety shoes, goggles, gloves, dust masks) for brothers who are doing work in which they would normally be required to wear such, especially if they do such work more than just once or twice. (Perhaps such equipment could be borrowed by the congregation or by individuals, rather than purchased.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. Many brothers have limited or no experience in the work they are doing on a construction project. Have more experienced workers train less experienced to be aware of the following: dangerous moving parts, on-off switch locations, electrical dangers, ways to lift heavy loads, etc.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Assign </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">children and youths</span><span class="font4"> to work with an adult, not alone. Do not permit them to use power tools requiring more strength or skill than they possess. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Visitors</span><span class="font4"> to the worksite should be restricted to areas that are not dangerous.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">7. Give special attention to scaffolds and ladders. Make sure that scaffolds are strong enough to bear the weight of all those who will use them and that they have stable supports. Ladders should be long enough (if used to reach a roof, should extend </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">above</span><span class="font4"> the roof), in good repair, and on a solid base.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">8. Inspect power tools to make sure that they are properly grounded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">9. Always have equipment available to extinguish fires. In most cases a source of running water and buckets will be sufficient. If flammable liquids or electrical fires are a possibility, have a portable ABC-type extinguisher on hand, and show workers how to use it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">10. Give consideration to first aid.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Keep appropriate </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">first aid supplies</span><span class="font4"> or a first aid kit at the worksite at all times (primarily those supplies which would be needed to control bleeding).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. Decide </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">what to do in the event of an accident</span><span class="font4">, and go over the procedure with everyone. Discuss the matter often enough to keep what should be done fresh in the minds of all workers. Include the following points: remove any immediate cause of danger, keep injured person calm, do not move if danger of broken bones, notify one of designated brothers on worksite to supervise other steps (if familiar with procedures to control bleeding, attempt to do so by direct pressure or dressings; have someone telephone for ambulance, if necessary; have injured person transported to hospital).</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Who Is Covered by the Society's Insurance Arrangement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The Society's arrangement insures your congregation if you regularly meet in a Kingdom Hall which has one of the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. An insurance account with the Society</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. A loan from the Society</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. A commercial loan for Kingdom Hall construction arranged through the Society</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">B.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Who Is Eligible for the Society's Insurance Arrangement</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Any congregation</span><span class="font4"> of Jehovah's Witnesses in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) can obtain insurance through the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. A congregation which mortgages its Kingdom Hall to someone other than the Society can still obtain insurance through the Society's arrangement. However, if a local bank or individual gives you a mortgage loan, the lender will usually ask for proof that you have insurance. In that case, give the Society the following facts:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">name and address</span><span class="font4"> of the lender (along with the name or department to whom correspondence regarding your loan should be sent)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">amount of insurance required</span><span class="font4"> by the lender</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. Any special requirements of the lender, including the date by which it must have proof of your coverage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ •</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The Society will try to provide whatever the lender requires and will send to your congregation a copy of any correspondence with it. Once you have taken the steps shown above, your coverage will continue in effect as before. Neither your coverage nor the cost of your insurance will change.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. If you have a Kingdom Hall loan with the Society, you obtained coverage through the Society at the time you received your loan. After that, your coverage continues without any further action on your part. If you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">pay off </span><span class="font4">your loan with the Society, your coverage will </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> be cancelled. You will continue to be covered, and no further action or additional premium will be required at that time. (See &quot;J. Term of Coverage and Billing,&quot; p. 16.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Your congregation does not have to own its Kingdom Hall in order to be insured through the Society's arrangement. If the congregation rents or leases the property, it can still be insured for (1) protection against lawsuits and claims for injury, and (2) theft, fire, and other risks for items owned by the congregation. The property insured can include additions and improvements to the rental property and the contents of the Kingdom Hall (chairs, sound equipment, etc.).</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">C.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Other Insurance</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The Society's insurance arrangement includes all basic kinds of coverage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Therefore, as soon as the Society's coverage begins, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">cancel other insurance immediately</span><span class="font4">. Your previous insurance company should refund the unused part of the insurance premium. (NOTE: If you have flood insurance, do </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">NOT</span><span class="font4"> cancel it.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Before you buy other insurance, contact the Society to determine if it would duplicate the coverage you already have or if the services you need can be provided under your present insurance. (See section III, p. 20.)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">D.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Insuring New Kingdom Halls</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If your congregation </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">rents</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">buys</span><span class="font4"> a new Kingdom Hall, begin insurance coverage with the Society </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately</span><span class="font4">. If you buy new property, do this as soon as you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">take title</span><span class="font4"> to it; if you rent, do this when you begin occupancy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If your congregation is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">building</span><span class="font4"> a new Kingdom Hall:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. If the Society's arrangement insures your present Kingdom Hall, insure the new property </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">as soon as you begin construction</span><span class="font4">. This is advisable, since construction involves many potentially dangerous situations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. If the Society's arrangement does not insure your present Kingdom Hall, insure the new property </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">as soon as you take title</span><span class="font4">. (If you do not begin construction immediately, it will be necessary for you to write the Society again when you do.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: Regarding Builder's Risk insurance (temporary construction insurance), see III.C, p. 21.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. The body(ies) of elders for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">all</span><span class="font4"> the congregations meeting in the Kingdom Hall should meet to decide what coverage is needed and from whom it should be obtained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Once the combined bodies of elders for all concerned congregations have made a decision, each body of elders should submit a resolution to its respective congregation. For insurance purchased through the Society's arrangement, the resolution may read as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">RESOLUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RESOLVED, THAT we purchase insurance for our Kingdom Hall through the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania under its group insurance arrangement. We understand that this insurance includes fire, extended coverage, and public liability coverage. We agree to pay the cost of premiums charged for such insurance in no more than five payments after we are billed. We understand that this includes interest charged monthly on any unpaid balance due, at the rate currently charged.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">E.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Obtaining Coverage Through the Society</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">To insure your Kingdom Hall under the Society's arrangement:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Write the Society a letter requesting insurance coverage, giving the address of the property. State whether (1) you are building a new Kingdom Hall; (2) your Kingdom Hall is mortgaged to someone other than the Society; or (3) you are renting your Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. The Society will answer with a general letter of instructions, along with Property Description Forms. Complete the forms </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">within 60 days</span><span class="font4"> of their receipt. Send two copies to the Society, keeping one copy for the congregation file.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. As soon as your request is received and acknowledged by the Society, your Kingdom Hall is covered by insurance under the Society's arrangement. Therefore, when you receive the Society's acknowledgment to your first letter, you may cancel any insurance coverage previously in force on your Kingdom Hall, with the exception noted in C.l, p. 12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Set up a separate folder in your congregation file for all congregation insurance matters. Mark the folder &quot;Insurance,&quot; and place your congregation's copy of the Property Description Form in this file, along with all other correspondence relating to insurance received from the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. Send to the Society the resolutions adopted by the congregations using the Kingdom Hall (see D.4, p. 13). Keep a copy in the files of the respective congregations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. Comply with all other instructions in the letter sent to you in response to your first inquiry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">7. The Society will acknowledge receipt of the forms, resolution, and other information you have sent. At the same time, you will be sent other information about your coverage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">8. Based on the information you submitted on the Property Description Forms, your insurers will give your Kingdom Hall an insured value. That value will be used to figure the amount of your insurance premium. When the Society has been advised of that amount, it will then send you a bill. Payment should be made as indicated in &quot;K. Payment of Your Bill,&quot; p. 17.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">F.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Other Buildings on Congregation Property</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. You can include in your Kingdom Hall insurance </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">any</span><span class="font4"> building the congregation owns or rents. However, no structure is automatically covered by insurance. You must specifically </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">request coverage for each particular building</span><span class="font4"> on your congregation's property. To insure other buildings, follow the same procedure as for Kingdom Halls. (See D, p. 13.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Unless you insure </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font4"> building on congregation property, you will not be protected against lawsuits and claims that may result from injuries in those buildings. Neither will you be insured for theft or damage to things stored inside them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Your Kingdom Hall insurance can also include a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mobile home</span><span class="font4"> that is owned by </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">the congregation</span><span class="font4">. It can be located on property that the congregation does not own. To be insured, the mobile home must be permanently secured (permanently attached on its foundation on the property where it is located) and parked in a protected area (near other houses, not isolated or distant from other dwellings.) If the mobile home meets these requirements, follow the steps shown in D. of this section. Show on the Property Description Form (1) &quot;Mobile Home;&quot; (2) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">length</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">location</span><span class="font4"> of the mobile home; and (3) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">value</span><span class="font4"> of the home itself (and its contents, if they are owned by the congregation).</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">G.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Insured Value of Your Property/Additions and Improvements</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">To be fully protected by insurance, every building must be insured for the full amount of its current replacement cost. It is your responsibility to do this for your congregation's property. In order to do so, you must provide your insurers with an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">up-to-date</span><span class="font4"> Property Description Form (formerly called &quot;Survey Form&quot;) for all buildings. This means that if you make major changes in the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">dimensions</span><span class="font4"> of your Kingdom Hall or its </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">outside structure</span><span class="font4">, you should:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Write to the Society for new Property Description Forms.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Complete the Property Description Forms and take photographs of the Kingdom Hall from the vantage points that would show any recent changes or improvements. Send to the Society at least two such photographs with two copies of the completed forms.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. If your insurers believe the insured value of your property should be changed, they will follow the steps in E.8, p. 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. To </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">increase the value of your Kingdom Hall</span><span class="font4"> for any reason other than a change in the outside dimensions or structure of the building, write a brief letter to the Society. State what you believe to be the current value of (1) your Kingdom Hall building and (2) its contents. (Your insurers do </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> require that you hire a real estate appraiser or get a written estimate of your Kingdom Hall's value. A letter from your congregation is sufficient.) If your insurers agree with the new values you have recommended for your Kingdom Hall, they will follow the steps in E.8, p. 14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Note: Recently, rapid increases in property values have made it difficult for many congregations to keep the insured values of their Kingdom Halls up-to-date. If you have a loss or damage while your Kingdom Hall is temporarily underinsured, your insurers have agreed that you will still receive the full settlement due you. It is anticipated that the insured values of all Kingdom Halls will be adjusted automatically each year, commencing in the near future. This adjustment will be based on a current appraisal guide or standard index. When the automatic adjustment is made, the Society will inform you of the new amount of insurance on your Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">H.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Land Owned by the Congregation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">If the congregation has land on which there is presently no Kingdom Hall or other building being used by the congregation:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Land without buildings</span><span class="font4"> is automatically covered by your present Kingdom Hall insurance. It is not necessary to notify the Society to have such property insured. If your congregation is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> presently insured through the Society's arrangement, contact the Society as soon as you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">take title</span><span class="font4"> to any new property. For vacant land, the coverage which applies protects the congregation in the event of accidents on your property. (See section &quot;VII. POLICY TERMS -CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS,&quot; p. 45.) (There is no coverage on vacant land for risks described under section VI, p. 41.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If there are </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">buildings on the property</span><span class="font4"> when the congregation acquires it, write to the Society to have them insured. (See F, p. 14.) This should be done even if the buildings on the property are vacant or if you plan to have them demolished soon, because of the possibility that someone may venture on the congregation's property and be injured there, later holding the congregation responsible for his injury.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">I.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Cancellation of Insurance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Once you have obtained coverage through the Society, your insurance will continue in effect, and you will be charged the full premium each time it is automatically renewed, until you advise the Society in writing to cancel it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. You cannot transfer your insurance to anyone except another congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. That means that if you sell your Kingdom Hall, you must cancel the insurance coverage as of the date of the sale.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. You are billed for your premium by the Society, not directly by the insurance company. Since the Society pays the premium for all Kingdom Halls as a group </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">in advance</span><span class="font4">, you cannot cancel your insurance by simply not paying the premium for which you are billed by the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. To </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">cancel your insurance</span><span class="font4">, write the Society a brief letter stating the address of the property and why you are cancelling coverage on it. On receipt of your letter the Society will cancel your insurance and begin procedures to refund to you the unused portion of the insurance premium you have already paid.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. The date the Society receives your letter requesting cancellation determines the amount of your refund. You will be credited with the amount of the premium for the full month if your request is received before the fifteenth of the month; after the fifteenth you will be charged for the full month.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">J.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Term of Coverage and Billing</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Since your Kingdom Hall is insured through policies which are carried in the name of the Society, coverage is continuous from year to year. Coverage continues until the congregation requests that insurance be cancelled for a particular building or property. Your policy does not lapse for non-payment of premium.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. You will receive a bill for your congregation's share of the insurance premium under the following conditions:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. When you insure a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">new</span><span class="font4"> Kingdom Hall or add other congregation property to your coverage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. When you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">increase the insured value</span><span class="font4"> of your present property, as when you make a major improvement or addition to your Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. When insurance coverage is being renewed for all congregations under the Society's arrangement. You are sent a bill periodically for such renewals; the most recent one was sent in 1978. (In the future it is anticipated that such bills will be sent on an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">annual</span><span class="font4"> basis.)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">K.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Payment of Your Bill</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">When you receive a bill from the Society for your insurance premium:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If your congregation </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">has a Kingdom Hall loan with the Society</span><span class="font4">, your regular monthly loan payments include insurance charges. Therefore, you are not required to make any </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">additional</span><span class="font4"> payment to the Society. (Your congregation’s insurance premium will be added to the current balance of your loan, and you should note this charge on your congregation's mortgage records.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If your congregation has an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">insurance account only</span><span class="font4"> with the Society (that is, does not have a loan with the Society), you should do the following:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Within 30 days of the date on the bill, bring it to the congregation's attention and make payment to the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. If your congregation cannot pay the entire bill within 30 days of the date of the bill, try to pay it in full in five monthly payments or less. Interest will be charged </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">each month</span><span class="font4"> on the unpaid balance and will be added to the balance due.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. If your congregation cannot pay the entire bill in five monthly payments, write to the Society to explain your situation. At the same time, begin to pay what you can as soon as your circumstances permit. Additional time can be granted if you need it, but you should make an effort to pay the full premium as soon as you are able. Keep in mind that you will ’ need to include interest charges in your payments.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. If your congregation has a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">commercial loan</span><span class="font4"> for Kingdom Hall construction </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">arranged through the Society</span><span class="font4">, follow the procedures shown in 2. above.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">If you make any major changes in the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">structure</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">exterior dimensions</span><span class="font4"> of insured buildings, you must notify your insurers through the Society. (See G, p. 15.) Inform the Society also of any change in the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">chief use</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">purpose</span><span class="font4"> of any buildings you have insured. For example, notify the Society if you convert a Kingdom Hall into a residence building. However, aside from these things, it is not necessary to let the Society know if you make other changes in the property you have insured. For example, your insurers have no restrictions or limitations on matters such as the following: type of heating systems used, distance from high-tension electrical lines, distance from a fire hydrant or from a fire station, storage of dangerous materials or flammable liquids, length of time that a building can be left unoccupied, type of fire sprinkler systems to be used (if any), or use of a part of a building for rental property, either temporarily or permanently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before you make changes in the equipment or structure of your Kingdom Hall, make sure first that they will meet the requirements of your local fire, building and zoning codes. However, your main concern is the potential consequences—safety, security, and fire protection—of any changes you make. What your insurers and the local codes will </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">permit</span><span class="font4"> is secondary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since you are insured through a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">group</span><span class="font4">, your insurers will not lower your premium if you add fire protection or security protection equipment to your Kingdom Hall. In most cases, what you are now paying is already much less than what you would pay for the same coverage if your congregation purchased it individually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Occasionally, your insurers may make brief inspections of your property to assist you in improving the security and safety of your Kingdom Hall or to verify that its insured value is correct. Before making such an inspection, your insurers will contact an elder in one of the congregations meeting in your Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">M.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Relationship Between the Insurer, the Society, and Your Congregation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">The Society does not itself sell insurance. Neither does the Society decide how claims will be settled or determine their amounts. Only your insurers provide these functions and other services related to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Society offers an insurance arrangement for congregation property as a service, because more favorable rates are given to members of a group plan. Also, the Society has made an effort to adapt your </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">coverage</span><span class="font4"> to the special needs of the congregations. Participation in this arrangement is entirely voluntary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Since your insurance includes a large number of Kingdom Halls, usually your insurers do not communicate directly with you. Instead, the insurance companies deal with the Society, who then relays their inquiries to you. When the Society expresses the viewpoint and decisions of your insurers, as in this manual, it is not stating that it approves or advocates that view of matters. Rather it is simply explaining to you what your insurance will provide. What your insurers say generally reflects either normal business practices in the insurance industry or the . specific terms spelled out in your policies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Always write or call </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">the Society</span><span class="font4"> when you have questions about your insurance. (The only exception would be when your insurers or the Society's insurance representatives contact you directly.) The Society is glad to explain your views to your insurers, but it cannot represent the congregation to your insurers or make decisions in your behalf, other than </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">tentative</span><span class="font4"> ones (as in the settlement of claims). The Society is pleased to receive inquiries from your congregation relative to your insurance. It will always try to answer them as fully as it is able.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">N.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Correspondence with the Society</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Show your congregation's </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">full name</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">including city and state</span><span class="font4">, on all correspondence you send to the Society. NOTE: Do </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> send letters with the secretary's name and address only. (See </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Theocratic Ministry School Guidebook</span><span class="font4">, pp. 85-86, par. 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Send all correspondence about insurance matters to 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, NY 11201, Attention: Office of the Secretary and Treasurer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If more than one congregation meets in your Hall, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">use the name of the congregation which the Society contacts about insurance matters</span><span class="font4">. Normally, this is the congregation which holds the territory in which the Kingdom Hall is located.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">O.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Responsibility for the Kingdom Hall</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">All elders in the congregation(s) meeting in your Kingdom Hall share responsibility for taking care of it. However, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">regular</span><span class="font4">, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">consistent</span><span class="font4"> attention needs to be given to the hall's security, maintenance, and day-to-day operation. It is advisable to select a committee of elders who can do this. Such a committee is usually known as a &quot;Kingdom Hall operating committee.&quot; It may include brothers who are not elders, if sufficient elders are not available. (Such a committee would be the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">same</span><span class="font4"> committee as the one referred to in section I.A, p. 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The committee should preferably include those with good business judgment and experience (as well as those with knowledge of maintenance, repairs, and security). To supplement their own experience, they should freely call on any available brothers who may have needed skills or knowledge. They should keep the body(ies) of elders informed of the problems they are encountering, the work they are doing, and the help they need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The committee will have a permanent chairman who should be an elder if at all possible. He should have good organizational ability, be able to take the initiative, and be quick to expedite matters. He should not be a procrastinator. The chairman should be alert to care for details, or to see that they are cared for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The committee may help handle claims to the insurance company for damage, theft, and accidents. (See sections IV.B, p. 25, and V.B, p. 35.) Additionally, they should be responsible for regular inspections of the Kingdom Hall. They may take care of such things as completing Property Description Forms when you insure new buildings or make improvements in buildings that are already insured, and they may care for matters such as increasing the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">amount</span><span class="font4"> of coverage you are carrying on your property. They will normally be in the best position to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">make recommendations</span><span class="font4"> to the body(ies) of elders of the congregations meeting in the Kingdom Hall regarding matters such as renovations in the Kingdom Hall and the purchase of new insurance. policies (for additional kinds of insurance such as flood insurance or Workmen's Compensation insurance). In such cases, each body of elders in the Kingdom Hall should consider what the committee has recommended and submit a resolution to its respective congregation for approval. (See paragraphs 5-6 on page 6 of the May, 1976, issue of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Our Kingdom Service</span><span class="font4">.)</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark16"></a>III. ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COVERAGES</span></h1></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">As part of your Kingdom Hall insurance, certain additional coverages are offered. These are outlined below. In addition, there are optional coverages which can be purchased at extra expense by the congregation. (Note: If your congregation is not presently insured through the Society, this section is provided for information purposes only.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Certificates of Insurance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Certificates of insurance show the kind and amount of insurance that you have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your insurer will provide certificates of insurance at no additional charge.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Your congregation may be required to provide a certificate of insurance when requested by:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">owner of property you rent</span><span class="font4"> or are given the use of, or</span></p></li>
<li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. To request a certificate of insurance, contact the Society, providing the following information:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Name of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Name and address</span><span class="font4"> of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">one requiring</span><span class="font4"> the certificate of insurance</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Address</span><span class="font4"> of the location for which certificate is required.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">B.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Temporary Coverage (for Special Programs, etc.)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Temporary</span><span class="font4"> use of a location other than your Kingdom Hall or assembly hall is automatically covered by your insurance, subject to the limitations shown below. (Note the limitation on coverage for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">property</span><span class="font4"> as described in VI.D.5, p. 44.) However, you must obtain specific coverage under certain circumstances.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. You should specifically request coverage when one of the following applies:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. You will be holding a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">special</span><span class="font4"> one-day </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">meeting</span><span class="font4"> (arranged by your circuit or by several congregations) at any location </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">except</span><span class="font4"> a Kingdom Hall insured through the Society or any assembly hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. You will be holding </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation meetings</span><span class="font4"> (or a Memorial celebration) at a location where one of the following applies:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) . The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">landlord</span><span class="font4"> (owner of the location where you will be meeting) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">requests</span><span class="font4"> that you provide </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">evidence that you have insurance</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) The temporary location will be </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">used more than two days</span><span class="font4"> (either consecutively or on separate occasions).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">expected attendance</span><span class="font4"> will be </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">greater than 1,000</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. To obtain temporary coverage for a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">special meeting</span><span class="font4">, use the Assembly Insurance Information form. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Add to the form</span><span class="font4"> the expected attendance at your meeting.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Send the completed form to the Society. If you do not have a copy of the Assembly Insurance Information form (circuit overseers are supplied copies of this form), write a letter to the Society incorporating the information shown in 3. below. (See the instructions in point (6) of the Society’s letter dated December 7, 1979, &quot;To All Bodies of Elders and Traveling Overseers in the United States.&quot;)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. To obtain temporary coverage for a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation meeting</span><span class="font4">, write a letter to the Society incorporating the information requested below. Show on the envelope &quot;Attention: Office of the Secretary and Treasurer.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Name of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. Name of </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation in whose name Kingdom Hall insurance is carried through the Society</span><span class="font4">, if different from your congregation. (This means the congregation in your Kingdom Hall which receives correspondence from the Society regarding insurance matters.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Date</span><span class="font4"> of special program, or dates during which meetings will be held at temporary location</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">d.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Name and address of the landlord</span><span class="font4"> (owner) of the location where your meeting will be held. Also list here the name and address of any others who the landlord requests to be included as insured parties.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">e. Full </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">name and address of the location</span><span class="font4"> where the meeting will be held</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">f. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">expected attendance</span><span class="font4"> at your special program or meeting</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">g. Give your requirements if they are different from the following:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1)</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Coverage</span><span class="font4"> - Comprehensive General Liability Insurance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Limits: Bodily Injury - $10,500,000; Property Damage - $10,100,000</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(2)</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Number of copies</span><span class="font4"> of certificates - Two sets of certificates of insurance (one for the'facility owner and one for your congregation) will be mailed.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">4. After the insurer issues the certificates of insurance, they will be mailed to the secretary of your congregation, unless you otherwise indicate. You will also receive a bill for the cost, if any. If the special program your congregation is insuring is for two days or less and has an expected attendance of less than 1,000, there will normally be no charge.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">C.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Builder's Risk (Construction) Insurance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Such insurance applies during the construction of a new building. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">It is automatically included in your present insurance</span><span class="font4">. (Note: most insurance policies cover only completed buildings. However, your insurance covers both completed buildings </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">and</span><span class="font4"> buildings under construction.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If your congregation is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">renovating its present Kingdom Hall</span><span class="font4">, your present insurance already applies. It is not necessary to purchase additional insurance to protect the congregation during your construction project.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If your congregation is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">building a new Kingdom Hall</span><span class="font4">:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Insure your Kingdom Hall through the Society </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately</span><span class="font4">. You will thus have the protection of both construction insurance and permanent property insurance. (See II.D.2, p. 13.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. If an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">independent contractor</span><span class="font4"> who is building your Kingdom Hall requests that you provide Builder's Risk insurance, your regular Kingdom Hall insurance should be acceptable to him. If a contractor requests proof that you have satisfactory coverage, contact the Society to obtain a certificate of insurance.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">D.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Flood Insurance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Your insurance does not pay for damage from floods or rising water. The United States Government, through a program sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, provides flood insurance in the United States. For flood insurance to be available in your community, your community must have made application to be included in this program. Most communities have done so. To obtain such insurance or information concerning it, contact the Society.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">E.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Boiler and Machinery Insurance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">For boilers, machinery and electrical equipment, your insurance does not cover electrical burn-out or short circuit, mechanical breakdown, or explosion. (Your present insurance </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">does</span><span class="font4"> cover </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">lightning</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">fire</span><span class="font4"> damage to your Kingdom Hall and its electrical equipment. Boiler and Machinery Insurance is for electrical or mechanical </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">breakdown.</span><span class="font4"> Such coverage can be purchased at additional cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is available in two forms: &quot;Blanket I&quot; and &quot;Blanket II.'' &quot;Blanket I&quot; covers * only boilers, water heaters, and refrigeration vessels. &quot;Blanket II&quot; covers everything covered by &quot;Blanket I&quot; with the addition of pumps, refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, compressors, electrical generators and transformers, and motors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: This coverage is intended for (1) Kingdom Halls with boilers and (2) assembly halls and Kingdom Halls with very large electrical and refrigeration equipment. For this reason, only those sizes of equipment shown below can be covered under this type of insurance (&quot;Blanket II&quot; coverage):</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Electric motors 10 hp or greater</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Refrigeration systems 10 hp or greater</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Internal combustion engines used for driving generators; engines of 10 hp or greater</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Electric generators 10 kw or greater Power transformers 25 kva to 1000 kva</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If your Kingdom Hall does not have equipment of the size or type shown above, your congregation would probably not find this coverage useful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you are interested in such coverage, write the Society to request an inspection of your Kingdom Hall. This is necessary before your insurers or the Society can provide a quotation (even an approximate one) for the cost of this coverage. Your expression of interest does not obligate your congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">F• </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Workmen's (Workers') Compensation Insurance</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your present insurance does not include Workmen's Compensation insurance. Anyone </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">who receives pay</span><span class="font4"> should be protected by such insurance. It pays workers who have been injured on the job, and it protects the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">employer</span><span class="font4"> from claims and lawsuits because of injuries to his employees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There are two reasons why you should purchase such insurance for persons you pay. Your present </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">insurance</span><span class="font4"> does not pay for injuries to anyone you pay. Also, you may be required </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">by law</span><span class="font4"> to buy Workmen's Compensation insurance. (This depends on the laws of your state.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Normally, such insurance is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> required for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">volunteer workers</span><span class="font4">. For that reason, most of those doing maintenance and construction work on your Kingdom Hall are covered by your present insurance. All </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">&quot;independent contractors&quot;</span><span class="font4"> you hire should buy Workmen's Compensation insurance or accident insurance with comparable benefits for their </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font4"> employees. (See I.H.l, p. 7.) In all cases, the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">actual status</span><span class="font4"> of those who do work on your Kingdom Hall should determine whether you buy Workmen's Compensation insurance, rather than whether someone is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">called</span><span class="font4"> a &quot;volunteer worker,&quot; an &quot;employee,&quot; or an &quot;independent contractor.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Anyone working for the congregation would be covered by whatever </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span><span class="font4"> form of insurance applies to him. For example, an independent contractor and his employees would be covered by insurance obtained by the contractor. A paid employee of the congregation would be covered by Workmen's Compensation insurance obtained by the congregation. Neither of these types of workers would be covered by the regular insurance your congregation carries, which includes &quot;public liability&quot; insurance. (This type of insurance is discussed in section VII, P. 45.) Any paid workers hired by </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">your congregation</span><span class="font4"> or by </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">contractors</span><span class="font4"> hired by your congregation would not be covered by your present Kingdom Hall insurance, and they would receive nothing from your insurers if they were injured while working on your Kingdom Hall. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If someone requests a certificate of insurance showing that you have Workmen's Compensation insurance, explain that no paid workers will be used by the congregation. If that is not sufficient, provide a written statement to the effect that the congregation has no employees under the definition of the Workmen's Compensation law of your state and that therefore it is your understanding that this law is not applicable in your case. If this is not acceptable, contact the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If your congregation has paid employees, you can buy Workmen's Compensation insurance </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">temporarily</span><span class="font4">, as during a construction or remodeling project. You can also buy it on a permanent basis to cover those who do maintenance work on the Kingdom Hall. If your congregation needs such coverage, contact the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If your congregation remodels or builds a Kingdom Hall, or if someone regularly does maintenance work on your Kingdom Hall or assembly hall, inform those doing the work of the limitations and provisions of your insurance. Explain that your insurance does not pay for expenses for more than one year after the accident and that the maximum amount payable for medical and hospital expenses under the terms of your coverage has a limit. (See VII.D.2.a, p. 47.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">G.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Automobile Insurance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Any vehicles </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">owned by the congregation</span><span class="font4"> can be insured through a separate insurance policy available through your present insurers. Contact the Society with the following information if you want this coverage:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Year, make and model of vehicle</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Maximum gross weight of vehicle (if not registered as passenger vehicle)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Vehicle identification number &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Principal use of vehicle (for example, local maintenance, local pick up and delivery, long-distance hauling)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Coverages</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">limits</span><span class="font4"> required (comprehensive fire and theft, collision, medical payments)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. Location where vehicle is garaged, if different from address of Kingdom Hall</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">H.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Performance Bonds</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Your city may require that you file a bond during construction of your Kingdom Hall. This bond can be obtained at a small additional charge from your insurers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The body(ies) of elders in your Kingdom Hall have final responsibility for matters related to a loss. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Immediately</span><span class="font4"> after the loss is discovered, they should delegate specific responsibilities as shown below.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. The Kingdom Hall </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">operating committee</span><span class="font4"> (or the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation secretary</span><span class="font4">, if you have not yet appointed an operating committee) should do what is outlined in parts C, F, and G of this section. If you do not have an operating committee and the congregation secretary is absent when the loss occurs, the body(ies) of elders should immediately select someone else to do this. When you send correspondence, use the name of the congregation which the Society contacts about insurance matters.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3., p. 25)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Protect your property</span><span class="font4"> from further damage. This is your first obligation if your Kingdom Hall is damaged. However, you should not make </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">permanent</span><span class="font4"> repairs until the claims adjuster has given his approval.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If your repairs will cost </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">less than $1,000</span><span class="font4">, you may make complete permanent repairs to your Kingdom Hall or replace damaged or stolen equipment as soon as you choose to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If your repairs may cost </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">more than than $1,000</span><span class="font4">, do not make </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">permanent</span><span class="font4"> repairs to the damaged portions of your Kingdom Hall. Make </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">temporary</span><span class="font4"> repairs to protect your Kingdom Hall from further crime or weather damage until the claims adjuster arrives. (The &quot;claims adjuster&quot; is sent by your insurers to inspect your damage.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. If you must make permanent repairs to avoid further damage to your Kingdom Hall or if you have an emergency, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">IMMEDIATELY make whatever repairs are necessary to protect your property</span><span class="font4">. Use your own judgment in doing whatever you believe is necessary in such a case. If you must make permanent repairs, you must take photographs of all portions of the damaged area. Keep the photographs for examination by the claims adjuster.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Do what is necessary to prevent further damage, including the following:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Restore</span><span class="font4"> proper </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">security</span><span class="font4"> to your Kingdom Hall immediately. Board up or securely close up damaged windows and doors. If you cannot make your Kingdom Hall safe from intruders, temporarily remove any property that could be stolen. Be alert to attempts by vandals to take advantage of the original break-in. '</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Protect from water and weather damage</span><span class="font4">. Cover any damaged part of your roof to prevent further water damage to the interior of your building.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) Before entering flooded buildings, make sure that there is no danger from live electrical wires, escaped gas, or structural collapse.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) Pump out flooded basements in stages, not all at once, to reduce potential damage to the structure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) Right away, dry out rugs and carpets, appliances, and motors. Oil machinery to prevent rust.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">c.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Restore fire protection</span><span class="font4">. Return to service broken water lines and recharge fire extinguishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">d. Air out curtains, rugs, and seats to minimize smoke damage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">e. Protect and salvage equipment. Dry out and separate any literature that can be saved. Clean up any debris, but do not have it removed from the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom Hall premises until the claims adjuster has inspected it and given his approval. Make sure you have the approval of the claims adjuster before discarding equipment or property, since your insurers may consider an item repairable.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">f. Keep receipts, invoices, etc., for the cost of debris removal, professional cleaners, and temporary repairs. Generally these costs are covered by your insurers. (See &quot;E. Estimates,' below.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">g. Get the cooperation of neighbors, police, and congregation members in providing temporary protection for the Kingdom Hall while it is being repaired. (See 1.1., p. 8.)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">E.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Estimates</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3., p. 25)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">insurers</span><span class="font4"> pay claims, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> the Society. Your insurers will pay only for losses that you can prove. To prove your loss, first compile a list of everything damaged or stolen. (If you have inventory in your congregation file, use that.) Then you must provide written evidence </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">from someone else</span><span class="font4"> of the current </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">cost</span><span class="font4"> of repairing or replacing every item. Keep in mind the following facts about estimates:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. You need to get estimates for three reasons:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. You cannot be paid for your damage or loss until your insurers receive </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font4"> estimates with the Loss Report Form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. You cannot decide whether the adjuster's offer to you is acceptable unless you can compare his offer with your </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">own</span><span class="font4"> estimates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. The adjuster may not send his report to the insurance company until he , has seen </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">your</span><span class="font4"> estimates.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Start getting written estimates </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately</span><span class="font4"> after you have taken steps to protect the Kingdom Hall from further damage.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: WHEN YOU HAVE </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">TELEPHONED</span><span class="font4"> A REPORT TO THE SOCIETY, the claims adjuster will probably visit your Kingdom Hall before you have time to get estimates. However, you must still obtain written estimates as soon as you can for the reasons shown in 1. above.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. You may have to pay for the estimates you obtain. If so, you will not be reimbursed for that cost by your insurance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Keep in your congregation file a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">duplicate</span><span class="font4"> copy of all estimates or bills you obtain. If the insurance company sends an adjuster, he will need to examine them. (See I.2.C., p. 31.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5. If the congregation intends to furnish its own labor to make the repairs, it is proper to include the fair market value of such labor in the estimate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. Estimates for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">property you are replacing</span><span class="font4"> should be for items of the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">same or equivalent quality</span><span class="font4"> as the original. Estimates for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">repairs</span><span class="font4"> should be only those necessary to restore your property to its original condition </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately before the damage occurred</span><span class="font4">. Repairs made necessary by the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">specific incident </span><span class="font4">of fire, wind, vandalism, etc., are all you can claim. NOTE: This principle applies to your insurance claim only. It is up to you to decide whether to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">rebuild or repair your Kingdom Hall in a way different from its previous construction or to make repairs beyond those made necessary by the specific incident of damage for which you are making a claim. The congregation would have to pay for the cost of such additional work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">7. Make sure estimates come from a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">recognized</span><span class="font4"> contractor or supplier, known in his community to be in the business of providing the goods or services he quotes. The one providing the estimate can be a member of your congregation, as long as he meets this requirement. The estimate should be on the business </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">forms</span><span class="font4"> or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">letterhead</span><span class="font4"> of the supplier. If he does not have such, have him sign and date the estimate he gives you. NOTE: Photocopied catalog pages are not acceptable as estimates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">8. Your estimates must be </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">current quotations</span><span class="font4">. Do </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> give the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">original</span><span class="font4"> cost you paid. Give </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">what it will cost you to replace</span><span class="font4"> the item at </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">today's prices</span><span class="font4">. The insurance company pays you according to current prices, which are usually higher than your original cost.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">9.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Detailed</span><span class="font4"> estimates are required. If they are for repairs to buildings, have them show </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">materials</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">labor</span><span class="font4"> separately. If they are for equipment or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">appliances</span><span class="font4">, they should show both the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">model number</span><span class="font4"> and a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">description of the item </span><span class="font4">quoted. Example: &quot;Bogen amplifier S3049 .... $225.00&quot; not just: &quot;S3049 . . . $225.00.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">10. Send to the Society only </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">one bill or estimate</span><span class="font4"> for the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">same item</span><span class="font4">. Do not send duplicate estimates. Do not send one estimate for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">repair</span><span class="font4"> and another for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">replacement</span><span class="font4"> of the same item. Decide whether the item can or cannot be repaired and get an estimate accordingly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">11. If your estimates or invoices include items which do not relate to your claim, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">circle the items you are claiming</span><span class="font4">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;..</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">12. Do not include sales taxes on your bills or estimates. Since religious or nonprofit organizations like your congregation are generally exempt from sales taxes, you should not have to pay them.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">Your insurers require that you submit a report of your damage or loss shortly after it is discovered. Normally this means that your report (along with bills or estimates) should be </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mailed within 30 days</span><span class="font4"> of the date on which you discover the loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">IF YOU CANNOT MAIL THE LOSS REPORT FORM AND ALL ESTIMATES WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE LOSS IS DISCOVERED, write the Society a brief letter. State the date and </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">kind of damage</span><span class="font4"> and why there will be a delay. This action will preserve your claim. However, once you have sent this letter, the completed Loss Report Forms with estimates and bills should be submitted </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">right away</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Report the damage or loss as promptly as you can, but not before you have obtained all your estimates or bills to substantiate your claim. Complete the form as directed below (see G, p. 29), attach all written estimates or bills, and send all the information to the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2.

<p><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3., p. 25.)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Decide why the damage or theft occurred and how you can reduce the probability of a recurrence.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">purpose</span><span class="font4"> of the investigation should be </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">to help your congregation avoid future losses</span><span class="font4"> similar to the one which has just occurred.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. In deciding how to prevent future losses, consider the suggestions in section &quot;I. PROTECTING YOUR KINGDOM HALL,&quot; p. 1. Before you decide on any major changes in the physical structure of your Kingdom Hall, find out what your local building, zoning, and fire codes require.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. After you have completed your investigation, write a brief letter to the Society stating (a) the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">cause</span><span class="font4"> of loss or damage, and (b) the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">steps you have taken</span><span class="font4"> to protect your Kingdom Hall from future losses.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">I. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Inspection by the Insurance Investigator (&quot;Claims Adjuster<sup>1</sup>') </span><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3., p. 25)] Be prepared for the visit of the adjuster and be prompt and cooperative in your dealings with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE</span><span class="font4">: DO NOT DEAL WITH ANY INSURANCE INVESTIGATOR (&quot;CLAIMS ADJUSTER&quot;) WHO HAS NOT BEEN SENT BY YOUR INSURERS OR ANY ADJUSTER WHO WORKS FOR A PERCENTAGE OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE ADJUSTER SENT TO INSPECT YOUR KINGDOM HALL IS PAID BY YOUR INSURERS, NOT BY YOU.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If YOUR REPAIRS WILL COST MORE THAN $1,000, your insurers will usually send a claims adjuster to your Kingdom Hall. The adjuster will advise whether your insurance covers the loss and how much you should receive for repairs. Keep in mind the following points when dealing with him:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. He represents an </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">independent firm</span><span class="font4"> hired by your insurers. Therefore, his judgment of matters may differ from the insurance company's and the Society's.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. He is an experienced professional and will usually try to be fair. However, his job is to make the lowest possible settlement that is reasonable. Since he usually deals with the world, he may therefore expect your estimates to be higher than necessary.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. In contacting your congregation, the adjuster will use the two names you listed on the Loss Report Form. If he cannot reach anyone at the telephone numbers given, he will contact you in writing. In meeting with the adjuster:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Select only </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span><span class="font4"> elder to communicate with the adjuster.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> PROMPTLY</span><span class="font4"> answer all calls and letters from the adjuster. Remember that he will want to meet with you during regular business hours, if possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. Have a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">copy of all estimates and bills</span><span class="font4"> for the adjuster AT YOUR FIRST MEETING WITH HIM.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">d. When you meet with the adjuster at the Kingdom Hall, show him what the damage is and how and when it occurred. Confine your statements about the cause or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">circumstances</span><span class="font4"> of the loss to the FACTS of the matter as you have them. Be helpful, but do not guess or volunteer opinions.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. The adjuster will check the estimates and bills you give him. He will base what he will eventually recommend on his own experience and on </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">other estimates he will obtain</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. To obtain such additional estimates, he may ask you to show the damage to contractors or suppliers of his choosing. Give them the same cooperation you give the claims adjuster, making sure they have all the facts at their disposal. However, your congregation is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not obligated</span><span class="font4"> to hire the contractors sent by the claims adjuster. When the actual repair work is done, you can use any contractor you choose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. The adjuster will check your own estimates in line with what is shown in &quot;E. Estimates,&quot; p. 27.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. If the adjuster asks for information to support or clarify your estimates, obtain it as soon as possible. Your claim will be held up until the adjuster receives this information.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">4.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;"> Once</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> he has completed his inspection</span><span class="font4">:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. The adjuster is then authorized to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">make an offer of settlement</span><span class="font4"> to you. If he does not make an offer, that fact may mean that he does not believe your insurance will pay for the damage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. The adjuster is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span><span class="font4"> authorized to promise </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">that you will be paid</span><span class="font4"> for your loss, nor can he promise </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">what your settlement will be</span><span class="font4">. Neither can he promise that you will be paid within a given period of time. The </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">insurance company</span><span class="font4"> decides all these things.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. When the adjuster makes an offer to the congregation, he will subtract from </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">his</span><span class="font4"> estimates (a) depreciation based on the age of items damaged or stolen and (b) any deductible which applies to your particular loss (see VI.E.l, p. 44).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">d. After the adjuster gives his offer to the designated brother(s) (see B.3, p. 25), they should decide </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">promptly</span><span class="font4"> whether to accept it. The decision should be given the adjuster immediately after being made.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: This decision should be </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">tentative</span><span class="font4"> if the insurance company's offer is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">much less</span><span class="font4"> than your estimates and bills, or if the amount of money involved is very large. In such cases, the body(ies) of elders should consider the recommendation of the designated brother(s) and present the insurance company’s offer to the congregation in the form of a resolution. The designated brother(s) should inform the adjuster of the congregation 's decision.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">e. If the offer is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">rejected</span><span class="font4">, promptly and frankly express this to the adjuster in writing. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Immediately</span><span class="font4"> send a letter to the Society explaining what you have been offered and why you disagree with the offer. Include with your letter any information you have given the adjuster.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">J. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Settlement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3., p. 25)]</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Your insurers will settle your claim within a reasonable time after you have furnished them and their adjusters everything they require. The amount of time required varies from claim to claim, depending on the circumstances. Pending settlement, you may want to make temporary arrangements to borrow necessary equipment or funds to replace what what was stolen, damaged, etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Your insurers will take </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">no action</span><span class="font4"> until they receive both (1) the report of the claims adjuster and (2) the Loss Report Form and estimates you have sent.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Do not contact the adjuster or his company if you feel there is a delay in your claim. Contact the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Society</span><span class="font4"> in writing instead. It will try to speed up settlement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Since the insurer makes payment through the Society, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">the Society</span><span class="font4"> will send you its check when payment is approved. If you receive any check directly from your insurers, return it to the Society, since it will be a duplicate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">5.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Your insurers may not agree with the recommendation made by the claims adjusters</span><span class="font4">. If that is so, the claims adjuster may make an additional visit and bring with him a contractor, engineer or other expert. Such a visit may mean that your insurers question whether your insurance will pay for your loss.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">6. From the information they have received, your insurers decide the following:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Whether your insurance will pay</span><span class="font4"> for the damage or loss. (See section &quot;VI. POLICY TERMS - PROPERTY PROTECTION,&quot; p. 41, for the details of what your insurance covers and what it excludes.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> How much you will receive</span><span class="font4">. This amount is based on the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">depreciated value</span><span class="font4"> of what was damaged or stolen. Depreciation is figured according to the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">normal useful life</span><span class="font4"> of each item. (No depreciation is applied to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">glass</span><span class="font4"> that you replace.) After depreciation is taken, any deductibles or limits which affect your loss (see VI.D-E, p. 44) are applied.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Example: You had hail damage to your roof. The roof was five years old. In your area, the normal lifetime of roofs is fifteen years. Here is how your settlement would be calculated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Cost of repair to your roof (as determined by claims adjuster) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$900.00-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Less depreciation (in this case, 33-1/3%, since</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">5 yrs. = 33-1/3% of 15-year life of roof) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">300.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Subtotal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$600.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Less $100 deductible &lt;for hail/windstorm damage &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">100.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Amount you will receive &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$500.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: If your Kingdom Hall is underinsured, the amount of your settlement will not be affected.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">7. The Society will notify you in writing of your insurers’ decision. You will receive either (1) a check for what your insurers have offered (you are </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">not obligated</span><span class="font4"> to accept this settlement) or (2) a letter explaining the offer, if it </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">is much less than your estimates</span><span class="font4"> or bills, or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">if your insurance may not pay for the damage</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">8. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THE DECISION OF YOUR INSURERS (OR THE ADJUSTER), you have the right not to accept the offer.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. If you do not accept the offer, you should first consider the explanation of your insurers. If you still cannot accept it:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1)</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Return to the Society</span><span class="font4"> any </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">check</span><span class="font4"> you have received for the loss, along with an explanation; OR</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) Promptly </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">advise the Society</span><span class="font4"> of your decision and the reasons for it.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b. The Society will relay your viewpoint to your insurers. They will consider your objections and will have either the Society or the adjuster get in touch with you to either present a new offer to you or to explain the original one.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. If you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">still</span><span class="font4"> disagree with the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">amount</span><span class="font4"> that you have been offered, you may need to get an additional estimate to back up your original one. You may also suggest that the contractors who have given you estimates meet with the adjuster to discuss any differences between his estimates and their own. If these steps do not produce agreement, a final procedure exists that you can follow. After the other steps outlined above have been exhausted, the Society will give you the details of this procedure upon request.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">d. If you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">still</span><span class="font4"> disagree regarding (1) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">whether your insurance should pay for your damage</span><span class="font4">, or (2) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">how much damage there is</span><span class="font4">: You may need to obtain a written statement from an architect or engineer who is familiar with the kind of building or equipment that was damaged. Please note that you will normally have to pay for such written statements, and that your insurance will not pay for this cost.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In all cases where you disagree with the decision of your insurers regarding your claim, the Society can only try to report the views of each side to the other to bring out the facts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">9. If you have a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">mortgage with someone other than the Society</span><span class="font4">: Since the lender has an interest in your Kingdom Hall up to the amount of its loan to you, it normally has the right of first claim to any settlement from your insurers. However, the lender is mainly interested in the complete restoration of the Kingdom Hall property to its former condition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">10. If you discover that some omission or error has been made after you have sent in your claim, write the Society immediately to explain the error.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">11. If the police later </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">recover</span><span class="font4"> and return to you all or part of what is </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">stolen </span><span class="font4">from the congregation, write the Society. Send (a) a list of what has been returned to you (b) copies of invoices or estimates you </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">originally</span><span class="font4"> sent the Society for those items and (c) any estimates for necessary </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">repairs</span><span class="font4"> to the returned items. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">If you have not yet received payment</span><span class="font4">, your settlement will be adjusted accordingly. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">If you have already received payment</span><span class="font4">, the Society will determine the new amount of the settlement due you, or refund due from you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">V. ACCIDENTS</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Definition</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">An &quot;accident&quot; means </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">injury to someone</span><span class="font4"> on Kingdom Hall property or </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">damage to the property of an individual</span><span class="font4">. (This does not apply to damage to property owned or used by the congregation.) A </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">lawsuit</span><span class="font4">, whether officially begun or only threatened, is an &quot;accident&quot; for the purposes of your insurance, because it claims that the congregation was negligent or responsible in some way for injury or damage. (Coverage for claims of this type is described in section VII, p. 45.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">B.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Responsibility for Handling the Accident</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The body(ies) of elders in your Kingdom Hall have final responsibility for matters related to an accident. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Immediately</span><span class="font4"> after the accident occurs, they should delegate specific responsibilities as shown below.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. The Kingdom Hall </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">operating committee</span><span class="font4"> (or the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation secretary</span><span class="font4">, if you have not yet appointed an operating committee) should do what is outlined in parts D through G of this section. If you do not have an operating committee and the congregation secretary is absent when the accident occurs, the bod-y(ies) of elders should immediately select someone else to do this. When you send correspondence, use the name of the congregation which the Society contacts about insurance matters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. The Kingdom Hall </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">operating committee</span><span class="font4"> (or the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">body (ies)of elders</span><span class="font4">, if you have not yet appointed an operating committee) should immediately </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">designate </span><span class="font4">brothers to do what is outlined in parts C and H through K of this section. According to the circumstances, they may choose either an individual or a committee. When the accident is very serious, the body(ies) of elders must always be informed of the final outcome of the accident. SELECT THE BROTHERS AVAILABLE WHO WILL EXPEDITE MATTERS AND USE GOOD BUSINESS JUDGMENT.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">f</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">C.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> If You Have an Accident (or Lawsuit)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3.)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In case of an &quot;accident,&quot; do the following </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediately on being informed of the accident</span><span class="font4">. If you have a &quot;loss,&quot; see section &quot;IV. LOSSES,&quot; p. 25. If after checking both definitions you are unsure into which category your claim would fall, write a letter to the Society explaining the situation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Do this for the following reasons: (1) no one can be sure that an injury which seems minor at first will not </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">later</span><span class="font4"> turn out to be serious or to have long-term effects; (2) the fact that the injured person has his own insurance does not mean that it will pay for all or even most of his eventual expenses; (3) it is not wrong Scripturally either to make a claim on the congregation's insurance or to sue it because of an accident (see </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Watchtower</span><span class="font4">, November 15, 1973, p. 704, par. 1); (4) </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">if the injured person delays making a claim</span><span class="font4">, he may receive nothing (see VII.D.l, p. 47). Also, the statute of limitations will not permit a lawsuit after a certain length of time following an accident. For these reasons, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">every accident</span><span class="font4"> should be reported IMMEDIATELY. If the injured person does not wish to pursue a claim, he can state that decision when the insurance company's claims representative contacts him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If someone claims injury or damage, do not hesitate to tell him that the congregation does carry insurance which may apply. </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Tell him that you are reporting his claim</span><span class="font4"> to the insurance company and that the matter will be considered by it, but </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">do not promise that his claim will be paid</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. If you receive a letter or notice that </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">someone is bringing a suit</span><span class="font4"> against you for any purpose, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">send to the Society</span><span class="font4"> IMMEDIATELY whatever you have received. This would include lawsuits for slander or libel brought by reproved, disfel-lowshiped or disassociated persons upset over judicial actions taken concerning them. This also applies to a suit against an elder or other </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">member</span><span class="font4"> of the congregation because of his assigned work on behalf of the congregation. Since the insurance company's attorneys will answer court summonses you may be issued, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">do not hire your own attorney</span><span class="font4"> until the Society has advised you whether your insurance will cover the lawsuit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Sometimes the first reaction of an injured person is to contact an attorney. Before doing so, the injured person should ask himself the following questions: If his attorney decides to sue the congregation, is he prepared to go that far? Does his claim merit the legal fees that will be deducted from any settlement received? Most important, he should make sure that his claim meets the following requirements: (1) the amount of his claim is greater than what the congregation's insurance will pay </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">without</span><span class="font4"> a suit (see VII.B.3, p. 46);</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) he can prove that the congregation was negligent and that the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation's negligence was the reason for his accident</span><span class="font4">. If both of the above statements are not true, the injured person can be alerted to the fact that hiring an attorney will be of no benefit and will actually mean an added expense to him.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">2. In deciding how to prevent future accidents, consider the suggestions in section &quot;I. PROTECTING YOUR KINGDOM HALL,&quot; p. 1.

<p><span class="font4">NOTE: Those parts of the following which concern the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">person making the claim</span><span class="font4"> may be passed on to him for his information.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. if </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">property</span><span class="font4"> has been damaged, the adjuster will not contact the owner of the property unless you send bills or estimates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If a </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">lawsuit</span><span class="font4"> is involved, the insurance company will have its attorneys answer any summons and respond to any requirements for pre-trial appearances, etc.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">In such cases, you may be contacted directly by the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">attorney</span><span class="font4"> for the insurance company, and you should cooperate fully with him. Furnish your insurers or their attorneys any records or documents they request. Send to </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">the Society </span><span class="font4">anything you receive from the person suing the congregation or his attorney.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. If someone has been </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">injured</span><span class="font4">, in most cases he will be contacted by the adjuster. (If the Liability Accident Notice gave the names of the witnesses to the injury, the adjuster may also contact them.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Whether injury or damage to property is involved, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">at the visit of the adjuster</span><span class="font4">;</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. The claimant should have a copy of all doctor's bills, letters from physicians, estimates, etc., for the adjuster at the first contact with him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. If the claimant has an attorney, he should follow the advice of the attorney. Normally the attorney will recommend that the adjuster deal with him alone.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">c. When he first meets the claimant, the claims adjuster may offer a settlement. If the settlement is accepted, that will end the matter. The claimant will have no right to make any further claim for compensation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">d. If no settlement is agreed upon at that time, the adjuster may try to obtain a tape recorded interview (or written statement) showing the claimant's version of the accident. The claimant should bear in mind that the adjuster is skilled in phrasing questions in the tape recorded interview in a way that will produce the best possible legal position for the insurance company. This factor may affect the claimant's decision on whether or not he wants to give a statement to the adjuster.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">e. The person who has a claim may want to keep in mind that the adjuster's responsibility is to protect the congregation and his company, and therefore his main concern is how to minimize the settlement paid. His interests are not primarily the welfare or satisfaction of the person who has a claim.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">f. The adjuster may emphasize<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark17">1</a></sup><sup></sup> points related to the following question: Does the claimant believe that the accident is the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation's fault? </span><span class="font4">If he does, the adjuster may try to show why the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">claimant</span><span class="font4"> was </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">negligent</span><span class="font4">, and not the congregation.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3., p. 35)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any settlement of the claim will be made directly between the insurance company and the person making the claim. In most cases, neither the congregation nor the Society will receive any further communication regarding it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: Those parts of following which concern the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">person making the claim</span><span class="font4"> may be passed on to him for his information.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If the person making the claim hears nothing further from the adjuster and does not have an attorney, he may ask the Society to send an inquiry to the insurance company regarding the claim. As a result, the insurance company will either explain its decision on the claim or have the adjuster make another visit. However, the Society cannot become an advocate for the claimant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. The usual maximum that the insurance company will pay without a lawsuit is shown in VII.B.3, p. 46. If the person making the claim is asking for more than that amount or is not satisfied with what the insurance company is offering, he has two choices: (1) he can either accept the insurance company's offer, or (2) begin a lawsuit for what he believes is fair. Before beginning the lawsuit, the claimant should consider the points mentioned in C.4, p. 36. If the decision is to sue, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">it is not Scripturally wrong</span><span class="font4"> to do so.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">K.</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;"> The Congregation's Viewpoint</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">[Responsibility of designated brother(s) (See B.3, p. 35)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When accidents happen to brothers, both the congregation and the injured person should keep a balanced view of the injury and of what the insurance company will pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At times your insurers may offer to pay either nothing at all or a very small amount of the expenses incurred as a result of an accident. In such cases, you would certainly want to give all possible help to the injured person, both financial and otherwise, out of Christian love for someone &quot;related to us in the faith,&quot; not because of what the law or your insurance coverage requires.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What you do to help the injured person should take into account both the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">circumstances</span><span class="font4"> and resources </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">of the person himself</span><span class="font4"> and any </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">assistance that he can obtain </span><span class="font4">on his own, including payments from his personal insurance or group employee insurance and any government aid that he qualifies for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your congregation's funds are limited, and so is the insurance coverage it carries. Neither should be expected to pay for </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">every</span><span class="font4"> expense incurred by those who are doing some kind of work for the congregation. Your insurance is intended to protect the </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">congregation itself</span><span class="font4"> from severe expenses or legal obligations that it would not be</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">(This describes a Public Liability Policy with Medical Payments, Personal Injury, and Comprehensive General Liability endorsements.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: To file a claim under this portion of your coverage, see section &quot;V. ACCIDENTS,&quot; p. 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The coverage discussed in this section protects the congregation from claims or lawsuits that others may make against it. (See section &quot;VI. POLICY TERMS - PROPERTY PROTECTION,&quot; p. 41, for information regarding the coverage for protection of the Kingdom Hall property.) Usually such claims against the congregation result from what is claimed to be some act of negligence by the congregation. This insurance may pay for the medical and other health care expenses and related damages of persons who may be injured or incur losses to their property if there are legal grounds for the claim that the congregation was responsible for the conditions that produced the accident or injury. Medical or other health care expenses may also be paid if negligence on the part of the congregation has not been established. It is not the purpose of such insurance to protect individuals who may incur injury or damage to their property. Rather, its purpose is to protect the congregation itself in connection with the defense and payment of such claims.</span></p>
