<p><span class="font11">STATEMENT OF FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the short space of tJuee years some two thousand of Jehoval's witnesses have been arrested alid haled before courts in the United Stateg. They have been charged with violation of many kinds of ordinanees. On March 28, 1938, the United States Supreme Court in the </span><span class="font11">case </span><span class="font10">of </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">LoreU </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">v. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin.,</span><span class="font10"> 303 U. S. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">44,</span><span class="font10"> reviewed their activities and upheld and confirmed their right to visit people at their homes and offer to them books, booklets, or pamphlets containing the message of the gospel in printed form. This momentous decision put an end to much of this unlawful opposition, but there are still some places where officials do not understand the principles so clearly stated by </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font10">Nation's highest court, and continue to interfere with the </span><span class="font11">beneficial </span><span class="font10">activities of sincere followers of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This memorandum </span><span class="font11">is </span><span class="font10">submitted </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">so </span><span class="font10">that all may understand and act accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the Lovell v. </span><span class="font11">Griffin </span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font10">s</span><span class="font11">e the S</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">u</span><span class="font10">p</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font10">em</span><span class="font9">e </span><span class="font10">Court of the </span><span class="font11">United States declared </span><span class="font10">invalid an </span><span class="font11">ordinanee of Griffin, Georgia, which imposed </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font11">license requirement to sell or distribute free printed matter in the city. The Court in clear and unmistakable terms stated the rights and liberties of all persons engaged in circulating printed matter. </span><span class="font10">It </span><span class="font11">established certain fundamental propositions which no municipal legisla-five hody, police court, or poljce officials have authority to override. They are as follows;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">FIRST: Liberty of the press is not confmed to newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, hut includes pamphlets, leaflets, books and every sort of printed communication used to convey information or opinion. Jehovah's witnesses are engaged in the circulation of books, booklets and periodicals containing Bible truths, </span><span class="font10">and </span><span class="font11">their activity is that of the press. They are therefore entitled to the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">SECOND: Liberty of the press goes beyond the right of publication and includes the right of circulation. Jehovah's witnesses are engaged in the publication and circulation of printed matter and have the right to do so unhampered by restrictions of license or censorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">TRIRD: No municipality has the right to require a license or permit for the exercise of any person’s ri</span><span class="font10">gh</span><span class="font11">t </span><span class="font10">to diBseminate </span><span class="font11">information </span><span class="font10">in prmted </span><span class="font11">form. </span><span class="font10">To </span><span class="font11">require </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font11">license, </span><span class="font10">m </span><span class="font11">the </span><span class="font10">words of Chird Justice Hughes, is to 'strike at tile very </span><span class="font9">foundation of </span><span class="font10">freedom of the press'. Whether sud) printed matter is soJd, or delivered free] or whether contributions are accepted in exchange </span><span class="font9">for </span><span class="font10">it, is not material. The point is that such activity cannot be lawfully subjected to licensing or permit laws or ordinances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A complete copy of this decision is annexed to this </span><span class="font9">memorandum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ARGUMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT ONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">An ordinance requiring a </span><span class="font10">license for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">distribution of printed matter </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">i</span><span class="font10">n</span><span class="font8">v</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">l</span><span class="font10">i</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">d on its face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Grifn (Gu.) onlh</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font10">aJce prohibited the distribution of “circulars, handbooks, adyei’tis-ing, or literature of any kind!! without a permit or license from the City Manager. Concerning it, </span><span class="font9">the Su</span><span class="font10">pr</span><span class="font8">em</span><span class="font10">e Cou</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font10">t s</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font10">id</span><span class="font8">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">•'We t.hink that the ordinance is invalid on its face. VVlmtever the motive which induced its adoption, its character is such that it st.rikes at tho very foundation of the freedom </span><span class="font9">of </span><span class="font10">th</span><span class="font9">e </span><span class="font10">press by subjecting it to li cense and censorship.))</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All similar ordinances </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font10">statutes </span><span class="font9">are rendered </span><span class="font10">null and void by virtue </span><span class="font9">of the </span><span class="font11">law </span><span class="font10">deelared and established in this decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">POINT TWO</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">An </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">ordinance requiring a license for the sale of goods, wares and merchandise becomes invalid when applied to the sale of printed matter containing information or opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Practically all municipalities have ordinances requiring licenses for the sale of goods, wares and merchandise. Under the Supreme Court ruling such ordinances cannot lawfully be applied to the circulation of printeJ matter. Some dann that the Supreme Court meant that only ordinances requiring licenses for the </span><span class="font18">free </span><span class="font17">distribution of literature were invalid. This claim is not sound. It means that a person would be entitled to the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press if he gave printed matter away, but </span><span class="font16">if </span><span class="font17">he sold it he would not be entitled to this fundamental liberty. The argument is, therefore, foolish. Newspapers, magazines, and periodicals are sold for money. The newspaper industry is a profitable oTie and many have grown wealthy through it. They are entitled to all the guarantees of freedom of the press, even though they do gain wealth through it. So likewise, the humble witness of Jehovah may deliver the gospel of the Kingdom in printed form and </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font17">ceive money or other contributions to assist tile Kingdom work, and be entitled to the fundamental guarantees of freedom of speech and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">press. Wnen any peddling ordinance is applied to this form of \vork the ordinance thus becomes invalid as applied and the arrest and imprisonment an unlawful one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">POINT THREE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">An ordinance prohibiting uninvited calls at the </span><span class="font10">houses of residents by persons selling merchan </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">dise becomes invalid when applied to the sale </span><span class="font10">of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">printed matter containing information or opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In many cities, towns and villages of the country ordinances designated the &quot;Green River Ordinance&quot; are being enacted and enforced. This type of ordinance prohibits making calls at the homes of residents by hawkers, peddlers, itinerant merchants or transient vendors of merchandise for the purpose of selling goods, wares or merchandise without the prior invitation of the householder. The ordinance in effect says that any person desiring to sell any commodities to the inhabitants of a town at their homes must first have their in&quot;vitation or permission to call. It </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font0">virtually a prohibition on selling from house to house. Although Jehovah's witnesses are not hawkers, peddlers, or vendors of merchandise, a number of them have been arrested and charged with violation of this type of ordinance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The </span><span class="font0">ordinance of </span><span class="font10">Griffin, </span><span class="font0">Geor</span><span class="font10">gi</span><span class="font0">a, was held</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">invalid beCllmle it required a license to sell or give away printed matter. Under that ordinance the person de8iring to sell or give away printed matter had to ::;ecure permission from just one person, the City Manager. Under this so-called </span><span class="font15">&quot;Green River&quot; type of ordinance the one desir</span><span class="font16">ing to sen printed matter must secure permits </span><span class="font14">from </span><span class="font18">al </span><span class="font14">residents of </span><span class="font16">the </span><span class="font14">town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">By way of illustration: Suppose an inclivjd-ual prints a hook conveying important information coneel'l1ing local political matters. He cannot afford to give away copies free, but can cir-cuInte it throughout the city by secming a small sum for each copy. Under the Griffin type of </span><span class="font14">ordinance lJe </span><span class="font16">could </span><span class="font14">secure pcrlllission from </span><span class="font16">o</span><span class="font14">n</span><span class="font16">e man, the City Manager, aDd proceed with its distribution. The Supreme Court, bowever, held this requirement a denial of freedom of the press. Therefore he can circulate his book without securing permission from anyone. Under the Green River type of ordinance this person </span><span class="font14">is </span><span class="font15">proliihlted </span><span class="font16">h</span><span class="font15">o</span><span class="font16">m selling </span><span class="font14">Ills </span><span class="font15">book except at </span><span class="font16">homes which have given him a prior invitation to call </span><span class="font14">for </span><span class="font16">that purpose. </span><span class="font14">In a </span><span class="font16">to\Hl </span><span class="font14">of </span><span class="font16">one thousand homes he would thus have to secure one thousand permits ()l' licenses to circulate his book throughout that community. This is greater denial of freedom of the press than that of the Grjffin ordinanee. </span><span class="font18">It </span><span class="font16">NUl </span><span class="font18">be ('learIy </span><span class="font16">seen that the application of the Green River type of ordi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">nance to the work of circulating printed matter d(mies liberty and would be held invalid by the high courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">POINT FOUR</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">An ordinance prohibiting the soliciting of contributions for religious or charitable causes with out a license becomes </span><span class="font10">i</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font8">v</span><span class="font10">alid when </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">applied to the taking of contributions in exchange for printed </span><span class="font10">matter containing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">information </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Jehovah's witnesses leave printed matter with the people and accept in exchange therefor contributions to help print more like literature. Some munjeipalities require a license to solicit donations or contributions for any philanthropic, charitable or reli,brioiis cause. To apply such ordinance to the work of Jehovah's witnesses brings it into conflict with the legal propositions stated in the Lovell decision. The ordinance becomes a means of requiring </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font10">license to circulate printed matter containing information or opinion. The fact that a contribution definite or indefinite in amount may be received in exchange for such printed matter does not remove from the act of distribution the guarantee of freedom of the press. The Lovell decjsjon is emphatic upon the point. that the press cannot lawfully be subjected to license 01’ censorship. 'Vhethet printed matter is de</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">livered free or sold) or circulated in exchange for contributions, is entirely immaterial; and the ordinane-c so applied becomes invalid as a denial of liberty of the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">POINT FIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">Any law or ordinance prohibiting distribution of printed matter containing information or opinion '''hich is offensive or abusive concerning some person, or which may incite or promote hatred, hostility or violence against any group of persons by reason of race, color, religion or manner of worship, </span><span class="font16">h&quot;l </span><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">invnlid on its face because it unduly restricts and denies freedom of speech and press.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Kingdom message circulated by Jeho-yah's witnesses declares the day of vengeance of Almighty God and turns the searchlight of truth upon traditions of men and fraudulent practices </span><span class="font18">of </span><span class="font2">religionists. For this reason it is sometimes claimed that the message is offensive. It </span><span class="font18">is </span><span class="font2">offensive to hj&quot;]Jocl'itical vendors </span><span class="font18">of </span><span class="font2">religion, in the same sense that the truth is offensive to a liar. It is further claimed that the message incites and promotes hostility and hatred against some people, on account of their religion. This is not true. Publication of the </span><span class="font10">t.ruth </span><span class="font2">might promote hostility against false doctrines or </span><span class="font18">false religious practices) </span><span class="font2">hut would never incite or promote hatred or hostility against per-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">sons because they are Catholics, or Protestants, or Jews, or of any other creed or organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The United States Supreme Court in the case of </span><span class="font10">Schenck v. U.8., </span><span class="font11">249 </span><span class="font10">U. </span><span class="font11">S. 47, at page 52, holds that any restriction on freedom of speech or press must be justified by showing that the </span><span class="font10">a</span><span class="font11">c</span><span class="font10">t complained of constitutes a &quot;cleaT and pres</span><span class="font11">ent danger&quot; of some substantial evil to public safety. This means that the circulation of printed matter containing information or opinion may tlOt be prohibited or restricted even though it is offensive to some priest, preacher, religionist, politician or financier. It may not be prohibited even though it does mercjlessly peel off the pious, sanctined front of the modern-day Pharisees, and expose the extortion and filth within. Such exposure does not create any &quot;clear and present danger&quot; to the state. On the contrary, it is a benefit to alfhonest persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">In a case at New Haven, Connecticut, involving three of Jehovah's witnesses charged with distributing offensive matter and matter holding people up to contempt on account of their creed or religion, the Common Pleas Court dismissed the complaint. The court examined the printed matter so distributed, and in its decision (filed September </span><span class="font10">6, </span><span class="font11">1938) stated:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;1 </span><span class="font11">regard them [the books circulated by Jehovah's witnesses] as matters which the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">author may lawfully write and the accused lmdully possess </span><span class="font3">.</span><span class="font17">. </span><span class="font3">..</span><span class="font16">T </span><span class="font17">am as little willing to declare them unlawful </span><span class="font16">per se </span><span class="font17">as I ,vould be to declare that a Christian may not argue the Divinity of Christ, a Jew deny it, and a Confueianist ignore it as a legend. It is not the function of the courts to either coerce or curb thinking or expression, but at most to restrain </span><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">license</span><span class="font17"> of expression as related to time, place and circumstances, all of whieh must be related in the final analysis to the question of potential danger to the established order as represented by the system of government accepted by the people as a whole.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">This Connecticut decision correctly states </span><span class="font18">the </span><span class="font17">law, and any complaint filed agaiIlst Jehovah's witnesses under similar statutes or ordinances should be dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-style:italic;">POINT SIX</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">AppJication of these types of ordinances to the work of Jehovah's witnesses unreasonably restricts and denies the right to worship Almighty God in accordance with the dictates of conscience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Religious freedom is guaranteed to all people under the State Constitutions. It is likewise guaranteed under the &quot;due process&quot; clause of </span><span class="font18">t</span><span class="font17">h</span><span class="font18">e Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Con</span><span class="font17">stitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Meyer v. Nebraska, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">262</span><span class="font17"> U. </span><span class="font18">S. 390 </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Hamilton v. Regents,</span><span class="font18"> 293 U. S. </span><span class="font17">245</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">(A)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The ordinances restrict freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Jehovah's witnesses are engaged in an aetual worship of Almighty God. In obedience to the written command to aU followers of Jesus Christ to preach the gospel, Jehovah's witnesses call upon the people at their homes to present to them the Bible message. These ordinances would restrict such activity by requiring a permit to engage therein. They would restrict the hours of activity of Jehovah's witnesses and subject their work and character to censorship by law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">They cannot meet the conditions of the ordinance without their religions rights' being infringed; for the record s}iows it to be their conscientious belief tliat to apply for said permit would </span><span class="font18">he </span><span class="font17">an act of disobedience to the command of Almighty </span><span class="font18">God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">(B)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Municipalities must j'ustify such restriction of Teligious freedom by showing that the aets complained of violate the laws of morality or property. or infringe on personal rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The extent to which religious freedom abounds in this country is well stated as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">&quot;In this country the full and free right to entertain any religious belief, to practice any religious principle, and to teach any religious doctrine WhICh does not violate the laws of morality and property and which does not infringe personal rights is conceded to all.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Watson</span><span class="font0"> v. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Jones,</span><span class="font10"> 13 </span><span class="font0">Wall. </span><span class="font11">(U. S.) 679, 728</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Jehovah's witnesses are commanded in His written Word, the Bible, to preach the gospel. They are arrested ivr engaging in the practice of a religious principle, to wit, the principle that Christians must &quot;preach the word </span><span class="font10">j </span><span class="font0">be instant in seasou, out of season ...&quot; They have the full and free right to practice that principle unless by so doing they violate the laws of morality or property or infringe on personal rights. To justify application of the restrictive terms of the ordinance to the acts of these God-fearing persons the burden is on the municipality to show that they violate the laws of morality or property or infringe on personal rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">(C)</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">These ordinances as applied are invalid because they contravene </span><span class="font10">the law </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font10">Almighty </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God, </span><span class="font10">which is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">supreme and above all human laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Blackstone! </span><span class="font10">the </span><span class="font11">leading expon&lt;mt of the common law, states with precision and clarity the relation of the statute law to the higher law of the Creator.

<p><span class="font16">All Christians are commalHled by the law of God to walk in the </span><span class="font18">footstep:; </span><span class="font16">of Jesus and preach the gospel. (Acts 20:20; 1 Peter 2:21; 1 Corinthians </span><span class="font17">9: </span><span class="font16">16) This Jehovah's witnesses do in obedience to the Di-rine mandate. To apply t.hese ordinances to their mission is to reject the principle </span><span class="font18">of </span><span class="font16">the supremacy of the law of Almighty God and move forward t.o the establislilllcnt of a state religion such as abounds now in European countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">In these modern days a monstrosity has appeared across the waters, endangering the safety and liberty of all peoples of earth. This monstrosity may well be designated a &quot;state religion&quot;. It is the theory </span><span class="font18">or </span><span class="font16">teaching that the state is supreme over all, and that supreme allegiance is due to </span><span class="font18">It </span><span class="font16">by all its SUbjects. Thls appeared first in Soviet R.ussia, where under </span><span class="font18">governmental action the </span><span class="font16">state </span><span class="font18">has been exalted </span><span class="font16">above Almighty God and above everything pertaining to His Kingdom under Christ Jesus. In F'ascist Italy and in Nazi Germany that mon-stl'osity has also appeared. In these perilous</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">times this hideous monsiirosity has wrecked civic liberties of the people and brought fear and distress to mjUions in continental Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The actions of some officials and the decisions of some courts manifest that there is real danger of this alien totalitarian theory of gov</span><span class="font11">ernment being adopted and </span><span class="font10">put in </span><span class="font11">practice in the </span><span class="font10">Unitod States. Thousands of Jehovah's witnesses have been subjected to arrest and imprisonment during the past few years. They are Christians and their only &quot;offense&quot; is that they obey the law of God to preach the gospel and will not subject His mandates to the requirements of </span><span class="font11">local ordinances. Some authorities have stated, </span><span class="font10">&quot;Vole don't care what the law of God is; our ordinance comes fi1'8t. You must obey our ordinance regardless of commands from the Most High God.&quot; Thus the American States' constitutional declarations of gratitude of the people to Almighty God for the civil and religious liberty give</span><span class="font0">n </span><span class="font10">to </span><span class="font11">th</span><span class="font10">em </span><span class="font11">become a hypocritical </span><span class="font10">m</span><span class="font11">o</span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font11">ke</span><span class="font10">r</span><span class="font11">y</span><span class="font6">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah's witnesses are not hawkers, peddlers, or solicitors. They are not engaged in a</span><span class="font0">n </span><span class="font10">y commercial enterprise. They are not political agents. In obedience to the mandate of .AJmighty God, they preach the good news of His everlasting Kingdom under Christ Jesus, from place to place an</span><span class="font11">d house to house. Their right to do </span><span class="font10">so has been upheld by the highest court of the land. UnlawfUl interference therewith by offi-</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">“Because said ordinance is contrary to and in </span><span class="font16">violation of the first amendment to the ConstitU' </span><span class="font17">tion of the United States, which reads:</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">&quot;Said ordinance also prohibits the free exercise of petitioner's religion and the practice thereof by prohihiting the distribution of literature about petitioner's religion in violation of the terms of said quoted amendments&quot;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">The ordinance in its broad 5&quot;veep prohibits </span><span class="font0">the distribution of &quot;circulars, handbooks, advertising, or literature of any kind&quot;. </span><span class="font10">It </span><span class="font0">manifestly applies to pamphlets, magazines and periodicals. The evidence against appellant was that she distributed a certain pamphlet and </span><span class="font10">a </span><span class="font0">magazine called the &quot;Golden Age&quot;. Whether </span><span class="font10">in </span><span class="font0">actual administration the ordinance is applied, as apparently it could be, to newspapers does not appear. The City Manager testified that &quot;every one applies to me for a license </span><span class="font10">to </span><span class="font0">distribute literature in </span><span class="font10">this </span><span class="font0">City. None of these people (including defendant) secured a permit </span><span class="font10">from me </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font10">distribute literature </span><span class="font0">in the </span><span class="font10">City of </span><span class="font0">Griffin&quot;. The ordinance </span><span class="font10">is </span><span class="font0">not limited to &quot;literature&quot; that is obscene or offensive to public morals or that advocates unlawful conduct. There is no suggestion that the pamphlet and magazine distributed in the instant case were of that character.

It is not </span><span class="font10">limited to ways which might be regarded as In</span><span class="font0">consistent with the maintenance of public order,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">or as involving disorderly conduct, the molesta</span><span class="font11">tion of the inhabitants, or the misuse or Jittering' </span><span class="font0">of the streets. The ordinance prohibits the distribution of literature of any kind at any time^ at any place, and in any manner without a permit from the City Manager.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We </span><span class="font0">think that the ordinance is invalid on its face. V1J.wtever the motive which induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very foundation </span><span class="font11">of </span><span class="font0">the freedom </span><span class="font10">of </span><span class="font0">the press </span><span class="font11">by subjecting it to license and censorship. The </span><span class="font0">struggle for the freedom of the press was primarily directed against the power of the licen-</span><span class="font10">sai’. </span><span class="font0">It was against that power that John Milton directed his assault </span><span class="font10">by his &quot;Appeal </span><span class="font0">for the Liberty </span><span class="font10">of </span><span class="font0">Unlicensed Printing&quot;.

<p><span class="font10">'1'he liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals. It ne</span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font10">essarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. These indeed have been historic weapons in the defense of Iibmrty, as the pamphlets of Thomas Paine and others in our own history abundantly attest. The press in its historic connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opjnlon. What we have had recent occasion to say with respect to the vital importance of protecting this essential liherty from every sort of infringement need not be repented.
