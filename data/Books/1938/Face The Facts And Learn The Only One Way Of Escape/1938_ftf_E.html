<p><span class="font15">FACTS </span><span class="font9">fully stated are never open to suceess-</span><span class="font8">fill contradiction, and therefore they stand </span><span class="font9">admitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The body that assembles the facts sho'.llcl do so honestly, withontprejudice or partiality and free </span><span class="font6">from </span><span class="font9">fear of any creature. Vvhen assembled, the facts should be presented to the people </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">nn-</span><span class="font8">censored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Because the full statement of facts tends to shock the susceptibilities of some persons furnishes no excuse or justification to withhold from the public any part thereof, particularly when the public </span><span class="font8">welfare is involved. When presented to the people, </span><span class="font9">those hearing should face the facts with calmness and solemnity and then </span><span class="font8">sincerely take the </span><span class="font9">course which is for their best interest. Previous belief </span><span class="font6">or opinion should never be permitted to </span><span class="font9">hinder one in receiving and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">con-</span><span class="font9">sideI'ing </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">statement of facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A fact is a statement of truth. The great primary fact that stands out before all creation, and which is </span><span class="font8">not subject to successful contra</span><span class="font9">diction, is this;. to wit: '['hat many centuries ago the _Almighty God, who alone is called Jehovah, declared his purpose to set up </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">righteous government, which shall rule the world in righteousness, in which there is no unrighteousness, and before which ruling power aU human </span><span class="font10">creatures shall stand equal and be given a fair</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">opportunity to gain everlasting life* in peace and prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Another indisputable faet, </span><span class="font9">and that wliieit stands ovpr against God's righteous government, is a hideous monstrosity, which has recently appeared in the earth and which in utter disregard of dIe </span><span class="font8">inalienable rights </span><span class="font9">of human creatures is moving with rapidity to seize control of and rule the world, tOi regiment the people and make them serfs. The people dread </span><span class="font8">that </span><span class="font9">monstrosity and are yielding to it only because of fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Today there is no righteous government on the earth, and it </span><span class="font8">will be freely admitted </span><span class="font9">that in every nation there is great distress and per</span><span class="font2"></span><span class="font9">plexity among </span><span class="font8">the people and </span><span class="font9">men</span><span class="font8">’s </span><span class="font9">hearts are failing theln for fear. Only onc(&gt; before in world history </span><span class="font8">have eonditions </span><span class="font9">been anything like those of the present time. The canse then was the same as </span><span class="font8">the cause now, which has brought about </span><span class="font9">present distressing conditions </span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font8">Judging </span><span class="font9">the future by the past, and judging it with even great&quot; er certainty from the Word of Almighty </span><span class="font8">Goel, we </span><span class="font9">knO\y what is upon the wodd an</span><span class="font8">d </span><span class="font9">what shall be the result in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All nations of </span><span class="font9">the earth face the same condition. No one, therefore, should be moved by prejudice or partiality against another because of race, nationality or color. God made of </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">one </span><span class="font9">blood all nations of men that dwell on the earth, and aJ I men are entitled to 1 he same fair consideration ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">There cannot be </span><span class="font9">the slightest doubt that all natio</span><span class="font6">n</span><span class="font9">s are facing </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">death, and </span><span class="font9">the people of all </span><span class="font6">nations who desire life will soberly hear the </span><span class="font8">facts, </span><span class="font9">can</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">d</span><span class="font8">i</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">d</span><span class="font9">ly consider them an</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">d act </span><span class="font9">with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">wisdom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">F'acing the. facts which we know to exist, and viewing such in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">light of the Bible, we are cert</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font9">in to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">se</span><span class="font8">e the right </span><span class="font9">way </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font9">leads </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font9">of the darkness that </span><span class="font8">has </span><span class="font9">c</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">o</span><span class="font3">r</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">e </span><span class="font9">upon the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">HIE PROMISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Almighty God gave </span><span class="font9">his word of promise that he would </span><span class="font6">make </span><span class="font9">his </span><span class="font6">Messiah, the Christ, the </span><span class="font11">Head of his </span><span class="font9">righteous government, who shall rule the </span><span class="font6">world in </span><span class="font9">righteousness and </span><span class="font11">adnlinister </span><span class="font9">life </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">everlasting </span><span class="font9">to all </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font9">who obey him, and men named at Hebrews eleven shall </span><span class="font11">I’ule the </span><span class="font6">earth. </span><span class="font9">( Genesis 12: 3; Isaiah H: 6, 7; Psalm. 45: 16) That government of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font8">c</span><span class="font11">e</span><span class="font9">s</span><span class="font8">s</span><span class="font9">ity must be </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">the</span><span class="font8">o</span><span class="font6">c</span><span class="font8">rac</span><span class="font9">y, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font8">v</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font8">r</span><span class="font9">y member thereof must be in </span><span class="font6">exact harmony with Jehovah God and move according </span><span class="font9">to his conunandments. </span><span class="font6">Why did </span><span class="font9">God make that </span><span class="font6">promlse?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures </span><span class="font8">an</span><span class="font9">sw</span><span class="font8">er: </span><span class="font9">God </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">made Lucifer </span><span class="font9">the overlord </span><span class="font6">or god of the world and placed the </span><span class="font9">perfect man 111lcler his lonh'hip. Lucifer </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">rebeHed </span><span class="font6">against God. </span><span class="font9">His name God then </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">changed </span><span class="font9">to that of Satan, that old Serpent, the Devil and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dragon, </span><span class="font9">and the sentence of dflath was entered </span><span class="font6">against him. </span><span class="font9">(Uevelation 12: 9; 20: 2) Because .Adam </span><span class="font11">had joined the </span><span class="font9">Devil in rebellion He was se</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font9">teneed to death, and as a result thereof </span><span class="font11">a</span><span class="font9">nd by inheritance all men have been </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">born </span><span class="font9">in sin and therefore imperfect and unrighteous. Then Satan declared that God </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">could </span><span class="font9">not put on the earth men who would </span><span class="font6">be </span><span class="font9">f</span><span class="font8">a</span><span class="font9">ithf</span><span class="font8">u</span><span class="font11">l </span><span class="font9">and true to Jehovah </span><span class="font6">and who would maintain their integrity </span><span class="font9">toward him. (.r oh 1: £J-11; 2: 4, 5) That challenge was </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">defamation of God's name and raised the question of his supremacy. Therefore God </span><span class="font8">delayed the execution of </span><span class="font9">Satan in order to give him the opportunity to make proof of his wicked challenge, which God knew Satan could not do. His failure would he </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">vllldirntion of Jehovah's name. Therefore God said to Satan: &quot;For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my </span><span class="font8">power; </span><span class="font9">and in order that they [my witnesses] </span><span class="font8">may proclaim, </span><span class="font9">my </span><span class="font8">name </span><span class="font9">throughout all the earth.&quot;-—Exodus 9: 16, Leeser.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9">To make good his challenge the Devil must turn </span><span class="font8">men </span><span class="font9">away </span><span class="font8">from God and cause them to oppose </span><span class="font9">Jehovah. His chief </span><span class="font8">means of accomplishing that purpose is fraud </span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">of</span><span class="font9"> deceit His name 8erpent </span><span class="font8">means </span><span class="font9">deceiver. .He has deceived all </span><span class="font8">men </span><span class="font9">except those who have strictly adhered to and oheved God's commandments written in Hi&quot; </span><span class="font6">Bible, Knowing that men by </span><span class="font9">nature </span><span class="font8">look to some higher power, Satan brought in religion as a fo</span><span class="font9">j</span><span class="font8">:m of worship </span><span class="font9">and hxl </span><span class="font8">men </span><span class="font9">to deify creatures rather than to worship Jehovah God the Creator iTJ spirit and in truth. 'Until reeently aU of </span><span class="font8">us </span><span class="font9">believed that religion and Christianity are tilt, </span><span class="font8">same. </span><span class="font9">The legislative bodies of theland and the CGnrts also have used, and continue to </span><span class="font8">use, </span><span class="font9">the words religion and Christianity as synonymous terms. Now God has made it clearly to be seen by those who diligently seek the truth that </span><span class="font8">re</span><span class="font9">ligion is </span><span class="font8">a </span><span class="font9">form of worship but Wl1ich denies the power of God and turns men away from God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">whereas Christianity means the strict obedience to God's commandments. Religion and Christianity are therefore exactly opposite to each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By means of deception Satan has hHllded practically the entire human race, the exception being those faithful mpn who at all times have diligently obeyed God and maiI!tained their integrity toward him and by so doing have proved Satan to be a liar and that God can put </span><span class="font7">men </span><span class="font9">on the earth who wil remain true and faithful to Jehovah, Since the first coming of Christ Jesus until now there have been on the earth a few creatures who have truly followed in the footsteps of Christ Jesus and have been witnesses to the name and majesty of .Jehovah God. All of these the Devil has bitterly opposed and persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">TIME liMn</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">God fixed the time limit during which he would not interfere with the Devil's efforts to prove his wicked challenge. That time limit must end, and then Satan's rule must cease. When on the earth .Jesus emphasized the fact that the Devil is the invisible ruler of the wicked world and that in GodJs due time Satan's world would come to </span><span class="font7">an </span><span class="font9">end. Jesus specified the physical facts that would come to pass showing when the end of that </span><span class="font7">'NO</span><span class="font9">rId anlves. According to the prophecy of Jesus, what </span><span class="font7">arc </span><span class="font9">the things to be expected when the world eomes to an end' The answer is, world war, famine, pestilence, dis-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">tress of nations, and, amongst other things mentioned, the appearing of a monstrosity on the earth. (Matthew 24; Luke 21) The World War came in 1914 in fulfillment of that prophecy, marking the time when God sent forth ,Tesus Christ to rule while the Devil is still operating.—Psalm 110: 1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Famine and pestilence quickly followed tIw &quot;World War. World distress is now upon all the nations, and fear has seized hold upon all of them, and such is in fulfillment of the prophecy. (Matthew 24: a-12; Luke 21: 20-26) These are the indisputable physical facts which have come to pass proving that Satan's world has come to an end, and which facts </span><span class="font7">ea</span><span class="font9">nn</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font9">t be ignored. What then is to be expected ? The Scriptures answer: God's &quot;strange work&quot;, that is, his witness work, quickly thereafter to be followed by his &quot;strange act&quot;, which is Armageddon, the battle of the great day of God Almighty, the worst tribulation that ever came upon the world, and which shall be the last.-Matthew 24; 14, 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">CLIMAX</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The time limit is up. God's kingdorn is here, and Armageddon is impending. Mark this, that Jehovah said that just preceding Armageddon he would cause his name to be testified in all the earth. (Exodus 9: 16) For that very purpose God has taken out from amongst the nations &quot;a people for his name&quot;, (Acts 15: 14) All of those ones taken out must be witnesses to the name of Jehovah God, because he so declared</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">and he has given them that name. (Isaiah 43: 9-12; 62: 2) God is now using those witnesses to carry on his &quot;strange work&quot;, which work con-si </span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font9">ts of these witnesses' going abo</span><span class="font7">u</span><span class="font9">t amongst the people and telling them the truth of and </span><span class="font7">co</span><span class="font9">n</span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">er</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">i</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">g Jehovah's purpose and of his kingdom, and particularly pointing out to them that religion is opposed to God's kingdom and is the means the Devil </span><span class="font7">uses </span><span class="font9">to deceive the people and turn them away from God and lead them into destruction. That appears to be </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">very &quot;strange” kind of work to an of those who are not Christians, because they have been led to believe that relig:ion Hnd Christianity are the same and that both proceed from God. The Lord definitely points out that such &quot;strange work&quot; of wi </span><span class="font7">tness-</span><span class="font9">ing must be done before the final end; as it is Vvl'itten: 'This gospel of the kingdom </span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font9">hall be preached to aU nations as a witness, and then shall the end come:’ (Matthew 24: 14) Such wit-ne</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font9">s work is now in progress and must he .tin-islwd before Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">OPPONENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J </span><span class="font7">esus </span><span class="font9">Christ taught his followers to always pray for the coming of God's kingdom, and accordingly all professed Christians for centuries have prayed, 'Thy kingdom come; thy will be done </span><span class="font7">on </span><span class="font9">earth as in heaven: Religionists; while littering that prayer, act exactly contrary thereto, They do not desire God's kingdom on earth, but desire to continue their </span><span class="font7">own </span><span class="font9">schemes to rule the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus and his apostles emphasized the great</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">kingdom, which would appear at the end of the world. Now Christ has come and his rule has</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">i . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begun. He has cast Satan out of heaven, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now Satan's operations are confined to the earth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for this reason, as the Scriptures declare,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">j &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great woes have come upon the nations of.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">down is near, and the Devil knows that </span><span class="font9">his </span><span class="font10">time is short; and in order to deceive the people and plunge them into destruction, by which he expects to defeat God and sustain his own challenge, the Devil brings forth in opposition to , God's </span><span class="font9">kingdom </span><span class="font10">under Christ, and as a </span><span class="font9">substitute </span><span class="font10">therefor, a hideous monstrosity, by which the people are being further deceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">HIDEOUS MONSTROSITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">J </span><span class="font10">ehovah God is supreme, but the Devil denies that fact. God's righteous government is </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font10">theocracy, because Christ </span><span class="font9">.1 </span><span class="font10">esus, the Head thereof, does everything according to Jehovah's </span><span class="font9">win. In </span><span class="font10">mockery of Jehovah Satan sets up a counter ■' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;government, in which he puts himself in a place</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similar to that of Jehovah God, and his religious</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">representatives on the earth he assigns to the place similar to that occupied by Christ Jesus; </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font10">hi</span><span class="font9">s </span><span class="font10">cruel dictators he substitutes in the i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place of the faithful men whom the Lord de</span></p>

(Psalm </span><span class="font9">45: </span><span class="font10">IG; Isaiah 32: 1) That monstrosity is </span><span class="font7">an</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">i</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">abomination in the sight ofGod, and such monstrosity, God foretold by his prophets, would appear at this time.-Matthew 24: 15; Daniel 11 : 31; 12: 11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The kingdom ofGod under Christ is the means of vindicating Jehovah's name and providing salvation for humankind. Satan's monstrosity in opposition to God's kingdom claims to he the means of saving the world in this hour of great distress. Satan is thereby deceiving or fooling many people. Heligionists support the monstrosity as against Jehovah's kingdom. Christians fully support Jehovah's kingdom under Christ. The monstrosity andGod's kingdom are deadly foes. One must lose; the other must win. The League of Notions was brought forth as </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">substitute for God's kingdom, and that has failed, as God by his prophets foretold. Now the great monstrosity appears in another form, and blasphemously assumes to rule the world and to destroy everyone who supports God's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">What is that hideous monstrosity'? It is the totalitarian government or ruling power, which makes the State supreme, regiments all the peo-pIe, rules them by arbitrary dictators, compels all to render complete obedience thereto, and which monstrosity tlierefoH) is a fraudulent mimic of God's righteous government. Now mark the indjsputable facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Fulfilled prophecy shows that in 1914 Jehovah enthroned Christ .Tf3SUS and sent him forth to rule, while Satan still exercises his power in the world. (Psalm 110: 1, 2) In 1917 Satan brought</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">forth in Russia a Communist or Bolshevik government, which was the first appearance of a totalitarian rule, and which opposes God and his kingdom. , It declares that the State is the supreme power, and it persecutes those who serve God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1 !322 Italy became a totalitarian govern</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ment, which rule defies God and his kingdom, declares the State is the highest power, and vigor-<sup>1</sup> ously opposes the proclamation of God's king' dom within Italian territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In 1933 Germany was seized by the Nazis, and is now ruled by an arbitrary dictator, which government also declares that the State is </span><span class="font7">su</span><span class="font9">preme, defieR Jehovah God and his kingdom, and cruelly persecutes all who even name the name of Jehovah and who have in possession puhliea-Hons telling of Jehovah and his Word, the Bible, and of his righteous government under Christ .Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Religion has always been the tie that binds together parthly powers and which through fear keeps the people in SUbjection. The noman Catholic religious organization has always claimed to be the representative of Christ on earth, but the indisputable facts show exactly to the con' trary. Jesus Christ made it clearly to appeu</span><span class="font7">[' </span><span class="font9">that his kingdom has nothing in common with this world over which Satan exercises power, and he emphatically warned his followers to keep themselves separate and apart from the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;politics of the world and commands them </span><span class="font7">to</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sup>:</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strictly obey God's commandments. (John</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">18: 36; .J </span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">mes 1 </span><span class="font7">: </span><span class="font9">27) Contrary to the commandments of the Lord the Papacy assumes temporal power and becomes a part of worldly governments and p</span><span class="font7">u</span><span class="font9">ts its ambassadors in practically all the nations and exercises political power throughout the earth. Hegal'dless of what good intentions may have existed when formed; the Catholic Orgmitzation of Authority has become entirely political. It continues to operate under </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">religious name, is agaiust God and his king.. dom under Christ, and hence violently opposes the proclamation of truth concerning God's kingdom. The Papacy is willing </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font9">make an alliance with any political power that will recognize the Roman Catholic Hierarchy as the spiritual part of world powers. The Hierarchy has nmde such alliance in order that thc Papacy may oc</span><span class="font7">en</span><span class="font9">py the place as a super-government, and therefore the Vatican became a part of the pm\‘-er that governs this world. That religious organization therefore is a part of the monstrosity now appearing in and claiming the right to rule the earth. Here mark more facts which cannot he disputed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When Mussolini marched to Home to take possession thereof he was an avowed atheist, opposed to God and his kingdom, and would not tolerate anyone who supports God's kingdom </span><span class="font7">or </span><span class="font9">advertises the same. He was then opposed to an religious organizations. But in 1929 Mussolini and the pope, the head of that </span><span class="font7">m</span><span class="font9">ighty religious organization, entered into </span><span class="font7">an </span><span class="font9">alliance by which temporal power ]n It</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">ly </span><span class="font7">was </span><span class="font9">l'm;torl3d to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">pope, and Mussolini became a devoted Catholic, and therefore a supporter of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Likewise the dictator of the totalitarian rule of Germany has entered into an alliance with the pope, and he is an avowed Catholic and supports the Catholic religion, and protects it within that arhitrary government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hecclltly Mr. Forbes, executive secretary of the Communist party, proposed mutual co-operation between Communism and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in state affairs. In answer thereto the pope, acting through his cardinal and authoritative representative (Verdier), at Paris, made reply to the Communist party in these words: &quot;If this gesture of the outstretched hand from your side expresses the wish to become better acquainted with your Catholic brothers in order to give better respect to the religion which inspires them to their convictions, their feelings, their works, then the church will not refuse to carry ont the::; work of enlightenment and you will recognize that this </span><span class="font7">can </span><span class="font9">contribute greatly to the happiness of all.&quot;’ To such generous offer from the pope the Communist party responded in these words: &quot;The outstretched hand of the Communist party to the Catholic people remains outstretched.&quot; (New York times, .July 2G, 1938) True, the Catholic Press of America, since the Hierarchy's connection with the Fascists was exposed in Australia, in Seattle, •Washington, and in other places, has had much to say about a possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">break between the pope and the Fascists. Such publication is merely a political trick to keep the people deceived and in the dark while the 'l'otalitarians march on and seize control of America and England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1'he indisputable facts are that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy has stooped wholly to political methods to gain control of tlle world, and concerning such an honest Catholic of New York has written a book entitled &quot;Bome Stoops to Conquer&quot;, and therein submits the proof that Vatican City's chief ohjective is to rule the world in conjunction with radical powers. The Hierarchy has placed its trusted men in the key positions of political office in praetically every nation of the world, which men are first Catholic and, regardless of the just rights of the people, always earry out the will of tIle Hierarchy in political governmental affairs, These facts, which cannot be disputed, disclose the Roman Catholie Hierarchy's determination to act as a kind of sPlritual supeT-government over the dictators of the world, forming a part of the monstrosity, and which violently opposes Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ Jesus. The monstrosity moves onward!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Between 1521 and 1531 came the break of the German states and Great Britain with the Papacy. Now Germany is in all alliance with the Papacy, and Great Britain is rapidly moving in that direction. 'rhe United States of America, once the bulwark of democracy, is all set to be</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">come</span><span class="font7"> 11 </span><span class="font9">part of the totalitarian rule. Most of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">American people are totally ignorant of the fact that Congress has recently enacted a law by which the president can become a dictator in one hour and can absolutely control every part of the nation, </span><span class="font7">eveJl </span><span class="font9">as Germany is </span><span class="font7">now </span><span class="font9">misruled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus the indisputable facts are, that there is nowin Hle earth Satan's dictatorial monstrosity, which defies and . opposes Jehovah's kingdom under Christ, and that such totalitarian, arbitrary rule is fully supported by the Hierarchy, which admittedly is the leading religious organization in existence. These facts the people must face, and learn the meaning thereof, in order to safeguard their own interests. Jehovah and Christ Jesus are the real friends of the ppople, and the followers of Christ .Jesus, who </span><span class="font7">are </span><span class="font9">jehovah's witnesses, are the only ones who visit the people to comfort those in distress, and this they do in obedience to God's eommand-.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">ments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PERSECUTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the time of Abel religionists have persecuted those who obey God's commandments, and this appears to mean t.hat religion is of the Devil. Heligionists persecuted J'esus even unto death, and he plainly told them that they were and are the sons of the Devil and that their political-religious organization is a product of Satan and is au abomination in the sight of God. —Matthew 23: 2-35; John 8: 42-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah's witnesses and their companions, the Lord's &quot;other sheep&quot;, which are caned</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">«,Jonadahs&quot;, are wholly devoted to God and his kingdom under Christ. They suffer persecution continuously at the handsoof the Roman Catholic Hi</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">r</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">rchy in every nation on earth, and in such persecution the totalitarian government works with the Papacy. In Germany thousands of true fo]]owers of Christ J</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">sus now linger in pTison because they told the truth, and for no other reason. In many parts of the British Empire and in the United States, Jehovah's witnesses suffer great opposition and much perse</span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">ution, and such is always at the instigation Of religionists, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Why do religionists bitterly oppose and persecute the true followers of Christ? .Jesus answered that question in these words addressed to his true followers: &quot;[Because] I have ehosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth yon ....If they have persecuted me,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">they [the religionists] will also persecute you.&quot; (J o11n 15: 19, 20) These faithful witnesses of the Lord are persecuted hecause they tell the truth of God </span><span class="font5">c</span><span class="font9">oncerning his righteow; government .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. In Northern and Southern Rhodesia, as ,veIl as in W est Africa, in Australia, the Fiji Islands, Port of Sp</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">in, and other </span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">rown colonies, in Quebec, and in other parts of the British Empire, not only are </span><span class="font2">.</span><span class="font9">Jehovah's witn</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">sses and their . companions opposed, but their Bible literature is confiscated and destroyed and these true Christians are viciously p</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">rse</span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">uted, and all such oppmiition is at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hie:rarchy, who </span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">lways have their men on the job. If the Hierarchy represented God, as claimed, why is it necessary to oppose and persecute others because they ten the people about God's kingdom under Christ as the only means of salvation? In many nations laws are enacted which, it is claimed, are directed against Com-muuists, but which lavvs, in fact, are directed against true Christians, the purpose being to prevent them from bearing witness to God's kingdom. God foretold that this would he done, in these words: 'I!'hey [opponents] frame mischief by law; they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.' (Psalm 94: 20.21) Being Scripturally unequipped to defend themselves and their position, the religionists resort to per-seeution by law. Astnte, lawyers, representing the Hierarchy, write such laws and subtly induce the law-making body to enact the same on the plea tlmi such laws are in the public inte1'e::;t to protect the people from Communism, while at the same ti</span><span class="font7">m</span><span class="font9">e Communists and the Hierarchy hold out their hands to each other in mutual co-operation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">-When t</span><span class="font9">h</span><span class="font0">e totalitarian Catholic combine </span><span class="font9">gains control </span><span class="font0">of the British Isles, which it is </span><span class="font9">certain to </span><span class="font0">do, then all liberties of the people </span><span class="font9">will </span><span class="font0">be at </span><span class="font7">un </span><span class="font9">fmd. For many centuries </span><span class="font0">this </span><span class="font9">and the </span><span class="font0">other</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">nations have claimed to be Christian and have openly endorsed the fundamental principle as stated by Blackstone, the well-known law writer of England, in these words; &quot;Laws of the state derive their validity from their conformity to the law of God. No human laws are of any validity if contrary to God's law.&quot; What will be the condition when all nations become totalitarian ? '1'hat will prove beyond all doubt that such nations have become wicked and have entirely forgotten God, and oppose his righteous government; and the end of those nations is stated by the Lord in these ,vords: &quot;'The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.&quot; (Psalm 9: 17) That means the complete destruction at Armageddon of the nations; and the ones who lead th.) nations to so forget God and bring about their destruction are the leaders of religion, and particularly the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which now by law attempts to keep the people from hearing the truth concerning the only hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">WORK</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Shall the work of proclaiming the truth throughout the earth to the name of Jehovah and his kingdom cease because of opposition by the Hierarehy totalitarian combine'? From the throne of heaven comes in thundering tones the answer, &quot;No!'&lt;' Such is ,Jehovah's &quot;strange work&quot;, which he eommands must be done by his witnesses immediately preceding Armageddon, and nothing can stop it until God says, &quot;It is done.&quot; Amidst like persecution Jesus continued the work assigned to him until it was :finished. The faithful apostles followed his lead and did likewise until their work was completed. It is the expressed </span><span class="font7">'v </span><span class="font9">ill of Jehovah that every true Christian today shall continue to proclaim the name of Jehovah and his kingdom until Armageddon. God will shield and deliver his people while they obey his commandments, and they need not fear man or Devil, and thus they are going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jj-'or the encouragement of his people Jehovah made many prophetic pictures in times of old, which he is now causing to be fulfiled and understood by those who love him. Among those prophetic pictures is. that of Jehoshaphat and the enemies acting against the Israelites. Jehoshaphat and the faithful Israelites pictured Christ an.d his faithful followers. Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir conspired to destroy the Israelites, and they pictured the totalitarian combine. lJ.'heil' united armies marched on .J erusalem to destroy it. Jehovah gave command that his people should not fice from the enemy, but should boldly march out to meet the enemy, singing the praises of Jehovah as they went, and to his people Jehovah said : 'Be not afraid of the enemy ; the battle is God's.' Then God brought about the complete destruction of the combined enemy, thus showing what shall come to pass upon the totalitarian crowd at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Another prophetic picture is that of Saul, the Philistines, and David. Saul pictured the </span><span class="font7">Ull-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">faithful religionists, who claim to serve God but who submit to the opponents of God. The giant Goliath, who led the Philistines, pictured the totalitarian Hier'[trchy combine that is now bluffing an nations with the determination of forcing' the</span><span class="font7">m </span><span class="font9">to yield to dictatorial rule. David, the anointed of God) pictured Christ Jesus and </span><span class="font0">his faithful followers </span><span class="font9">now on the earth. David engaged the giant in combat and slew him, thus disclosing wllat is now in progress and what God through Christ Jesus, the antitypical David, will do to the t.otalitarian combine at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">liet the Hierarchy, including the pope, together with all others that form the totalitarian, dictatorial rule, the representatives of which are now listening to this speech, thereby hoping </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font9">find </span><span class="font0">some occasion </span><span class="font9">against </span><span class="font0">God's people, </span><span class="font9">now take notice. To </span><span class="font0">such </span><span class="font9">opponents we now say: “Today you stand before the judgment seat of Christ, the great Judge of the world. According to the undisputed facts you are convieted out of yonI' own monU), and the Lord's final judgment has been entered against you and you are going to die. You have willingly yielded to Satan, abandoned God and his King, and have permitted the Dewil to gather you to Armageddon, that battle of the great day </span><span class="font0">of God Almighty, as </span><span class="font9">Jesus foretold. (Revelation HI: 13-16) The final showdown has come. Your high-sounding titles, your garments, your exalted positions, yonr money, and your boasted power, shall now </span><span class="font1">completely fail you. Christ Jesus, the anti-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">typical David, has called your bluff. Jehovah's witnesses do not fear you, but they do fear and serve God and Christ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">&quot;For the purpose of preventing your exposure you now seek the destruction of Jehovah's witnesses. You come to us with your laws subtly enacted and wrongfully enforced. You come to us with your strong-arm squad, with your armies and navies, all armed to the teeth, with sword and cannon. -We meet you upon the battlefield with songs of praise to Jehovah's name upon our lips. We come to you in the name and strength of Jehovah God and his King, whom you have defied. At the battle of Armageddon Christ J eSTIs, leading his invincible army, will slay you and give your dead carcasses to the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth, and all creation shall know that Jehovah is the </span><span class="font9">Almig'hty </span><span class="font10">God, that Christ Jesus is the rightful Ruler of the world and the Vindicator of God's word and name, and that Jehovah can put men on earth who will remain true to him.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Only once before in world history were conditions similar to those of today. That was at the time of the flood, which Jesus declared was </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font10">type foretelling the present-day conditions. (Matthew 24:37-39; Luke 17:26,27) Then the earth was filled with a wicked crowd that defied Jehovah God. Jehovah sent Noah to warn the people of impending disaster. At God's command the ark was built, which was a type of </span><span class="font9">God's </span><span class="font10">organization under Christ. Refusing to give heed to the warning, God then destroyed </span><span class="font9">all flesh on the earth, and only those who joined Noah in the ark were saved. Those survivors pictured the Lord's &quot;other sheep&quot;, who now take refuge in God's organization under Christ, the antitypical ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fLEE NOW</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Every purpose of Jehovah shall be performed. (Isaiah 46 : 11) His kingdom of righteousness is here. Let all take warning. Ambitious men have set up in the place and stead of Jehovah's kingdom that monstrosity, the totalitarian government, which boastfully claims it shall save the world. That monstrosity is a &quot;desolating abomination&quot; in the sight of God and brings only suffering and deatIl to the people. By his prophet Daniel Jehovah foretold its coming and its end. The indisputable facts show that the totalitarian government blasphemously claims that which belongs only to God. To all who see these facts and who candidly face them Christ Jesus gives these words of warning: &quot;When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, ...then let them that be in Judma flee to the mountains.&quot; (Mark 13: 14) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mountains </span><span class="font9">symbolically represent God's kingdom, particularly the capital organization under Christ, the Chief thereof. Such is the antitypical city of refuge (Numbers 35: 6-32), and only those who flee from Satan's rule and take their stand on the side of God and Christ will find protection and safety at Armagfiddon. After Armageddon begins will be too late to flee, and therefore God coHnnnnds that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the warning be given </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">now, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and that is why </span><span class="font2">.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font9">ehovah's witnesses </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font9">giving it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHERS TAKE WARNING</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The English-speaking people have had freer access to the Bible than any other people on earth ; therefore their </span><span class="font8">greater responsibility </span><span class="font9">before the Lora. Centuries ago </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font9">who sincerely believed in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font9">and Christ formed </span><span class="font8">themselves </span><span class="font9">into an association called </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Protestant&quot;, </span><span class="font9">which they did in protest against the works of the Catholic Hie</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">:ral'</span><span class="font9">c</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">h</span><span class="font9">y</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font9">Alas, hl these days of great peril and w</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">h</span><span class="font9">e</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">n </span><span class="font9">all </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">should </span><span class="font9">be declaring the name of ,Jehovah and his kingdom under </span><span class="font8">Christ as </span><span class="font9">the ouly means of salvation, the &quot;Protestant&quot; organization remains silent and iheTcfore t</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font9">citly supports the &quot;abomination of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">desolation&quot;, which </span><span class="font9">hlasphemol1s1y stands in the place </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of Gou's kingdom, </span><span class="font9">\vhere </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font9">ougM not to stand. Let &quot;Protestants&quot; and all persons of good will toward God awake and turn quickly to the Bible and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">there, </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9">light of present-day events, learn that GoC's kingdom is the only hope of humankind. Learning such fact, then quickly take your stand firmly on the side of God and his kingdom; otherwise you shall vorish at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jerusalem, where' God put his </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Name, was </span><span class="font9">typical of: &quot;Christendom&quot;'. “Christendom,&quot; like J enumlem, has ranen avvay from God. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Before </span><span class="font9">JCl'l1SalCln </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">fen .}PllOvah sent ,Jeremiah </span><span class="font9">his prophet to give warning </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to tlle people that </span><span class="font9">all </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">those of </span><span class="font9">good will might awake and fiee </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to safety, </span><span class="font9">,Jeho-vall caused to he enacted </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9">IH'ophctic drama in</span></p>

Do not try. Your safety is on the Lord's side; hut there really will be hut a short time that the combine will hold sway, because it is written in the Lord's vVord, at 1 Thessalonians 5:3, that when this crowd says, "We are now at peace and safety,' the Lord </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">se</span><span class="font9">nds sudden destruction upon them, and they are at th</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">e</span><span class="font9">i</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">r </span><span class="font9">wits' eud, and they shall find no way of escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ISSUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the name of Jehovah God is vindicated by and through his kingdom, the totalitarian </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">com</span><span class="font9">bine and all rule under Satan must perish. The i</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">s</span><span class="font9">s</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">u</span><span class="font9">e shall be settled </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">soon </span><span class="font9">at Armageddon. The issue is not between Catholics and Protestants, Jews or Gentiles; the issue is not between Fascism, the Hierarchy and Communism, be- because all of them are on the same side. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">great issue is Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ, the world's rightful ruler against the rule of Satan by and through his politicalreligious totalitarian combine. Let all take warning! Every. human creature on earth must decide whom he will serve. 'Those who remain under the rule of Satan's makeshift shall die. Those who take their standpoint firmly on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom under Christ, and who sincerely and diligently serve that kingdom, shall live. Choose which side you will take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GREAT FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The great and indisputable facts, which all must now face, are these:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Jehovah God's kingdom has begun. The end of Satan's world has come. God is </span><span class="font7">now </span><span class="font9">carrying on his &quot;strange work&quot;, which consists of his witnesses under the command of the Lord giving testimony of the kingdom to the peoples of earth. After that work is finished, then immediately follows Armageddon, which will completely wreck every institution and every part thereof that stands in opposition to the kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Only the Lord's &quot;other sheep&quot;, the .Jonadabs, who compose the &quot;great multitude&quot;, will survive that great tribulation. (Revelation 7 :9-17) Those faithful ones remaining true and steadfast to God and his King have the Lord's promise that they shall be carried through Armageddon, even as Noall and his family were carried over the flood. Now we see the .Jonadabs hurrying to the Lord and forming the &quot;great multitude&quot;, and they must all be gathered before Armageddon begins, even as Noah's family had to be taken into the ark before the deluge began. According to the words of the Lord those of the &quot;great multitude&quot; come from all nations of the earth and now engage actively in the service and praise of .Jehovah and his King.—Revelation 7: 9-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">. At the beginning Jehovah gave command to perfect man to &quot;multiply and fill the earth&quot;. That command has never been fulfilled, because the perfect man fell away. God's command shall be completely fulfilled. Ffhe &quot;great multitude&quot; will be the only ones left on the earth after Armageddon. They will be righteous in the sight of the Lord because of their faith and obedience. They will carry out the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth. Therefore the &quot;great multitude&quot; 'will be privileged, according to the Scriptures, to marry and bring forth children in righteousness and fill the earth with a joyful and righteous race that will forever praise the name of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">\V e have no in will toward and no controversy with any person because of his religious belief, nationality or color, but we are against every part of Satan's organization. We must tell the truth and give the warning, because God has commanded that to be done. (Ezekiel 33 : 7 and 5) I propose the following Declaration and </span><span class="font0">I </span><span class="font9">urge upon all persons who desire to live to make that Declaration their own. 1. Those who so declare should vote Aye ; those opposed, No!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'Ve declare that the Almighty God is Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">and that there is ll one other; that Christ Jesus is the King of the world, the Vindicator of Jehovah's name, and the Savior of meno</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">\Ve recognize that Jehov</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">h</span><span class="font5">'</span><span class="font7">s </span><span class="font9">kingdom with Christ as King is God's means provided for our salvation and for the vindication of his great name. \Ve therefore declare ourselves wholly for Jehovah God and his King and kingdom, and by His grace we will serve and faithfully support his kingdom henceforth and forever, having fun confidence that by so doing we may receive from Jehovah his favor and life everlasting through Jesus Christ </span><span class="font7">our </span><span class="font9">Lord, and to God's eternal glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">[The great visible audience and also the invisible </span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">d</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font9">pted the declaration by a tremendous shout AYE rIhe speaker continued :]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Why do the great nevyspapers ignore these vital facts ? The democracies of earth, and par-tieularly Great Britain and America, </span><span class="font7">are </span><span class="font9">in great danger of totalitarian rule. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority,, the Fascists and the Nazis </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">am</span><span class="font9"> conspiring together to </span><span class="font8">gain control and </span><span class="font9">rule all the nations by dictators </span><span class="font5">. </span><span class="font8">.lHthongh the newspapers know </span><span class="font9">this fact they</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">refuse to publish the truth concerning the same, and so far as the press is </span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">oncern</span><span class="font5">e</span><span class="font9">d the people are kept in ignorance. The newspapers therefore indirectly support the conspiracy and are unfaithful to the p eopl</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Centuries ago the Almighty God gave his word that in his due time and a</span><span class="font7">m</span><span class="font9">idst great distress and perplexity in the world, exactly what we now sec, he would set up his righteous government -witt) Christ as King, and which will rulp the </span><span class="font7">na</span><span class="font9">tions in righteousness. 'rhat kingdom is now at hand and is the only hope of the nations and the people. It is of greatest importance to the peopl</span><span class="font7">e </span><span class="font9">that they know about it, but the newspapers refuse to publish anything about the kingdom for fear of shocking the r</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">ligious susceptibilities of the Roman Catholic Hierarehy and their allies. Such publication would interfere ,vith the religious racket. For centuries hoth Christians and religionists have prayed as J</span><span class="font7">esHS </span><span class="font9">t au ght</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font9">for the eorning of God’s kingdom on earth, but only the Christians have desired that kingdom. Religionists have </span><span class="font7">an </span><span class="font9">ambitious desire to rule the world in the place and stead of God and Christ. Religion is therefore </span><span class="font7">1:1 </span><span class="font9">snare and a racket, and the Lord’s kingdom, will do away with religion and aU fraudulent schemes. The religio-political combine is against the kingdo</span><span class="font7">m </span><span class="font9">of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is the business of Jehovah’s witnesses to make known to the people God’s kingdom under Christ as their only hope. Because they do so those Christians are opposed and </span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">ruelly persecuted by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">It has </span><span class="font8">pleased </span><span class="font9">God to make prophetic dramas by which he reveals to those who love him his means of carrying out his pm'pose. Before the divine mandate to fill the earth could be cllTl'ied out all the wicked must be removed tmd a righteous overlord installed in office.

<p><span class="font9">The father of N ouli was named Lamech, which name means </span><span class="font8">&quot;powerful&quot;, </span><span class="font9">and the part played by Lamech in the drama of the flood pictured Jehovah, the Almighty </span><span class="font8">God, </span><span class="font9">whose power is without limitation and who is the :B'ather of ;Je8118 CIH'ist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Noah played the part representing Christ Jesus. After Noah's birth his father uttered a prophecy which doubtless was spoken at the direction of Jehovah and is a part of the prophetic drama. The prophecy is contained in this text: &quot;And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son; and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, be</span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">a</span><span class="font7">us</span><span class="font9">e of the ground which 'the Lord hath cursed.&quot;—Genesis 5:28</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font9">29</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The name N oali means &quot;rest&quot; or </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;</span><span class="font9">comfort</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;, </span><span class="font9">and in this he foreshadowed Christ Jesus, the beloved Son of God, who is the comfort and rest of Jeho</span><span class="font7">va</span><span class="font9">h. In ha</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font7">m</span><span class="font9">ony with this it is written that, when Noah left the ark at the conclusion of the flood, he built an altar unto God and offered sacrifices, &quot;and the Lord smelled a sweet savour: <span class="font9">and the Lord said in his hearti I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake.&quot;’—8: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The earth was fUleri with viole</span><span class="font7">nc</span><span class="font9">e, and God sent Noah to give warning of the impending deluge by whieh he would destroy all flesh </span><span class="font7">01' </span><span class="font9">human creatures on the earth except those who found safety in the ark. '1'he flood came, with this result: The nephilim of Satan's invisible organization were removed from th</span><span class="font7">e </span><span class="font9">earth ; the disobedient angels, &quot;the sons of God&quot; who had materialized and formed unions with human women and produced &quot;mighty men</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;, </span><span class="font9">were </span><span class="font7">re</span><span class="font9">moved by being imprisoned. and the offspring of that improper union </span><span class="font7">were d</span><span class="font9">est</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">o-y</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">d</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font9">The only survivors were Noah and the members of his household</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font9">eight in all—Genesis 6:1-20, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Revised Version. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">PURPOSE Of THE FLOOD</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Devil had set himself up as equal to Jeho-vah. He evolved schemes to repr</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font9">ach </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">,J</span><span class="font9"> ehovah</span><span class="font7">;</span><span class="font9">s </span><span class="font7">name. </span><span class="font9">He knew that Jehovah h</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">d commanded Adam to multiply and fill the earth. The Devil decided to prevent that from being done. He set about to debauch the human race and to fill the earth with a wicked people whom God would have to destroy. The Devil's scheme appeared to be making real progress. If he succ</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">eded</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font9">the Devil concluded, he would prove his own supremacy and .Jehovah's inferiority. The result of the flood in d</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">st</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">oying all except Noah's family would prevent Satan from carrying out his purpose and would be </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">vindication of Jehovah's name. It therefore appears that the primary purpose of the flood was the </span><span class="font7">v</span><span class="font9">i</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">dication </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font9"> God's name and word</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font9">and closely connected therew’ith were matters concerning the human race relating to the filling of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Becanse of Noah's faith and obedience he was righteous in the s</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font9">gh</span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font9">of God. He is </span><span class="font7">m</span><span class="font9">entio</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">ed in the Scriptures as &quot;a p</span><span class="font7">r</span><span class="font9">eacher of righteousness&quot;. (2 Peter 2: 5) God commanded Noah to build an ark</span><span class="font7">, </span><span class="font9">which he did, and which ark was a picture of God's organization under Christ as the Head thereof, which organization includes the members of the body of Christ. The family of Noah received and gave heed to the warning and believed on God, and because of their faith and obedience they were counted righteous, taken into the ark, and carried over the flood and saved. God declares that his purpose in having the ark built was to keep alive'the righteous ones of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The command of Jehovah given to Adam to &quot;multiply and fill the earth&quot; could be </span><span class="font9">carried out only by righteous creatures, and that must be done after all the wicked are removed from the earth. The flood and the devastation it wrought, therefore, was a picture of Armageddon, the great day of God Almighty, and the destructive work it will do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PLAYERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The players in that prophetic drama were, to , wit, Lamech, who pictured Jehovah God ; Noah, who pictured Christ Jesus and the members of his body ; and the ark, which pictured the organization Zion, of which Christ Jesus is the Head and Builder at God's command ; the deluge picturing Armageddon. 'N e have the positive statement of the Scriptures that such drama was performed and recorded long ago for the comfort and hope of God's people on the earth at the end of the lJlorld, where we now are. (Romans 15: 4) With confidence we may exped to receive from the Lord an understanding of that prophetic drama, and the understanding of it will increase our zeal &quot;'and hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The members of Noah's family were carried over the flood, finding safety in the ark; and the question is, Whom do they picture or represent in the prophetic drama'1 The Scriptural proof is that they pictured the &quot;other sheep&quot; of the Lord (John 10: 16), that is, those whom we now caD &quot;.J onadabs&quot; and who wil form the &quot;great multitude&quot;<sup>7</sup>.—2 Kings 10: 15-23; Revelation 7: 9-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">N oah's three sons were born after Noah was 500 years old, and a short time before the flood. Likewise a short time before  Armageddon Christ Jesus, the antitypical Noah, begins the gathering unto himself of his &quot;other sheep”, who form the &quot;great multitude&quot;. A. long period of time elapsed from the birth of Noah until the birth of his three sons. Likewise a long IWl'God of time elapsed from the bixth of ,T esus until the bringing forth of the Jonadabs, his &quot;other sheep&quot; </span><span class="font2">o </span><span class="font9">Now the kingdom is here and the &lt;Tona-dabs are coming forth and appreciating the fact that it is their great privilege to learn about. and fully support the kingdOIl1 of God under Christ as the only means of salvation and vindication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">DELAY '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It has been argued that God delayed the setting tip of his Idngdom for six thousand years in order to permit </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">sufficient number of persons to be born and then die, so that at the resurrection there would be. enough to fill the earth. That argument is not supported by reason </span><span class="font7">nor </span><span class="font9">by any scriptures. There has been no delay, but God has permitted the Devil this period of time in order to have Iun opportunity to make good his challenge before the destruction of his </span><span class="font7">01'-</span><span class="font9">ganization, and in that period of time God has taken out &quot;a people for his name&quot;, which people must be witnesses of .Jehovah to bear testimony in the earth in fulfillment of God'1; prophetic utterance to the Devil recorded at Exodus 9: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SELECTING THE GREAT MULTITUDE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The fiTst .essentiaI for one to be gathered unto the Lord is to hear the message of truth. That person then must exercise faith in God as the source of life, and in Christ Jesus as his Redeemer, whose precious blood bought the human race, and that Christ is the Administrator of Jehovah to give life. (Romans 10: 9-15) The Lord .Jesus came to the temple of Jehovah in 1918, gathered unto himself the faithful consecrated ones, judged and approved them, brought them into the temple, and instructed them, and then sent them forth to declare his message in order that his &quot;other sheep&quot; might be permitted to hear and flee to him for refuge. Thereafter the &quot;other sheep&quot; began to hear, but it was not un-ti1 1935 that the Lord disclosed to his people that his &quot;other sheep&quot; constitute an earthly class that shall live on the earth forever. What further steps must the &quot;other sheep&quot; take in order to receive God's approval and protection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All .persons who receive the benefit of thH ransom sacl'ificf! must make a consecration Lv agreeing to do the will of God, and must openl</span><span class="font7">;</span><span class="font9">, confess this agreement to others. This must be done by the Jonadabs, and hence they must join with the remnant io become witnesses for the Lord. r:L'hey must find protection in God's organization, which shows that they must be immersed, baptized or hidden in that organization. The ark, which Noah built at God's command, pictured God's organization, and those who entered the ark and found refuge there from the deluge were thus hidden, and that was a picture of baptism, </span><span class="font7">as </span><span class="font9">stated by the apostl</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font5">, </span><span class="font9">to wit, &quot;The ark ... wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by watf^r. 'The like figure whereunto, even baptism, doth also now save us,&quot; (1 Peter 3: 20, 21) In fulfillment of that part of the picture Christ Jesus has built God's capital organization, unto or under which the ,J onadabs must be immersed, baptized or submerged out of sight and completely separated and hidden from Satan's organization. Under the protection of the Lord's organization they may be safely carried over Armageddon. (Zephaniah 2: 1-4) Therefore the &quot;great multitude&quot; must find refuge and protection in the anti-typieal ark, being there hidden from the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A like picture was made when the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, and concerning which it is written : &quot;For I wi</span><span class="font7">s</span><span class="font9">h you not to be ignorant, brethren, that our fathers &quot;vere aU under the cloud, and all passed through the sea ; and that all were immerse(l into Moses hI the cloud and in the Sea; and that all ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink ; for they drank [water] from a spiritual Roek which followed them ; (but the Hoek was the Anoint-ed).&quot;-l Corinthians 10: lA, D'ia,glott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">V:Phe Israelites were thus &quot;baptized unto Moses&quot;, Those in the ark were baptized unto Noah. Both Noah and Moses pictured Ch</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font9">ist ,JeS1J,S and his organization, therefore shmving Hlat all the ,lonadahs must come under the protection of the organization of which Chdst is the Chief. That is t11(Oi1' antitypical &quot;city of refuge&quot; (Numbm's 35: 6-:32), and there they must remain until the end of Armageddon. Being carried over Armageddon will prove that God counts the</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">m </span><span class="font9">righteous. The ohedient Israelites found protection and safety from the waters of the J:ted Sea; those in the ark found protection and safety, while all others suif'C)I'ed destruction ; and both of those pietures foretold Armageddon, at which time those under Christ will find protection and safety, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">vv</span><span class="font9">hile all the world will suffer destruction in the :fiery tribulation such as never before was k</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">n</span><span class="font9">own</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font9">John the Baptist must have referred to that baptism unto Noah and unto Moses as typical of the baptisrn unto Christ when he said: &quot;He [Christ] shall baptize you with the holy [spll'itJ and with fire.&quot; (Matthew 3: 11, 12) The &quot;nre&quot; manifestly refei-s to Armageddon, from the destructive effects 'of which thos</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">e </span><span class="font9">under Christ and in Christ will he protected. This is further proof that universal protection and &quot;universal salvation&quot; find absolutely no support in the Scriptures, but are a triek of the Devil to turn the minds of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">men </span><span class="font9">away from Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who as .J on</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a</span><span class="font9">dabs flee to Christ and there find protection must continue to seek </span><span class="font6">righteousness and meekness as the Lord eom-mands. (Zephaniah </span><span class="font9">2: </span><span class="font6">1-3) They must study to know God's will and must be diligent to obey his commandments. They must be faithful ; they must be entirely devoted to God's kingdom, and must keep themselves separate from the world, refusing to participate </span><span class="font9">in </span><span class="font6">any worldly schemes. </span><span class="font9">Thus </span><span class="font6">doing they have God's promise to be carried over Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MANDATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that the divine mandate to &quot;multiply and fill the earth&quot; was given to righteous Adam before he sinned is conclusive proof that the mandate can be carried out </span><span class="font9">only </span><span class="font6">by righteous human creatures who live and bring forth children in righteousness and under righteous eon-</span><span class="font9">ditions. Who, </span><span class="font6">then, </span><span class="font9">can fulfill that mandate ? </span><span class="font6">Not the remnant (Romans 11 : </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">;</span><span class="font6">)), of course, because they aTe spiritual and their abiding place is in heaven. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great mass of the people that have lived since 'the flood have been wicked. Today the earth is filled with a wicked class similar to that </span><span class="font9">which </span><span class="font6">filled the earth prior to the flood. The most ,Nicked and blasphemous or all those who now encumber the earth are the religious leaders, and particularly those who constitute </span><span class="font9">the </span><span class="font6">Roman Catholic Hierarchy of Authority, who blasphemously claim that which belongs only to God, falsely claim that they are representatives of the &lt;Lord, bring great reproach upon God's name, </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font6">persecute Jehovah's witnesses </span><span class="font9">and</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">the Jolladabs, and which religious organization is the chief instrument of the Devil on earth. Certainly none of such will ever have anything </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font9">do &quot;vith carrying out the divine mandate. l'here is no reason, and certainly there is </span><span class="font7">no </span><span class="font9">Scriptural proof, that God will ever raise such out of death, nor any others who have been willfully wicked and who have spurned and opposed Jehovah's organization. It is true that the Scriptures say 'there shall be a resurrection of the just and the unjust', but there is </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">wide distinction between those who are unjust by reason of inheritance, being born such, and those who are willfully wicked and who oppose God's kingdom. Certainly those who now hear of and refuse to believe on Clu'ist as the Redeemer and as the world's rightful Ruler shall continue to abide under the condemnation of death, as plainly stated at John 3: 36. The purpose of the deluge was to clear the earth of the wicked ; and likewise the very purpose of Armageddon is to clear the earth of the present-day wicked ones. Why should such wicked ones ever be awakened out of death and jufest the ground and continue to reproach God's holy name ? There is </span><span class="font7">no </span><span class="font9">reason to conclude that God will give them a &quot;second chance&quot;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But regardless of who shall be awakened out of death, none of the world in the general resurrection win come forth as ,righteous men and women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font9">the end of the flood Noah and his family were the only human creatures living. God</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">counted such eight persons righteous because of their faith and obedience unto him. 'I'hey therefore pictured the class of persons that God will count righteous at the end of Armageddoll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">. RESTATED</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">'When Noah left the ark at tll(' end of the flood he offered sacrifices U1lto the Lord, and, as it is written, &quot;the Lord smelled a sweet savour </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">[(margin)</span><span class="font9"> of restl&quot; (Oenosis R: 21) 'Phat seems clearly to refer to the comfoi-t and rest that will come when Armageddon bas ended and I he earth is completely cleaned out of all the wicked. The saerifices offered by Noah were al </span><span class="font7">so a </span><span class="font9">part ol‘ I lii’ prophetie drama showing that after J\ rmaged-don all the persons on earth will be devoted </span><span class="font7">jo </span><span class="font9">Jehovah. It was at the time Noah offered slid) sacrifices that God restated his mandate in these words: &quot;And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.&quot; ( Genesis </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">9:1)</span><span class="font9"> Sneh words also must be a part of tIle prophetie drama foretelling how God will carry out his purpose to fill the earth with righteous people following Armageddon. The restatement of the mandate was to righteous men, showing agaiIl that only righteous human creatures can fulfill that mandate. Since the great multitude will be the only ones that shall survive A.rmageddoll, and they being counted righteous in God's sight because of their faith alid obedience, it follows that God will use those human creatures to carry out his mandate to fill the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Only eight persons survived the flood, and now, after a few brief centuries, the earth is filled with human creatures numbering many millions and almost all of whom are wicked by reason of the Dp,vil's influence. If only a few millions survive Armageddon, what may those few milliollfj do undpl' the direction of Christ .J </span><span class="font7">esns </span><span class="font9">during the period of the thousand-year reign ? It is absolutely certain that God's mandate to 6U the earth mnst be carried out, because he hllS given his 'wOI'd, and his word shuH not l'etuI'n unto him void. It therefore follows that it will he fulfilled \vithin the thousand-year period with the ereatnres appoiuted to that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">MARRY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If this conclusion is Scripturally eorrect, then it v{ould mean that those men and women forming the &quot;great multitude&quot; will many and bring forth children in righteousness and unto life, rhere </span><span class="font7">are </span><span class="font9">now on earth J onadabs devoted to the Lord and who doubtless will prove faithful. Would it be Scripturally proper for them to now marry and to begin to rear children ? No, is the answer, which is supported by the Scriptures. Referring to the prophetic picture: Noah's sons and their wives had no children before </span><span class="font7">01' </span><span class="font9">during the flood, and none were born of them until after the flood was dried up, and the record is that it was two years after the flood befoTe children born are mentioned. (Genesis 11: 10, 11) There is.no Scriptural evidence that any children were taken into the ark., but only eight persons were taken therein: &quot;And the Lord said unto Noah, Come thou and. all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.&quot; (Genesis </span><span class="font10">7:</span><span class="font9">1) This is proof that the dass pictured by those taken into the ark will be counted rig&gt;hteous by reason of their faith and obedience, and which is evidenced by their being carried over Armageddon. The Scriptures fully support the conclusion that the filling of the earth is not due to begin before, but after Armageddon. The words of .Jesus further support this conclu:-;ion, to wit: &quot;And ‘woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days !&quot;--Matthew 24 : 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It is the great pri</span><span class="font7">v</span><span class="font9">ilege of the ,Tonadabs to now see th at the kingdom is h er e and that i t is their bounden duty, if they would live, to fully support the kingdom a</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">d do what the Lo</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">r</span><span class="font9">d has commanded them to do, which is to seek right-eOUSliCSS and meekness, and to join forces with the remllant and give t</span><span class="font7">es</span><span class="font9">timon</span><span class="font7">y </span><span class="font9">to the world of and concerning the kingdom of God under Christ.

<p><span class="font9">rrhel'c are J onadabs who are fully devoted to the Lord and his kingdom many of whom have children and may have Il1Ol'e. What must be expected of them &quot;? 'rhe </span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font9">bligatio</span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font9">is laid upon the parents to teach their children the truth of and concerning the kingdom and to thus lead them in right paths that they too may seek righteous-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ness and meekness ; and </span><span class="font9">if </span><span class="font0">the children </span><span class="font9">do </span><span class="font0">so, God's promise of protection also applies </span><span class="font9">to </span><span class="font0">them. </span><span class="font9">C</span><span class="font0">hildren born now are sunounded by the wicked influence of Satan and his organization, and their only proteetion is that they be taught and that they devote themselves to God and his kingdom organization. They must seek right-eOUSIless and meekness by learning </span><span class="font9">and </span><span class="font0">doing the will of God. Therefore the great responsibility upon the </span><span class="font6">J</span><span class="font0">onadab parents now is to properly teach their children and lead them in the right way until they reach the age of individual responsibility, when such children must aet for themselves in serving God. While it is not the obligation of the </span><span class="font9">consecrated </span><span class="font0">to seek out the children of others who are not consecrated and teaeh them, yet if </span><span class="font9">any </span><span class="font0">such children of others </span><span class="font9">eome </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font9">thein seeking </span><span class="font0">the truth they </span><span class="font9">should </span><span class="font0">eount it a great privilege to so instruct those children who </span><span class="font9">do </span><span class="font0">seek the truth.

<p><span class="font9">What should the </span><span class="font0">.Tonadahs </span><span class="font9">do now? </span><span class="font0">They should </span><span class="font9">devote themselves wholly to the kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">interests of Christ, they should see to it </span><span class="font8">that </span><span class="font9">their substance is now used to the glory of God and his kingdom, and therefore should do all within their power to </span><span class="font8">advance </span><span class="font9">the kingdom in</span><span class="font8">terest. As </span><span class="font9">companions of the remnant of </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">body of Christ </span><span class="font7">now </span><span class="font9">on earth the Jonadabs should join with them in actively bearing wit-n</span><span class="font8">e</span><span class="font9">ss to the people, giving them warning and telling the</span><span class="font7">m </span><span class="font9">of the kingdom blessings that will come to those who obey. The faithful from Abel to John looked for the coming or God’s righteous government and sacrificed everything that </span><span class="font8">they might have a </span><span class="font9">place to live thereunder. Now the glorious kingdom is here in full sight alld wiIl soon be in full operation, ami those wlio love God will delight now to do </span><span class="font8">all </span><span class="font9">within their power&quot; to make known to others the blessings of that kingdom. It is the kingdom of God under Christ now pitted against everything of </span><span class="font8">Satan's organi</span><span class="font9">zation, and the .Tonadabs mnst </span><span class="font8">align </span><span class="font9">themselves uncompromisingly on the Lord's side, faithfully serving him </span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">nd his kingdom at all times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">REDEMPTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Children born to the Jonadahs before Armageddon must come under the redemptive provision made through Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font9">The parents being imperfect, such children </span><span class="font7">are </span><span class="font9">born with imperfections and must be taught by the parents and must be obedient to the Lord if they receive life. Children born after Armageddon likewise must helong to Christ J </span><span class="font7">esus, </span><span class="font9">because he has paid the redemptive price for all, including them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He is &quot;The Everlasting I&lt;'ather&quot;, who administers life, and there is no other name wherehy men may live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">OBEDIENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">All who receive life must believe on and obey the Lord. (.John 3: 36) Therefore the children born of the great multitude mnst have faith, and must be faithful and fully obedient to the righteous Lord. The responsibility will then be UPOIl the parents to properly teach their children until the children reach _an age of individual </span><span class="font7">re</span><span class="font9">sponsibility, at which time the offspring must assume the responsibility and </span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font9">b</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">y</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font9">rfhe Scriptures show that each </span><span class="font7">one </span><span class="font9">born will have a fun and fair opportunity under righteous conditions to prove his integrity to the Lord. The Scriptures fully support the conclusion that no babies will die after Armageddon. What could be the purpose of a baby's being born if it should die when it is a mere suckling l The Scriptures </span><span class="font7">on </span><span class="font9">this point now seem to be clear. God, through his prophet, says: &quot;There shall be thenceforward no more a suckling of a few days, or </span><span class="font7">nn </span><span class="font9">elder who filleth not up his days, hut a youth a hundred years old may die, yea a sinner a hundr</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">d years old shall he accursed,&quot;’—Isaiah 65: 20, Rotherham</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This prophecy may now apply to the spiritual class in this manner: The number one hundred is a multiple of ten times ten</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font9">which means earthly completeness. The faithful remnant, having maintained their integrity. may be said to have received everything on the earth they can </span><span class="font7">re</span><span class="font9">ceive, and hence they may know that the enemy canIlot destroy them. If one should willfully become a sinner, he will die accursed, and no one will sorrow for him,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A_s to the childl'en of the gl'eat multitude, God gives the assurance that they shall gl'OW up under conditions of righteousness where nothing shall be permitted to hurt them and that sneli will continue to live until they have full opportunity to prove their integrity. Ten times ten equaling one hundred, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font9">being symbolic of earthly completeness in every way, must mean that </span><span class="font7">no </span><span class="font9">baby shall die as a babe, and not at all until it tirst has full opportunity as all individual to prove its integrity. If, however, after h</span><span class="font7">a</span><span class="font9">ving full opportunity that offspring willfully Iw('omes a sinner he shall die accursed_ '1'hat does not mean that he would be limited to one hundred years, but he must have full earthly opportunity, even if five hundred or the entire thousand years are required to prove his full devotion to the L</span><span class="font7">o</span><span class="font9">rd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">N </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">one will </span><span class="font7">sorrow </span><span class="font9">because of the death of the accursed ones, because all who live will be righteous and rejoice in the Lord's righteous judgment. Hence the prophecy says : &quot;rrhere-fore will I exult in .Jerusalem [God's organization], and joy in my people, and there shall be heard in her no more the sound of weeping or the sound of a cry.&quot; (Isaiah 65 : 19, Rothaharn) God has given a specific commandment, at Ezekiel 24- : 16, 17, that </span><span class="font7">110 </span><span class="font9">OIle of the rigJJtpous</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">shall sorrow or weep because of the death of the willful1y wicked. Such is strong corroborative proof that no babies will die as such, and therefore the offspring's death will bring no sorrow to the parents. Such babies will be born to life and must live until they have reached the age of individual responsihility. 'This will now be of great comfort and encouragement to those who will form the great multitude, because they can look forward to the fact that they shall be privileged to brillg forth ehildren in righteousness and never thereafter have any sorrow by reason of such children. Furthermore says Jehovah : &quot;For behold me ! creating new heavens and a new earth, and the former sha.H not be mentioned, neither shall they come up on the heart </span><span class="font2">... </span><span class="font9">creating J</span><span class="font7">e</span><span class="font9">ru</span><span class="font7">sa</span><span class="font9">l</span><span class="font7">em </span><span class="font9">an exultation, and her people a joy.&quot; (Isaiah 65: 17, 18, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Rother</span><span class="font9">. ham) 'l'he apostle Peter wrote: &quot;Nevertheless we. according to his promise, look for new heavens and </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; (2 Peter 3: 13) The </span><span class="font7">&quot;new </span><span class="font9">heavens&quot; consists of Christ Jesus and his royal house, and is already created and bl1ilded up to </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font9"> joy . of Jehovah. (Psalm 102: 16) The faithful princ</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">es (Psalm 45 : 16), the great multitude and their children'. wiU constitute the &quot;ne1N earth&quot; wherein righteousness shall dwell and where there shall be continuous joy. In accord with this it is written: &quot;And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and Hley shaH he his people, and God himself shall</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">be with them, and be their God, And U'nd shall wipe away all tears from tlipir eye;;.” (Revelation 21: 3, -1) That condition will ohlaiii </span><span class="font7">at the </span><span class="font9">beginning of the thousand years instead </span><span class="font7">of </span><span class="font9">wailing; until the end thereof. Therefore </span><span class="font7">says </span><span class="font9">the prophet concerning G-od's new earth: “There shall he heard in her no more the sound of weeping </span><span class="font7">oi’ </span><span class="font9">the sonwI of a cry.&quot; Surely these truths are </span><span class="font7">now a great:,! </span><span class="font9">immlus to the .Tonadabs to bend every effort! to find protection nud safety in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">RESURRECTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Those who have died aud who wili be resurrected must have a fnll and fair opportunity lo live, but they will have nothing to do with ca rry ing out of the divine mandate and filling the earth,. They will be awakened imperfect ami must be brought to righteousness and granted life after fun. obedience. There is no reason why that should require a thousand years, and there is no Scriptural evidence that the general resurrection will be accomplished during the thousandyear reign, but, un the contrary, it is written (Revelation 20 : 5) : &quot;But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years wen: finjshed.&quot; \Vhile thpre is a dispute about this authenticity of this text, the weight of authority is in favor of its authenticity. God has preserved it in the Bible. IteslUrectiOYl meaning full standing to life, therefore at the general resnrrection the divine mandate will have been fully carried out; paradise will then ’have been restored; then</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">will come forth the thief aecording to the promise of Jesus ; also all the dead in their graves, that is, all in the memory of God, shall come forth, but not the wicked </span><span class="font7">ones. </span><span class="font9">Surely Judas Iscariot, and those of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, and the other &quot;goats&quot;’, will never Iw awakened out of' death. The final adverse; judgment against them is entered by Christ .Jesus, who says that they go away into everlasting cutting off. (Matthew 25 : 33,41-46) Procure The Watchtower,</span><span class="font9"> which gives consideration </span><span class="font7">to </span><span class="font9">the texts relating to this matter, study the same carefully and you will have every reason to rejoice ; and. continuing faithful, your joy shall never end. Every person who loves the Lord should be </span><span class="font7">a regular reader of The Watchtowe1'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">SUMMARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Specific and great truths now revealed must be kept in mind by those who have consecrated themselves to do God's will. Amongst such truths are these : .Jehovah has commanded </span><span class="font8">t </span><span class="font9">ha </span><span class="font7">t </span><span class="font9">the earth shall be filled with a righteous people. That shall be done. No unrighteous human can have any part in fulfilling that divine mandate. Adam was righteous when he received the mandate, but he became unrighteous and lost all. The eommandment reaffirmed to righteous Noah and his sons </span><span class="font7">\vas a </span><span class="font9">prophetie drama, which drama, must become </span><span class="font7">a </span><span class="font9">reality henceforth. The Flood was for the purpose of cleansing the earth of wickedness then existing, and it was a type, the fulfillment of whieh win be th(' hattle of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Armageddon and whi</span><span class="font7">c</span><span class="font9">h </span><span class="font8">will </span><span class="font9">clean the earth </span><span class="font8">of </span><span class="font9">all wickedness.</span></p>

It is </span><span class="font8">bitterly </span><span class="font7">resisted by the religionists, the chief agents of the Devil on earth. It will be finished according to God's will.

'rhat means that the great </span><span class="font10">religious </span><span class="font9">institution, t</span><span class="font8">h</span><span class="font9">e Hierarchy, is certain to lose, and will perish for ever.

<p><span class="font9">spiracy between the Papacy and the Hitler totalitarian government of Germany:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;There is now one country on ear</span><span class="font7">t</span><span class="font9">h where the so-called 'Earnest Bible Students' [.Jeho-vah's witnesses] are forbid.den. That is Germany! The dissolution of the sect which, at that time, had found a strong foothold in Germany, did not come to pass under Briining [chancellor of </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font9">German Reich before Hitler], although the Catholic Church in Bru</span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">i </span><span class="font7">n</span><span class="font9">g's, time urged to have this done. However, the 'Most </span><span class="font8">Catholic Chancellor' </span><span class="font9">Bruning </span><span class="font8">answered </span><span class="font9">that he had </span><span class="font7">no </span><span class="font9">law which authorized him to dissolve the sect </span><span class="font8">of the </span><span class="font9">'Earnest Bible Students'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;When Adolph H itl er had come to power’ and the German episcopate repeated their request, Hitler said: 'These so-called &quot;'Earnest Bible Students&quot; are trouble-makers; they disturb the harmonious life amongst the Germans; I </span><span class="font7">consider them quacks; I do not tolerate that the German Catholics be besmirched in such a manner by this American &quot;Judge” Rutherford; I dissolve the &quot;Earnest Bible Students&quot; in Germany ; their property I dedicate to the people's welfare; I will have all their literature confiscated.' Bravo!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;However, the American episcopate, </span><span class="font7">even </span><span class="font9">Cardinal Mundelein, is not </span><span class="font8">able </span><span class="font9">to have Ruther</span><span class="font8">ford’s books, </span><span class="font9">in which the Catholic Church is slandered, to be taken away from the bookmarket in the United States t&quot;</span></p>
