<h2><a name="bookmark1"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark2"></a>EARLY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font14">The 19th century was marked by great religious ferment as many students of the Bible were expecting a time of change and were looking forward to the second coming that Christ Jesus had promised. Among those who had a strong hope and interest in the fulfillment of prophecy was a group of people in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, organized for serious Bible study by Charles Taze Russell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">These Bible students strongly felt that there was a need for reexamination of the creeds and practices of major religious denominations. It was their view that fundamental Christian principles had become overshadowed by denominational interests. They began a program of Bible research to clarify these issues. This group described themselves as the International Bible Students Association.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As their understanding of the Scriptures progressed, the Association adopted the practice of disseminating their views through religious tracts, magazines, and books, in addition to meetings and sermons. Public</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">evangelism also became part of their practice. In this they sought to follow the customs of the early Christian Church. They also advocated a further feature of primitive Christianity—the ministry of all believers; that there should not be a clergy/laity distinction within the Christian Church but that all members should be ministers, evangelists, and preachers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">In 1879 they began to publish, under the editorship of C. T. Russell, the magazine </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Zion's Watch Tower</span><span class="font14"> (now known as </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower).

<p><span class="font14">Meetings were held regularly by these Bible Students. They were not content to meet just once a week like many of Christendom’s churchgoers. In addition to holding public services on Sundays, they met in smaller groups in homes at other times during the week. In most meetings all in attendance shared in the discussion. This practice continues down to the present time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">By the mid 1880’s, the little congregation in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, had begun to establish its activities in different parts of the United States, Canada, and England. Its basic principles were strict adherence to the Bible for authority and distribution of printed Scriptural material by volunteer workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During this same period, Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society was formed as a unincorporated association to expand the preaching activity. It was incorporated in 1884 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">The Bible Students, now known as Jehovah’s Witnesses, first began to preach in Canada in 1880. From earnest friends and relatives in the United States, some Canadians received literature and a heartening message about a peaceful new system of things under God’s Kingdom in the hands of the glorified Jesus Christ. (Acts 3:19-21; Revelation 21:1-5) One of these thought-provoking publications, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Food for Thinking Christians,</span><span class="font14"> published in 1881 found ready acceptance in Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By 1891 the number of Bible Students in the Toronto area was sufficient to hold the first one-day convention. Charles Taze Russell, the first president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, was the featured speaker. There were more than 700 present for this event. As time progressed, these interested Bible students formed congregations located in every province of Canada.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I. B. S.A. International Convention held at the CNE Coliseum, Toronto, July 18-26, 1927, with talks given by Judge Rutherford</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Some of these Canadians played a major role in the early days. One prominent figure was Alexander Hugh Macmillan of Nova Scotia. He was baptized in 1900 and worked closely with C. T. Russell in helping to provide direction to the growing organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In 1916, Charles Taze Russell died while on a lecture tour through the southwestern United States. He was succeeded by J. F. Rutherford, a lawyer and former judge from the State of Missouri. He had been brought into the Watch Tower headquarters in New York as a legal adviser in 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By 1925 the number of congregations of the International Bible Students Association in Canada had grown to 70. Associated with these congregations were 1,000 Kingdom publishers, along with 71 full-time ministers. A branch office of the Watch Tower Society was first established in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1918. A notice of this branch office opening was chronicled in the January 1, 1918, edition of </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower.</span><span class="font14"> In 1920 the office was moved from Winnipeg to Toronto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In order to better serve the Canadian field and give permanence to the work of the Association, it was decided in 1925 to form a Canadian corporation, adopting the name International Bible Students Association of Canada.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This Canadian corporation was to serve as an agent and trustee for the parent corporation, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Frank Wainwright (on left), in front of the first Toronto branch office in 1920 on 270 Dundas Street West</span></p><img src="1993_ibsa-ca_E_files/1993_ibsa-ca_E-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:249pt;height:184pt;">

<p><span class="font14">of Pennsylvania. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watch Tower</span><span class="font14"> of December 15, 1914, explained the policy: “For the sake of our many new readers we explain that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, as the parent organization, represents all the activities in Christian work with which THE WATCH TOWER and its Editor are associated. All the work done through the International Bible Students Association and Peoples Pulpit Association, directly and indirectly, is the work of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. . . . Thus it comes that we use sometimes the one name and sometimes the other in various parts of our work—yet they all in the end mean the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Pursuant to the above policy, J. F. Rutherford and Frank Wainwright of Toronto (who remained a member of the I.B.S.A. until his death in December 1989), being two of the applicants, obtained a charter on the 15th day of December 1925. The Letters Patent of the I.B.S.A. of Canada stated its purpose: “To promote Christian knowledge by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">In July 1927 the president of the Watch Tower Society, J. F. Rutherford, was the main speaker at a convention of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">International Bible Students Association of Canada at the Coliseum on the Canadian National Exhibition Grounds. The Mayor of Toronto, Thomas Foster, gave an address of welcome to the delegates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Toronto convention was a landmark event. According to Bible prophecy, it</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Revelation 9:13-21. The main lecture by J. F. Rutherford, entitled “Freedom for the Peoples,” called upon all sincere Christians to give heart allegiance to Jehovah God and to his King.—</span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation—Its Grand Climax At Hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">pp. 149, 173. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Shortly afterward, in 1931, the organization adopted the name Jehovah’s Witnesses, a Biblical expression which signified the specific evangelical objectives of the Church. Thereafter, the name International Bible Students Association became less and less used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As time progressed, the religious organization became identified in the public mind with its chief magazine, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font14"> Some even called the religious association “The Watch Tower People.” Accordingly, the name Watch Tower Bible and Tract</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font14">The above growth has come despite strong opposition from majoritarian factions within Canada, both religious and political. In order to defend the liberty of the association’s members to practice their faith, it has been necessary to invoke the aid of the courts to prevent overzealous officials from interfering with freedom of religious expression. Jesus Christ himself warned that such opposition was to be expected by his faithful ones: “They will deliver you up to local courts, . . . you will be haled before governors and kings for my sake, for a witness to them and the nations.” (Matthew 10:17, 18)</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font14">attention the inadequacy of legal protection for civil liberties. It led the Canadian government to provide first a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Bill of Rights</span><span class="font14"> in 1960 and later a </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Charter of Rights</span><span class="font14"> embedded in the Constitution itself in 1982.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font14">Canadian legal scholars have commented on the fine contribution that Jehovah’s Witnesses have made to law and liberty for all the people of Canada. Frank Scott, former Dean </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font14"> Law School of McGill University in Montreal, said regarding these cases: “We should be grateful that we have in this country some victims of state oppression standing up for their rights.

R. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Civil Liberties and Canadian Federalism</span><span class="font14"> (University of Toronto Press, 1959) p. 45.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font14">Another scholar, Professor William Kaplan of the University of Ottawa Law Faculty observed:</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">“The courage of Jehovah’s Witnesses who endured repression and fought for what they believed is a testament to the human spirit. . . . The Jehovah’s Witnesses taught the state, and the Canadian people, what the practical content of legal protection for dissenting groups should be. . . . post-war persecution of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the province of Quebec ... led to a series of cases that . . . made their way to the Supreme Court of Canada. . . . they constitute the bedrock of civil-liberties jurisprudence in Canada today.”—Kaplan, W. </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">State and Salvation—The Jehovah’s Witnesses and Their Fight for Civil Rights</span><span class="font14"> (University of Toronto Press: Toronto, 1989).</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Parallel to these legal developments has been the rapid increase of our worldwide Bible-teaching program.

<p><span class="font14">All this activity has created a need to streamline our internal and corporate organization. It is also most appropriate that we continue using the name Watch Tower, which highlights the unique position of Jehovah’s Witnesses during this period of history. As foretold by the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel in chapter 33, verse 7: “Now as regards you, O son of man, a watchman is what I have made you to the house of Israel, and at my mouth you must hear the word and give them warning from me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There is no longer any practical purpose to be served in maintaining the International Bible Students Association </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font14"> Canada as an agent and trustee. Accordingly, the I.B.S.A., notwithstanding its past useful service, can now be dissolved.
