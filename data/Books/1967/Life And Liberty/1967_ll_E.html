<p><span class="font1">Would you like to know how . . . and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You were not at home when I called to tell you about it so I've left this note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Please look inside.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Mio,</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">I'm sorry I couldn't talk to you in person because what I wanted to tell you could well affect your entire future. That's why I'm leaving this note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First, let me ask you this: Isn't life, and the liberty to pursue its pleasures, your most prized possession? How many people do you know who have found only a token of happiness, who really long for contentment and peace of mind? Hasn’t that been so since the beginning of man's imperfect human experience? Yet we seem farther away from it than ever. In fact. I'm sure you'll agree that our own grandparents did not suffer the frustrations that we experience every day. But, you know, our grandparents did something that few families do today. They read the Bible regularly. Do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is a growing tendency to discredit the Bible, to set it aside as of no practical value today. In fact, half the world has thrown the Bible away completely, and it's overrun with communism. But in this other half, the so-called &quot;free world,&quot; how many people do you know who really believe the Bible, who solve their problems by heeding its counsel and by following its principles, who are willing to live by its standards? No, the failure is not with the Bible. The failure is the world's—it has failed to heed our Creator's instructions in his Word as to how we should conduct ourselves and conduct our affairs in relation to our fellowmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our relationships to God and to this world and to one another are all important. And they are all interrelated, yet they can conflict one with another. How can we know what is right to do and how can we find the contentment and peace of mind that come only with doing what is right and pleasing to God? This little note cannot possibly say all that you might need to satisfy you completely. So I would like to recommend a book that has really helped me to understand these things from the Bible. It is called “Life Everlasting —in Freedom of the Sons of God.&quot; Let me tell you about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Life Everlasting—in Freedom of the Sons of God</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">• A Bible-study aid designed to strengthen your faith and hope in a truly &quot;free world.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• Over twenty versions and editions of the Bible are used for a broader view of the points discussed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">* Over four thousand verses of the Bible are cited or quoted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• Besides the Bible, over forty-five other publications are cited or quoted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• Where the meaning might be affected the original Hebrew and Greek words of the Bible are given and explained.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">* Questions are listed at the bottom of each page to enable you to use the book as a fine guide for study of the Bible as a textbook, either for your own benefit or as a source of regular study with your family.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• This book helps you to know what our relationship is to God, how mankind came into enslavement to transgressions and death, how and when liberation is to come, what this world will be like when that day of liberation is here.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• Our relationship to others is also clearly drawn, what Bible principles are involved in a happy marriage and the places both men and women occupy in God's arrangement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• The important relationship of men and nations is also considered, what Jesus meant when he said the Christian is no part of this world, what his apostle, Paul, meant when he encouraged Christians to present their bodies to God, how Bible principles affect our choice of employment, political activities in the community and conflicts between nations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• Within just two months of the book's release, 1 Vi million copies were out.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1">If you really value life and the happiness of your family you will begin now to make a serious study of the Bible. Never in man’s history has the need been more acute and never before has the reward been so great. I know some people try to discount this by saying we have had difficult times before and other generations have thought theirs was the worst too. Perhaps they have, but when has mon ever had within his grasp before the power and the weapons to destroy himself and his entire civilization? How far must we go before we have reached the 'end of the world'?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But to know what these times mean to you and what your part in our future will be, you must study the Bible. We will be very glad to assist you without any cost or obligation to you. Last year over 800,000 of such free weekly Bible studies were conducted around the world by Jehovah's witnesses. We will study with your family or with you alone if you prefer. Simply indicate your desire in the space below and send it to us. But do it now. It really is later than you thinkl</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sincerely yours,</span></p>
