<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Basic Teachings of the Bible</span></h2>
<p><span class="font28">J</span><span class="font25">EHOVAH GOD has lovingly provided his written Word the Bible to reveal himself to mankind. In it he tells us of the things that he has done, his purposes for the future and what we must do to walk in harmony with his will. If you are to be one of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses, these are things that you should know so that you can properly represent God before your f showmen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">The Bible plainly states that God’s will is for people to “come to an accurate knowledge of truth?’ (J. Tim, 2:4) Such knowledge is necessary in order to walk in a way that pleases Jehovah. That is why the apostle Paul, who was deeply interested in the spiritual welfare of other people, wrote on one occasion: “We &gt;&nbsp;♦ * have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him/* (Col. 1:9, 10) Are you equipped with such accurate knowledge?</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">To teach others about God and to walk worthily of Jehovah yourself, you need to be equipped with knowledge. That is why we strongly recommend that anyone who plans to get baptized come to an accurate knowledge of at least the basic teachings of the Bible first. This is in harmony with Jesus’ instructions to make disciples of people and then to baptize them. (Matt. 28:19) A disciple is one who learns and accepts the teachings of another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Have you learned and accepted the fundamental teachings set out in the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">We believe that you will be greatly aided to do SO if you read the books “Tftingra in Wftw/i- </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">It Is Impossible for God to L4e’<sup>&gt;</sup></span><span class="font23"> and </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">.Life Everlasting— in Freedom of the Sons of God</span><span class="font23"> (or, if they are not available in your language, other recent publications of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society that cover similar material). In this way you will find out what the Bible teaches, what Jehovah’s Christian witnesses advocate and the responsibilities that you are accepting when you get baptized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Before each assembly of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses, at which arrangements are made for immersion of those who qualify, your congregation overseer will check to ascertain whether there are any associated with the congregation who are planning to get baptized. If there arc, he will ask them if they have read the publications mentioned in the preceding paragraph. If they have not yet done so, he will urge them to complete that reading before they are baptized. He will also arrange to have a series of meetings with these candidates for immersion to review the information that follows under this heading &quot;Basic Teachings of the Bible.” This will help them to be sure that they really understand these important matters and it will assure the congregation that those who get baptized really know what is involved in being one of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses and that they Scrip! urally qualify for immersion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Baptism is an important step in your life, and not one to be taken lightly. If you plan to be immersed <sub>f</sub> you should arrange your personal affairs so that you do not miss any of these preliminary meetings for baptismal candidates. In preparation, it would be wise to review the questions on the following pages and read the material that is provided in answer. Also, look up any scriptures that are cited but not quoted. Do ’not try to memorize answers. The important thing is to be sure that you understand each point, that you believe it and that you are able to express it clearly. Analyze how each thought affects your own life. Keep in mind that the reason for learning these truths well is so that you can “walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The material outlined on pages 7 to 40 will be divided between three or more sessions, at the discretion of the congregation overseer. He will conduct at least one of the sessions himself, and, if he chooses to do so, he may arrange for the other sessions to be presided over by other members of the congregation committee or other mature brothers designated by him. These meetings a re not meant to embarrass anyone, but to give each one opportunity to express the things that he sincerely believes. The apostle Paul said there should be “an interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other's faith, both yours and mine?* (Rom. 1:12) These meetings provide a fine opportunity for some of the appointed seiwants to become well acquainted with you and, in turn, for you to come to know them so that you feel free to approach them. If there are any points that you do not fully understand, do not hesitate to say so. These brothers will be glad to help*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Together, now, let us review these basic teachings of the Bible, one at a time, and let us try to understand and also to express in our own words what these scriptures mean to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Who is the true God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">The Bible answers: “That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.” (Ps. 83:18) “Listen, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.” (I&gt;eut. 6:4; Mark 12:</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">29) “God is a Spirit,, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth/' (John 4:24) (Consider how this differs from local popular beliefs, whether ot Christendom or of other religions. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">What kind of &lt;iod Is Jehovah ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;God is love.&quot; (1 John 4:8) &quot;The Rock, perfect is his activity, for all his ways are Justice. A God of faithfulness, with whom there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he.&quot; (Deut. 32:4) &quot;O the depth of God's riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are!&quot; (Rom. 11:33) **O Lord Jehovah! Here you yourself have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm. The whole matter is not too wonderful for you yourself/’ (Jer. 32:17) &quot;No man has seen God at any lime; the only-begotten god who is in the bosom position with the Father is the one that has explained him.'' (John 1:18) &quot;Jehovah went passing by before his face and declaring: 'Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abundant in loving-kindness and truth, preserving loving-kindness for thousands, pardoning error and transgression and sin, but by no means will he give exemption from punishment.’ ” (Ex. 34:6, 7) &quot;Jehovah is not slow respect mg his promise, as some people cor sidcr slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance/' &lt;2 Pet. 3:9) “Before the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God/' (Ps. 90:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">What does the Bible mean when it says that Jehovah requires our exclusive devotion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;In reply Jesus said to him: Tt Is written, “It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and It is to him alone you must render sacred service/”” (.Luke 1:8) “You must not make for yourself a cawed image or a form, like anything that is in the heavens above or that is on the earth underneath or that is in the waters under the earth. You must not bow down to them nor be induced to serve them, because i Jehovah your God am a God exacting exclusive devotion/' (Ex. 20:4, 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">fhnv wlH Jchcwjih Ood .sanctify his name? Hqiv can we have a share in it T</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;I will bring myself into judgment with him, with pestilence and with blood; . . * And I shall certainly magnify myself and sanctify myself and make myself known before the eyes of many nations; and they will have to know that I am Jehovah.&quot; (Kzek. 38:22, 23) “You must pray, then, this way: 'Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified/” (Matt. 6:9) “Jehovah of armies—he is the One whom you should treat as holy.” (Isa. 8:13) “I have glorified you on the earth . . . I have made your name manifest to the mon you gave me out of the world.<sup>11</sup> (John 17:4, 6) “Main-lain your conduct fine among the nations, that, in the thing in which they are speaking against you as evildoers, they may as a result of your fine works of which they arc eyewitnesses glorify God in the day for his inspection.” (1 Pet, 2:12) IGonsidcr how one's conduct reflects on Jehovah's name.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Who is Jesus Christ ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“In answer Simon Peter said: ‘You arc the Christ, the Son of the living God.&quot; &quot;&nbsp;(Matt. 16:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">What is Jesus' position In relation to Jehovah. God ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“You heard that I said to you, I am going away and 1 am coming back to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going my way to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.” (John 14:28) “He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation; because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and upon the earth, the things visible and the things invisible, no matter whether they are thrones or lordships or governments or authorities. All other things have been created through him and for him. Also, he is before all other things and by means of him all other things were made to exist.” (CoL 1:15-17) “There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man Christ Jesus.&quot; (1 Tim. 2:5) &quot;Keep this mental attitude in you that was also in Christ Jesus, who, although he was existing in God’s form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that ho should be equal to God. No, but he emptied himself and took a slave’s form and came to be in the likeness of men. More than that, when he found himself in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient as f ar as death, yes, death on a torture stake. For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.” (Phil. 2:5-11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Why did Jesus die m sacrificial death ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“The Son of man camo, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.” (Matt. 20:28} “We behold Jesus, who has been made a little lower than angels, crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death, that he by God’s undeserved kindness might taste death for every man. . . . that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil; and that he might emancipate all those who for fear of death were subject to slavery all through iheir lives.&quot; (Heb. 2:9, 14, 15) “The next day he beheld Jesus coming toward him, and he said: 'See, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world T ” (John 1:29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">How is the ransom an expression of GimI’h love for mankind ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“God recommends his own love to us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom. 5:8) “By this the love of God was made manifest in our case, because God sent forth his only-begotten Son into the world that we might gain life through him. The love is in this respect, not that wo have loved God, but that he loved us and sent forth his Son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.” (1 Jolin 4:9, 10) “God loved the world so much that he gave his only-begotten Son, in order that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life.” । John 3:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Elow docs the ransom affect us us Individuals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“By means of him we have the release by ransom through the blood of that one, yes, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his undeserved kindness.” (Eph. 1:7) “My little children, I am writing you these things that you may not commit a sin. And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one. And he is a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins, yet not for Olli's only but also for the whole world's/* (1 John 2:1, 2) &quot;He that exercises faith in the Son has everlasting life; he (hat disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains upon him.&quot; (John 3:36J</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">What Is the holy spirit ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;God's active force was moving to and fro Over the surface of the waters/' (Gen. 1:2) “You will receive power when the holy spirit, arrives upon, you, and you will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and In all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth.”<sup>1</sup> (Acts 1:8) &quot;'Now while the day of the festival of Pentecost was in progress they were all together at the same place, and suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just, like that of a rushing stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting. And tongues as if of fire became visible to them and were distributed about, and one sat upon each one of them, and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance.” (Acts 2:1-4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Iftnv can we benefit from the operation of that spirit today T</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;I( you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!” (Luke 11:13) &quot;All Script uro is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness?'<sup>1</sup> (2 rim. 3:16; see also 2 Peter 1:21.) “Pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God, which he purchased with the blood of his own Son.” (Acts 20:28)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Whose Ideas are recorded in the Bible ? Does that mean th-it God personally spoke or wrote it all Is all of it true?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;All Scripture is inspired of God/* (2 Tim. 3:16) &quot;Indeed, that is why we also thank God incessantly, because when you received God's word, which you heard from us, you accepted it, not as the word of men, but, just as it truth fully is, as the word of God, which is also at work in you believers.&quot; (1 Thess. 2:13) “You know this first, that no prophecy of Scripture spring's from any private interpretation. For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God. as they were borne along by holy spirit.&quot; (2 Pet. 1:20, 21) “Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.&quot; (John 17:17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Why should we pray ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“The end of all things has drawn close. Be sound in mind, therefore, and be vigilant with a view to prayers.” (1 Pct. 4:7) &quot;Then he wont on to toll them an illustration with regard to the need for them always to pray and not to give up.” (Luke 18:1) “Pray for one another . . . A righteous man’s supplication, when it is at work, has much force.&quot; (Jas. 5:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">To whom should we pray ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“If you ask the Father for anything he will give it to you in my name. . . . Ask and you will receive, that your joy may be made full.” (John 16:23, 24) “To my sayings do give ear, O Jehovah; do understand my sighing. Do pay attention to the sound of my cry for help, O my King and my God, because to you I pray.&quot; (Ps. 5:1, </span><span class="font21" style="font-style:italic;">2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">About what Is It proper to pray ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;No matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us.&quot; (1 John 5:14) “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanks giving let your petitions be made known to God.&quot; (Phil. 4:6) “In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ giving thanks always for all things to our God and Father.” (Kph. 5:20) &quot;You must pray, then, this way: ‘Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth. Give us today our bread for this day; and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the wicked one.”’ (Matt. 6:9-13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the kingdom of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a sen of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that Ono. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him. His rulership is an indefinitely lasting rulership that will not pass away, and. Ills kingdom one that will not be brought to ruin.&quot; (Dan. 7:13, 14) “In the days of those kings the God of heaver* will Set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.** (Dan. 2:44) ”Jesus answered: ‘My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source,’ &quot;&nbsp;(John 18:36) “They sing a new song, saying; ‘You are worthy to take 1 he scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought persons for God out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and you made th+'in to be a kingdom and priests to- our God, and they will rule as kings over the earth.” (Rev. 5:9, 10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">When Christ returns. Is it visibly ms a man, nr how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“When the Son of man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne.&quot; (Matt. 25:31) <sup>4</sup>‘Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might load you to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit,&quot; (1 Pct. 3:18) &quot;In the house of my Father there are many abodes. Otherwise, I would have told you, because I am going my way to prepare a place for you. Also, if I go my way and prepare a place for you, 1 am coming again and will receive you home to myself, that where 1 am you also may ba. A little longer and the world will behold me no more, but you will behold me, because I live and you will live.” (John 14;2, 3. 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">How can people know when hi.s second presence takes place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">Read in your copy of the Bible the entire chapters of Matthew 24, 25; Mark 13; Luke 21; Daniel 4; Revelation 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">What does It mean to *seek first the kingdom’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal. . . . No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will Slick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches. . . . So never be anxious and say, 'What are we to eat?* or, 'What are we to drink?* or, *What are we to put on?* For all those are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing. For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things.

But you did not learn the Christ to be so, provided, indeed, that you heard him and were taught by moans of him, just as truth is in Jesus, that you should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires; but that you should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty.” (Eph. 4:17-24)</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Why are true Christians persecuted ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">&quot;If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you. Bear in mind the the word I said to you, A slave is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will persecute you also; if they have observed my word, they will observe yours also. But they will do all these things against you on account of my name, because they do not know him that sent me.’<sup>1</sup> (John 15:19-21) “In fact, all those desiring to live with godly devotion in association with Christ Jesus will also be persecuted.” (2 Tim. 3:12) “Before all these things people wall lay their hands upon you and £X?rsecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, you being haled, before kings and governors for the sake of my name. It will turn out to you for a witness.” (Luke 21:12, 13)</span></p>

<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">What should always be our attitude toward the doing of Jehovah’s will ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font21">“Look! I am come to do your will<sup>11</sup> (Heb. 10:9) ‘Tlappy is the man in fear of Jehovah, in whoso commandments he has taken very much delight.** (Ps.</span></p>

<p><span class="font21">112: 1) &quot;You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind-&quot; (Luke 10: 27) '&quot;Jesus said to them: &quot;My food is for me io do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.’ &quot;&nbsp;(John 4:34)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">Why should one who has made a dedication to God he baptized ?</span></p>

But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: ‘I am the one needing to bo baptized by you, and are you coming to me?’ In reply Jesus said to him: ‘Let it be, this time, for in that way it Is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.’ Then he quit preventing him. After being baptized Jesus Immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God's spirit coming upon him. Look! Also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’” (Matt. 3: 13-17) &quot;When they believed Philip, who was declaring the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they proceeded to be baptized, both men and women.” (Acts 8:12) &quot;That which corresponds to this is also now saving you, namely, baptism, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the request made to God for a good conscience,) through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.” (1 Pct. 3:21)</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>An Organization Based on God’s Word</span></h3>
<p><span class="font28">J</span><span class="font23">UST as it is true that God’s Word is a lamp to our feet in matters of belief and personal conduct, so, too, it provides organizational instructions. It makes clear to us Jehovah’s way of doing things and shows us how we personally can have a share in the carrying out of his purposes. Therefore, the Holy Bible constitutes the basic organization instructions of Jehovah's Christian witnesses. It contains Jehovah’s righteous laws, commandments and judicial decisions. It sets forth principles that must guide our thinking and oui' actions if we are to be well pleasing to God. What it says applies in every part of the earth and to all persons, without partial i tv.—Mic. 4:2; Acts 10: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The inspired Word of God informs us that Jehovah has subjected all things to Jesus Christ and has made him the head of the Christian congregation. (Eph. 1:22, 23) At the time of Pentecost, 33 C.E., the glorified Jesus poured out God’s holy spirit on his faithful disciples gathered in Jerusalem, in this way designating them, as a class, as his “faithful and discreet slave.” (Matt. 24:45) As Jesus had told them in advance, when this happened they were to be witnesses of him, first in Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, and then to the most distant part of the earth. (Acts 1:8) As new ones were gathered into association with them, those already in the Christian congregation were to supply them with the needed spiritual food. All contributed in various ways to the spiritual upbuilding of the individual members of the congregation.—Eph. 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Today the remaining ones of Christ’s spirit-anointed body members on earth constitute the “faithful and discreet slave,” and it is this class, as foretold at Matthew 24:47, that the Lord Jesus has appointed “over aZZ his belongings” here on earth. So it is vital to work in close association with this “slave” class and respond in a positive way to the counsel that you receive through it. This is in harmony with what is stated at Revelation 7:9-17. There it is made clear that, in addition to Hie 144,000 spiritual Israelites who would be “slaves of our God/’ a “great crowd” of others would stand approved before God and Christ. Their respect for Jehovah's organizational arrangement is made clear, because it is pointed out that they serve God “in his temple/* that is, in association on earth with the remnant of Christ’s body members, who make up a temple of “living stones,’* “a holy temple for Jehovah . . . a place for God to inhabit by spirit/’ (1 Pet. 2:5; Eph. 2:21, 22) And in his illustration of the sheep and the goats, Jesus says that people of the nations are to undergo judicial examination on the basis of their treatment of his “brothers,” his spirit-anointed follow heirs of the heavenly kingdom. It is those who loyally uphold them even when they are being persecuted and who refresh them by wholehearted participation with them as dedicated Christians in God’s service who will be approved by Jesus Christ and rewarded with eternal life. —Matt. 25:31-46; Hcb. 2:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">From among the members of Christ’s spirit-anointed body members certain ones serve as a visible governing body. In the first century of our Common Era that governing body was made up of the apostles and certain other mature brothers in the Jerusalem congregation. (Acts 15:2, 6, 23) When they were called on to make decisions affecting the lives and activity of God’s people, they considered carefully what the Scriptures said about the matter, looked to God for the direction of his spirit, and then gave appropriate counsel. Response to their oversight strengthened the faith of the congregations and resulted in continued increase, with God’s blessing.—Acts 16 :4, 5; 1 Cor. 3:6, 7,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In order to carry out the preaching work most effectively under modern-day conditions, the “faithful and discreet slave” has organized a legal corporation, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. This Society, made up of mature Christians, is nonprofit and is completely devoted to advancing the interests of true worship in the earth. It has been used by the anointed followers of Jesus Christ for many years in dispensing knowledge to the household of faith and directing the preaching work, and Jehovah’s blessing on that arrangement is very manifest. The visible governing body is closely identified with the board of directors of this Society. As was true among early Christians, response to the oversight of the governing body results in unity and increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To facilitate the carrying out of Jesus* instructions to preach “this good news of the kingdom’* in all the inhabited earth, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society also has branch offices in various countries. All of these are subject to the visible governing body, but each branch devotes its attention to its own territory. Knowing the conditions that exist there, the branch office is in position to apply instructions in the most beneficial way and to handle local matters promptly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is no less true in our day than it was in the first century of our Common Era that close contact with Jehovah’s visible organization is important. Those who got baptized as Chris turns at the time of Pentecost, 33 C.E., continued in close association with the apostles to receive instruction. (Acts 2:41, 42) When persecution resulted in a scattering of the disciples, they still kept in touch with the governing body in Jerusalem. (Acts 8:1, 14-17} Later, when Saul of Tarsus was converted, the Lord saw to it that he was brought into contact with representatives of the Christian congregation for instruction. (Acts 9:1-22) And as this zealous apostle went about the preaching work, he built up the appreciation of others for Jehovah’s visible organization. How? By referring the important circumcision issue to the governing body at Jerusalem and supporting the decision made; also by organizing congregations in many of the cities where he preached. (Acts 14:21-23; 15:1, 2; 16:4, 5) The instructions written to some of those congregations have been preserved for us In the inspired Word of God, and they continue to provide the basis for the organizational procedures followed by Jehovah’s Christian witnesses today.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Congregation Meetings</span></h3>
<p><span class="font28">I</span><span class="font23">N ALL. parts of the earth where there are groups of Jehovah’s witnesses, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society has organized congregations and provided a schedule of meet ings for the spiritual upbuilding of those associated with them*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Gathering together to hear God’s Word and to share in worship is important for each one of us, even as it was in the days of faithful Nehemiah, who urged his fellow Israelites: “We should not neglect the house of our God.&quot; (Neh, 10:39) Attending meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses shows that you are conscious of your spiritual need and it identifies you with Jehovah’s servants in the earth. At Hebrews 10:24, 25, the apostle Paul urges us to appreciate the importance of the meetings, saying: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near.&quot; That “day&quot; is indeed drawing very near, and the pressures of the world are constantly increasing. So, more than ever before, it is necessary to gather together at the congregation meetings, in order to stay spiritually awake. Even when you arc tired at the end of the day, you will find that the meetings are refreshing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Attending meetings is important for both young persons and those of oldci' years. It is a fine thing when parents arrange to bring their children with them to the meetings. As the prophet Moses instructed the people in his day: “Congregate the people, the men and the women and the little ones . . . in order that they may listen and in order that they may learn.” (Deut. 31:12) And of the young man Timothy, the Bible informs us that </span><span class="font22">lie knew the li- wri.ings from She time of in</span><span class="font23">fancy.—-2 Tim. 3:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font23">is not just occasional meeting attendance that makes one a spiritually sound, mature Christian. More is required than that. Regularity is needed, and balance, enabling one to benefit from all the provisions made by Jehovah through his organization. Those who embraced the truth at the time of Pentecost, 33 C.E., did not treat the matter lightly. “They continued devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles . . . And day after day they were in constant attendance at the temple with one accord.” (Acts 2:42, 46) Later, when Paul instructed disciples in Ephesus, he provided a consistent program or spiritual upbuilding for them, giving talks daily. (Acts 19:9) Really, where would we rather be than in association with Jehovah’s people? And what could be more beneficial than hearing the Word of God discussed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is also our privilege and duty when attending meetings to consider the others who are present. Of course, our being in attendance is itself a source of encouragement to them. But, when discussing the importance of attending meetings, the apostle Paul urged us to do more than simply be present, lie said: “Let us hold fast the public declaration of our hope without wavering.” (Ileb. 10:23) So, when there is opportunity for audience participation, offer to express yourself on the material under consideration. This will deepen the impression on your own mind, strengthen your faith in the matter being discussed and upbuild others who are present. It will also provide a good example for any newly interested ones who are at the meeting with you. Do not feel that what you might say is not of sufficient importance. Your very willingness to comment will warm the hearts of others in attendance, and your accepting the privilege of participating in the meeting will result in rich blessings for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Another way that you can be a blessing to others is by inviting and bringing them with you to the meetings of Jehovah’s witnesses. Tell your friends and neighbors about the good things that you are learning at the meetings, and invite them to come with you. Freely advertise the meetings both by word of mouth and by distributing handbills when you participate in the field ministry. Right from the start, build up a desire on the part of those with whom you study the Bible to attend meetings. Even in the congregation there may well be some who need encouragement and assistance to get to the meetings. Thei’e will be mutual benefit if you arc able to extend personal aid to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Each one of the meetings is important; each plays a part in your life as a Christian, As we consider the various meetings of the congregation, take note of how that is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">WATCHTOWER” STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The weekly study of the TVatcfotower magazine is the most important meeting of the congregation and everyone associated with the congregation should make a diligent effort to be present regularly. The study material frequently deals with the application of Bible principles to your daily living and fortifies you against the “spirit of the world’* and unchristian conduct, (1 Cor, 2:12) Through the columns of </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font23">comes increased light on Bible doctrine and the fulfillment of prophecy as Jehovah makes this known. Regularly sharing in the Weft</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font23"> study will enable you to keep in sharp focus Jehovah’s righteous new system of things. It will assist you to manifest the fruitage of God’s spirit in your life and keep strong your desire to serve Jehovah zealously, (Gal, 5:22, 23) It will fortify you for the searching trials of faith that He ahead for each one of us. It will help you to prove worthy of perfect life in God’s promised new order under his everlasting kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The schedule for study of the principal articles in each issue of </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font23"> is printed right in the magazine, so each one can know in advance what material will be discussed. You will find it very beneficial to set aside time during the week to read the lesson and look up the scriptures before you attend the meeting. This will enable you to participate, and you will also find that you get far more from the expressions made by others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even if you should find that, on occasion, you are not able to study your lesson in advance, do not miss the meeting. By being present you will benefit from the preparation that others have done. Their comments will help you to understand matters that may not have been clear to you, and even hearing them express 1 hemselves on truths with which you are well acquainted will deepen your appreciation; it will help to fortify your heart. (Prov. 4:4, 23) Furthermore, the </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font23"> study servant will endeavor to handle the meeting in such a way that principal points are emphasized for the benefit of everyone. Flven more important, keep in mind what Jesus Christ said: “Where there are two or three gathered together in mv name, there I am in their midst/<sup>1 </sup>—Matt. 18:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Watchtower study is opened and closed with song and prayer. After the opening prayer the conductor briefly draws attention to a few high points in the lesson, both to whet the audience’s appetite for what is to follow and to help them to appreciate the reason for considering the specific material at hand. If it is a continuation of an article started the previous week, he may briefly restate certain key points from that earlier study and tie them in with what is next to be considered. The printed questions provided in Watchtower are propounded, then the study conductor calls on those who volunteer by raising their hands. Feel free to express yourself. He usually directs attention to the scriptures in the paragraph, encouraging comments that show their relation to the question being considered. If time allows, he also calls for the reading of certain scriptures that are cited but not quoted. Then the paragraph is read in summary. For reading the paragraphs a different reader may be used each week, and, if possible, advance selection is made of a well-qualified reader, since much valuable instruction is imparted when the reading is done with proper sense stress and enthusiasm. If there is only one brother capable of doing good reading, then he may be asked to read every week. If you arc a brother who can read effectively, or if you apply yourself and become a fine public reader, it may be your privilege to serve the congregation in this way on Occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Ordinarily, the Wafcftitnear study is just one hour in length, with no more than ten additional minutes for the opening and closing, including announcements. You can help to keep the study within the allotted time by having comments ready to offer as soon as the questions are asked. This will keep the study moving and make it possible for the congregation to hear from many persons during the time set aside for the study</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">in most cases the entire congregation gathers together at the Kingdom Hall for their weekly Watchtower study. However, if some live at distant points, far from the Kingdom Hall. Wc/t-toirer studies are sometimes arranged for them, perhaps on Sundays or another day that is convenient for them, It is better to have a WcrtcZi-tower study in their own locality than for them to miss it because of the long distance and inconvenience in traveling to the central meeting. In such cases a brother living in that vicinity is appointed as the study conductor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The meeting is held in the language of the country or district, unless the congregation was specifically organized to serve a different language group. However, if there is a group of persons in the congregation who speak another tongue, there is no objection to arranging a WcitcTz</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">tower</span><span class="font23"> study for the benefit of these brothers, They will get a clearer understanding by studying </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font23"> in their own language and expressing themselves in their own tongue. The extra-language meetings should be at a time different from the regular meetings for the congregation, however, and those attending these meetings should also be encouraged to attend the regular meetings of the congregation, to get acquainted with the language of the land where they dwell. In this way they will, in time, be able to have a more extensive share in the ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PUBLIC MEETHra</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The public meeting is quite different from the IVa/c/t/ower study. Rather than being a question-and-answer discussion of printed study material, it generally takes the form of a discourse. But to stimulate keen interest and to impress key thoughts on the minds of everyone, the speaker may use pictures, maps or an outline of points on a blackboard. As part of the program, arrangements may be made for questions both to and from the audience. At times, the material may be presented by a symposium of speakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">A wide variety of subjects comes under consideration at this meeting. There are talks about marital problems and the difficult situations that confront youths in this modern world. Christian morals are discussed. The marvels of creation and scientific confirmation of the Scriptures are considered. Other talks provide illuminating background information to enhance your appreciation of Bible accounts^ as well as comments on their significance in our day. There are verse-by-verse commentaries on portions of the Bible. Films produced by the Society may also be presented from time to time as part of the public meeting program. In addition, other topics that are particularly appropriate to your community or needed by your congregation may be developed and presented locally. TYuly, the public meeting provides a spiritual feast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">This is called a </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">public</span><span class="font23"> meeting because extensive advertising is done to invite the public and the talks are given with the public in mind- Not that the material is directed solely to the public, but the speaker makes it a point to explain his subject in terms that the public can grasp. He frequently invites his audience to open the Bible and follow with him as he reads from it, just as you might do in personal discussion with a newly interested person in his home. Anyone who attends cannot help but be impressed with the fact that here are a people who truly do study and believe God’s Word. As a result , sincere ones wall be moved to declare: <sup>4</sup>‘God is really among you/*—1 Cor. 14:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Since this is advertised as a public meeting, and the public are invited simply to hear a Bible discussion, we do not open and close this meeting with prayer, thus obliging: them to join in worship with us. Rather, a chairman usually makes a few opening remarks, welcoming those present, introducing the speaker and stating the title of the talk for the day. His remarks are very brief. After the talk, the chairman also concludes the meeting, making whatever announcements are appropriate for those present. In most cases he will let you know the title of the next public talk and the name of the speaker, He will also warmly invite everyone to remain for the TVatcftipwer study, if it is held after the public talk. When there are new ones on hand, he may extend an invitation for them to avail themselves of our free home Bible study service; and perhaps a tract or a booklet and a handbill listing the congregation’s meetings will be given to them before they leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">You have a key role to play in connection with this meeting. Of course, your presence is necessary if the meeting is going to accomplish for the members of the congregation what is intended. But there is something more than that. The com gregation counts on you to advertise the talk, both by distributing handbills (sometimes by using placards) and by enthusiastically talking to your acquaintances and other interested persons, stimulating their desire to be present. Whore possible, arrange for others to come to the meeting right along with you. This is by far the most effective means of building up attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If there are sufficient qualified speakers available, your congregation will no doubt have a public talk every week. Frequently this can be made possible by arranging for visiting speakers from nearby congregations. But, even if there is a shortage of speakers in your area, arrangements will be made to have these talks just as often as possible, so that the congregation does not miss out on the fine instruction made available by means of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In addition to putting on talks in your Kingdom Hall, arrangements may be made for holding public talks in rural sections and outlying towns in the congregation’s territory. Efforts are made to give a thorough witness in this territory in conjunction with the public meetings. If 1here are many locations that can be obtained, such as community houses, lodge halls, schools, private homes of Kingdom publishers, lawns, fields and parks, the congregation will no doubt plan on using some of them. Usually they can be obtained at a very reasonable cost or even free* If you have a share in setting up sound equipment for such a meeting, keep in mind that you should conform to local regulations as to operating the equipment. The loudspeakers need only be loud enough to reach the audience so that all can hear well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Public meetings similar to those enjoyed by each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses were also conducted by Jesus Christ, his apostles and their associates* Often they spoke in synagogues, which were actually public assembly halls in those days. (John 18:20; Acts 17:1-3) Pau! used a school auditorium in Ephesus as a place to give talks. (Acts 19:8, 9) Other discourses were given on the mountainside and down by the sea. (Matt, 5:1, 2; 13:1, 2) Not only the public, but the disciples were very much encouraged by the things that they learned from these discourses, (Matt, 7:28; Euke 6:17, 20) That will be your experience too as you regularly attend the public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SERVICE MEETING</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The service meeting is specifically designed to equip you to have an effective share in carrying out the work of preaching the Kingdom good news and making disciples of those who respond to God’s Word. (Matt. 24:14) Featured at this meeting are talks that highlight the Scriptural methods to use in the Held ministry, and encouraging experiences are related in connection with the preaching work, both locally and in other parts of the world. There arc demonstrations designed to show effective ways to introduce the Kingdom message to people and stimulate their interest in God’s Word, also how to cope with the various obstacles and objections common to the territory in which you live, Practical instruction is given on the way to conduct home Bible studies and aid interested ones to begin to associate with the congregation. The meeting aids both new and seasoned Witnesses to improve their ability in the service of God. Regularity in attending the service meeting results in unified activity on the part of the entire congregation and it will aid you to be regular in the field service. Since every baptized witness of Jehovah is a minister, this meeting is important for all of us and it is also very beneficial for anyone else who desires to become a dedicated servant of God, Make attendance at this meeting a part of your weekly schedule of activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Meetings of this sort are nothing new. They arc based on sound Scriptural precedent. Before sending his disciples out to preach, Jesus gave them detailed instructions on what to say and do. (Matt. 10:5-11:1; Luke 10:1-16) Later his disciples continued to have such meetings at which they discussed their experiences in the field ministry and were strengthened for continued service. (Acts 4:23-31) We continue the practice today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Service meetings are built around the information provided by the Society in </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font23"> which you will receive every month from your congregation overseer. When he receives a new issue of </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font23"> he carefully analyzes what it contains and assigns the various meeting parts to qualified brothers, giving them written notice of their assignments as soon as possible. But there is more to it, in order to make the meetings most practical and beneficial to the local congregation. He may review the counsel given by the circuit servant on his latest report and see that this is taken into consideration at various times during the month. He also endeavors to discuss with each one on the program how to present his material in a way that will most directly fit the local needs. At times he may even rearrange the program in order to take up some matter that is urgently in need of attention. Arrangements should also be made to rehearse demonstrations and to coordinate all the meeting parts. This takes time, but it results in a program that is informative and spiritually upbuilding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">From time to time there is a service meeting that is left for the overseer of the local congregation to outline. Others of the servants may also have some suggestions, and he will take these into consideration. Since the overseer Is well acquainted with the needs of the congregation, he can see that the meeting is one that contains practiced suggestions that will be of real benefit to the publishers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Every service meeting is opened with song and prayer‘and closes in the same manner, unless one meeting follows the other. There is also a discussion of the day’s text. At the close of the program service arrangements arc outlined for the days ahead, also there frequently is some announcement about what has been planned for forthcoming meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At almost every service meeting there is opportunity for you to participate. Avail yourself of it. If there is to be a question-and-answer discussion of material from Atwgjdom </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry</span><span class="font23"> or some other publication, endeavor to read it ahead of time so that you will be in position to comment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Or if you are invited to relate a field experience or to share in a demonstration, gladly accept this privilege, if at all possible, and work at it diligently. Attend the service meeting with the thought of giving, not merely receiving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Dedicated and baptized males who have the needed ability and who set a good example as Christians arc put in charge of the various service meeting parts. If you are a brother, and you apply yourself diligently, it may be your privilege to serve the congregation in this way. Accept such assignments joyfully, and care for them conscientiously as part of your service to Jehovah. When you are assigned such a meeting part, study carefully the material provided by the Society. Determine what the principal points of instruction are and emphasize them so that the publishers will understand and remember them. There are many ways in which material can be effectively presented. Demonstrations, roundtable discussions, interviews, quizzes, forums, dialogues, question-and-answer sessions and service talks may all be used at various times. Have in mind, too, the importance of applying the material to the situation of the local congregation. If you are not sure what is needed in this regard, discuss the matter with your congregation overseer. An ideal presentation is one that is simple, practical and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Demonstrations may be called for at times* Any publishers in good standing with the congregation, including young children, may be used in these presentations. In fact, it is a good thing, from time to time, to afford opportunity for every publisher in the congregation to have a share in these programs. If you are assigned to present a demonstration, do not try to put over some great dramatic production with a lot of stage props. Use natural scenes, such as a house-tb-house visit, a back-call, a home Bible study or a family discussion. It is what is said and how it is said that are important, not the stage setting. To be effective, demonstrations must be well rehearsed. Do this either in someone's home or at the Kingdom Hall itself, so that each one will know where he is to be and what he is to say and do. In that way the demonstration will proceed smoothly and will accomplish its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Each service meeting has a theme. The first meeting in the month is built around the service theme shown on the Society's calendar and in the Yearbook. Other meetings may be built around other appropriate themes. The meeting will make a more lasting impression on the minds of the publishers if each one will tie in his part with the theme; so take this into consideration when preparing your assigned part. Also, consider the timing. If each one on the program sticks to the allotted time, the meeting will conclude in one hour, apart from the song and prayer <sub>+</sub> Everyone who shares in the program should cooperate to that end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCILATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Tn addition to the other meetings, each congregation of Jehovah's witnesses provides a Theocratic Ministry School. This is a continuous training school for men, women and children. There are special textbooks and a well-planned program of activity. As a part of this course, periodically those in attendance read the entire Bible, analyze the principles of effective speaking and discuss how to conduct effective congregation meetings. Students also give short talks to the group and practice sermons to individuals^. and a qualified counselor offers helpful suggestions for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In organizing and conducting this meeting, Jehovah’s witnesses show that they take to heart the practical counsel that the apostle Faul gave to Timothy, a fellow servant of the Lord, when lie said: * 'Continue applying yourself to public reading, to exhortation, to teaching. . . . Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, that your advancement may be manifest to all persons.” (1 Tim. 4:13-15) By enrolling in the Theocratic Ministry School, which convenes once each week at the Kingdom Hall, you show that you, too, arc interested in advancement. Such training can aid you to become a more effective public praiser of Jehovah. It can equip you to accomplish more in the time you have available for the field ministry, as well as to give fine comments in the congregation meetings. In the case of brothers, this training is one of the important steps toward qualifying for the privilege of taking responsibility for service meeting parts and delivering public talks, and it is a means by which you can develop the abilities required of those who are appointed as overseers of Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">All persons associated with the congregation, both male and female, are encouraged to enroll in the Theocratic Ministry School and attend regularly. Those enrolled will be assigned periodically to give student talks, and they will be notified well in advance so that they can prepare thoroughly. Though no roll call is read at the school, it is beneficial to be present, and it is particularly important to be on hand to give any talks that are assigned to you. Plan to get. to the hall before the meeting starts, so the school servant will know that, you are going to give the talk. If an emergency situation arises, and it is impossible to be present to fulfill an assignment, be sure to notify the school servant, doing so just as early as possible so that he can arrange for someone else to prepare the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When you are assigned to give a talk in the Theocratic Ministry School, keep in mind that the reason for your giving the talk is twofold: It pro-vidcs opportunity for you to improve your speaking ability, and at the same time you cover instructive material for the benefit of everyone present. To accomplish these objectives, it is important to spend some time analyzing the speech Qualities on which you are assigned to work, as well as to study the information that will be discussed in your talk. If you do this, each talk you give will reflect improvement in your speaking ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">After each student talk the instructor will offer helpful counsel. So, if you will be giving a talk, before the meeting be sure to give him your Speech Counsel slip, because he ■will want to make notations on it. If you have done well on certain speech qualities, he will commend you, and, to the extent that time permits, he may point, out, for the benefit of everyone present, what it was that made them good and how they affect our ministry* If further work on a speech quality would be advantageous, he will offer suggestions to assist you* Always keep in mind that the counsel given is for your edification and to assist you to be a better praiser of Jehovah God</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">in addition to the student talks, the school program usually includes an instruction talk, given by the school servant or one of the better qualified brothers enrolled in the school. If you apply yourself diligently (and are a male), in time it may be your privilege to give such discourses. There is also provision on most weeks for an oral review of the previous week’s instruction talk, and it will be stimulating to you, and beneficial to the others too, if you prepare ahead of time and volunteer to answer at least one of those review questions. Then, too, periodically there may be a written review of the information that has been studied* This is not for competitive purposes but is a means of helping you to see if you have an accurate understanding of the material that has been discussed, and it assists you to learn any key points that you may have missed. Avail yourself of all these opportunities to be an active participant in the Theocratic Ministry School. Even those who are unable to give talks, because of some infirmity or because they arc too young, should attend and benefit from the instruction provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION BOOK STU OY</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The congregation book study is generally conducted with a smaller group than the other meetings. There are just a few families or a comparatively small number of individuals who gather at each of these studies. Instead of having the entire congregation come together at one place for the meeting, arrangements are made for them to meet in convenient locations scattered throughout the congregation's territory. One group may meet at the Kingdom Hall; others assemble in the homes of persons who have kindly opened them for that purpose. Here is an evidence of Jehovah’s loving-kindness and his tender care for his people, because in these small groups it is possible for more personal attention to be given to the spiritual growth of each individual.—Isa. 40:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">This is a one-hour group study, using the Bible and a textbook provided by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Here a careful study is made of Bible doctrines, prophecy, counsel on Christian conduct and other information that will aid you to carry out your dedication to Jehovah God? Scriptures cited in the study material are looked up in the Bible and their relation to the points under discussion is analyzed. Time is taken to discuss the material thoi'oughly. As you attend this study week by week, you will find that you gain not only knowledge but understanding; you will learn the reasons for statements that are made and how to support them from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">(Prov. 4:1; 2 Tim. 2:15) You will learn how to conduct discussions of the same material with individuals and families that you are able to help to become acquainted with the “word of life.” (Phil. 2:16) This meeting will do much to equip you to become a capable teacher of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Basically, T he meeting is conducted in the same manner as the WafcTtfower study<sub>+</sub> It is opened and closed with prayer. Questions are asked on each paragraph; comments are invited; scriptures are read; then the paragraph is read in summary. However, at the congregation book study there is no set amount of material to be covered, so more time can be spent in discussing the material. The important thing is not how many pages are covered but that those present understand what has been studied. To impress principal thoughts on the mind of each onc<sub>t</sub> brief oral reviews arc generally conducted at both the beginning and the end of the study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">With a small group such as this, there is more opportunity for you to comment. You will find that it is not at all difficult to participate freely at this meeting, and this gives you opportunity to get accustomed to making a declaration of your faith before others. (Heb. 13:15) It is good to learn to make your comments in your own words, instead of reading them out of the book, because this enables you to deter mine whether you really understand the material. Learn to give simple, clear, brief comments, because they are the easiest to follow and, therefore, the best for you to use in teaching others. To get the most out of the study, set aside time to prepare your lesson in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Although everyone present is encouraged to share in the reading of scriptures, just one person reads the paragraphs each week. If possible, arrangements are made for a well-qualified dedicated brother to be the reader. IF there is not one available, other than the conductor himself, he may ask a dedicated sister or, in some cases, an undcdicated person to do the reading* Assignment to read the paragraphs is usually made a week in advance. If that should be your privilege, be sure to prepare well, realizing that effective reading adds much to the instructive value of the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Having these study groups scattered throughout the congregation territory makes it convenient both for you and for newly interested persons in the neighborhood to attend. Make every effort to bring others with you to the meeting, so that they can get a taste of the spiritually upbuilding discussions and warm association that we enjoy* From time to time as you call on these people, why not take along various ones from your congregation book study group? When the interested person gets acquainted with a number of those who attend the study, it will make it easier for him to respond to your invitation to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In addition to providing a study place, the location where the congregation book study is held is also a rendezvous for service. Here the group can meet at convenient times to go out into the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When your congregation book study group grows to the point that there are about twenty in regular attendance, then the congregation overseer will consider arranging for another study group. Of course, this means that another mature study conductor will also be needed, and, if you meet the Scriptural requirements, that may be your privilege. (1 Tim* 3:8-10, 12, 13) Also, another home will be needed where the new group can meet. It should be one that is neat and clean, and located where it will be convenient for a group of publishers to meet so that none will have to travel very far. It is truly a privilege Tor' one's home to serve as a place for worship in the community, and such an arrangement often results in rich spiritual blessings to the members of the household. If you would like to have a congregation book study in your home, why not mention it to your overseer? Then, when the need arises, he will know that there is a location available* Having congregation meetings in private homes was a practice of the early Christians, and the practice has continued to have Jehovah's blessing in our day.—Rom. 16:3, 5; Philem. 1, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">TIME OF MEETINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The times at which the congregation meetings are held are determined locally. They may vary from place to place, because the matter *is discussed with the congregation and then times are chosen that are convenient for the majority of publishers in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The greater number of congregations have their public meet ing and Watcyfetoiaer study on Sunday. Thon, one night early in the week they’ have their congregation book study, and another night later in the week they have their Theoci’atic Ministry School and service meeting. But this varies, if some have to travel fox' many hours to get to the meetings, or other circumstances make it necessary, they may have more of their meetings at one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In areas where most of the brothers work late, the schedule may be adjusted to fit their situation. There are some congregations that do not start their week-night meetings until quite late; others have meetings in the afternoon. Of course, in locations where more than one congregation uses the same Kingdom Hall, meeting times have to be set accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">A large number of publish era engage in the field ministry on Sunday. Many of them prefer to do their field service early In the day, and then gather for congregation meetings in the afternoon or at night* But some have found that, because of the way of life in their locality, they get a more favorable response in the field ministry on Sunday afternoon than in the morning; so they have their meetings in the morning. Either is all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">KINGDOM ILAJLL</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Kingdom Hall, of Jehovah’s Witnesses is the center of pure worship in the community. It is the principal location where meetings of the congregation are held, and it provides a central place from which the field ministry can be conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In some communities a congregation may be small and so may meet in a private home. But just as soon as it proves to be both possible and practical, each congregation endeavors to obtain an adequate meeting hall. In some localities it is more convenient to rent a hall than to buy or to build. However, large numbers of congregations have decided to purchase property and build their own Kingdom Hall, suited to their needs. It is up to each congregation to decide what it wants to do in this matter. Kingdom Halls are ordinarily moderate in size. Emphasis is placed on the spiritual condition of the congregation rather than the size of the building. Of course, whether you own or rent your hall, it ought to be kept clean, and that is a responsibility that each one in the congregation should help to bear. Both inside and out, the Kingdom Hall should be a proper representation of Jehovah’s organization. Usually the congregation overseer works out a schedule for the various congregation book study groups to take turns in cleaning the hall, along with a list of the things that need to be done each week* When your study group’s turn comes, be sure to do your part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There are a number of things that can be done to advertise the Kingdom Hall. For one thing, there should be a sign out in front bearing the</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">words “Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses'* and an up-to-date listing of the times of meetings. If your hall has a window on street level, it is good to have an attractive display of literature so that passersby may observe it. Perhaps you enjoy arranging tilings in an artistic manner; if so, you may want to volunteer to help keep that display up-to-date and clean, using current literature and changing the arrangement from time to time. Some newspapers gladly publish free notices of meeting times and special events, and it is good to take advantage of this service. It may also be that the congregation servant will want to have his phone listed under “Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Besides the above means of advertising, do not fail to make good use of any handbills provided by your congregation. Distribute them freely. They provide an excellent reminder to the people in your territory that Jehovah's witnesses are active among them and are ready and willing to help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Of course, it costs money to keep up a Kingdom Hall, and all those associated with the congregation have the privilege of contributing financially to its maintenance. There is never any solicitation of funds, nor is a collection ever taken up. But a contribution box is provided in the Kingdom Hall so that each one can contribute as he is able, ’not under compulsion' but “just as he has resolved in his heart.”—2 Cor. 9:7; 8:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At every meeting in the Kingdom Hall there should be a brother who serves as an attendant, and he ought to be a person who has a friendly personality. Would you be willing to serve in this capacity occasionally? Speak to your overseer about it. Then, if you are assigned, keep in mind that it is your job to greet newcomers and to make them feel welcome. Also, be sure that there are sufficient chairs set up and that any necessary attention is given to proper heating and ventilation in the hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In addition to its use foi' regular congregation meetings and as a rendezvous for field service, the Kingdom Hall may be used for wedding ceremonies and funeral services, with the permission of the congregation service committee. It is up to the committee to decide what preparations for such events may be made in the hall and what announcements of such use of the hall will be made to the congregation, if the individuals concerned would like to have the congregation know. When the need arises, the congregation will furnish a speaker for a funeral service, whether it is conducted in the Kingdom Hall or elsewhere; or, if a particular person is requested, and he is able to handle it, that is all right. If requested, the overseer will also be glad to arrange for a capable brother to conduct a wedding ceremony, in harmony with Ilie local legal requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">CIRCUIT AXI) DISTRICT ASSEMBIJBS</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Everyone who regularly attends the meetings at the Kingdom Hall also looks forward with eager anticipation to the larger assemblies of Jehovah’s people that are held periodically. The coming together of large numbers of Jehovah’s people for instruction has long been a feature of true worship. (Neb. 8:1-3; Dcut. 16:1-16; 31:10-13) Such assemblies are highlights in the lives of Jehovah’s witnesses today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Twice a year a number of congregations that are served by the same circuit servant meet together for a three-day circuit assembly. There are talks and demonstrations, practical instruction designed to meet the needs of that circuit. Such assemblies also afford opportunity for those who have recently made a dedication to Jehovah God to symbolize it by w<sup>T</sup>ater immersion. Additionally, once a year a number of circuits usually gather for what is called a district assembly. At these district assemblies, and at the occasional national and international assemblies, some of the most thrilling discourses and announcements in the modern-day history of Jehovah’s people have been presented. It is not only the last day or two of such assemblies that are important; right from the opening session on, the program contains material that has been specially prepared to equip you to be a more effective praiscr of Jehovah and to endure faithfully in his service right on into his new system of things. If at all possible, plan ahead so that you can enjoy the entire assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The very fact that a large number of persons who manifest the spirit of God have come together makes people ask questions, as they did at Pentecost in the year 33 C.E. As a result, conventions of Jehovah’s people afford an opportunity to give a witness to God’s kingdom in an impressive way. (Acts 2:1-42) The love that motivates Jehovah’s witnesses to contribute their time and labor to serve their Christian brothers by operating the various assembly departments is a source of amazement to the world, resulting in an effective witness.—John 13:34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Not only must those in attendance have their spiritual needs cared for through the program itself, but also their physical needs require attention. Sufficient rooming accommodations must be obtained. Usually the hotels do not have enough rooms for our large conventions; besides, many of the delegates who come as family groups are of moderate means, and they need something economical, This calls for house-to-house visits to contact local residents who are willing to rent rooms at reasonable rates. Food is made available through the Cafeteria and Refreshment departments at the assembly and is served to conven-tioners for a moderate price. Attendants are also required. These and many other services neecs-sary to the operation of the assembly are performed by volunteer workers attending the assembly. None of them are paid for their work, but they willingly serve out of love for their Christian brothers, (Ps. 110:3) When you attend assemblies, it is your privilege to volunteer to share in this helpful service- If you are able to do so, you will find that your enjoyment, of the assembly itself will be greatly increased, because, as the Lord Jesus said, “there is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving,”—Acts 20:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">PERSONAL ANU FAMILY STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Having individually dedicated ourselves to Jehovah, we show that we take delight in him and the things he says. We do not feel that it is a burden to study and discuss the Scriptures. These things fill our hearts and minds and, as a result, we seek out opportunities to read the Bible and our Bible-study aids. We are like that person of whom the psalm says: “His delight is in the law of Jehovah, and in his law he reads in an undertone day and night.” (Ps. 1:2) With all our heart we join with the writer of the 119th Psalm, who said to God: “How I do love your law I All day long it is my concern. How smooth to my palate your sayings have been, more so than honey to my mouth] Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway.” (Ps, 119:97, 103, 105) Feeling this way about it, we do not limit our consideration of God’s Word to the time that we are at the Kingdom Hall. Rather, we endeavor to make some time for it every day in our own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If your family is united in the pure worship of Jehovah, you will want to do some of your studying as a family group. The Bible particularly urges parents to feel the responsibility that is theirs to inculcate godly thinking in their oilspring. (Eph. 6:4; Deut. 6:1, 6, 7; Ps. 78:3, 4) What, a blessing to the household when this is done* The family is drawn closer together, and the fruitage of God’s spirit manifest in their lives makes the home a truly happy one. The children get their feet firmly planted on the way that leads to everlasting life, (Prov. 22:6) So, when you sit down to a meal together, you will want to follow the Christian practice of giving thanks to God before you eat. (Matt. 14:19; Acts 27:35: Luke 11:2, 3) And at a meal when you tire all together you will find it most beneficial to take some time to read and discuss the Scripture text and comments for the day provided in the Yearbook </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">of Jehovahfa Witnesses,</span><span class="font23"> if it is available in your language. If you do not have the Yearbook in your tongue, you will find the texts published in </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font23"> Endeavor to bring each member of the family into the discussion. Many families also enjoy reading at tills time some of the experiences found in the </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook,</span><span class="font23"> Such a practice can make mealtime in your home a most pleasant and spiritually upbuilding occasion.—Rom. 14:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Apart from your regular discussion of the day’s text, it is a good thing to have an evening, or other convenient time, set aside for family Bible study. There are many publications available for you to study together. You may want to prepare together for one of the congregation meetings, or you may choose to study something else. Select the material that is most appropriate to the needs of your household. The time to he devoted to such a study on any one occasion Lind the amount of material covered can best be worked out in each family. Take time to look up scriptures together. Discuss points thoroughly so that everyone understands them. Emphasize their value in your everyday lives. If you do, this time spent together each week will be a major contribution to the spiritual growth of your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Of course, it is unlikely that you will do all your reading and studying together. There is also a need to do some on a personal basis, and it has been found that the rate of one’s spiritual development usually bears a direct relationship to his personal study habits. Jehovah God counseled Joshua in ancient times that he needed regular personal study of the Scriptures to succeed as a servant of God. ( Josh. 1:8) The same is true of us today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Some of your personal study will no doubt be preparation for congregation meetings; some will be reading of the Bible and other publications. Lovingly, the <sup>1</sup>'faithful and discreet slave” has provided an abundance of fine material to use. In addition to bound books and booklets, there is Tte Watchtower, which is the principal magazine of Jehovah’s witnesses. 4</span><span class="font25" style="font-style:italic;">wake!,</span><span class="font25"> also published in many languages, reports on world news and helps one to get a theocratic perspective on a wide variety of topics. To the extent that, you are able to read those publications as they are made available, there is a blessing in store for you. Of course, some have more time to read than others; some read faster than others; some can grasp things more quickly than can others. But the Society has supplied ample for everyone. By availing yourself of it, to the extent that your personal circumstances permit, you will be protected against the spirit of the world, strengthened In faith and equipped to be a bet 1 er servant of Jehovah God, —Phil. 4:8; Rom. 12:2.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Your Field Ministry</span></h2>
<p><span class="font25">INETEEN hundred years ago when the C-/ ^&lt;Lord Jesus Christ was a man on earth he provided for us a pattern of the worship that Jehovah God approves. More than once while His Son was on earth, Jehovah spoke out from the heavens in approval of him. Not only did He do this at the time of Jesus’ baptism, but toward the conclusion of Jesus’ earthly ministry God again declared, in the hearing of a group of Jesus’ disciples: “This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved; listen to him/* (Matt, 17:5; 3:17) So it is with keen interest that we take note of what Jesus himself did in Jehovah’s service and what he instructed his followers to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Some months after his immersion in water by John the Baptist, Jesus entered the synagogue in Nazareth, where he had been reared, and read to those there assembled his commission from God, saying: &quot;Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away with a release, to preach Jehovah’s acceptable year.” (Luke 4:16-21; Isa. 61:1, 2) Faithfully he carried out that commission. From city to city and village to village, both in the homes of the people and in public places, he went preaching “the good news of the kingdom of God.” (Luke 8:1; Matt. 9:35) As he went he gave his followers instructions on how to perform the same kind of ministry.—Matt. 10:7, 11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">Then, after his resurrection, Jesus appeared again to his disciples and said to them: “Go there-</span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">70</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">fore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you/* (Matt. 28:19, 20) They appreciated the importance of that work and, even when persecuted, they continued “declaring the good news of the word/* (Acts 8:4) Later, the apostle Paul was also moved by holy spirit to point out how vital this public proclamation of God’s Word is to the preacher himself, saying: “With the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.’* (Rom. 10:10) And of our own day, Jesus foretold: ‘'This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations; and then the end will come/' (Matt. 24: 14) Obviously, those who would do this preaching would be faithful followers of Jesus Christ. So, if you arc a true Christian, that prophetic declaration is your commission as a preacher of the kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If you are a dedicated and baptized Christian, you are an ordained minister of Jehovah God, You did not ordain yourself by vowing to serve God, nor did the one baptizing you ordain you. God’s commission to all those dedicating themselves to do His will is what constitutes your ordination as a minister. While God’s commandment to preach the Kingdom good news is there in the Bible for all to read, it constitutes the ordination only of those who meet his requirements. It may be compared to the issuing of a diploma to a school graduate. While the wording of the diplomas is basically the same, and anyone can read them, what they say does not apply to everyone. One’s name belongs on such a diploma only when he meets the requirements. Likewise, it is after study, dedication and baptism that the commission from God recorded in the Bible constitutes one’s ordination. Of course^ seminary training and written certificates of ordination are not requirements for Scriptural ordination. (John 7:14, 15; Acts 4:13) Rather, ministers ordained by Jehovah God and backed up by his holy spirit produce living letters of recommendation.-—2 Cor. 3:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Your ministry is not something to treat lightly; it should influence your entire life as a Christian. (1 Cor. 10:31) To care for it requires time, but not merely leftover time or time when you do not happen to have anything else to do. God’s Word advises: “Keep strict watch that how you walk is not as unwise but as wise persons, buying out the opportune time for yourselves, because the days are wicked.” (Eph. 5:15, 16) That does not mean that you are to take time away from other Christian responsibilities—-that you are to neglect study of the Bible or attending congregation meetings, or that you arc to fail to perform your Scriptural duties toward your family and then use this time in the field ministry. Balance should be maintained in caring for ah the responsibilities that fall on you as a Christian. In harmony with this, Colossians 4:5 associates our buying out of time with “walking in wisdom toward those on the outside.” Yes, time that was formerly used in worldly associations and activities is what ought to be ^bought out* for Christian service. Also, by better organization of personal affairs you may be able to make more time for the ministry. Just how much time you will be able to spend in the ministry is something that you must decide, but do not leave it to chance. Much more will be accomplished, and with better results, if you schedule regular times each week 10 participate in this most important preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As was true of Jesus Christ, who set the example for us, when you share in this preaching work you will not speak ‘of your own originality.’ (John 7:16-18) Where you can Find a hearing ear, you will want to reason with the householder from the Scriptures. (Acts 17:2-4) Additionally, the Society has published Bibles and printed sermons in books, booklets and magazines. These may be presented to the people so that, when you are not at the home talking to them, they can read and study on their own, using their own Bible to look up the scriptures cited. Tn doing this work Jehovah's witnesses are not salesmen or peddlers. They do not seek to make a financial profit from their distribution of literature. It is simply loft with interested persons for a small contribution sufficient to cover the cost of printing and handling these publications. Many of the persons met in the witnessing work are unable to contribute, and so millions of copies of booklets, magazines and tracts are given away yearly so that these persons, too, can benefit from the message of salvation that they contain. (2 Cor. 2:17) In their use of such literature, Jehovah's witnesses of today are like their early Christian brothers who, according to historians, were pioneers in the use of the codex, or leaf book, for reproducing the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Mo doubt, there will be times when you, like many others, feci inadequate for the work of preaching and teaching the Bible. But, remember, it is not one’s personal ability that qualifies him to be a minister of God. As the apostle Paul reminded the brothers in Corinth: “Our being adequately qualified issues from God,” (2 Cor. 3:4-6) Of far greater importance than any natural ability on your part is your willingness to be used by God. Remember, Moses felt that an impediment of speech disqualified him and Jeremiah said that he was too young, but both of them took up their assignments from God, and how marvelously Jehovah used them! You, too, show yourself to be willing. Regularly attend the meetings that Jehovah has provided to train you. Pray to him for guidance, and you will find great joy in realizing that he is using you and that the power beyond what is normal is from God and not out of yourself.—2 Cor. 4:1, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As you call at the homes of the people, keep in mind the fine counsel that Jesus gave to a group of seventy of his disciples when he sent them out. He said: &quot;‘Wherever you enter into a house say first, &quot;May this house have peace/ And if a friend of peace is there, your peace will rest upon him. But if there is not, it will turn back to you/’ (Luke 10:5, 6) You have a wonderful message, a comforting one, to share with persons who have receptive hearts. Those who are sheeplike will respond to the call of the Fine Shepherd extended through you. (John 10:4, 14-16) Your objective, in harmony with Jesus’ prophetic declaration at Matthew 24:14, is to tell others the good news of the Kingdom &quot;&quot;for a witness/* But w'e have no reason to expect the whole world to be converted as a result of our preaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is always a happifying experience to find people who listen appreciatively to the Kingdom message, and you will no doubt have many such experiences. (Luke 10:1, 17; Acts lt&gt;:3) But the accomplishment of your ministry is not to be measured merely by the number who show interest in the truth of God's Word, nor is it to be measured solely by the amount of literature that you are able to place. Even if those people on whom you call do not accept the good news you bring to them and even if they do not listen to more than a few sentences of w'hat you say, by your very presence at their doors the name of God and the Kingdom message are kept before them. In that way Jehovah's purpose is being accomplished, and you are having a share in it. (Rom. 9:17; Mark 13:10) The very fact that you are regularly participating in the ministry gives evidence of your loving devotion to Jehovah, and this, in turn, makes His heart glad.—1 John 5:3; Prov. 27:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Though people show themselves indifferent or unfriendly, do not hold back from giving them further opportunities to hear. Many who at one time turned away the Witnesses who called at their doors are now grateful for the patient perseverance shown by those publishers who called repeatedly and, as a result, they are now our spiritual brothers and sisters with the prospect of everlasting life. Perhaps you yourself are such a person. Oftentimes, people who do not listen believe that their own religion is right, or they may have become embittered by personal experiences in life, or perhaps they have been told lies about us. It is as the apostle Paul wrote at 2 Corinthians 4:4: “The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.” By kindness on your part, “instructing with mildness those not favorably disposed,” you may be able to help them. As Paul wrote: “Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to an accurate knowledge of truth, and they may come back to their proper senses out from the snare of the Devil.” (2 Tim. 2:24-26) How fine it would be to have a part in teaching such a person, and thus aiding him to become a praiser of Jehovah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Your own personal conduct, both in the field ministry and as you go about other activities of life, can often do much to overcome the prejudice of observers and open their minds to the truth. So, it is vital to watch your speech and your deportment at all times, to be sure that they befit a servant of Jehovah God. (1 Pet. 2:12; 3:1, 2) Your personal appearance when participating in the field service should always bo one of neatness and cleanliness. Your words, too, if always spoken in a kindly way, will favorably impress right-hearted persons. There is no doubt about it; good results will be forthcoming if we always keep in mind the scripture that says: “In no way are we giving any cause for stumbling, that our ministry might not be found fault with; but in every way we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.** —2 Cor. 6:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">No matter where you may live or what the conditions under which you serve, never lose sight of your personal responsibility as a minister of God, (1 Cor. 9:16) Jehovah has had recorded in his Word examples and advice to encourage us to press on even under the most difficult circumstances. It sets a pattern for us to follow. For example, in the book of Acts we learn that, when our Christian brothers were experiencing official persecution, they did not fearfully cease meeting together for worship, though they did take certain precautions to avoid unnecessary difficulties. (Acts 12:1-17) Threatened by government officials, ihey did not agree to cease preaching. (Acts 4:18-20; 5:27-32) When circumstances isolated them from their fellow believers, they did not become inactive. (Acts 8:4) Even when imprisoned, they took advantage of opportunities to preach. (Acts 16:25-34; 28:16-31) Jehovah was always close to them; they could pray to him for his spirit, and so can you.—Luke 11:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The ministry entrusted to us by God is urgent. Timothy, a faithful servant of God, was helped to appreciate that when he was admonished by a member of the early Christian governing body: “I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is destined to judge the living and the dead, and by his manifestation and his kingdom, preach the word, be at it urgently in favorable season, in troublesome season.” (2 Tim. 4:1, 2) How much more urgent it is today, now that the Kingdom is already established and the &quot;last days” of the wicked system of things are coming rapidly to their close! Our “keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah” will stir us to “deeds of godly devotion” in full measure. (2 Pct, 3:11, 12) This is no time for anyone to render to Jehovah merely “token service/' feeling that as long as one spends some time in the field service, that is all that is necessary. It is a time for zeal in the ministry, participating to the full extent that one’s circumstances permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Never Jose sight of the fact that this generation is faced with the impending destruction of Babylon the Great, the world empire or false religion, as well as the Armageddon destruction of ah others who have not taken their stand on Jehovah’s side, (Rev* 18:2-8; 19:11-21) Only ‘those who call on the name of Jehovah will be saved? However, the Scriptures ask: “How will they call on him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith, in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without, someone to preach?” (Hom, 10:13, 14) Yes, the salvation of other people is influenced by your ministry. ( I Tim, 4:16; Ezek. 3:17-21) Even when the people refuse to listen, the urgency of Hie work does not diminish, Repeatedly Jehovah has directed his faithful servants to keep on talking. “You must, speak my words to them, regardless of whether they hear or they refrain,” (Ezck. 2:7; Isa. 6:9) Whether they listen in faith or not, it is our privilege to speak out in behalf of God, to make known his name, to publicize his righteousness and to declare his love. So, with appreciation for what Jehovah has done for you, make your own ministry a reflection of the depth of your love for him.—Isa. 12:4, 5; Ps. 71:14-16; 1 John 4:9-11; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">TERRITORY IN WHICH TO PREACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In order that the ministry may be carried on in an orderly and effective manner, it is both practical and Scriptural for there to be assignments of territory in which to preach. (2 Cor. 10:13; Gal. 2:9) So the Society assigns a certain section of territory to each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses. it is the responsibility of the congregation to see to it that this territory is worked thoroughly Just as many times each year as possible. Al! the territory—-cities, towns and rural areas-—ought to be given regular attention, and this is done under the supervision of the congregation organization. It is hoped that it can all be covered at least every four months. When frequent calls are made, people are moved to give more serious consideration to the Kingdom message and the interest of sheeplike ones can be stimulated more rapidly. For this reason, congregations that cover their territory more frequently are usually the ones that have the greatest, increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To facilitate orderly coverage of the congregation’s territory, it is divided up locally into smaller sections for assignment to service groups and to individual publishers of the Kingdom. If you would like to have one of these sections of territory assigned to you, the magazine-territory servant will be glad to provide it. for you. Although you will probably find that a section close to your home is most convenient, you are welcome to take out one anywhere in the congregation^ territory if someone else does not already have it. This, then, becomes your personal territory, and those who live in it are the ones to whom it is your responsibility to minister. With deep love for Jehovah and loving concern for the sheeplike ones, care for it well.—1 Th ess. 2:8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Endeavor to reach the occupants of every home with the good news, if at all possible. This will call for patient perseverance. First of all, as you work in the territory keep a careful record of every place where people are not at home; then try again at another time. If they still are not at home, you may want to put a tract under their door, but keep on trying to make personal contact. Some publishers* after trying several times without finding anyone at home, write a letter in which they give a witness to the householder; or they may arrange for a publisher who is confined to homo, due to illness or ago, to write such letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In addition to private homes, there may be apartments, business establishments and other buildings in your territory. Call on them all* If you cannot get into certain apartments, ask the doorman if you may leave handbills or tracts with him for each of the occupants; or perhaps you can copy down their names and write them personal letters. At convenient times, arrange to call at stores and other business establishments in your territory* The owner may be someone that you will seldom find at his home: and, with his permission, you may be able to talk briefly with his employees loo. As you work through your territory again and again, be alert to observe where more than one family lives in a house and where rooms are rented. Keep in mind, too, that there are usually a number of persons in each household, and by working the territory at different times or on different days you may be able to meet various members of the family. Recognizing that the message you carry means life to those who embrace it, be diligent to give everyone in your territory the opportunity to hear it.—John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Before you work a seel ion of territory, always be sure that it has been assigned to you. This will help to avoid confusion, as well as needless irritation of householders, and will result in consistent coverage of all the congregation’s assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">GROUP WITNESSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">For those who would like to share in the field ministry along with other publishers, the congregation also makes ample provision. Every location where congregation meetings are held is viewed as a rendezvous for field service. Not only the Kingdom Hall but all the places where congregation book studies are held are locations where you can meet with other publishers at. various times to go out in group witnessing. For this reason the locations where congregation book studies are held are known as rendezvous for service. Since the one with which you are associated is probably near your home, it will no doubt save travel time for you to work with that group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Your congregation book study servant will endeavor to arrange for group witnessing at times that are convenient for those associated with the study group. From time to time he may talk to those of you in the group to see just what, time you have available that you would like to use for group witnessing, and perhaps some can adjust their schedules to coincide with those of others in order to help them. If some can share in service for an hour or so before the book study, he will be glad to arrange for it. Perhaps several arc able to go out another night, whether from house to house, making back-calls or conducting home Bible studies; if so, your local book study servant will be glad to make arrangements, even though not everyone is able to do so. Likewise, provision can be made for a group to meet on certain weekdays, if that fits their needs. So, too, many may be able to go out in the field ministry on weekends, while that may not he possible for others. These arrangements for group witnessing are for your convenience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The circumstances of the household where the service rendezvous is located should also be considered. The congregation book studies are usually located at homes where it is possible for the group to meet at certain regular times foi' service. But there may be times when some get together for service that it would be better to meet in another location, and that can certainly be arranged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Sometimes when there are only a very few who can share in the service at a particular time, the congregation overseer may arrange to combine several service groups, if this docs not make it inconvenient as far as travel is concerned. On special occasions, as a stimulus to the eongrega-1 ion, he may even arrange for everyone to meet for service at the Kingdom Hall, though this is not done on any regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Local conditions govern the time that it is suitable to begin calling at homes in the territory. Since the habits of the people are not the same everywhere, and the congregation overseer is well acquainted with the way of life of people in the area, he can decide when it is best for the group to start witnessing from door to door. In some parts of the earth it is possible to engage in field service very early in the day, since that is when people do their work, before it gets too hot. In many localities it is all right to start, earlier on weekdays than on Sundays, and that may be done if the circumstances of the publishers also make it possible. But good judgment should always be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When you meet with the group for service, by all means put forth a diligent effort to be on time. Usually there is a brief discussion that is designed to help equip you for the service to be done, and you will not want to miss it. At most morning meetings for service (and sometimes, at afternoon meetings), the one serving as chairman of the group will conduct a helpful discussion of the day’s text. Then there will be comments on how to</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">32 </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">“your word is a lamp* to my foot” </span><span class="font23">approach the people in the territory, what to say, how to overcome objections, how to present the literature or start. Bible studies, or something else of practical value in connection with the work that the group will be doing. At times there may be encouraging experiences related. Arrangements will also be made so that everyone knows where he is to work. Of course, it is always appropriate to ask Jehovah's blessing on our efforts to serve him, and this is done before the meeting for service is dismissed. This entire program is usually limited to fifteen minutes, and then you will want to get into the territory just as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If the group meets for service at. night, when time is limited, or immediately following a regular congregation meeting, a shorter session is ordinarily arranged. But service arrangements for those in the group are made and prayer is offered, provided they gather at a place where this is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The book study servant will always hold territory in which you can work. Generally this will be reasonably close to the service rendezvous, because it will save travel time and make it convenient to follow’ through on any interest located. So, when you meet with the group for service, you can obtain from him a portion of territory that is sufficient for the day. Take the same keen interest in covering it thoroughly as you would in your own personal territory, but be sure to let your book study servant know how much you cover, because he is responsible to see that, it is all worked before it is turned back to the magazine-territory servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If there arc quite a number that gather for service at certain times, the book study servant may divide them into two or three smaller groups and ask one to take charge of each group. Should you be requested to care for such a group from time to time, bear in mind that more is involved than simply leading them to the territory. Much</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">of the effectiveness of the work will depend on your oversight. If possible, assign sufficient territory to the individuals in the group to keep them busy for the entire lime that they plan to share in the house-to-house work, so they will not have to stand around waiting for a further assignment. In localities where territory is scattered, perhaps you can arrange for just a few to work in the sparsely settled area while the others concentrate on the more densely populated sections. If some of the service time is going to be spent making back-calls, be sure that this is also well organized. Some may have calls that, need to be made early, and plan to join in the house-to-house work later. Others may plan to make back-calls after their house-to-house activity. Inquii'e ahead of time as to their plans so that you can cooperate with them. Remember, too, that your zealous example, staying out in the service for the full lime period that has been planned, will encourage the others to do the same.—1 Pet. 5:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Group witnessing is especially beneficial for those who are new publishers of Ute Kingdom, as it gives them opportunity to go with someone else for training. This makes it possible for them to observe how experienced ones carry on the ministry and to receive helpful counsel and suggestions as they walk along between houses. Jesus set the example in this, providing personal training for his apostles; and, later, when he sent out seventy othei' disciples Io preach, he arranged for them to work two by two for a time. (Luke 8:1; 10:1) In the years that followed, the Christian congregation continued to appreciate the importance of training those who joined their ranks. (Eph. 4:11, 12) If you feel the need for such training, do not hesitate to ask for it- The congregation overseer is keenly interested in seeing that all new publishers are properly trained in the ministry, and he will be glad to arrange for you to go along in the service with one of the mature ministers. Your congregation book study servant will also be pleased to help. In fact, since he is right there in the service rendezvous with which you associate, he will gladly arrange for you to work with someone else for training whenever you want to benefit from the assistance available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As you receive training in the ministry, apply yourself earnestly to make progress, knowing that it will enable you to be a more effective praiscr of Jehovah. Prepare well before you go out in the service; and when you have an appointment Io work with another publisher, be sure to show appreciation for it by being there. When you learn to do one feature of the service well, seek training in the others too. Work toward the goal of being qualified to assist in training others; you will find added joy when you are able to share in this line privilege of service*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even when you become an experienced publisher, you may want to work a few doors with another capable publisher on occasion, with a view io improving the effectiveness of your ministry. But, unless instruction is being given to one who desires help, those who are able to go io the doors alone usually find that much more can be accomplished in this way in 1hc time that they have available for service. They are encouraged as they see other publishers working across the street or down the block from them, but they know that more can be done when they go to the doors by themselves. Nevertheless, at night and in dangerous neighborhoods it may bo wise for two publishers to work very dose to each olher or in pairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">So there are advantages to be had tn group witnessing. When you find it convenient to work with a group, it will be mutually upbuilding. On the other hand, there may be times when you will find that it is advantageous to work alone, and it is quite all right to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">PREACHING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The principal means by which “this good news of the kingdom” is being “preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations” is house-to-house preaching. (Matt. 24:14) Jesus Christ and his apostles set the example for us in this. Having been instructed by Jesus in the best ways to carry out the ministry, the apostles kept up their house-to-house preaching after the holy spirit carne_upon them at Pentecost, 33 C.E. Of them, Acts 5:42 reports: ‘'Every day in the temple and from house to house they continued without letup teaching and declaring the good news about the Christ, Jesus.” Years later, the apostle Paul reminded mature Christian brothers from Ephesus of the work that he had done in their city, saying: “I di ci not hold back from telling you any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.” (Acts 20:20) Even today this remains the most effective manner of accomplishing the work. It enables you to come into personal contact with individuals, answer their questions and explain the truth in a way that will be most understandable to them. This is a type of work that fits the capabilities of each one of us, because it involves talking to Just one or two persons at a time, and, at the same time, it is the best way to be sure that no one hungering and thirsting for righteousness is overlooked.—Matt* 5:6*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When you start out in the house-to-house work, it is always wise to have something definite in mind to say to the people you meet. It may be Just one scripture that you plan to read and discuss, or there may be two or three texts that you arc able to tie together in a presentation that is easy to give and easy for others to understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font23"> regularly offers helpful suggestions. When Jesus preached he emphasised the fact that “the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near,*' because he, the king, was there among the people. (Matt. 4:17) In our day, too, he said that the Kingdom message would be preached, and appropriately so, because that heavenly government of God is already in operation. So it is always proper to discuss with people how God’s kingdom ailccts their lives and the blessings that it will bring to those who put faith in it. Furthermore, at the conclusion of Jesus’ earthly ministry he reported to his Father that he had made the name of God known, and it is appropriate for you, too, as one of Jehovah’s witnesses, to make the name of Jehovah prominent bv means of vour preaching. &lt;—John 17:6; Isa. 43:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To be most effective in your ministry, it is good to learn to be flexible in your presentation. For example, if you observe that there are children in the home, show an interest in them and point out the importance of teaching them the Bible while they are still young. (Matt. 18:2, 3; 19: 13-15) If someone has suffered severely due to illness, show why this has been mankind’s experience and how the Kingdom will remedy it. (John 9:1-3; Rev. 21:4; Isa. 35:5, 6) When you see evidence that a household is religiously inclined, it may be that you can use this as a springboard to stimulate interest in the message of the Bible. (Acts 17:22-31) In some cases you may find that the particular subject that you had in mind discussing does not appeal to a certain householder, but his remarks may give you a clue as to where his interest does lie. If you have learned several short sermons oh a variety of themes, you may be able to adapt to the circumstances and continue the discussion, but along somewhat different lines.—1 Cor. 9:20-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Generally you will want to open the Bible and read from it to those you meet, because this impresses others with the fact that the message is not of our own originality but from God. However, among people who do not accept the Bible as God’s Word, you may have to talk a little first to help them to see why it is beneficial to consider what the Bible says. In some places publishers find that they are able to accomplish more if they simply carry on a friendly conversation with people, quoting or paraphrasing scriptures in a natural way, and not taking out the Bible actually to read from it until the household er is in a sufficiently receptive frame of mind. Regardless of the method used, though, it is to God’s Word the Bible that we always direct attention. —1 Thess. 2:13; 2 Tim, 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">How long you talk at each door will have to be determined by the circumstances. In some parts of the earth people always seem to be in a great hurry, and they may not manifest much interest; so your presentation may at times be limited to just a minute or two. But even in that length of time you may, in a kindly way, be able to say something that will start the householder to thinking. At other times perhaps you can talk for five or ten minutes, or even longer, if they show keen interest or have questions that they want to have answered. Nevertheless, be careful not to stay so long that they will hesitate to invite you in on another occasion. Of course, when you call on someone who is sincerely busy and asks to be excused, it is considerate to be brief in what you say and perhaps to arrange to call again later in the day, or at some other convenient time. The customs of the people among whom you work will also influence the length of your calls. If the people are by nature hospitable and expect to exchange a few friendly comments about the weather before discussing the purpose of your call, you will probably find more hearing ears if you do not ignore the custom. At the same time, keep in mind that your time is valuable, and do not stay unnecessarily long with those who really have no interest, in God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To assist you in the ministry, the Society provides printed material—Bibles, books, booklets, magazines and tracts—to be left with interested persons. Fool free to use any of these items, at any time, to aid others to learn the truth. Of course, each month a suggestion is made in </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font23"> as to the literature offer to be featured in the field service, and it is beneficial to follow this suggestion. The Society’s printing plants are geared to provide you with this literature at the time designated, and the service meeting program is specially arranged to aid you to handle it effectively, The information in the literature being featured is vital for the public, and we want to make it available to everyone possible. However, when you meet someone who already has this literature, or some other circumstances make it advisable, do not hesitate to make good use of the other publications that have been provided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As you call from house to house, it is recommended that you keep a careful record both of those who are not al home and of those who manifest interest. Then call back, Remember, as Jesus instructed his apostles, when you carry on your ministry in a territory you arc to “search out who in it is deserving” so that you can spend further time with them to build up their faith and aid them to be numbered among those who make known the greatness of our God.—Matt. 10:11; Ps. 145:6; Deut, 32:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It may be that sometime in your house-to-house work someone will ask you for an identification. As far as any authorization to do the work is concerned, this you have from God, as we have already seen from the Scriptures, and we do not ask men for permission to do God's work, (Acts 5:27-32) However, a simple identification card signed by the congregation overseer is helpful at times, and this can be obtained on request. Such cards are issued to any dedicated and baptized publisher who regularly engages in house-to-house witnessing and is able to call at homes by himself and give an effective witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">tiac</span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;"> H-C xnns</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When, in the house-to-house work, you find someone who manifests interest in the Scriptures, it is wise to call back on that person. Your commission, as stated by Jesus, is to &quot;make disciples of people . . . teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) That cannot possibly be accomplished on just one visit. It requires repeated calls to cultivate the interest, clear out obstacles and aid the newly interested ones to get a firm grip on the Word of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The making of back-calls should be a prominent part of your ministry, and you will find that, if you regularly participate in the house-to-house work and keep a careful record of those who show interest, you will always have back-calls to make. Some, while refusing to take literature for various reasons, may listen to what you say and show interest in the Scriptures. Why not call back and see if you can further that interest? Others may accept only a tract, but some fine home Bible studies have been started as a result of following through on such calls. When a subscription for </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font23"> or Zimfce? is obtained, it is always advantageous to call back and deliver the current issue, until the magazine starts to come through the mail, and to use this opportunity to talk a little more about the kingdom of God. Ukewise, if a name has been received by the congregation with the request that someone call, and this information is turned over to you, faithfully give it your attention, Back-calls should also be made on all who accept books, booklets or magazines, because they have manifested a willingness to give further consideration to the things about which you talked. It is true that a few of these persons may have shown only slight interest, but what they read may change their entire viewpoint, “The word of God is alive and exerts power/* and it is that word that is discussed in all the literature that we offer in our ministry. (Ileb. 4:12) There are many persons who showed only a little interest at first who are now zealous publishers—because someone called back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Keep in mind that we arc endeavoring to search out those who manifest jsheeplike qualities and aid them to get into the fold, where they can enjoy the loving care of our Great Shepherd Jehovah God and his Fine Shepherd Jesus Christ. (Kzek. 34:11-14, 31; John 10:11, 16; Rev. 7:16, 17) When a shepherd locates a lost sheep, hurt and hungry, he does not leave it unattended, content simply that he knows where it is. He gives it tender personal care, providing it with food and water just as soon as possible, to build up its strength. Our concern for these potential praisers of Jehovah will move us to care for them just as diligently.—Matt. 9:36-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">After you locate someone in the territory who displays sheeplike qualities, it is usually beneficial to call again soon—if possible, within a week. In this way you may be able to keep alive the interest that was shown on your earlier call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When you make your back-calls, be friendly and natural. Rather than giving an extended speech, allow the householder opportunity to share in the conversation. Do not feel that you have to know the answer to every question that people may ask; you arc simply there to share with them good things that you have learned.—Mark 5:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Of course, you will accomplish the most good on your calls if you have in mind something definite to say. By way of preparation you might locate a few more scriptures on the topic that interested the householder on your previous visit. Bor some calls, you could select a few paragraphs in one of the Society’s publications that you would like to read and discuss together. Then, as you cover the information with the householder, suggest that he get his own Bible, if he has one, and look up the references with you. Generally this makes a very favorable impression, as he may be surprised to see the things that you are saying right in his copy of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At first the people on whom you call may listen somewhat passively to what you say; but when they start asking questions, it is wise to realize that those questions arc the key to their interest in continued discussions. If you know the Scriptural answers, do not hesitate to change from your prepared presentation to answer them. And if they ask something that you are not equipped to handle then, simply tell them that you will see what you can find out about it and will discuss it when you call again. Patiently help them to realize that the problems and questions that they are most concerned about in life are answered in the Bible. In time you may be able to conduct a regular home Bible study with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">You will often find that considerable patience is required to stimulate a person’s spiritual growth. (Jas. 5:7) He may be disillusioned by the hypocrisy of the false religious leaders and, for that reason, somewhat skeptical even of your reason for calling. On the other hand, he may encounter pressure from acquaintances and relatives to turn him away from the truth. Others may be so busy trying to satisfy material wants and needs that they cannot seem to find time to sit down and lib-ci/iss the Set ir iijo With your patient care., it may be that these obstacles can be cleared away so that the person can begin to grow spiritually. In this work it is our privilege to be fellow workers with God; for while it is our assignment to plant and water, it is God who causes growth.—1 Cor. 3:6-9; Luke 8:11-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">For your participation in this important work to be most productive of good results, you will find it beneficial 1o share in it on a regular basis. It is suggested that you set aside some of your service time each week to call back on interested persons that you have already located. If you are working in the same territory week after week, whether alone or with a group, you will find it convenient to make these calls, because they will be right in the vicinity where you are working. Some may choose to make their calls during the daytime; others find that they get good results in the evening. You may share in this work at any time that is convenient. But do not leave it to chance; plan your back-call activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">home ribi.f: studies</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If you are diligent in the field service, showing keen interest in those to whom you preach, in time you will probably have the joy of conducting a home Bible study. This is the foremost means by which persons are aided to come to an accurate knowledge of the truth. It is God’s will that all kinds of men gain such knowledge, and you can have a part in helping them to do so. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) As those with whom you study progress in spiritual growth and their lives begin to change, your heart will overflow with gratitude to Jehovah for the privilege of having part in such a work. And when they become devoted servants of God along with you, you will feel as did the apostle Paul, who said to some persons that he had helped to learn the Word of God: “What is our hope or joy or crown of exultation—why, is it not in fact you?— ... You certainly are our glory and joy.”—1 Thcss. 2:13, 19, 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Make it your goal to conduct at least one home Bible study each week. If you have children with whom you can conduct such a study, by all means do so. But, in addition to that, endeavor to arrange for a study with someone in another household, so that he, too., can benefit from the good things that you are able to share with him. Of course, if you are able to care for more than one study, then you will find that your rewards of joy will increase acco rd j ngly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Bible studies can be started in a variety of ways. Many publishers have had good results in starting studies when making their very first call on a person, in house-to-house work. They simply say that their purpose in calling is to assist their neighbors to understand the Bible and that they would be pleased to study the Bible with the householder or the entire family at a convenient time each week at no cost. Others give a sermon first, and then, if interest is manifested, offer to demonstrate how to make a study of the Scriptures both informative and enjoyable. Frequently studies are started when a back-call is made, simply by using the Society’s publications, along with the Bible, as a source of answers to the householders' questions. At first the person may not even realize that he is having a home Bible study; he just enjoys the fine Bible discussions. In many parts of the world it is necessary to make a number of calls, discussing a variety of topics and answering questions, before it is possible to get down to a regular study. The important thing is to help the interested person to spend some time on a regular basis discussing God’s Word. If at all possible, when you get a study started, arrange for it- to be held each week for a full hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">What publication will you use for your study? Do not hesitate to start with any chapter or any article in any of the Society’s publications, if that is what is needed to hold the interest of the householder. If you find that you personally are better able to use the presentation of a topic as set out in one of the publications than you are another, that is all right. They have all been prepared for your use. With some persons it is necessary to use just their Bible for several weeks to win their confidence before you direct their attention to the study aids provided by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. Others readily accept the use of the Society’s publications along with the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There is no arbitrary ruling as to how the study should be conducted, but be sure that the student really understands the points discussed. We recommend that you urge the student to study the lesson before you come, perhaps even demonstrating how to do this. In this way it will be possible to ask the questions on the paragraphs, look up the scriptures that are cited, and then read the material in the paragraph as a summary. When the study is new, you may And it beneficial to look up all the scriptures, whether they are quoted in the publication or not. In this way you focus principal attention on the Bible itself. But after a short time, it should bo possible simply to discuss what the texts quoted in the paragraphs say, while looking up those that are cited but not quoted. This will enable you to make greater headway. Right from the start it is certainly appropriate for you to seek Jehovah’s blessing regularly before you go to conduct the study. However, you will have to determine when the student is properly adjusted religiously to show him the importance of prayer to Jehovah through Christ in connection with the study. Then it would be appropriate to open your study each week with prayer, asking Jehovah’s blessing, and to conclude with a prayer of thanksgiving for the fine things learned,—Ps. 25:4; Jas. 1:5; Eph. 5:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As we have already noted, it is our privilege to be “fellow workers** with God by sharing in the ministry. The apostle Paul had a prominent share in such work. He was called to be an heir of the heavenly kingdom with Christ, and he was used in gathering and preparing others for that high calling. He did not. teach in such a way as to draw attention to himself or cause others to look to him as their leader. (1 Cor. 1:13-15; 2:1-5; 3:5-7; Matt. 23:10) He always directed attention to Jehovah God and to His provision for salvation through His Son Jesus Christ. In harmony with God’s declared will, he laid Christ as a foundation by teaching the truth about him and aiding others to make belief in that truth part of their own lives. Furthermore, he stressed that building that was done on that foundation ought to be of fire-resistant materials, with characteristics like those of gold, silver and precious stones. That is, durable Christian qualities had to be built into the individual being instructed in God’s Word; otherwise, all that spiritual building work would be destroyed when subjected to fiery trial. (1 Cor. 3:10-15) Surely no one would want that to happen to his work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those same principles of building that applied to the work done by Paul and his associates in connection with prospective members of the body of Christ also apply to the work in which you are privileged to share today. Those that you teach need more than to be able to answer certain questions on basic doctrinal matters. Rather, as Paul wrote to those whom he had taught: <sup>4</sup>‘You should be made new in the force actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loyalty?’ (Eph. 4:23, 24) Gaining accurate knowledge is a necessary part of putting on</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">this new personality with its many durable qualities. The needed changes just do not take place when a person does not understand a matter clearly. So, patiently explain matters to those with whom you study and draw them out with questions to be sure they understand*-—Col. 3:10*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As you study with them, help them to see the Scriptural reasons for things that are said* Encourage them to incorporate scriptures in their answers and to seek out Bible principles when decisions must be made* In this way inculcate deep regard foi' Scriptural principles and reliance on Jehovah God.—Prov. 3:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When reading Bible accounts that draw attention to either desirable or undesirable qualities, emphasize Jehovah’s view of the situation. Patiently endeavor to cultivate a desire on their part to be pleasing to Jehovah in everything.—Ps, 19:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Rather than endeavoring simply to cover a large amount of material Lit each home Bible study, pause at appropriate points to build appreciation. (Ps. 27:4) In that way you build up the spiritual heart of both yourself and the ones that you are teaching. (Prov. 4:23) As opportunity affords, highlight the grand qualities of Jehovah God as manifest in his works and purposes, so helping the students to draw closer to God. Inculcate deep respect for Jehovah’s wisdom so that they will readily respond to the direction of his Word. Magnify his justice, to fortify them against the onslaughts of skeptics* Help them to know Jehovah as one who loves his servants and cares for them and to whom they can turn with confidence* (1 John 4:10; Matt, 6:25-34) In this way work toward developing in them a strong feeling of devotion and loyalty toward Jehovah. If they truly know Jehovah and love his ways, they will never forsake his service or become indifferent about his will for them.—1 Chron, 28:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Something else that they need to be taught, a little at a time, is appreciation for Jehovah’s organization. This can be done in a natural way, because when you talk about the things that you have been doing and enjoying, you will be telling them about the congregation meetings, assemblies, and so forth. Gradually explain to them how the organization functions. When considering various aspects of the organization, you may want to emphasize the Scriptural reason for things; on another occasion, you may stress how a certain thing marks Jehovah's people as different from the world; at other times you may highlight the great joy that we find in doing Jehovah’s will. There may be times when you discuss something about the organization before your study, or perhaps afterward. On certain weeks the study material itself may give rise to additional remarks about the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As soon as it seems to be appropriate, invite the newly interested ones to go along with you to the congregation book study or other congregation meetings. To put them at ease, you might explain in advance how the meeting is conducted, that no collections are taken and that they will not be called on to say anything unless they want to raise their hand and offer a comment. When they respond to your invitation, introduce them to others at the meeting and make them feel welcome. At the Kingdom Hall, explain the congregation activity and progressively acquaint them with the servants and the services that they perform. Do not be satisfied with merely telling them a little about the organization. Over a period of time, put forth an earnest effort to help them to know it well, to appreciate it as Jehovah’s and to feel gratitude lor the privilege of associating with it and having a share in its activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As you study together week after week, keep in mind that the home Bible study is not the end in itself. It has as its purpose the producing of additional praisers of Jehovah God- So the students need to be helped to think in terms of using what they learn. As Proverbs 4:7 says: “Wisdom is the prime thing. Acquire wisdom/* Wisdom, here referred to, is the ability to use knowledge in a right way. In tactful ways direct attention to such right use of what is being learned. You may spend a little extra time discussing scriptures that refer to the preaching work. Some questions might be phrased in such a way that the student is made to think in terms of explaining the matter to his friends. Perhaps you will relate some of your own held experiences or read some fitting ones from the </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font23"> at times. When they attend the congregation meetings, they will hear more discussion of the field service and arrangements that are made for it. Gradually their desire to share in this grand privilege of service will grow, and, when they qualify to go along in the field service, it can be your happy privilege to instruct them in this too.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In determining how long to continue studying with a person, you must consider the circumstances. At first some householders may welcome you largely because they like to have you visit with them, and not because of keen interest in the truth. But this friendliness may open the way for them to see and appreciate God’s loving purposes. However, if, after a time, the person does not manifest any real progress, then it may be that you could spend the time more advantageously on other calls. On the other hand, if the householder gives evidence of appreciation of the things being learned, and shows some measure of progress, you will want to continue to help him to grow in knowledge, in love and in appreciation of the privilege of serving Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">(Phil, 1:9-11) Help him to become a mature Christian. Even after he starts out in ihc field service, yes, even after dedication and baptism, it is usually advisable to continue the study for a time until he gets well established in the way of the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The I-.ord Jesus, shortly before returning to his Father in heaven, emphasized the importance of this kind, personal attention to persons with sheeplike traits. He spoke of those whom he called “lambs” and &quot;little sheep/’ persons whose spiritual growth was just beginning, and urged that they be tenderly cared for, as a shepherd cares for the young in his Hock. By a series of three questions to the apostle Peter, Jesus impressed the point that willingness to share in this activity is in reality a demonstration of our love for Christ—John 21:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Who qualifies to share in this feature of service? You do! Remember, God docs not give us the whole job to do ourselves. He simply invites us to be his fellow workers. We plant and water, but it is God who makes it grow. Even if you have much education and can speak persuasively, this will not make persons whose hearts are not right accept the good news. On the other hand, publishers with very limited worldly education have studied with well-read persons, and with good results. Their very willingness to conduct such a study, along with their obvious sincerity and love for God, has deeply impressed right-hearted householders, w<sup>r</sup>ho, as a result, have joined them in making known Jehovah’s praises. Publishers who are physically blind conduct studies by having the householder or another publisher do the reading- Some even study with persons who read another language, having the householder do all the reading and then discussing the points together to the extent possible. They appreciate the importance of aiding others to learn the truth now, while there is yet time. They are wiZZing to serve Jehovah in this way. Are you? Then you, too, can have a share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">MA G AZIN K DlSTRIIJI T1OX</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Another method of preaching the good news of the Kingdom is through the distribittion of the magazines </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font23"> and Aww</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">ke!</span><span class="font23"> This activity accomplishes much good. It enables us to get the Kingdom message into the hands of those who have even limited interest. Though they may not listen to a sermon at the door, and they may not want a largei' piece of literature, they are often willing to accept the magazines with their short articles. And what about others in the home who pick them up? Although we may never have met them personally to give a witness, the magazines can help to do the job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Hie Watchtower</span><span class="font23"> faithfully directs the attention of all who read it toward Jehovah’s kingdom. Each issue contains articles that are designed to be specially appealing and beneficial to the public, as well as material for more advanced Bible students. </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!,</span><span class="font23"> which is also published in many languages, is designed with a broad coverage of practical and informative articles that often appeal to persons who are not inclined to read our other publications. Tactfully it helps them to appreciate how Bible principles should affect one’s view’ on all the various matters of life and it stimulates their desire for more Bible knowledge. Both magazines have aided many persons to break free from the bondage in which Satan holds mankind. —2 Tim. 2:24-26; 1 John 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If possible, spend some time in the distribution of the magazines each week. You will find it beneficial, and most productive of good results, to have a regular time set aside for this activity. Your congregation no doubt features this work as the principal activity one day a week, and you may be able to participate in it then. If not, feel free to do it at any convenient time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When engaging in this feature of service, you will find that a very brief presents! ion is usually sufficient. Simply draw attention to an article that you believe will specially appeal to the individual and then offer the magazines on the regular contribution. Often your presentation will be less than a minute in length. But, of course, our goal is not simply the placement of magazines; we are searching for the &quot;sheep,” and, if someone shows keen interest, you may want to talk a little more and then arrange for a back-call.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Magazines may be distributed by calling from house to house, as well as by malting brief calls at business places and approaching people on the street. Why, anytime that you are walking from one place to another or shopping or waiting for a bus, you may offer the current magazines to the people you meet. Additionally, when engaging in any other feature of the service, magazines may be offered, and to good advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is a good idea to call back on those who obtain magazines from you. Especially where unusual interest was found on the first call is it wise to return soon to cultivate that, interest by Bible discussion. Many fine home Bible studies have developed from return calls on magazine placements. Return visits on others who accepted the magazines, perhaps in two weeks with the new issues, will also be appreciated by some of them, and in this way you can develop a regular magazine route. Your share in distributing the magazines will help to keep the Kingdom message prominently before the people in your territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">OTHER WITNESSING</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Being a minister of God, you will want to be ready and willing at all times to share a knowledge of his grand purposes with others. This is something’ that can be done, not only when you arc in the house-to-house work or some other regular feature of the ministry, but at any time. When traveling on trains and buses, during lunch time at work or school, when deliverymen and others call at your door and when you meet a neighbor in the garden, there arc golden opportunities to give a witness. You may want to carry some Bible tracts with you for use on such occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Do not forget your relatives. They, too, need the Kingdom hope. When Andrew of Bcfhsaida learned the identity of the Messiah, the first one that he told about it was his brother Simon. (John 1:35-42) Later, when Simon Peter was sent to give a witness to Cornelius in Caesarea, he found that Cornelius had enthusiastically “called together his relative's and intimate friends/’ and they, too, accepted the truth. (Acts 10:24, 44) How fine it would be if you could help some of your relatives in a similar way!</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In witnessing to others while going about the customary activities of life Jesus set a fine example, When pausing for water at a well in Samaria, he used a woman’s question as an opening for a fine discussion of spiritual matters, and quite a number from that vicinity believed in him as a result. (John 4:5-42) In your everyday life, too, you will find that others frequently raise sincere questions or express concern about world conditions, and you can follow through by pointing to the Bible’s high moral standard and the Kingdom hope. Furthermore, if you talk freely about the meetings you attend<sub>T</sub> the student talks you give, the things you read, and so forth, this may bring a response and open the way to discuss other spiritual matters. You will find that your personal acquaintances and reftatives are usually more willing to discuss matters freely with you than with a Witness they do not know who knocks on their door. Use this opening to good advantage, and for their lasting benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Aged and infirm publishers,, and even those who may simply be con fined to their homes for a few days due to illness, can do a great deal of preaching by means of the telephone, letter writing and talking with the people who visit them. If our hearts are full and overflowing with appreciation for the good things that God has done, it will not be difficult to find opportunities to talk.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Reporting Your Field Ministry</span></h3>
<p><span class="font28">T</span><span class="font23">HE Society, as well as the local congregation, is keenly interested in knowing what is being accomplished in the field ministry month by month and year by year. Such a record provides encouragement to all of us, it serves as a guide in providing spiritual aid to those who need it and it makes possible the orderly oversight of the preaching work. (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 8:14; 2 Cor. 10: 13) So we request that all of Jehovah’s witnesses make weekly reports to their congregation of what they have done by way of preaching the good news to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At the Kingdom Hall you can get. a supply of report slips, designed for you to make a daily note of your preaching activity. At the end of each week, total the figures on it and put. it in the report box that is provided. When making out your reports, have the following points in mind:</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">‘‘Books**: In this column on the report slip show the total number that you personally placed with any persons who are not baptized witnesses of Jehovah, as well as with any who, although baptized, have not reported field service for at least six months. Count all books printed by the Society, including Bibles* (If you occasionally provide some literature to another congregation publisher for distribution in the field service, this should not be included in your report.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“Booklets”: Total number placed with persons who are not baptized witnesses of Jehovah, as well as with any who, although baptized, have not reported field service for at least six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“Hours in Field Service”: Timo spent preaching God's Word to persons who are not baptized witnesses of Jehovah, counting from when you personally make your first call in the territory until you leave your last call. If two publishers are working together, both may count the time, as long as both share in giving the witness. Time used in giving a witness to those who visit your home or to people at any other place may be included in your report. Time spent writing letters to give a witness concerning God’s kingdom may also be counted. Additionally, time may be reported when it is spent in conducting a home Bible study with one's own unbaptized children or when it is used for giving instruction to anyone else who, though he may share in Held service, has not yet been baptized. The same is true of time spent in actually conducting a home Bible study with another publisher who, even though baptized, is </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">both</span><span class="font23"> irregular in field service (missing entire months in field service) and seldom attends congregation meetings. Likewise, time spent in making calls on anyone who, though baptized, has not reported field service for at least six months may be counted as hours in the field service if God's Word is discussed and the person is encouraged to come back to meetings. (This time spent in teaching baptized persons, when circumstances require it, may be reported until such time as they again report field service for two consecutive months and start attending meetings.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Public speakers may count the time spent in actually delivering any public talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“New IVafcfttower and jlwafce/ Subscriptions”: Total number obtained as new subscriptions from persons who are not baptized witnesses of Jehovah, as well as from any who, although baptized, have not reported field service for at least six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“Individual Magazines”: Total number placed with persons who are not baptized witnesses of Jehovah, as well as with any who, although baptized, have not reported field service for at least six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“Hack-Calls”: Total number of return calls on persons who are not baptized witnesses of Jehovah but who previously showed some interest in the Kingdom message that you gave them or whose name you were given with the request that you make the call to stimulate further interest. The person who previously showed the interest should be contacted and an effort made to further that one’s interest in God’s Word, Even if the call is quite brief, either because the person is no longer interested or because it is not a convenient time for him to invite you in, it may be reported. The visit should have been made with the intention of making a back-call. If two publishers go together, only one will report the back-call. Back-calls may also be reported when a letter is written to give a further witness to a person who has already responded to the Kingdom message, or when the additional witness is given over the telephone. The call may likewise be counted if you deliver to an interested person a piece of literature, as on a magazine route, or if you call an unbaptized person on the phone to invite him to a meeting or stop at his home to take him with you to a congregation meeting. If you call on an unbaptized publisher to invite that one to go in the service with you or to take him along in service with you that day, it may be reported as a back-call, since the one on whom you are calling is not yet an ordained minister. A back-call is to be reported each time you conduct a home Bible study with anyone who is not yet baptized, and with any who, even though baptized, are bot/t irregular in field service (missing entire months in field service) and seldom attend congregation meetings. Back-calls may also be counted for calls made to give spiritual assistance to persons who, although baptized, have not reported field service for at least six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">“Bible Study Report’*: At the end of each month please fill out a Bible Study Report for every study conducted, whether with an individual or a family group. Always include yourself as the conductor in the attendance figure. New studies are not to be reported in this way until they have been held twice after the call on which the study arrangement was first demonstrated, or a total of three times, and there is reason to believe that the study will continue. Studies conducted with anyone who is not a baptized witness of Jehovah should be reported until he is baptized. There may also be persons who, although baptized, seldom come to the congregation meetings </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font23"> are irregular in reporting any field service (missing entire months in field service); or perhaps they have become inactive, reporting no field service for at least six months. If you can start a regular study with such a person, you may include this activity in your report of field service. You may report both the home Bible study and the time spent in conducting the study, helping the person to get restored to Jehovah’s organization. Such a study may be reported until such time as the person again goes out in the field service for two consecutive months and starts to attend meetings. After this, of course, it is wise to continue to encourage the individual to keep feeding on the spiritual food provided at congregation meetings, and more personal assistance may be needed, but you will no longer report the home Bible study even though you continue to conduct it for a while longer because of your loving concern for your dedicated brother or sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Obviously, these reports of your field service do not include everything that you do as a minister of God. For example, your personal study, attending of meetings, visiting the sick and needy, studying with newly baptized ones, traveling to and from the territory' where you preach, caring for the Kingdom HaU and other responsibilities that you may have in ihc congregation. The fact that you do not report the time spent in these various act ivities does not mean that they are any less important. To the contrary, all of them are very necessary and part of our lives as servants of Jehovah God. In fact, if we were to report all the time that is involved in our activity as Christians, the report would show twenty-four hours a day<sup>r</sup>, because every aspect of the life of a mature Christian is directly affected by the fact that he is a minister of God. However’, on our field service report all that is wanted is what is outlined in the paragraphs above, in connection with taking the good news of the Kingdom to those persons who are not already devoted subjects of Jehovah and his kingdom, to show to what extent the good news of the Kingdom is being preached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO MAY REPORT AS A Fl B LI SHER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">While you personally qualify to report as a Kingdom publisher, a discussion of this matter will help you to know when it is proper to invite others to go along with you in the Kingdom service, Of course, anyone is free to talk about the things he believes. When his heart is touched by the things he hears from God’s Word, he may</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">IOS be moved to share them with other people, and that is fine. (Matt. 9:24-26) However, when you as one of Jehovah’s witnesses invite someone to go along with you from house to house and share in giving the witness, and so identify him publicly with the work of Jehovah’s witnesses, it is different. Now he is going to tell people that he is calling as an associate of Jehovah’s witnesses, and others arc going to view him as an example of what Jehovah's witnesses are. Is he readv for that?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To determine the answer, consider these points: Ooes he believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God? (2 Tim. 3:16) Docs he know and believe at least the basic teachings of the Scriptures so that, when asked questions, he will answer in harmony with the Bible, and not according to false religious teachings? (2 Tim. 2:15; Matt. 7:21-23) Is he heeding the Bible’s command to associate with Jehovah’s people in congregation meetings (if he physically and circumstantially can)? (Heb. 10:24, 25; Ps. 122:1) Does he apply in his life what the Bible says about honesty? (Eph. 4:25, 28) Does he know what the Bible says about, fornication and adultery, and live in harmony with it? (Heb. 13:4; Matt. 19:9) Does he heed the Bible’s prohibition of drunkenness? (Eph. 5:18; 1 Pet. 4:3, 4) Has he definitely broken off membership in all false religious organ izations with which he may have been aflili-a ted, and has he ceased attending their meetings and sharing in their activities? (Rev. 18:4; 2 Cor. 6:14-18) Is he free from any involvement in the political affairs of the world? (John 6:15; 15:19; Jas. 1:27) Does he believe and live in harmony with what the Bible, at Isaiah 2:4, says about the affairs of the nations? Does he want to be one of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses? (Ps. 110:3) Before inviting anyone to go along with you in the field service, it would be wise to discuss these</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">requirements together. It is not necessary to pry into his life with personal questions, but be sure that he understands that before one has the privilege of sharing in the field service his life must harmonize with these Scriptural requirements. In this way you will not be urging anyone to start out in the service before he is really ready for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If the one whom you are training in the field service assists in giving the witness to householders by taking part in the conversation, he, too, may be invited to turn in a field service report, even though he is not yet baptized. It is your privilege to explain to him how and why the reporting is done. But never turn in a report for someone else, unless the other person requests that you do so, possibly due to physical handicap or inability to read and write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It may be that you are a parent, and, if so, you may take your children out into the field service with you, since it is your responsibility to look after them. Of course, if the children are not really interested in preaching and are just going along because you require it, they should not turn in reports as Kingdom publishers. But if they do show a desire to serve Jehovah, it is beneficial to take them along with you just as often as possible and to train them to share in the work. It will have a far-reaching effect on their lives in the years to come. (Deut. 6:5-7; Prov. 22:6) When one of your children has a knowledge of fundamental Bible truths, really appreciates that what he is doing is service to Jehovah, shows a desire to share in that work regularly and is able to make his own presentation in some feature of the service, at least with the magazines, then you may encourage him to start reporting as a publisher. Have in mind, though, that the responsibility rests upon you as the parent to make arrangements on a regular basis for the child to participate in the service, I&gt;o not expect others to carry this load for you. Of course, if the young publisher shows a keen desire to share in the service, it is all right for you to arrange for him to work with other publishers too, if that is agreeable both to you and to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">YOUR PI'BLIMIER *S RECORD CARD</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Whenever a qualified person begins to preach the good news and reports his activity to the congregation, a Publisher’s Record card is made out for him and kept on file by the congregation. On it a record is made each month of the share that he has had in the field service. There is such a Publisher's Record card kept by the congregation for you. It is nothing that is open to examination by everyone else, to compare what he is doing with your report. However, it is consulted from time to time by the servants in the congregation, to determine what assistance, if any, they can offer to you, because they are keenly interested in your spiritual welfare. If you should want to do so, you, too, are welcome to examine your card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The file of cards is divided into three sections. One contains the cards of those congregation publishers who have made a dedication and symbolized it by water baptism, and so are recognized by the congregation as ordained ministers. A second section is made up of the cards of those publishers who have not. yet been baptized but who meet the qualifications to report as publishers and who arc being trained to become ministers of God. The third section contains cards for those who are regular or special pioneers in the congregation. When the cards are completely filled, they are put into a permanent file; they are retained for eight years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Your Publisher's Record card is a record of your ministry. So, if you move to another con-grcgation, be sure to ask your overseer for your current card and all the previous ones on file and then turn them over to the overseer at the Kingdom Hall where you will be attending in the future. If you are going to be away from your home congregation for only a short time, of course, you ought to mail your service reports brick regularly. But if you plan to be in a congregation for more than three months, then it is better to take your Publisher’s Record cards along to the new congregation,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those who go out in the field service and turn in a report each month, and who have done so for the past six months, as shown by the Publisher’s Record cards, arc counted as regular publishers. Any who do not yet have a full six-month record or who have missed any months in the past six are termed irregular publishers. It should be your determination to be a regular publisher of the Kingdom. Certainly anyone who counts it a privilege to serve Jehovah should be able to find some time each month to preach the good news to some other person and aid him to a better understanding of God's Word. These are urgent times in which we live and it is vital that we stay awake spiritually and not allow other cares of life to crowd out our service to God.—Luke 21:3436.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is true that some will allow their Love for Jehovah to cool off, and they will stop sharing in the preaching of God’s kingdom. The servants will do everything they can to assist such individuals, and you too can offer help. (Jas. 5:19, 20) But if such a person becomes completely inactive, not having reported field service for six months, there is no reason to retain his card in the active file of those making up the congregation, We sincerely pray that that will never happen to you, but that strong love for Jehovah will always moti-vatc you and that you will find real joy in serving God.—Phil. 1:9-11; Ps. 35:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CONGREGATION REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Each month all the field service reports are compiled, also the home Bible study reports submitted by congregation publishers are counted, and a total report of the congregation's activity is sent to the Society. This report is put in the mail no later than the fifth day of the month. Of course, for the report to be complete, your cooperation is required. Your overseer will appreciate it very much if you turn in your field service reports regularly each week and then if, at the close of the month, you promptly report any furthei' activity for the last few days of the month and turn in your Bible study reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When all the reports are received by the Society’s branch offices, they are compiled; and a monthly service report is published in </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font23"> for the benefit of all the congregation. The annual worldwide report of the preaching activity of Jehovah’s witnesses appeal's in the </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font23"> along with interesting field experiences from each country. But, of course, for such reports to be published for your encouragement, each publisher of the Kingdom must report his field service regularly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There are also figures included in those published reports that you as a publisher do not supply, but most of them are sent in by your congregation overseer, For example, on the monthly report card sent to the Society he shows the total number of public meetings put on by the congregation during the month, whether held at the Kingdom Hall or elsewhere. Funerals are included in this figure. The public meeting held in connection with the circuit assembly, however, is reported by the district servant. On occasion, there may be some who get baptized under the supervision of the congregation. This, too, is noted on the monthly report card, at the bottom, Ilie overseer showing the total number immersed; and if any wore rebaptized, this figure is listed separately. Most individuals who are ready to symbolize their dedication are able to get baptized at circuit or district assemblies, though, and the number is reported by the district servant. As for the attendance at congregation meetings, this is recorded by the one in charge of the meeting and reported on a Study Report slip; then, in time, it is relayed, to the Society by the circuit servant. So, as you can see, there are many who cooperate together to make those published reports available for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">After the repox't is sent off to the Society, the congregation’s service activity is also shown on the information board in the Kingdom Hall for the benefit of everyone associated with the congregation. (Prov. 15:30) This report enables you to sec how you are doing in comparison with the congregation as a whole. Thus it serves as a source of encouragement and stimulation to us as individuals, and when certain features of the ministry are in need of special attention by the entire congregation, this is readily apparent. We should all be keenly interested in the congregation report, because it is a reflection of the zeal of the congregation in preaching the Kingdom message, which is a vital part of our lives as Jehovah’s witnesses.—Titus 2:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is the earnest hope of everyone associated with the congregation that there will be an increase in the number of active praisers of Jehovah throughout the year; and, of course, if they continue to live in the congregation territory, this increase will be reflected in the congregation report. Special attention is given to this aspect of oui' work during December and April of each service year. At those times everyone is encouraged to give special thought to those with whom he has been studying the Bible and who arc now attending meetings, to sec if any of them are ready to start out in the service, and, if they are, we want to help them. So we put forth an extra effort along this line during certain months, and it is a good stimulus to all of us to keep in mind that we are preparing those with whom wo study to become active praisers of Jehovah. (2 Tim. 2:1, 2) It is not that we do not start out new publishers during other months; we do. But we have set aside certain times during the year to concentrate on this aspect of our work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In some places the increases are large, and this is a cause for great rejoicing. (Acts 15:3) Elsewhere, the growth may not be as spectacular, but the faithfulness of those who persevere in Jehovah’s service is no less a source of joy to Jehovah and to his people. How much more growth in number of dedicated servants of Jehovah there will be in the years remaining before the end of this wicked system of things, we do not know. But as long as the opportunity is open, we will continue to encourage all who will listen to join us in giving public praise to Jehovah.-—Ps. 150:1, 6; Hob. 13:15.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Mature Christian Brothers to Help You</span></h3>
<p><span class="font28">I</span><span class="font23">N THE congregation with which you arc associated you will find mature Christian brothers who are glad to be of help to you. They have love for their brothers and are interested in their spiritual welfare. They have taken to heart what Jesus said to his disciples before leaving them: “I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another; just, as I have loved you, that you also love one another* By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.” (John 13:34, 35; 15:12, 13) While this is true of all who really are Christ’s disciples, you will find it manifest in increased measure on the part of those who are spiritually mature. The appointed servants in the congregation are such persons. Because of Christian love for you, the servants may occasionally offer you Scriptural counsel or suggestions in connection with your ministry. You, too, should feel free to approach any of them for assistance or suggestions in connection with your field ministry, assignments you may have on the meetings, questions that arise in your personal study, and other matters in relation to your service to God. To be of service to you and for your convenience, they usually endeavor to get to the Kingdom Hall at least twenty minutes before congregation meetings and stay for a while after the meetings are dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When Jesus was carrying on his ministry on earth, he said on one occasion: &quot;Come to me, al! you who are toiling and loaded down, and 1 will refresh you . . . for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.” (Matt. 11:28, 29) Those who accepted his invitation were, indeed, refreshed. When Jesus returned to heaven he did not leave his disciples without loving shepherds to care for them. (Eph. 4:8, 11) Such shepherds endeavor to walk faithfully in the footsteps of their Master; they too endeavor to manifest “lowliness of mind,” and in your association with them you will find great spiritual refreshment.—-1 Pet. 5:5; Isa. 32:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">These brothers who are “taking the lead among you'* as appointed servants feel a keen responsibility for each one in the congregation. As stated at Hebrews 13:17, “They arc keeping watch over your souls as those who will render an account/' They endeavor to set a fine example for the congregation, and they encourage all to take full advantage of provisions made by the organization for their spiritual welfare. But their position is not that of bosses, trying to run the lives of other persons. They are well acquainted with what Jesus said, as recorded at Mark 10:42-44: “You know that those who appear to be ruling the nations lord it over them and their great ones wield authority over them. This is not the way among you; but whoever wants to become great among you must be your minister, and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all/' In harmony with this, appointed servants in the congregations of Jehovah's witnesses are not addressed with any titles designed to elevate them above others. They are our Christian brothers.—Job 32:21, 22; Matt. 23:8-11*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As our brothers, they deserve the love of each one of us. And as appointed servants in Jehovah’s organization, they deserve our deep respect and cooperation. When writing to the congregation of the Thessalonians, the apostle Paul admonished: “Now we request you, brothers, to have regard for those who arc working hard among you and presiding over you in the Lord and admonishing you; and to give them more than extraordinary consideration in love because of their work.&quot; (1 Thess, 5:12, 13) That is good advice for us too. Further, the Bible counsels us to 'imitate the faith* of these brothers who speak the word of God to us, 'to be obedient and submissive.’ (Heb. 13:7, 17) “Older men who preside in a fine way&quot; are to be “reckoned worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching.&quot; (1 Tim. 5:17) In this way we show our devotion to Jehovah, whom they represent in their positions of oversight, and we</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">MATURE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS TO HELP YOU </span><span class="font21">1 IT </span><span class="font23">put ourselves in position to benefit to the full from their loving service on our behalf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">APPOINTMENT OF SERVANTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those who are overseers in the congregations of Jehovah’s witnesses are appointed theocratically. They are not selected on the basis of their success in business affairs of the world but in harmony with the qualifications set out in God’s own Word the Bible. Years of faithful service arc prized over youthful vigor, and spirituality is valued more than natural ability. Men who qualify to be overseers are described in this way: “The overseer should therefore be irreprehensible, a husband of one wife, moderate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach, not a drunken brawler, not a smiter, but reasonable, not belligerent, not a lover of money, a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having children in subjection with all seriousness; . . . not a newly converted man . . . Moreover, he should also have a fine testimony from people on the outside.” (1 Tim. 3:2-7; see also Titus 1:5-9.) The resident overseer, or presiding minister, of each congregation of Jehovah’s witnesses is known as the congregation servant. He is a spiritually mature person to whom you should be able to turn with confidence that the counsel he gives will adhere firmly to God's own faithful Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There arc also a number of ministerial servants in each congregation and all these are assistants to the overseer or congregation servant* They include the assistant congregation servant, the Bible study servant, the magazine-territory servant, the literature servant, the accounts servant, the IVki</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">tch-tower</span><span class="font23"> study servant, the Theocratic Ministry School servant and the book study servants. Qualifications to be met by them before being appointed are also listed in the Bible, as</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">118</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">follows: “Ministerial servants should likewise be serious, not double-tongued, not giving themselves to a lot of wine, not greedy or dishonest gain, holding the sacred secret of the faith with a clean conscience. Also, let these be tested as to fitness first, then let them serve as ministers, as they are free from accusation. Let ministerial servants be husbands of one wife, presiding in a fine manner ovei' children and their own households. For the men who minister in a fine manner are -quin ng for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with Christ Jesus/' (1 Tim. 3:8’10, 12, 13) They, too, arc appointed in a theocratic manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When the need arises for seiwants, the local service committee ( the congregation servant, the assistant congregation servant and the Bible study servant) meet together to consider the matter prayerfully. (Luke 6:12, 13) II. is their responsibility to review the Scriptural qualifications and recommend brothers who fit the Bible's standard. Those recommended should be men who show aisprcciat ion for the congregation meetings by regular attendance and participation, are zealous in the field ministry, go out of their way to aid other publishers and are respected in the congregation for their exemplary Christian conduct. Their recommendation is then sent to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, the legal agency used by the visible governing body of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When submitting a recommendation to the Society, the committee shows the full name of the one being recommended, age, years in service, date of immersion, whether of the anointed or “other sheep/’ also average hours of field service, back-calls and homo Bible studies for the past six months. Additionally, they are requested to include comments on the spirituality of the brother, as reflected in a comparison of him with the Scriptural requirements. When a congregation servant or assistant congregation servant is being reoommendcd, his complete mailing address and phone number (if he has one) are also provided. If the committee is unanimous in recommending the brother, only one name needs to be submitted; however, if more than one qualified person is available, they may submit a first and second recommendation. The Society is not bound by the recommendation submitted, but is pleased to consider it. If it is acceptable, a letter of appointment will be sent to the congregation. This is in harmony with the arrangement in the early Jerusalem congregation, where recommendation of servants was made to the apostles, and then these members of the Christian governing body prayed and conferred authority upon the men who had been certified by the other brothers.—Acts 6:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Of course, in making recommendations to the Society, certain questions may arise in view of local circumstances. How are these problems resolved? Tire counsel of God’s Word lights the way. True, the brothers available in one locality may not manifest all the desired qualities to the same degree that those in another place do, but the ones who show the greatest spirituality are chosen to serve. If they show themselves willing and constantly seek Jehovah's direction, his spirit makes up for their lack. And, as was done in the first-century congregation, other responsible ones in the theocratic organization offer them assistance and counsel in carrying on their work in a way well pleasing to God.—Acts 20:17, 28; Phil. 1:1; 2 Tim. 1:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Nevertheless, the Scriptures are very pointed in saying that no “newly converted man” should be designated as an overseer and that a man should be “tested as to fitness” before he is appointed as a ministerial servant. (1 Tim* 3:6, 10) So, even where there is a scarcity of brother's, it is required that a man have a record of a minimum of one year of exemplary service after his immersion before he can be considered for assignment as a servant. But those longer in the truth are preferred when available. If there are not enough qualified brothers to care for all the assignments* those who do qualify may be asked to care for more than one servant’s position, and assistants can help them to do the work while themselves receiving training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If there are still not sufficient brothers to care for the necessary work, then, on recommendation from the congregation committee, the Society may request that certain mature, humble sisters assist. They arc not appointed as servants, but are simply requested to be substitutes in caring for the work until a qualified brother is available. This is in harmony with the fact that, when Jesus ascended to heaven, he gave “gifts in men” to provide oversight for the Christian congregation; also, we are told that overseers are to be spiritually “older men”; and, consistently, those overseers and ministerial servants who were married are spoken of as “husbands.”—Eph. 4:8; Titus 1:5; 1 Tim. 3:1, 2, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Anyone recommended by the committee for appointment as a servant is to be “free from accusation.” (Titus 1 :7&gt; Servants are to be “examples to the flock” of God. (1 Pct. 5:3) If there is some situation that raises questions, the committee bears the responsibility to determine whether what the individual is doing causes him to come under accusation of immature conduct so that the congregation as a whole will not have confidence in him. If so, he should not be recommended. However, it may be that many years ago a. brother engaged in unchristian conduct and was disfellowshipcd but has now been reinstated. Is he barred forever from being an appointed servant? Nut necessarily. If he repented and has been reinstated for at least ten years, and now manifests proper Christian humility and a strong appreciation of Jehovah's view of the matter in which he formerly erred, and is now viewed by others as a good example to the flock of God, he might be recommended for some service privilege* Perhaps someone else got involved in wrong conduct that did not result in disfellowshiping but, because of his humble, repentant attitude right from the start, was put on probation. It usually is not necessary to wait many years before such a one can serve, but one recommended as a servant should not be presently on probation and he should have set a fine enough example in Christian living since the wrongdoing that he is now viewed by the congregation, not as an immature person, but. as a mature Christian ‘example to the flock.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Of course, the service committee should never recommend anyone to the Society for appointment unless they certify that he qualifies to serve in their congregation. However, even when they do recommend a brother, if ho was ever on probation or disfellowshipcd, this is mentioned to the Society, along with the reason for the action, length of disfellowshipment or probation, and when it terminated. Thus care can be exercised to safeguard the spiritual welfare of the congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Sometimes it proves necessary to recommend the removal of a servant. It may be that, due to personal circumstances, he requests it, Or, perhaps, though he at one time did measure up to the Scriptural qualifications, that is no longer true. This is lovingly discussed with the one involved before a recommendation is made to the Society, and, if possible, he is aided to correct the situation so that he can continue to serve. But, if a change is recommended, complete and specific reasons are included in the letter to the Society, When discharging this responsibility of recommending servants, those on the congregation service committee are under obligation to keep in mind the sound counsel written by a member of the first-century governing body to a Christian overseer in Ephesus, namely: “Never lay your hands hastily upon any man; neither be a sharer in the sins of others; preserve yourself chaste/’ (1 Tim. 5:22) So the members of the committee consider matters carefully, turning to Jehovah in prayer. When they submit recommendations to the Society, all three of them sign it<sub>t</sub> indicating their agreement on the matter. If there is any uncertainty in their minds on what should be done, they wait for the visit of the circuit servant, discuss it together and then he submits the recommendation to the Society as part of his report on the congregation. In fact, if there is no urgency, these matt ci's are frequently reserved for handling at the time of the circuit servant’s visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Bible plainly says that those who occupy positions of oveiTSight in the Christian congregation have been appointed by holy spirit. Said Paul to the older men of the congregation of Ephesus: “Pay attention to you i‘selves and to all the flock, among which the holy spirit has appointed you overseers, to shepherd the congregation of God.” (Acts 20:28) Just as appointment was by holy spirit then, so it is today. God’s own Word, which was written under direction of holy spirit, sets the standard. Those who are appointed are persons who themselves are “full of spirit,” manifesting the fruits of God’s spirit in their lives. (Acts 6:3; Gal. 5:22, 23) Prayer for God’s spirit to direct the matter is offered both by those making the recommendation and by those charged with making the appointment. Furthermore, the appointment is made under the direction of the spirit-anointed &quot;faithful and discreet slave&quot; class* When this arrangement of things is adhered to in every way, we can be confident that the appointments made are, indeed, by means of holy spirit, being in full harmony with Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Recognizing the high standard that is followed in selecting overseers and ministerial servants for </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font23">congregations of Jehovah’s people, you can have confidence in them. Never despise their counsel or look down on them as individuals, viewing matters from simply a human standpoint. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">(2 Cor. 10:7-31; 1 Tim. 4:12; Acts 4:13) Learn to </span><span class="font23">take God’s view of matters, appreciating the spiritual qualities that he prizes in his servants. In this way you will be able to benefit from the provision that he has kindly made for your blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In time it may be that you, too, if a male, will qualify for appointment as a servant in the congregation. When you were baptized, you said, in effect, to all onlookers: T have made an unreserved dedication of myself to Jehovah God. Whatever his will is, I am willing to do it.* </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font23">harmony with your dedication, if you are a male, we urge you to take to heart what Paul wrote to Timothy: </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font23">any man is reaching </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">out for </span><span class="font23">an office of overseer, he is desirous of a fine work,” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">(1 </span><span class="font23">Tim. 3:1) There is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font23">great need for qualified men to shoulder responsibility in the theocratic organization, and rich blessings from Jehovah come to those who are willing to accept such service. You can reach out for these service privileges by applying yourself diligently to measure up to the qualifications for a servant and by showing that you are willing to aid others. Then, when privileges of service of any kind are extended io you, show that you have the spirit of that devoted prophet of God who said: &quot;Here I am! Send me.” —Isa. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Briefly, now, we would like to acquaint you with the servants in the congregation and their work. They are there to help you,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">CONGREGATION SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The congregation servant is the presiding minister, and he has general oversight of the congregation. Ue is deeply concerned about the welfare of all who are associated with the congregation. (2 Cor. 11:28, 29) Furthermore, he knows that he is to be “an example to the faithful ones in speaking, in conduct, in love, in faith, in chasteness?’ (1 Tim. 4:12) Tic is not a person who simply tells others what to do, but he participates in all the activities of the congregation himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">His duties include making provision for all the meetings of the congregation and seeing to it that they are conducted properly. He arranges for capable brothers to deliver the public talks that you enjoy, and for chairmen to introduce them. When speakers come from other congregations, he sees that provision is made to extend hospitality to them. (3 John 5-8) There is much work for him to do in connection with the service meeting—planning the program for a month in advance, assigning parts to capable brothers and discussing with them how to adapt the material to local needs, arranging for rehearsal of various parts and caring for his own parts of the program. He also works closely with the WotfcTttower study servant, the Theocratic Ministry School servant and the congregation book study servants, to see that the meetings over which they preside arc handled in harmony with the arrangements outlined by the Society, so that they result in the greatest good for all the congregation. He is glad to care for this work, but he cannot do it all himself. All in the congregation share by carrying out their assignments and giving good support to the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As all of Jehovah’s witnesses do, he endeavors to share regularly in the field ministry. He takes the lead in this work, coordinating the arrangements for group witnessing and personally working along with other publishers to assist them in whatever way he can. In order to keep in close touch with all the publishers in their ministry, he arranges to visit the various congregation book studies from time to time and to work with the groups them in the field service. When he visits your service group, if there is opportunity for you to work with him, by all means take advantage of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As a shepherd of Jehovah's people, the overseer makes a diligent effort to give loving attention to each one of the flock according to the personal needs of that one. (Jer. 23:4) To the extent possible, he welcomes newcomers to the congregation and commends and encourages those who are already active servants of God. He is interested in assisting each one to become a mature Christian. If some are sick or depressed, he pays t hem a visit to build them up. (Matt. 25:37-40) He bears in mind what the apostle Paul said to the older men of the early Ephesus congregation: *T have exhibited to you in all things that by thus laboring you must assist those who are weak&quot; and he is glad to offer such assistance. {Acts 20:35) If someone becomes irregular or completely inactive as a publisher, or if one frequently misses meetings, the overseer shows concern about that person* He offers whatever help he can to aid the individual to renew his love for God and to become firm in the faith. (Ezek. 34:16) These arc things that you, too, can do as you see the need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In caring for the interests of the congregation, there are also records that must be kept, and the congregation servant has oversight of these. Even though others may care for them, he checks them periodically. All correspondence from the Society having to do with congregal ion matters is sent to him, either for reading to the congregation or for attention by various ones of the servants. Orders sent to the Society for literature and handbills, as well as remittance and subscription forms and other congregation correspondence, are signed by him. (Of course, individual publishers arc free to write to the Society too, when necessary.) The overseer makes provision for certain items, such as appointment letters from the Society and reports left by circuit servants, to be retained in </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font23">permanent. file. At all times he seeks to work closely with the governing body and its representatives, responding to its direct ion and encouraging others to do the same, because he knows that this results in Jehovah’s blessing on the congregation.—Acts 16:4j 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">With a view to continued growth of the organization, the overseer may find it beneficial to arrange for the training of willing ones who someday may qualify for appointment as servants. (2 Tim. 2:1, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">2)</span><span class="font23"> They can learn by observing and by helping the appointed servant to care for records and other work. Faiticularly in larger congregations some servanl-s may find that, they need assistance Io care for their assignment of work; so arrangements for someone to work with them can be doubly beneficial. The congregation servant </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">should </span><span class="font23">approve the assignment of any such assistants .before they begin to serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The congregation overseer is a man who has personal obligations that require attention too. Ue may be secularly employed, providing for himself and his family, and that often requires considerable time. If he has a family, he is to be “a man presiding over his own household in a fine manner, having children in subjection with all seriousness.” (1 Tim. 3:4) He needs to spend time to care for their physical, emotional and spiritual needs. (1 Tim. 5:8) He also needs opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">MATURE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS TO HELP YOU </span><span class="font23">127 for personal study. So he is not able to spend all his time in earing for congregation matters. Yet he has been kind enough to arrange his affairs to extend assistance, as he is able, to you and all the rest of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As you become well acquainted with your congregation servant, we believe you will find that, in many respects, he is like that early Christian, overseer the apostle Paul, who wrote: “Having a tendei' affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you, not only the good news of God, but also our own souls, because you became beloved to us. In harmony with that you well know how, as a father docs his children, we kept exhorting each one of you, and consoling and bearing witness to you, to the end that you should go on walking worthily of God.&quot;—1 Thess. 2:8, 11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">ASSISTANT CONGREGATION SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Next to the congregation overseer, the assistant congregation servant is usually the most competent brother in the congregation. Spiritually speaking, he is an older man, one who has a mature interest in the spiritual welfare of the .entire congregation. If anything should happen to the overseer, the assistant would step in and take care of the congregation. Also, he takes oversight of the congregation in the absence of the congregation seiwant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Regularly the congregation benefits from his ministry. lie has a share in the meetings, and, to the extent that his circumstances permit, he takes the lead in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">He is also responsible to care for some of the service records of the congregation. Each week he tabulates the field service reports for the entire congregation, marks the totals on a weekly report sheet supplied by the Society and informs the congregation servant of the report to date. At</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">the end of the month he prepares the congregation’s service report card and gives it to the overseer so that he can sign and mail it to the Society no later than the fifth of the following month. He also puts a report of the congregation’s field ministry for the month on the information board at the Kingdom Hall, doing so as soon as possible after the service report is sent to the Society. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Then, once a month he enters on the Publisher’s </span><span class="font23">Record cards each publisher’s service report<sub>t</sub> including reports of pioneers in the congregation; and, when he is finished with them, he passes the Bible study reports on to the Bible study servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Yet the assistant congregation servant is by no means merely a record keeper, The reports that he handles reflect the devotion of faithful servants of God, and they indicate where there is need for the appointed servants and other mature ones in the congregation to be of loving assistance to their brothel's and sisters. So, about the first of each month when he is making entries on the Publisher’s Record cards, he lakes note of any who need help in presenting the Kingdom message. Some publishers may be spending time in the service but not placing any literature or not having any results in following up interest shown. From lime to time he gives a note on the needs of various ones to the congregation book study servants so that help can be offered, thus producing increased praise to Jehovah and enabling the individual publisher to find greater joy in his service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">If </span><span class="font23">he observes that some did not report any service at all for the month, this information is conveyed to the book study servants right away so that a personal call can be made to offer assistance, lie believes that any who have been reporting as Kingdom publishers really do want to serve Jehovah, and he feels a strong obligation to aid them to do this regularly. Sometimes a person who is experiencing ill health, opposition from unbelieving family members or oilier personal problems gets depressed and deeply appreciates the loving concern of Christian brothers. (1 Thess. 5:11, 14) With a little help, such a one may be glad to get out in the field service again. On the other hand, if any who are not reporting have not been attending the congregation meetings either and so have lost their desire to participate in the service, what they need is personal help to be strengthened spiritually in order to stay on the road to life* (Matt* 7:13, 14) Perhaps arrangements can be made to help them get back into the habit of regular meeting attendance. It may even be that some need a home Bible study to be conducted with them again. The servants are glad to be of help. They feel about them as does Jehovah, of whom his Son said: *Tt is not a desirable thing with my Father* who is in heaven for one of these little ones to perish*’*—Matt. 18: 12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At the fifteenth of each month, too, the assistant congregation servant notifies the book study servants of any who have not yet reported service for the month. We feel sure that any who are publishers want to be regular in their service, reporting every month if at all possible. But some may need help; others may simply have forgotten to turn in their report Slip. Obviously, you can help to keep the assistant congregation servant’s work in this regard at a minimum by remembering to turn in your service reports regularly each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If a new publisher reports field service for the first time, this makes us rejoice. But, before the report is counted, it is wise to make sure that the individual qualifies to be a publisher and that he appreciates what it means to be publicly identified as an associate of Jehovah’s witnesses, in training for the ministry’. So the assistant congregation servant notifies the overseer, and then the overseer has a personal talk with the individual, highlighting the righteous requirements of Jehovah for his people as well as the provisions that God has made to keep us spiritually strong, and warmly commending the new publisher for the progress that he is making. Then the assistant congregation servant makes out a record card for this new publisher and includes it in the file of active publishers in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In view of his duties, we feel sure that you can see why this brother is called the assistant congregation servant. Ue works closely with the overseer and endeavors to be a real assistant. However, this service is performed on behalf of you and your brothers and sisters in the congregation. Understanding what is done, you can benefit f rom it and can work along with this servant in aiding others to bo regular praisers of our God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">BUiLE STUDY SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Although the Bible study servant shares in all features of the service, he is particularly interested in promoting back-call and Bible study activity on the part of all the publishers in the congregation. He is a mature brother, one who has had considerable experience in the ministry, and lie will gladly assist you in this activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When any back-call slips arc received from the Society, he distributes them to the various book study servants so that they will be given attention. If you are handed such a slip by your book study servant, be sure to make the call promptly. Perhaps repeated calls will be needed in order to make contact, but it is good to persevere. These are individuals who have shown some interest in the truth, but. they are in need of further attention. The same is true of those on your own back-call list, persons whose names you noted on your house-to-house record because they listened appreciatively to your sermon or accepted some literature. Their lives are involved; give them every opportunity to accept the truth. If you need someone to go along with you on the call, or simply suggestions on how to deal with a particular situation, remember, your Bible study servant will be glad to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If possible,, the Bible study servant would like to see every publisher in the congregation conducting at. least one home Bible study. He knows that this is one of the most important means by which the shecplikc ones are being gathered into Jehovah's organization. He appreciates, too, the joy that conducting a study can bring to the publisher* Are you presently conducting a study? If so, you are well aware that it is largely from this activity that new p raisers of Jehovah come, and you know the contentment that sharing in such work brings. If you do not have a study, the Bible study servant may approach you to offer some aid. On the other hand, if you really want to conduct a study but are having some difficulty in getting one started, why not take the ini native by talking to the Bible study servant about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To afford opportunity for this brother to work with the publishers long enough to get them well established in the back-call and Bible study work, he usually spends considerable time with the group that meets at a service rendezvous. He may even be assigned as the congregation book study servant there, so that he can concentrate on the work in that locality. Then, when he has accomplished what appears to be possible, he may be assigned by the congregation servant to another congregation book study for a period of time— perhaps a few months, or even a year or more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Bible study servant keeps a record of all the Bible studies being conducted in the congregation’s territory. In his file he has a separate Study Record slip for each study, whether it is conducted by a congregation publisher or a pioneer. All of them are arranged alphabetically according to the names of the householders. As soon as you report a new home Bible study, he makes out a Study Report slip and includes it in the file. Then, each month when you turn in your Study Report slip, he makes the necessary entries to keep it up-to-date. Of course, not all studies continue; and if you find that there is no further interest, do not forget to mark your Study Report slip “not interested” so that the corresponding record can be removed from the file. There is also a section in his file where he keeps study records for each of the congregation meetings, and from the Study Report slips submitted at the end of the month by the ones in charge of the various meetings, he records the number of meetings held and the average attendance. The Study Report slips, having served their purpose, are then destroyed. But the file itself is a guide to the Bible study servant in offering assistance to both publishers and newly interested ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If you are conducting a home Bible study, from time to time the Bible study servant, may inquire about it. In fact, if you approach him and tell him what progress is being made, he appreciates it. He is keenly interested in the advancement being made by all of these potential servants of God. If any problems arise in connection with the study, he is pleased to offer suggestions. And, where possible, he likes to get acquainted with these persons, and thus help you to get them in closer touch with the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Should circumstances arise that make it impossible for you to care for a certain study anymore, feel free to seek the Bible study servant’s help in arranging for someone else to conduct it. Or, if you are getting good results in this feature of the service, and would be willing to take someone else along with you and help him to start a</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">MATURE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS TO HEtP YOU 133 </span><span class="font23">study, tell the Bible study servant that you would like to help. There is much of this work to be done, and willing workers are needed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">CONG REGATION COMMITTEE</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The congregation servant, the assistant congregation servant and the Bible study servant comprise what is known as the congregation committee. While the congregation servant is the one who is responsible to take full oversight of the congregation, there are times when it is beneficial for several mature brothers to discuss matters together. (Prov. 15:22) The congregation servant acts as the chairman of this group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Certain recommendations are submitted to the Society, for example, and these are given attention by the entire committee. When the need arises, they prayerfully consider together which brothers arc Scripturally qualified for appointment by the Society as servants. Similarly, applications for regular pioneer' service and for appointment as vacation pioneers are checked by the committee and, if approved, are submitted to the Society. If it is deemed advisable to divide a congregation into two units, this too is weighed by the committee before being sent to the Society for approval. Such recommendations to the Society arc signed by all three members of the committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Public speakers in the congregations are not appointed by the Society, but they too care for a very responsible assignment, so their selection is a matter i hat is handled by the committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Other matters may be discussed by the committee and then submitted, not to the Society, but to the local congregation. Changing meeting t imes to make them convenient to the majority of the publishers is one of these. Arrangements for an adequate place of meeting is another. Whether it is a matter of finding a better hall to rent or purchasing property and building a Kingdom Hall,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">the congregation as a whole bears the expense; so the matter is put to them for decision. Hie same is true of sending contributions of money to the Society to be used to advance the Kingdom interests, and setting aside funds for legal cases that may involve the preaching work locally. In many places the State makes provision for needy persons, but there may be situations involving worthy individuals that require loving consideration by the congregation, and, of course, it is up to the congregation to decide what they are in position to do. (1 Tim. 5:3-16; Rom. 12:13) After the committee has come to agreement on any of these matters having to do with the congregation, il is presented to the congregation for decision. Particularly if it involves the use of congregation funds the committee’s recommendation is drawn up in the form of a written resolution. The congregation servant presents the resolution to the congregation, and the congregation is free to discuss the matter from all angles before it is voted on. Then, if the congregation accepts the resolution after hearing all the facts and votes in approval of it, the committee will follow through in caring for what has been approved*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The committee may, at times, call in other mature publishers for advice when they are discussing certain matters. However, the committee is responsible to draw its own conclusions and write up the resolution or recommendation to present either to the congregation or to the Society, depending on the matter under consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At times the committee is called on to act in a judicial capacity in handling difficulties that arise and in keeping the congregation clean and acceptable to Jehovah. (1 Cor. 5:12-6:6) Usually this judicial committee is made up of the same three brothers who comprise the service committee discussed above. But, if there are not three qualified brothers available locally, or if one of the committee asks to be permitted to step aside for some reason, a qualified brother from another congregation may be requested to serve by the other two members. Wherever possible, these brothers seek to assist persons who sincerely want to serve Jehovah acceptably, but they are also well aware of the obligation not to ignore Jehovah's righteous judicial decisions, (Gal, 6:1; Ps. 119: 106) They encourage the congregation always to bo guided by the wise counsel in God’s own Word, and they endeavor to do the same themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">M A G AZIN E-TEK RI TORY SERV A N </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The magazine-territory servant has been given the assignment of supplying you with copies of the Watsfctower and .Awake? magazines to use in the field service and territory in which to work. He is pleased when he can serve you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Each congregation usually has a day set aside in which magazine distribution is particularly featured, and it is the magazine-territory servant's assignment to give this his special attention. He takes particular interest in seeing to it that there are convenient arrangements for publishers to meet for this activity, and he works closely with the congregation servant to accomplish it, It may be that he has approached you and asked if you would like to work with one of the Magazine Day service groups. If you can arrange to do so, we know that you will enjoy it. But if that particular day is not convenient for you, choose a time that fits your schedule, and share regularly in this feature of Kingdom service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In order to have magazines with which to work, you will need to place an order with the magazineterritory servant. This should be a regular standing order. He will add your requirements to the number already being received and, if necessary, notify the congregation servant of the increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Such adjustments in the order, as well as requests for an extra supply of a particular issue, arc sent to the Society on the magazine Distributors’ Order blank, Dor orders of thirty or more, the brothers endeavor to order in tens, because it helps the Society in its mailing; so there may be a few extra copies available at the counter if you place your supply of a certain issue faster than usual. But if you find that you can make good use of even more copies of any issue, do not hesitate to ask for them. The brothers arc pleased to order them, and the Society will send them out just as quickly as possible. Whatever you order, be sure to take them. The congregation has obtained them from, the Society for you on credit, and the magazine-territory seivant depends on each one to take his supply so that the account docs not become delinquent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When the magazines are received from the Society, the magazine-territory seiwant counts them, checks the total against the label on the package and informs the accounts servant of the issue and the number of magazines received. If there is a discrepancy, the congregation servant notifies the Society, so that the account can be adjusted. They arc then made available to you at. die first meeting after they arrive, and you will find that the magazine-territory servant is usually at the Kingdom Hall for at least twenty minutes before and after meetings to serve you. Please pay for the magazines when you receive them. This money (with a notation of the total placed with pioneers) is turned over to the accounts servant each week. Obviously, if his records are going to balance, it is important that no one help himself to magazines when the servant in charge is not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The magazine-territory servant also has charge of the file of terri lory in which those associated with the congregation carry out their field service. Congregation publishers, pioneers and con</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">gregation book study servants all get their assign</span><span class="font23">ments of territory through the magazine-territory servant. As long as a territory is available in the file, they may take their choice or where they would like to work. But only as much territory as is actually needed for the present is to be checked out at any one time. If you hold a personal territory, do not forget that, as soon as it has been worked once, or at the end of four months, even </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font23">it has not been completed, it should be checked in. If you are caring Tor it and want to check it out again, you may do that, but </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font23">servant </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font23">charge needs your help if he is going to keep an accurate record of the work being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The congregation’s entire assignment of territory is subdivided into small sections, each containing perhaps 200 to 300 homes and each bearing its own number. However, the type of territory and local circumstances influence the size. This breakdown of the territory is also generally shown on a map of the entire area, with boundaries and territory numbers clearly marked. This makes it easy to select the section in which you would like to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When you request territory in which to work, the magazine-territory servant may make a suggestion concerning sections that are particularly in need of attention. Of course, you are free to select the one that you want, but he knows which areas are most in need of attention and endeavors to arrange for a balanced coverage of the congregation’s entire assignment with Bible sermons and the campaign offers as well as magazine distribution. It some territories arc not regularly worked by individual publishers, he may encourage book study servants to care for them in group witnessing and they may be given attention by groups on Magazine Day. It is hoped that all the territory can be covered every four months, and more often if possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If the congregation's assignment of territory contains a large rural area or a number of towns spread out. over a large area, the public meetings are sometimes scheduled in these localities away from the Kingdom Hall in order to concentrate work in sections that arc not regularly given attention. The distribution of handbills in connection with those meetings, whether held at the Kingdom Hall or elsewhere, keeps the Kingdom work before the public. The magazine-territory servant has charge of the handbill supply, and he endeavors to sec that all of them are used. If the time for their use is running out and there are still some on hand, he may suggest that some of the publishers simply work through a section of territory putting them under the doors of the homes. This is something that even young ones can do and enjoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Other means of advertising the Kingdom message also come within the assignment of the magazine-territory servant. For example, if you have a window display at the Kingdom Hall, he usually is the one who cares for it. And if you find a notice in a local newspaper concerning the congregation meetings, or perhaps concerning the visit of the circuit servant or travel by the publishers to an assembly, he probably had a hand in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">He always discusses these matters with the congregation servant before starting anything new, but then he follows through on the details of the work. His great interest is to keep the Kingdom message prominently before everyone who lives in the congregation’s territory; and, of course, in that work you have a share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">LITERATURE SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There is a servant in the congregation whose special assignment is to make available to you and the other publishers and pioneers books, booklets, Bibles and tracts for use in the Held ministry. He is the literature servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Regularly he checks the congregation’s supply of literature and </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font23"> announcements of coming literature offers, to be sure that there will be ample literature on hand. Using his records from years past as a guide, he can estimate how much of certain items to order, so that there will be sufficient but not an excess. If there is some item of literature that you would like to have, perhaps in a foreign language that he does not have in stock, he will be glad to include it in his next order to the Society. In most congregations an order is sent just once a month, after the close of the month. For your convenience, the literature servant plans to have the literature room open for about twenty minutes before and after meetings at the Kingdom Hall. But no one should ever help himself to literature when the servant in charge is not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Most of the literature in stock belongs to the Society, having been obtained by the congregation on credit. So the literature servant realizes that there is a responsibility on his part to take good care of it, keeping it neat and clean, and to keep accurate records. Whenever you obtain literature from him, he carefully marks on a Literature Check Sheet the amount taken. Then at least once a week he totals everything moved from the stock and gives a copy of the Literature Check Sheet to the accounts servant along with the corresponding money. If it. is necessary, on occasion, to place small amounts of literature with a publisher on credit, he makes notation of it on a Publisher’s Credit Slip and asks the publisher to sign it. But no further credit is extended until the literature previously obtained has been paid for. Then, when payment is made, the literature servant shows the movement of the literature on his Literature Check Sheet for the week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Pioneers, too, obtain their literature supplies from the congregation, paying for it at pioneer rates. Since the pioneers receive their literature at less than cost, to help them with expenses, separate records are kept at the literature room. What they obtain is recorded on a separate Literature Check Sheet, and at the end of the month credit is requested from the Society for the difference in rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When a shipment of literature is received from the Society, the literature servant opens it soon and checks it against the invoice to be sure that everything is in order. After he marks it approved or notes any needed correction he passes it on to the congregation servant, who checks it and turns it over to the accounts servant for filing. If there are any discrepancies, the overseer writes to the Society about it right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Whatever supplies come from the Society are noted on the Progressive Inventory kept by the literature servant, and at the end of the month he enters the total amount of each publication moved from the stock. This enables him to figure just what he has on hand. lie keeps such an inventory for each language in which he has a supply of literature. Additionally, each year, on September 1, he makes an actual-count inventory and sends a report of the results to the Society on a form provided at that time. So, as you can see, the servants endeavor to handle these matters In a very orderly way, as befits Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCOUNTS SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The accounts servant is charged with the responsibility of caring for money that you and others contribute locally for the advancement of the Kingdom work, as well as any other funds handled by the congregation. He keeps a careful record of all money received anti disbursed, and any expenditures of money are approved by the congregation overseer. The method of accounting used is outlined in detail in instructions provided by the Society to each congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">No collection is ever taken at the meetings of Jehovah <sup>f</sup>s people, nor is there any assessment of dues, Expenses of the congregation are met. by voluntary contributions. (1 Chron. 29:1, </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font23"> 5, 9) For your convenience, contribution boxes arc provided by the accounts servant at the Kingdom Hall and at all the locations where congregation book studies are held.—2 Ki. 12:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The accounts servant has many details for which to care, A number of things require his attention after each meeting; others are cared for once a week. For example, after each meeting contributions are taken from the box and the amount is noted on a Receipt form. A duplicate copy of the Receipt goes to t he congregation servant, and the accounts servant enters the amount on the Account Sheet. At least once a week money is also received from the literature and magazineterritory sciwants, Receipts are made out for them, a copy of each is retained by the accounts servant and appropriate entries are made on the Account Sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When you obtain a magazine subscription, or want to renew your own, be sure that you have made it out neatly and accurately, then give it to the accounts servant and he will see that it gets prompt attention. He makes out a Receipt for the total amount of subscription money received at any one meeting, keeps the Receipt in his file and makes an entry on the Account Sheet. Then, once a week, he fills out a Subscription Record Sheet, listing all the subscriptions received that week, and gives it to the overseer, with the subscription slips and covering Remittance and Credit Request form and corresponding remittance, to be checked and sent to the Society. A copy of the Subscription Record Sheet is retained in the accounts servant’s file.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Some matters require attention once a month. For example, by the fifth of each month a remittance is made to the Society of all money received from the literature and magazine-territory servants during the preceding month, and credit is requested for items placed with pioneers. A Remittance and Credit Request form signed by the congregation servant is used for this purpose. Also, the accounts servant balances the records for the month and prepares a financial report, to read to the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To assure the accuracy of the accounts, as well as for the protection of both the congregation and the accounts sei want, the overseer arranges to have the accounts audited every three months—at the beginning of March, June, September and December. All invoices, carbon copies of Remittance and Credit Request forms, and magazine labels are kept in a “pending&quot; flic until such time as they appear on the Society’s statements; then they are transferred to a permanent file. Magazine labels and Literature Check Sheets are retained only until the audit is made. However, Accounts Sheets, Receipts, Invoices, Credit Memos, Statements, Remittance and Credit Request forms, Subscription Record Sheets, bills, bank statements, check stubs and canceled checks are retained in the permanent file for a period of seven years or whatever the Statute of Limitations requires in your locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Some congregations find it convenient to have a bank account in which to deposit their funds each week, and that is all right if they want to do it. Where it is done, the account is in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">name of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congregation of Jehovah’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Witnesses/* If there is more than one congregation in the city, then the name is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses,.....Unit.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">All checks drawn on the account arc signed by the accounts servant and countersigned by the congregation servant. Other congregations may prefer to use money orders, bank drafts or other safe method of transmitting money. Nevertheless, the expenditures are always approved by the overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">This care given to the handling of funds of the congregation assures that they will al! be used in the way intended, to advance the Kingdom interest s<sub>T</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">“WATCHTOWER” STUDY SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Watchtower study servant leads the congregation in its weekly study of the Wftftfower magazine, which is the principal publication of “the faithful and discreet slave&quot; class. (Matt. 24: 45-47) He has the assignment of helping everyone in the congregation to get full benefit from this spiritual provision that Jehovah has made for his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Realizing that, he endeavors to set aside time to make a special study of each lesson. Where possible, he may go over the material carefully several times to get it clearly in mind. Furthermore, he endeavor’s to get a clear view of the overall objective of the article and the principal points developed, so that he can aid the congregation to see these. Having such a grasp of the material enables him to know where repetition for emphasis in the study will be helpful, which points bear specially careful discussion because they are key ideas, and which ones are relatively minor in relation to the discussion at hand. His is more than a routine assignment of asking questions. He wants to help everyone present to understand the material thoroughly and appreciate its application to their lives as Christian witnesses of Jehovah. —Prov. 4:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Ho has a personal interest in the spiritual growth of all in the congregation, and he knows that regularly being at the Watch-tow study is a major factor in one's advancement to Christian maturity. So, if some are not attending regularly, he tries to visit them personally; and he works through the congregation book study servants to encourage them to be present each week, to the ex 1 ent possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Also, he would like to see those who are in attendance benefit from the study most fully. He knows that the ones who are active participants get more from the meeting and enjoy it much more than do passive listeners. So, as opportunity affords, he talks to those who need help along this line and offers to assist them to prepare an answer or discusses with them how to pick out and underscore key thoughts and use them in commenting. If you realize that you arc not actively participating in the study each week and want some aid, why not approach your Watc?i-tower study servant and discuss the matter with him? He will count it a privilege to help you. —Heb. 10:23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">On the other hand, if you are an active participant in the meeting, there is much that you can do to aid others to do the same. What about the members of your family, those with whom you conduct studies and who are now attending the Kingdom Hall meetings, also the publishers with whom you closely associate in the field service? Do they all attend regularly and comment freely? Would you like to help them? Why not select just one who needs some encouragement and patiently offer it? When you see good results, wo are sure that you will be moved to aid others too. In this way you can cooperate with the Watcfttender study seiwant in helping your brothel's to get the</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Tull benefit from the rich spiritual provisions that Jehovah is now making through his organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRATIC MINISTRY SCHOOL SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The brother who presides over the Theocratic Ministry School is the Theocratic Ministry School servant* Among the brothers in the congregation, he is usually one who has a particularly good knowledge of both Bible truth and the language of the country and is able to express himself well. He is keenly interested in improvement of the speaking and teaching ability of evei*yone in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The outline of material to be covered in the Theocratic Ministry School is provided by the Society, and the school servant follows this in assigning talks to those enrolled. When you arc assigned a talk, he usually makes it a point to notify you at least three weeks in advance, so that there is ample time for you to prepare*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If the congregation with which you are associated has a very large enrollment in the school, you may find that it is divided into two or more sections for the student talks. In this way each one has an opportunity to give a talk at least every three months. The congregation servant arranges for capable assistants to the school servant to offer counsel to the students in the additional groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">For the school servant (and any assistants he may have) to give good counsel, it is necessary for them to do considerable preparation each week. They need to be familiar with the material on which each student is going to speak as well as the speech qualities on which each is working. When offering counsel, they always draw attention to good qualities, for the encouragement of the student* And with a view to the student’s advancement, they may discuss how he can improve in others and assign him specific speech qualities to give attention to in his next talk. During the meeting they have just two minutes in which to offer counsel to each student speaker, and they try to make what they say in that time beneficial both to the speaker and to the rest of the congregation. After the school, when necessary, they talk to the students privately to elaborate on points that may need further discussion. Always they endeavor to make their suggestions with genuine kindness and Christian love, so you should find their help to be truly upbuilding.—1 Cor. 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even the school servant may give student talks on occasion, as well as instruction talks. When he does that, the congregation servant or someone else that he may designate offers counsel. So, you see. all of us can continue to learn, and we should all desire to develop cis fully as possible our capabilities as servants of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As we have learned to be true of the other servants, so with the school servant, he is interested in being of assistance to you, not only from the platform, but personally. If you find that you need help in preparing a talk, in selecting a practical setting for it, or in mastering a particular speech quality, do not hesitate to approach him. He is an experienced and mature brother and he will be able to offer helpful suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">For your use, the congregation also provides at the Kingdom Hall a Theocratic Ministry School library. It is under the supervision of the school servant, and usually it contains all the available publications of the Society, perhaps a variety of Bible translations, an exhaustive concordance and some other helpful reference works. Feel free to use any of these publications at the Kingdom Hall before or after meetings. If you want to take one home with you for a few days, check with the school servant first and he will, no doubt, be glad to accommodate you. The library has been provided for your benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">CONUREfrATlON' BOOR STUDY SERVANTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">A key role in the spiritual growth of each congregation is played by the congregation book study servants. Their duties are threefold: to conduct the congregation book studies, io lake the lead in the field ministry, and to give the needed personal attention to each one so that all enjoy good spiritual health. Since each book study servant is assigned to give attention to a comparatively small group of publishers, they are able to keep in close touch with each one of the Lord’s “sheep” entrusted to their care.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As is true of other servants, each congregation book study servant is appointed by the Society. Then he is assigned to a specific book study group by the congregation servant and is given the names and addresses of all the publishers associated with it. The number of book study servants in the congregation is the same as the number of congregation book studies presently in operation. Then, when definite arrangements are made for a new study group, recommendation is made to the Society of a qualified brother to care for it. In the meantime, prospective servants arc appointed by the overseer to serve as assistants to the book study servants, both for training and to care for the study and service arrangements when the appointed servant is not able to be there. If at all possible, each book study servant has an assistant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To do a really good job of conducting the study each week, the book study sc tvant usually has to spend more time in preparation for the meeting than other publishers do. Me needs to know, not only the answers to the study questions, but the reasons for those answers and the value of the information. At the study itself, since the group is moderate in size, he is able to give more personal attention to each one who attends. It is his desire, not merely to cover material, but to aid each one to understand it. clearly so that it will be readily available for use in making personal decisions and in teaching others. He knows that a truly informative study, well supported, is a major factor in spiritual growth and a stimulus to participation in the field service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The location where the book study is held is also a rendezvous from which field service is carried on, and the book study servant takes the lead in this. From time to time he endeavors to go along personally in the service with each one in the group, aiding the less experienced and encouraging those who do well. He knows that regularity in the ministry is important, so ho encourages all to have some share in the service each week, if possible. Ue arranges meetings for group witnessing at times convenient to the circumstances of the publishers, and he is with them himself as often as he can be. When he is not able to be with them, he sees to it that an assistant cares for the group and has territory in which they can work. If there arc any who are new in the service, or who can be helped to become better teachers, he also secs that arrangements are made to provide them with a qualified companion in service who can offer helpful suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">A truly mature book study servant is, above all, a loving shepherd. He shows a warm personal interest in the spiritual well-being of each one in his study group. He keeps an eye out for them at the Kingdom Hall meetings, expresses appreciation for their share in the iVutcTitower study and aids those who need help with assignments for the Theocratic Ministry School. He does not feel that his responsibility toward them ends when they turn in a field service report for the month. Are they having a share in the service regularly each week? Do they participate in all attainable features of the service? Can they be encouraged to reach out for additional privileges of sei vice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">These arc questions that he has in mind as he thinks of the spiritual health of each of the “sheep.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As a shepherd, he likes to keep in close touch with each one of the “flock.” From time to time your book study servant may pay you a visit at your home. He feels as did the apostle Paul, who wrote to fellow believers: &quot;I am longing to see you, that I may impart some spiritual gift Io you in order for you to be made firm; or, rather, that there may be an interchange of encouragement among you, by each one through the other’s faith, both yours and mine.”—Rom. 1:11, 12,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Among those of our first-century brothers who showed particular concern for their fellow Christians was Stephanas, and of him and his household we read: “They set themselves to minister to the holy ones . . . they have refreshed my spirit and yours.” They were interested in helping their brothers, the same as your book study servant is. The Scriptures urge us to respond to the help of such persons, saying: “May you also keep submitting yourselves to persons of that kind and to everyone co-operating and laboring.”—1 Cor. 16:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Perhaps some in the book study group have become irregular in attending meetings and have not been out in the service of late. Periodically the book study servant receives a note from the assistant congregation servant reminding him of those in need of help. The book study servant is deeply concerned about them, because he does not want to see any drift away from the flock of God because of negligence on his part. (John 17:12) He makes a personal call on them, not to check up on them, but because he cares for them. It may be that they have been ill and are in need of help. Or perhaps personal problems have left them despondent. He endeavors to build them up with a discussion of spiritual matters and offers what assis-tn nee appears to be needed to renew their regular association and service with Jehovah’s people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Of </span><span class="font23">course, the book study servants have other responsibilities that require their time and attention too. Usually they are brothers who are secularly employed, and there are always personal affairs that press for attention. As with the other appointed ministerial servants in the congregation, if they have a family, they are to preside “in a fine manner over children and their own households.” (1 Tim. 3:12) That means that they need to spend time with their family. Yet. their devotion to Jehovah and their loving concern for others in the congregation move them to expend themselves willingly on behalf of these too. We can surely say of these servants, as an apostle of Jesus Christ said of his Christian brother Epapti-roditus: &quot;Keep holding men of that sort dear.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">—Phil. 2:25, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">PIUSLIC SPEAHEKS</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In each congregation, it is up to the congregation committee to determine which ones of the brothers should be used as public speakers. While speaking ability </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">is important, </span><span class="font23">more is required. There are a number of factors that are considered. Is the person dedicated and baptized? Does he have an accurate knowledge of Bible truth? Is he a good teacher, able to express God’s Word clearly? When he speaks, does he really hold the inter</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">est of </span><span class="font23">his audience? Is he a regular publisher, zealous in the field ministry? regular in attending meetings? a fine example in Christian living? And is he spiritually mature? In the case of one being assigned to give public talks, the answer to each of these questions ought to be Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Only the very best speakers arc listed for giving public talks in congregations other than their own. However, there may also be others who are spiritually qualified and who do fairly well as speakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Locally the brothel's may enjoy hearing them; so arrangements may be made for them to give talks in their own congregation, even though they are not at present being sent out to serve other congregations. While the committee decides who qualify to give public talks, the congregation servant is the one who assigns the specific talks to be prepared by the individual speakers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In order to have a variety of talks, it is often necessary to obtain speakers from nearby congregations. Such arrangements are always to be approved by the overseer of the speaker’s home congregation. After that approval has been obtained, a personal letter is sent to the speaker himself, confirming the subject on which he is to talk, providing the address of the meeting place and the time of the public meeting, along with information concerning arrangements for field service that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Normally, those who are appointed servants in a congregation are assigned to give public talks in other congregations only once a month, so that these assignments do not unnecessarily interfere with their caring for responsibilities in their home congregation. However, in some places, to keep the public talks going on a regular basis in the congregations it is necessary for some speakers to be away to give public talks more than once a month. That is all right, provided that the speaker himself is willing to take on the additional responsibility and it will not unduly interfere with his caring for his specific assignment of service in his home congregation. If a brother is assigned to give a talk in a congregation that is a considerable distance away, he may travel there ahead of time and arrange to share with the brothers there in the service during the day. However, if the congregation is close by, either in the same city or nearby, the speaker may prefer to work with his home congregation that day, going to the other congregation only for the meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When a speaker travels a considerable distance, arriving the day before the talk is to be given, it is the privilege of the brothers in the congregation to extend to him Christian hospitality* Even if he arrives on the day of the talk, it is a kind thing to invite him to share a meal. (Item. 12:13) The congregation servant usually makes arrangements for this, but if you let him know that you will be glad to help out, you may have the opportunity to enjoy the upbuilding association of some of these mature brothers in your own home.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Forming New Congregations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23" style="text-decoration:underline;">yy</span><span class="font23"> S THE preaching of the good news is ac-</span><span class="font25" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Lx'tL</span><span class="font23"> coniplished and sheeplike ones are gathered into Jehovah's organization, the number of congregations also increases. (Ads 14:21-23) Sometimes a group of dedicated and baptized publishers who have been carrying on their ministry in a locality isolated from other congregations is organized into a congregation. Or it may be that a congregation already in operation has grown large, or that the size of the Kingdom Hall or the distance that some travel to the meetings makes it advisable to form a new congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In any event, if a congregation is to be formed, it must be made up of a group of ministers, dedicated and baptized servants of Jehovah God who really love him and want to advance the interests of true worship* There should also be available enough qualified persons to care for the work of the appointed servants. It is not good to be hasty, only to have a congregation that is too weak to fund ion properly. Those who make up the group ought to appreciate that there arc responsibilities as well as privileges attached to their being organized into a congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The matter should be thoroughly discussed by those involved, whether an isolated group of publishers, or the congregation committee in the case of division of an already-existing congregation. Then, before the application for formation of the congregation is filed with the Society, it. is usually advisable to discuss the matter with the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In naming our congregations we follow the Biblical precedent, designating each congregation by the name of the city or town in which it is located. (1 Cor. 1:2; 1 Thess. 1:1) If more than one congregation functions within a city, then a geographic designation describing its location is added as a unit name. For example: New York, New York, Congregation, Brooklyn Heights Unit; or Saginaw, Michigan, East Unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Society deals with each unit as a separate congregation, sending supplies directly to it and receiving its monthly service report. However, one of the congregation servants is also appointed by the Society as city servant. He does not exercise any jurisdiction over any unit other than his own. However, the Society may wish to communicate with him at times in connection with arrangements for assemblies and other matters. He may also be called on by the overseers of the other units for counsel if some special need arises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">SMALL CONGREGATIONS AND ISOLATED PURUSHERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Small congregations, whether newly formed or longer in operation, endeavor to arrange the same program of theocratic activity as larger ones. Material is provided for them to use as the basis for their congregation meetings, and they have the same responsibility as to public proclamation of the “everlasting good news” as their brothers elsewhere do.—Rev. 14:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even if there are only a few in attendance at the congregation meetings, there can be an interchange of encouragement. Discussion of the study material provided by the Society will be upbuilding. Furthermore, as Jesus Christ said: “Where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.” (Matt. 18:20) So* the meetings are no less important just because the attendance may be comparatively small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Regardless of the size of the congregation, the regular study procedure can be followed at the Wcfctower study and the congregation book study. If there are not enough persons to prepare all the various service meeting parts, at least they can read and discuss the material together. Similarly, adjustments can be made in the Theocratic Ministry School. If possible, it is good to arrange for the instruction talk to be given as a model talk each week and to have at least one student talk on which counsel is given. But, if necessary, the other assignments can be covered by somewhat informal reports, discussions between two sisters, questions and answers or simply reading the published information. For public meetings, local brothers can no doubt give talks from time to time; occasionally, arrangements can probably be made for visiting speakers, and this will be a stimulus to the group. And, when no speaker is available, the group can even read together one of the extensive outlines provided by the Society and look up the scriptures together. Thus, all congregations, regardless of size, can benefit to the full from the spiritual “food at the proper time” that is being provided through the “faithful and discreet slave/’-—Matt. 24:45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If a congregation is composed entirely of sisters, various ones who are spiritually mature and humble will be designated as substitutes to care for the work of the appointed servants until such time as qualified brothers are available. Of course, in recognition of the theocratic arrangement of things, sisters who pray or preside at congregation meetings, because of the absence of a qualified male, wear a head covering. (1 Cor. 11:3-16) With head properly covered, the sisters designated by the Society preside at the various meetings—in most cases, simply seated facing the group. None of the sisters give actual discourses at their meetings, but they read and comment on the material provided by the Society, doing so from their seats. For variety, they may also cover some things by discussions lx?tween two of them of* in demonstrations. When counseling other sisters in the Theocratic Ministry School, the one conducting that meeting usually just reads excerpts from the Society’s publications, thus letting the publications do the teaching. But if a male enrolls in the school, she leaves the counseling of him to the circuit servant. When a </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">qualified</span><span class="font23"> male becomes available in the congregation, the circuit servant notifies the Society, and that brother is appointed as congregation servant, Watcftfoioer study servant, Theocratic Ministry School servant and congregation book study servant. However, until such time as there are other qualified brothers there, the sisters may continue to assist by caring for work normally done by the other appointed servants. This makes it possible for those associated with the congregation to have all their various needs in connection with the ministry given adequate attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When the Society is advised of a publisher or a group of publishers living in territory not assigned to any congregation, provision is made to care for their spiritual needs too. If possible, that territory will be assigned to a nearby congregation so that, they will be given attention as part of a congregation of Jehovah's people. If the congregations arc too far away, they can still arrange to have some or all of the regular congregation meetings, and the Society will supply them with literature and receive reports from them just as it. does from the congregations everywhere. In time, perhaps a congregation can be organized. No matter where we may be on earth, we need to keep in close touch with Jehovah's organization and active in the work of disciple-making. The Lord is with us when we do his will, so we should press on in the work with full confidence in him.—</span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font23"> Tim. 4:7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font28">T</span><span class="font23">O STIMULATE the'spiritual growth of all the congregations of Jehovah’s, servants, provision is made by the Society for periodic visits by traveling overseers. Some of these visit congregations; others visit circuits, and yet others serve the Society's branch offices and missionary homes.

<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">CIRCUIT mVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To assist all congregations, large and small, as well as isolated publishers, the Society arranges for regular visits by circuit servants, who are appointed by the Society. These spiritually &quot;older men” view matters as did the apostle Faul, who, after having worked with the brothers in quite a number of places, said: “Above all things, let us return and visit the brothers in every one of the cities in which we published the word of Jehovah to see how they arc/* And he did just that, “strengthening the congregations'* as he served them. (Acts 15:36, 41) Today, as the circuit servants make their'visits, they too strengthen the congregations. They do this principally by giving attention to the spiritual needs of the brothers, by working with them in the field ministry and by checking the congregation organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The congregations and isolated groups visited by a circuit servant are termed a circuit. (1 Sam. 7:15, 16) The servant, plans his route so as to visit each congregation in his circuit about once every four months, staying there for about a week on each occasion. Time is also set aside to serve publishers, pioneers, special pioneers and missionaries who arc not living in congregation territory<sup>7</sup>. Some isolated publishers may be assisted while he is serving a nearby congregation. If two groups arc close together, he may decide Io divide a week be tween them. But in the case of isolated pioneers, special pioneers and missionaries, he slays for a full week with them, holding meetings, helping them to improve their personal ministry and strengthening them spiritually for the work ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Before the circuit servant visits your congregation, there is much that your overseer does by way of preparation to enable everyone to benefit to the full from the visit. When notice is received, about two months in advance, that the circuit servant is coming, the overseer may find it necessary to submit an order for additional magazines for the week of special activity, including whatever number the circuit servant has requested for himself. Handbills are also ordered for the public talk to be given. Locations from which field service will be carried out need to be selected and arrangements made for sleeping accommodations and meals for the circuit servant and his wife, if he is married. All this requires considerable time. Then, during the few weeks before the circuit servant’s arrival, publishers are reminded of their appointments to go along in service with him: territory is selected to be worked by the group; pioneers, servants and the entire congregation are notified of special meetings and the times they will be held: congregation records are brought together for the circuit servant to check; and arrangements arc made for the overseer and the circuit servant to visit publishers who may need spiritual help and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When the circuit servant is with your congregation, all the regular meetings are held and some special ones too. It is a week of spiritual feasting. At the start of his visit, on Tuesday night, the Theocratic Ministry School and service meeting </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">programs </span><span class="font23">arc conducted in somewhat shortened form (forty-five minutes each), followed by forty minutes of upbuilding counsel and Scriptural information from the circuit servant for the entire congregation. He also informs the congregation as to when and where the groups will meet for service during the week. Thursday night is set aside for the congregation book studies* Saturday night another special meeting is held for about an hour and fifteen minutes. At that time the circuit servant, discusses with everyone present the spiritual condition of the congregation, their ministry and what he recommends for improvement. Part of the program is devoted to a stimulating review of new things learned through </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font23">in recent months, and part is a Scriptural service talk. It is a most practical program. Then on Sunday, at the time scheduled by the congregation, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the public </span><span class="font23">talk is given (usually by the circuit servant), the WaicMoicer study is held and there is a beneficial concluding thirty-minute talk by the circuit servant. Certainly this spiritual provision is an evidence that Jehovah is providing for his people generously, just as he promised that he would do.—Isa. 65:13, 14; MaL 3:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Ordinarily the regular congregation meetings arc conducted by the appointed servant during the circuit servant’s visit, and the circuit servant may offer private counsel to the conductor. However, at times the Society may request the circuit servant to conduct a certain meeting for one or more rounds of the circuit in order for the local servants to benefit from his example. Notification of any such adjustment is provided well in advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The week of his visit is also one of increased field service for the congregation, and the circuit servant will be pleased to go along with you. Would you like help to improve your house-to-house activity or your back-call ministry? Do you wish that you had a home Bible study to conduct or would you appreciate suggestions on the one you now have? We feel sure that the circuit servant can be of help to you, and that is one of the principal reasons why he visits your congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Generally, the circuit servant plans to spend at least twenty-five hours in the service while he is with your congregation. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are full days, calling for about six hours of service a day. Saturday and Sunday are scheduled with three or four hours of service each. One day may be set aside to feature magazine distribution, and service time on the other days is usually equally divided between house-to-house work and back-call or Bible study work. In order to accomplish the most work, the group starts early each morning, the time being determined by what is suitable in the locality. Could you arrange to make this a special week of service along with the circuit servant? We would like to suggest that you do. We know that Jehovah will richly reward your effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If the circuit servant is married and his wife travels with him. she, too, will be sharing in the field service. Usually she is a pioneer. Mo schedule is made for her to work with other publishers, but she may be glad to work with the sisters or other publishers, and, in that case, arrangements for it arc made under the direction of her husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Considerable time is sot aside during the wook to give special attention to the appointed servants and pioneers. First, on Tuesday afternoon the circuit servant checks all the congregation records, both to be sure that they are being kept properly and to gather information that will help him to be of service to the congregation. Early Tuesday night there is a half-hour meeting with the servants to discuss what has been accomplished in the congregation since the circuit servant’s previous visit and to outline what lias been planned for the week. On Friday night, or at some other convenient time, the members of the committee meet with the circuit servant for an hour or two to discuss in detail the needs of the congregation, including the recommendations for servants, if necessary. And early Saturday night all the servants come together with the circuit servant to hear his comments on the needs of the congregation and to plan what, they as servants will be doing to improve the spiritual condition of the congregation in the months ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">On Saturday afternoon there is a meeting with pioneers and special pioneers (and vacation pioneers are welcome, if they want to attend), to assist them with any problems and to offer beneficial counsel and suggestions. The circuit servant also makes it a point to work with each one of them in the service during the week. The Society is very much interested in these brothers and sisters who are spending so much of their time in the field ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The circuit, servant is keenly interested in the training of publishers and pioneers, with a view to their aiding others to become better qualified ministers of the good news. So, during the week of his visit, as he becomes acquainted with the capabilities of the various ones, he makes definite arrangements for the more capable ones to give personal assistance to those who need it in some feature of their service. He also takes note of any who have not been able to arrange their affairs to spend at least ten hours in the field service each month and, as opport unity affords, discusses the matter with them individually in a kind and constructive way. Where possible, he actually helps them to work out a schedule that fits their circumstances and that allows for a greater share in preaching the Kingdom message. Likewise, he has a keen interest in any who may be assisted to become vacation pioneers, regular pioneers, missionaries or* members of a Bethel family. He is glad to discuss the prospects with them and, if possible, help them to see how to overcome any obstacles that may be in their way. If you wish that you could enjoy such service privileges, talk to him about it. His own experience in special service as well as his constant contact with many others who enjoy such privileges gives him a vast fund of practical knowledge from which to draw in offering suggestions for your benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Full as the program of activity of the circuit servant is, he is still not too busy to take time to offer a helping hand to any “sheep” who may have strayed from the flock or become spiritually ill. He is, first of all, a shepherd of the Hock of God. Usually he devotes an evening during the week to making visits on those in need of aid. Additionally, he may take a little time during the day to make calls on former publishers, if there is reason to believe they can be revived, and irregular ones who need to be strengthened. Sometimes keen interest in the spiritual welfare of other publishers requires calls too, Even when attention to those matters cuts down to some extent the hours that he is able to devote to the field ministry, he takes time for it, because he is deeply concerned about the welfare of all of Jehovah's people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At. the conclusion of his visit to each congregation, he makes out a Report on Congregation for the Society and leaves a copy of it with the overseer for the use of all the appointed servants. He also leaves a resume of other suggestions that he has made to the servants during the week so that they will have them available for consultation and can follow through on them. Thus the benefits of his visit do not cease when he leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Since the circuit servant travels to a different congregation each week, he usually does not have a permanent residence. In this respect he is like Jesus, who, though welcome in the homes of many lovers of the truth, had no place that he could really call his own, where he could lay his head at the close of a day. (Matt, 8:20; Mark 10:29, 30) It is the privilege of the local congregation to provide sleeping accommodations and meals for him and his wife, if possible. They endeavor to be, not a burden to the congregation, but, rather, a blessing. With that in mind, they urge those with whom they eat to keep in mind what Luke 10:38-42 says. Nothing elaborate is really necessary; instead, placing emphasis on spiritual matters is choosing the truly <sup>4</sup>'good portion.&quot; The circuit servants have a full program of activity for the week and they need their sleep to care for it properly, so they are not able to spend much time visiting socially. But they do appreciate the hospitality of their Christian brothers and endeavor to reward them richly in a spiritual way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At the close of each month when the circuit servant and his wife send their field service reports to the Society, they also submit a report on expenses incurred, provided they were not covered by the congregations. Such expenses for which the Society reimburses the circuit servant include transportation between congregations, but not expenses for getting around in the congregation territory. The Society will also cover food and lodging, if some congregations are not able to make provision. In addition, a small monthly allowance is sent, for personal things, and the fact that they obtain literature at pioneer rates provides a little more to keep them going in the work. They have confidence that, as Jesus promised, if they seek continually the interests of Jehovah’s kingdom, the material needs will be provided. —Luke 12:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The line service provided by these mature brothers is greatly appreciated by Jehovah’s people everywhere. It enables all of us to be better pralsers of God, to enjoy close contact with the Society and to stand firm in the faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">DISTRICT SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Another one of the traveling overseers of Jehovah’s witnesses is the district servant. A number of circuits comprise a district, and, as the overseer of the district, the district servant regularly visits and works in the ministry with those who are circuit servants as well as serving as the principal speaker at circuit assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The district servant has a keen interest in the field ministry and, though he spends considerable time on organizational matters, he devotes eighty-five hours to house-to-house work, back-calls and Bible studies each month. Some months it may be less than that if there are many spiritually weak publishers who need special attention, but he always tries to set a zealous lead in the field work. If he is married, his wife, too, is a preachei’ of the Kingdom message, as all of Jehovah’s witnesses are, and usually she is a pioneer, reporting at least a hundred hours in the field service each month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Society schedules the district servant to spend two weeks at a time in each circuit. One week he works with the circuit servant as he cares for his regular activity in serving a congregation. The other week he spends in the city where the circuit assembly is being held. His accommodations and expenses are cared for in the same manner as those of the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If your congregation is the one to be served by the circuit servant during the week that the district servant is with him, your overseer will be notified ahead of time so that adequate arrangements can be made. The circuit servant does his checking of records earlier than usual that week, and then on Tuesday afternoon he has the opportunity (along with his wife) to sit down with the district servant and discuss their ministry and any problems that may need attention. It is a special provision to build him up, so that he, in turn, can be a continued blessing to you. During the week the district servant will attend the meetings with the congregation, servants and pioneers. He observes how the circuit servant handles his work so that he can offer constructive suggestions for improvement. But he is not there simply to check up on the circuit servant; he is a fellow worker in the service of God, willing to share in what needs to be done and conscious of the importance of spiritually upbuilding and encouraging his brother. (Acts 11:23; Deut. 3:28) The district servant also shares to the full in the service arrangements for the week. He sets aside some time to work with the circuit servant and his wife, and there is also opportunity for you and others of the publishers to receive training from the district servant, just as you do from the circuit servant. Toward the end of the week, the district servant will give some talks to the congregation, taking the last half hour of the Saturday-night program and a half hour after the </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font23">study on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The first part of the other week of the district servants visit in the circuit is usually spent with the congregation in whose territory the semiannual circuit assembly is to be held. Tuesday evening he gives an hour service talk to the congregation, and the next two days he spends in the field service with them. In the evenings he may show one of the Society’s films in nearby congregations. In the meantime, the circuit servant usually is very busy with arrangements in connection with the forthcoming assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The district servant, too, directs much of his attention toward assembly matters during the week because he is the assembly chairman* On Tuesday afternoon he gets together with the circuit servant to compile and discuss the information on the analysis report forms submitted by the congregations in the circuit, showing what they have been doing in the service, their meeting attendance, and so forth. This provides a basis for offering constructive counsel to the entire circuit* The assembly program itself usually begins on Friday night and extends through Sunday afternoon. Included in the arrangements is a meeting of congregation servants with the district and circuit servants on Saturday afternoon, followed by a stimulating meeting with those who are interested in pioneer service. The entire assembly is an occasion of spiritual refreshment, and extensive advertising is done to invite the public*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">During the course of the assembly the district servant has opportunity to observe the operation of the assembly organization and to offer suggestions, The circuit servant is principally responsible for the assembly arrangements, obtaining the hall, immersion pool, and so forth* However, to assist him the Society appoints, on recommendation from the circuit servant, various permanent assembly personnel: an assembly servant, an assistant assembly servant and a public relations servant. They work closely with the circuit servant in supervising the assembly organization, so that the circuit servant can give more attention to the program. Other capable brothers, too, are designated by the circuit servant to care for various departments, and, if you would like to help, volunteers are always needed during the assembly to handle the great amount of work that is entailed in putting on an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Funds for operating circuit assemblies and defraying other circuit expenses are cared for by contributions from the brothers in the circuit, and for that reason contribution boxes are provided at the assembly. A circuit accounts servant appointed by the circuit servant keeps a record of this money and pays bills that have been approved by the circuit servant. If there is not enough money on hand to care for the initial expenses, the circuit servant may advise the congregations in the circuit of their privilege to assist with expenses. But usually after the first assembly in any circuit there are sufficient funds on hand to care for the initial expenses of the next assembly <sub>t</sub> Between assemblies this money is often deposited with the Society. However, if there is a deficit at the conclusion, of the assembly, it is the responsibility of the congregation overseers to decide among themselves what contribution their congregations can make to the circuit fund to care for the expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When any purchases of equipment for the circuit arc made, when donations are made to the Society or there are other expenditures out of the ordinary, these matters are decided by the congregation overseers at their meeting on Saturday afternoon at the assembly. They are in position to consider what funds are available in the circuit, what expenses must be met in connection with the assembly, and so forth. They also know if their own congregation is in position to contribute toward extra expenses that may be incurred. Authorization of such expenditures is always put in writing in the form of a resolution, which is voted on only by the overseers. To keep the brothers, informed of the standing of the accounts and how the money that they have contributed is being used, a brief statement of receipts and disbursements is made up for each assembly and read to all the brothers by the circuit servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Knowing to some extent how the circuit assembly organization functions should sharpen your appreciation for it. The provision of these assemblies is to keep you spiritually strong. Be sure that you always benefit from them to the full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;">ZONE SERVANT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even branch servants, who have general oversight of the congregations and the preaching work in an entire country or group of lands, are visited and assisted by other responsible servants in Jehovah’s organization. The president of the Society periodically visits all the branch offices to inspect them and handle problems. But in addition to his visits, arrangements are made for persons who are appointed by the Society through the president to visit the bi'anch offices and printing plants of the Society as well as all the missionary homes. These brothers are known as zone servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">They check the records of each branch, analyze its oversight of the congregations and what is being accomplished in the field service. They attend congregation meetings with these brothers and work with them in the field ministry. Usually these zone servants are themselves branch servants, so they can appreciate the problems that arise and w<sup>T</sup>ork them out with the brothers whom they are serving. Later, when they are back in the branch offices where they are assigned as branch servants, a zone servant visits there and provides the same service for them. So, there is, indeed, an interchange of encouragement. Everyone in the organization, the congregation publisher and the responsible overseer alike, is strengthened with a sense of interdependency, just as the various parts of a human body serve for the common good of the whole body. And as each one in the organization is drawn close to his follow servants in loving unity, he is also brought closer to Jesus Christ, the head of the Christian congregation, and to Jehovah God, whose spirit permeates the entire organization and whose Word guides its operation in harmony with his righteous purpose. —1 Cor. 12:12-31; Eph. 1:22, 23; Prov. &lt;3:5, 6.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Financing the Preaching Work</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">QUESTION frequently asked by persons C who are newly associated with Jehovah’s witnesses is, Who provides the money for carrying on this work? The answer is that Jehovah’s witnesses every where have a part in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There is never any solicitation of funds, but the brothers are aware of the great amount of work being done by the Society in connection with the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom in all the earth, they know that it requires money, and they want to have a share in providing it. They arc free to send voluntary contributions to the nearest branch office of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society. They are like God’s servants in ancient times who brought, ‘everyone whose heart impelled him, a voluntary offering to Jehovah/ (Ex. 35:20-29) Most of the donations received are in relatively small amounts, but those, when added together, provide enough to keep the work going. (Luke 21:1-4) Some gifts are received from estates, under wills of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is a privilege to share in this way in furthering the work in all parts of the earth, and none need feel that what they are able to offer is too little to be worthwhile, As 2 Corinthians 8:12 says: “If the readiness is there first, it is especially acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what a person does not have.” Contributions arc received by the Society from individuals, congregations and circuits. The Society appreciates the donations that are made and acknowledges them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">None of this money is used to enrich individuals; it is all put to work to advance the preaching of the good news of the Kingdom. It is used to build and maintain printing plants where Bible literature is produced; and the full-time workers who care for this work are supplied with “sustenance and covering” and a small allowance for personal expenses. (1 Tim. 6:8) Others who are devoting all their time and energy to the ministry as missionaries, special pioneers, circuit and district servants arc also given assistance so that they will have the food and shelter required as they carry on their work. Additionally, literature is provided at less than cost to all these full-time workers as well as to pioneers and vacation pioneers to help defray their expenses. This is made possible by contributions to the Society from you and your brothers everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In addition to these contributions to the Society, the individuals associated with each congregation support their own Kingdom Hall and care for any other expenses locally. No collection is ever taken, but contribution boxes are provided at our meetIng places so that each one can have a part “just as he has resolved in his heart/’—2 Cor. 9:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Furthermore, you generously contribute time and effort to the preaching work in your territory. You are willing to bear your own expenses in this, and you expect no money in return for the assistance that you offer to those with whom you study the Bible. As is true of Jehovah’s witnesses everywhere, you apply the instructions of Jesus Christ, who said: &quot;You received free, give free.” (Matt. 10:8) The appointed servants in your congregation view<sup>r</sup> things in the same way. Though they do much extra work in caring for the congregation, they are paid no salary for this. They serve because of love for Jehovah and for his “sheep/* With you, they are glad to expend themselves in Jehovah’s service. Yes, Jehovah’s people find happiness in giving.-—Acts 20:35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Keeping the Congregation Clean</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">x XI only the appointed servants, but every Cx one of Jehovah’s witnesses should be deeply inteT'CSted in maintaining the peace and unity of the congregation. (1 Pet. 3:10, 11) It is of primary importance that we be at peace with God and that we actively demonstrate our love for him. </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font23"> John 6) But the Bible is frank in saying that &quot;he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen/’ (1 John 4:20) So we cannot honestly profess to love Jehovah God if we are harboring animosity toward our Christian brothers and sisters. Jesus Christ said: “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves,” (John 13:35) Failure to demonstrate that quality would mean that one was not walking in Jesus* footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even when someone offends us, love ought to move us to be forgiving. On this the Scriptures counsel: “Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also.” (Col. 3:13) This does not mean that Christians approve of wrongdoing, but they realize that all are imperfect, and they deal kindly with one another, just as they want God to deal with them.—Matt, 6:12, 14, 15; 18:21-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">So, when difficulties arise between members of the congregation, mature Christians do not venge-fully seek to cause injury to the one who injured them. (1 Pet. 3:8, 9) Nor do they coolly refuse to talk to him anymore. (1 Cor. 13:4, 5; Eph. 4:26) Where possible, they simply overlook offenses against them, especially so when they realize that they have not been committed with malice. —Eph. 4:32; Prov. 19:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">But what if the sin committed was a serious matter? What if it has caused a serious breach between you and the other person? Or what if you believe that it might result in harm to other individuals in the congregation simply to forget the incident? What steps should you take?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Gossiping to others is not the answer; that would only make the situation worse. Furthermore, the Bible does not say that you should first ask your Christian overseer to talk to the offender. You have a responsibility. At Matthew 18:15 it is written: “If your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault [reprove him J between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.” If the wrongdoei' knew that he had done wrong, was repentant and had taken steps to set matters right, of course, this would usually not be necessary- But when he does not initiate that action, the Bible admonishes you as the one against whom the sin was committed to approach the wrongdoer. This is to be done, not in an angry frame of mind, but to ‘gain your brother/ When the approach is made in a kindly way, usually a reconciliation is readily brought about. Thus the wrongdoer is helped to bring his life back into line with God's Word. But what if the difficulty persists and does not appear to be something that you can dismiss?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Take the next stop, the one set out at Matthew 18:16: “If he does not listen, take along with you one or two more, in order that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.&quot; That docs not mean that you should round up sympathizers, persons who you feel sure will side in with you. Seek the aid of mature Christian brothers. It may be that, while the offender was previously inclined to brush the matter aside as of little account or was actually inclined to continue in a course contrary to Christian principles, now he will be impressed with the seriousness of the situation. The mature brothers whom you take with you may offer helpful Scriptural counsel, and perhaps there will be favorable response to it. Everyone concerned will be glad to have the matter rectified. On the other hand, if there is a belligerent rejection of what the Scriptures say, if there is a determination 1o continue in an unchristian course, there will be two or three witnesses to this. In such a case, when the person docs not listen, rejecting all efforts at reconciliation and spurning the counsel of God's Word. Jesus admonished, “speak to the congregation.&quot; (Matt. 18:17) That is, to the “older men&quot; in the congregation who are responsible servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Seldom will it be necessary to carry the matter this far, though. Usually difficulties can be settled between the two persons involved. Your accepting the responsibility to handle problems in this loving way is a contribution to the spiritual welfare of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There are other important contributions that you personally can make to the spiritual health of the congregation too. You can help to keep the organization morally clean, free of corrupting influences. All of us can do this, and we should, not leaving it to the overseer as if it. were all his problem. If we maintain fine conduct, observers are moved to glorify God. But if a person engages in loose conduct* he causes the way of the truth to be spoken of abusively. (1 Pet. 2:12; 2 Pct. 2:2) When you resist temptation to wrongdoing you are contributing to the moral cleanness of the organization. The same is true when you refuse to feed your mind on ideas that stimulate wrong desires. Parents, by properly training and disciplining their children so that they walk in the paths of righteousness, contribute to the fine reputation of Jehovah's organization. So do younger persons, by obedience to their parents and by refusing to imitate the world and its ways. When you take care to teach interested persons the Bible’s high moral standards before they get baptized, this, too, acts to keep the organization clean. These are things that it is most important to do, so that the spirit of God may continue to operate freely on the congregation.—1 Cor. 5:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">HELP FOK THOSE OVERT AKEN IN SIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Nevertheless, it may happen that someone who is a dedicated and baptized witness of Jehovah gets involved in unchristian conduct or he may be doing things that can easily lead to trouble. He may not even realize the seriousness of the situation. What can be done about it? Galatians 6:1, 2 says: “Brothers, even though a man takes some false step before he is aware of it, you who have spiritual qualifications try to restore such a man in a spirit of mildness, as you each keep an eye on yourself, for fear you also may be tempted. Go on carrying the burdens of one another, and thus fulfill the law of the Christ.” So, the appointed servants, and perhaps other spiritually mature ones, will lovingly endeavor to help the erring one to view things in Jehovah's way and to make straight paths for his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">More often, though, a baptized Christian knows what the Bible says about conduct that is pleasing to God, and if he has become involved in anything that Is Scripturally wrong he is aware of it. True, what he did may not have been premeditated; he may have been overcome in temptation before he realized it. But now, as he looks back, he knows that he has been displeasing to Jehovah* What should he do? He ought to go to God humbly in prayer through Jesus Christ, confess his wrong and seek forgiveness, (Fs. 32:5; 1 Tim. 2:5) Then he should take steps to avoid any circumstances that will lead to repetition of the wrong. All of us are imperfect and fall short of God’s standard of righteousness. (Rom. 3:23) That is why Jesus, in teaching his followers how to pray, told them to include in their petition to God this request: &quot;Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.”—Matt. 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When serious difficulties begin to arise, however, it is also wise to seek the counsel of a mature Christian brother. That brother could be the congregation overseer or one of The other members of the committee. Additionally, in some places, there arc other men of comparable maturity in the congregation, and they, too, may be approached with confidence when one is in need of help. Jehovah, who knows our weaknesses, has lovingly arranged for us to have help from these brothers when we need it the most. Note what James 5:14-16 states in connection with this: “Is there anyone [spiritually&quot;] sick among you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Let him call the older men of the congregation to him, and let them pray over him, greasing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also, if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him. Therefore openly confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may get healed. A righteous man's supplication, when it is at work, has much force.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The assistance that mature men can render is a provision that Jehovah has made for our good, and not just an arrangement whereby certain ones are appointed to check up on what everyone else does. Obviously, when a person commits grievous sins it is evidence of spiritual weakness. A person in this position needs help to overcome his difficulties, and is wise if he asks for that help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There is grave danger in not asking for assistance. If a brother in difficulty fails to do so, he may just find that he will become habituated in a course of sin until he becomes irreformable or, even if he does not repeat the wrong, he may draw away from association with Jehovah’s organization for fear that someone may learn of his wrong act. (Prov. 18:1) I low much better for the erring one to acknowledge humbly that there are times when he needs help and so avail himself of the loving provision Jehovah has made!</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Remember what is recorded at Proverbs 28:13: “He that is covering over his transgressions will not succeed, but he that is confessing and leaving them will be shown mercy.” So if someone has fallen into sinful conduct and is really sorry about it, he shows that, not by covering over his transgression, but by confessing it, seeking help, and thereafter carefully avoiding the circumstances that might lead to* a repetition of the wrong. In this way he can be restored spiritually and again enjoy Jehovah’s warm smile of approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Regardless of the spiritual assistance that a mature brother may give to one in difficulty, however, there are certain types of cases that always should be brought to the attention of the congregation committee. These are lying, stealing, drunkenness and other serious offenses when they have been </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">committed repeatedly.</span><span class="font23"> Such repeated sin is a serious matter, but if the wrongdoer has voluntarily confessed and sincerely wants to do what is right in Jehovah’s eyes, it may be that he can be helped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Certain other cases that may not involve repetition of a sin should also be brought to the attention of the committee. These include cases of sexual immorality involving other persons, whether committed by adults or dedicated and baptized minors, and other serious wrongdoing that has become public knowledge or that may readily become a matter of discussion in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">HE A KIN(iS BEFORE TEfJE COMMITTEE</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those servants in each congregation who arc charged with responsibility to hear matters such as these constitute the congregation committee. Usually this judicial committee, all of whom arc males, is made up of the congregation servant, the assistant congregation servant and the Bible study servant. However, on occasion one of the brothers may ask to step aside in a certain case, in order to assure impartiality, and then the other two select a third mature brother to complete the committee to hear the case. These qualified brothers are desirous of helping to bring about the spiritual restoration of any who have stumbled due to imperfection but who arc sincerely repentant, and they are also keenly aware of their obligation to protect the organization against any who may be ^turning the undeserved kindness of our God into an excuse for loose conduct” and who seek to corrupt the clean, trusting people of God.—Jude 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If you personally are ever a witness to serious wrongdoing on the part of a dedicated and bap-1 jzed member of the congregation, or if you come to know of it, loyalty to Jehovah and bis organization should move you to bring it to the attention of the responsible servants. (Ps. 31:23) It is no real kindness to the wrongdoer to conceal his unchristian conduct; it may only harden him in sin to the point where he cannot turn back, and so lead to his everlasting destruction. Certainly it shows no love for Jehovah God or his people when one becomes a party to wickedness by concealing those who practice it. One who loves righteousness and is truly loyal to God will courageously step forward and expose the sinful conduct and fearlessly testify to the truth of the matter before the committee when called on to do so, —Lev. o:l; Eph. 4:24; Luke 1:74, 75.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Whenever a charge of serious wrongdoing is made against a person, arrangements are made for the congregation judicial committee to hear the matter. Notification of the time of the meeting and its purpose is sent in writing to the one against whom the charge has been made. He is informed what his course of action is supposed to have been and he is treated in a kind manner. If he does not show up on the date set by the committee, then the committee considerately endeavors to find out what dale would be convenient to him. The person is given full opportunity to make a statement, and to present witnesses on his behalf before the committee, just as the committee is willing to hear other witnesses and those who are making charges. But refusal to come to the hearing, even the second time, will not prevent the committee from taking action if the evidence is clearly established.—Num. 16:12-14, 25-33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Judgment of matters affecting the fives of dedicated servants of Jehovah carries with it a great responsibility, and, fox* that reason, the committee is obligated to be sure that it has all the facts before it renders its decision. (1 Tim. 5:21; Prov. 18:13; Deut. 13:12-14) For a matter to be established as true, there must be two or three witnesses. (1 Tim. 5:19; Dcut. 19:15) These cannot, be persons who are simply repeating what they have heai'd from someone else; they must be witnesses of the things concerning which they testify. No action is taken if there is just one witness; it is not that the brothers discredit the testimony, but the Bible requires that, unless the wrongdoer himself confesses his sin, the facts must be substantiated by two or three witnesses in these serious matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">However, if a brother or a sister confesses a sin committed with another brother or sister and there arc no witnesses to prove it, would not the acceptance of that one's confession of guilt also obligate the committee to judge guilty the one charged as party to the sin? In such a case the one confessing is urged to follow the advice at Matthew 18:15-17, and the brothers make sure that each of the steps outlined there is taken. If the accused denies the charge throughout, and there is no further evidence to prove him guilty, then the Scriptures do not authorize those doing the judging to declare him guilty. He may be gudty, and, if he is, Jehovah knows that, and in time will see that the truth is brought to Light. (1 Tim. 5:24) At the same time, adhering to the Scriptural rule prevents any injustice. But what of the one who confessed the sinful conduct? This person is guilty of cither the sin confessed or of lying and bearing false witness against a fellow Christian, and, if thus guilty would, if repentant, be put on probation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If, in the course of a hearing before the committee, the required witnesses are available and it is definitely established that the accused did commit a sin warranting disfellowshiping, the committee endeavors to determine if there is basis for mercy. If there is not, then they are Scriptural ly obligated to disfellowship the wrongdoer. (1 Cor. 5:9-13) Although they may feel sorry for the wrongdoer, this is not by itself a sound basis for mercy. The basis for mercy lies in sincere repentance on the part of the wrongdoer. (2 Chron. 7:14; Isa. 55:7) He may say that he is sorry, but is he really cut to the heart over his sin and, out of love for Jehovah and his organization, does he really want to avoid any repe</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">tition of his wrong course? (Ezck. 18:30, 31} If </span><span class="font23">a person manifests indifference about the situation, or professes repentance but then persists in his wrong conduct, the divine requirements of justice may not be sidestepped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">DISFELLOWSIIITING</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When anyone is disfellowshipcd from the Christian congregation, a resolution is drawn up by the judicial committee and presented to the congregation, informing them that the individual has been disfellowshipcd for conduct unbecoming a Christian. The congregation is not invited to vote on this resolution. The committee is responsible for acting on behalf of the entire congregation, because they have made the investigation. Those who love Jehovah’s law and his righteousness will accept the decision made and not complain against those responsible for handling the matter. (Num. 16:41-50; Ps. 119:29, 30) Notification of the decision is sent by the committee to the Society, giving the date the action was taken, the grounds and evidence for it, and each member of the committee signs the letter. The Society then sends a disfellowshiped person’s card to the congregation, which is retained in the congregation’s file. Of course, if one who is disfellowshiped believes that the action of the committee was improper, he may appeal to the Society, but in doing so he should submit a copy of his letter to the committee of the congregation that took the action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Being disfcllowshiped is a serious matter. It means that one is expelled from the congregation; he can no longer enjoy the warm fellowship of faithful Christians and he is no longer recognized as a member of the congregation. The faithful members of the congregation therefore “quit mixing in company” with such a person. (1 Cor. 5:11, 13} Any baptized person who deliberately chooses a course of immoral conduct shows that he now rejects the teachings of the Bible, just as much so as one who openly teaches others contrary to what the Scriptures say about the identity of God, the provision of the ransom, the resurrection, and so forth. (Titus 3:10, 11) Concerning such persons God’s Word counsels: “Everyone that pushes ahead and does not remain in the teaching of the Christ does not have God. , . If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, never receive him into your homes or say a greeting to him. For he that says a greeting to him is a sharer in his wicked works.” (2 John 9-11) In faithfulness to God, none in the congregation should greet such persons when meeting them in public nor should they welcome these into their homes. Even blood relatives who do not live in the same home, valuing spiritual relationships more, avoid contact with them just as much as possible. And those who may be members of the same household with a disfcllowshiped person cease sharing spiritual fellowship with the wrongdoer. In this way the evildoer Is made to feel the enormity of his wrong, and, at the same lime, Jehovah upholds the good name of his organization and protects the spiritual well-being of those in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If a disfellowshipcd person wants to attend meetings to get himself restored spiritually, he is not prohibited from attending public meetings in the Kingdom Hall, provided he conducts himself properly. None will greet him, of course, and he may not attend any meetings held in private homes. The congregation will not assign him any terri’ lory in which to preach, nor will any service reports be accepted from him. If he wants to read the Society's publications, however, he may obtain copies for personal use. Perhaps what he reads will help to correct his thinking, soften his heart and move him to turn back to Jehovah*</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">REIN STATEMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If a disfellowshiped person comes </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">1o</span><span class="font23"> his senses, repents of his sins and manifests this beyond a reasonable doubt over a period of time, he may appeal in writing to the congregation servant for reinstatement. No plea for reinstatement will be considered for at least a year after disf cllowsh ip-ing, and in some cases even more. However, if sufficient time has elapsed, the committee may call him in and listen to what he has to say. IT they are convinced that he has had a change of heart and has had it for a considerable period of time, and if they believe that Jehovah God has forgiven him because of his contrite heart, and if they see that he is humbly desirous of doing Jehovah’s will, then there is a Scriptural basis for them to consider reinstatement. But if he has only very recently done anything about changing his ways, or seeks constantly to justify himself and does not show a humble spirit, then no proper basis for reinstatement exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In those cases where the committee decides that the Scriptures authorize them to reinstate a person, they draw up a resolution to that effect and read it to the congregation as notification that the individual has been reinstated. They also advise the Society of this action, returning the dis-fellowshiped person's card, bearing the date of reinstatement and the congregation servant's signature. The formerly disfellowshiped person can then be accepted back into the congregation as a brother. (2 Cor. 2:6-8) However, to test further his fitness to be back in the congregation and to afford opportunity to strengthen him spiritually, the committee will put him on probation, usually for at least a year, setting out certain reasonable restrictions regarding his conduct. During this time he may share freely in all features of the field ministry and he may comment in meetings, at the discretion of the conductor. However, until the termination of the probation period he may not appear on the platform at meetings for any reason other than to give student talks, nor will he be called on to represent the congregation in prayer. He will be advised when the probation ends, though no announcement of this is made to the congregat iom</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">One who is disfellowshiped is cut off, not only from the local congregation where he has been a<sup>J</sup> tending meetings, but from all the congregations of Jehovah's people everywhere. However, since the circumstances that led to the disfellowshiping are best known locally, the congregation that dis-fellowships is also the one that reinstates, even though the wrongdoer moves to another congregation. The congregation where he is currently associated may hear the person's plea and make its recommendation, with reasons, to the congregation that first handled the case, but the decision will be made by the now-existing committee of the first congregation. Similarly, the congregation that imposes probation is the one to terminate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">PROBATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Not ah cases of wrongdoing that arc brought to the attention of the committee lead to dis-fcllowshiping. Sometimes all that is needed is good counsel. Even if the sin was a serious one but there is basis for mercy because of the willing confession and sincere repentance of the dedicated and baptized person, and particularly so if it was a first offense, they may put the erring one on probation. Such probations are not usually announced, unless the wrongdoing has become generally known. It is up to the committee to decide if any announcement will be made. But if the person holds any appointment from the Society, whether as a servant or a pioneer, the Society is notified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Ordinarily the probation period runs for a year, during which time the committee observes the conduct of the person and provides needed assistance to strengthen him spiritually. If the individual is put on probation because of committing an act of sexual immorality with another person or if the probation for any wrongdoing is announced to the congregation, his privileges of service in the congregation will be restricted during the probation period. He may not continue as an appointed servant in the congregation during the time of such a probation, nor may he appear on the platform at meetings for any reason other than to give student talks, and he will not be called on to represent the congregation in prayer. However, he may share in the field ministry and comment in meetings, at the discretion of the conductor. Probation terms never include restrictions on eating or drinking nor do they require performance of certain service requirements, though appropriate counsel may be given. Yet if bad associations have led to the offense, these may be reasonably restricted to protect the individual from circumstances that might lead to a repetition of the sin. (1 Cor. 15:33; 2 Cor. 6:17) If the probation is not because of sexual immorality and no announcement is made to the congregation. it may not be necessary to restrict the individual’s service privileges, but that is something that the committee may decide. During the probation period provision is made for one of the committee to spend some time with the person each month to discuss Scriptural information appropriate to the person’s needs, with a view to building him up spiritually.—1 Thess. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If some person who is regularly associated with the congregation, but is not a dedicated and baptized Witness, gets involved in grossly unchristian conduct,, this is not ignored. Since the unbaptized person is really not a member of the congregation, he is not officially disfellowshiped from it or put on probation. Nevertheless, no one who seeks to corrupt Jehovah’s people is permitted to carry on his activity unrestrained. If a person simply does not. know the Bible’s requirements, kindly personal counsel may help him to straighten out. his paths. But if he does not love righteousness and is unrepentant, announcement can be made to the congregation 1o put them on guard against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Should it be that reports of openly reproachful conduct on the part of a baptized member of the congregation reach the committee, even though committed by one who no longer comes to meetings, it is their duty to inquire into the situation. One is not relieved of accountability simply by ceasing to associate with Jehovah’s people; the obligations that attend dedication and baptism are for life. If such a one deliberately chooses to live immorally, for example, or to take up false religious practices, he brings reproach on Jehovah’s organization, misrepresenting it before friends and acquaintances who know that he was baptized as a Witness. So it is the obligation of the committee to clear the congregation of any share in the responsibility for the wrong by taking definite action to expel such a person*—2 Cor. 7:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In the case of wrongdoing by minor children, the dedicated and baptized parents bear the responsibility for handling the situation; particularly is it the father’s responsibility. (Eph. 6:4; Col. 3:20) Il is up to them to decide what should be done to make amends for their child’s wrongs. If they feel that, certain restrictions should be placed on the child for a time, that is for them to work out, (Heb. 12:9) If the conduct engaged in by the child put the congregation in a bad light, then they ought to tell the committee what they have done to handle the situation. But as long as they are shouldering the responsibility, the committee is not going to try to step in and do the job, even in the case of dedicated and baptized minors. However, if any parents let their dedicated children engage in loose conduct and fail </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font23">keep them in check, the congregation committee may inquire into the situation, but they endeavor to do this through the parents, encouraging them to shoulder the responsibility for the children. Yet, if the parents continue to fail to take firm hold of the situation, even after loving counsel has been offered to them, then the congregation committee will take what steps arc needed in connection with the children to keep the congregation clean. Similarly, if a dedicated and baptized minor persists in serious wrongdoing, refusing to submit to probation imposed by his parents, the congregation will take action to dis-fellowship the persistently sinning youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">So it is seen that in the case of a youth whose parents, or at least one of them, arc members of the congregation, probation may be handled largely within the family circle. The committee should regularly be informed of what is being done in cases of serious wrong, but, as long as the parents take the matter in hand and the youth submits to their probation, it is proper for the parents to care for the situation. Likewise, in the case of a married person who sins against that one’s mate by committing adultery (and only for this offense). If the offender was overtaken In weakness but now is grief-stricken and confesses and asks forgiveness of the innocent mate, a period of probation may be imposed on the erring one. The committee should examine the case to decide if the erring one is truly repentant and whether there is a basis for merciful probation. If there is such a basis, then the faithful mate may institute and supervise the probation^ and a member of the committee will simply offer suitable help from time to time to assist in building up the erring one spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Our learning to live now in harmony with Jehovah’s requirements, maintaining cleanness in teaching and conduct, is preparation for life in God’s new system of things. Therefore it is vital for each one of us to impress God’s righteous precepts on his mind and heart. Accurate knowledge of God’s law will safeguard us against bringing great grief upon both ourselves and others because of ignorance, and love for what Jehovah shows us to be right will motivate us to act in harmony with it.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Opportunities to Share in Special Privileges of Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">NYDNE who truly finds his &quot;exquisite de-</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">CLXjL </span><span class="font23">light in Jehovah” rejoices at the prospect of added privileges of service. (Ps. 37:4; Isa. 58:14) He finds genuine pleasure in doing the will of God and is glad to take on additional responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To him it is no unpleasant burden but is the work that, more than anything else, he wants to do. —PS. 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The importance of moving ahead, reaching out for increased knowledge and improving the quality of service that we personally offer to God, is highlighted repeatedly in the Scriptures. The apostle Peter urged fellow believers to “go on growing in the undeserved kindness and knowledge of our Lord.” (2 Pet. 3:IS) Hebrew Christians were counseled to “press on to maturity.** (Heb. 6:1) The brothers in Corinth were admonished to “widen out/* to demonstrate by their actions their concern for other people. (2 Cor, 6: 13) Paul told the Philippians that his ministry on their behalf was Tor their advancement/ and he urged Timothy to apply himself to the ministry, that his “advancement may be manifest 1o all persons.** (Phil. 1:25; 1 Tim. 4:15) Because of the fine advancement made by some, the same apostle felt moved to write to the congregation of the Thessalonians: “We arc obligated to give God thanks always foi' you, brothers, as it is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of each and all of you is increasing one toward the other.”—2 Thess. 1:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The need for us to show increase in the use of what has been entrusted to us was forcefully illustrated by Jesus in a parable. He told of a certain man of noble birth who was about to travel abroad to secure kingly power and who called his servants to him and, entrusting each one with a mina, he told them to do business with it. “Eventually when he got back after having secured the kingly power, he commanded to be called to him these slaves to whom he had given the silver’ money, in order to ascertain what they had gained by business activity. Then the first one presented himself, saying, *Lord, your mina gained ten minas? So he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave!</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Because in a very small matter you have proved yourself faithful, hold authority over ten cities/ Now the second came, saying, ‘Your mina, Lord, made five minus/ He said to this one also, ‘You, too, be in charge of five cities/ ” Another slave, although he had not lost his mina, showed no increase, and he was judged unfaithful and what he had was taken from him. (Luke 19:12-26) Christ Jesus is the One to whom Jehovah has given kingly power </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font23">he has entrusted the privilege of participating in the ministry as Kingdom witnesses to all his followers, saying: &quot;Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">—Matt. 28:19*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">By this parable Jesus shows that approval is obtained, not by merely retaining what has been entrusted to us, but by working with if in such a way that we show an increase. Why so? Because this indicates a right and good heart condition. As Jesus explained in his parable of the sower: &quot;As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one a hundredfold, that one sixty, the other thirty.” (Matt. 13:23) One whose heart proves to be &quot;fine soil” is receptive to God’s Word and responsive to the direction of His organization, and, as a result, God blesses the work of his hands with increase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To show an increase we must apply ourselves, seeking to grow in a knowledge of Bible truth, availing ourselves of provisions made to help us improve our personal ability and participating zealously in the field ministry. At no point should we become complacent, adopting the attitude that we have done our part and now we will let others carry the load. Though our physical capabilities may limit us, if our hearts are filled to overflowing with gratitude to God we will continue to serve wholeheartedly. Additional opportunities to advance the interests of pure worship will always be to us, in the full sense of the word, pri-vitej/es </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">of service.</span><span class="font23"> We will respond to the Scriptural admonition: “Stay awake, stand firm in the faith, carry on as men, grow mighty. Let all your affairs take place with love/*—1 Cor. 16:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Every one of Jehovah’s witnesses, whether recently baptized or with many years of experience in the ministry, ought to have in mind enlarging his privileges of service. Each one, being progressive, would do well to have a goal in the ministry toward which ho is working—a goal that can be attained in a reasonable length of time and that will serve as a stepping-stone to further advancement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Basic to any real progress is regularity in participation. Do you have a share in the field ministry regularly each week? It is something that we all should endeavor to do. That is not a stepping-stone that can be skipped over, with the thought that other goals in the ministry can readily be reached even though this one is ignored. It deserves serious consideration and careful planning. There should be definite time set aside in your schedule each week for the field ministry. Having taken that step, you will find that the others arc easier, and your enjoyment or the service will gi ow as you hike each one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There are many features of service in which you can engage, and progressively you will want to include all of them in your regular program of activity. If you are physically able to do so, you no doubt engage in the house-to-house work, as did Jesus and his apostles. (Acts 20:20; 1 Cor. 11:1) But do you also make back-calls on each one who manifests interest in the good news? Are you regularly conducting a home Bible study? No doubt it was through such service that you were enabled to come to a knowledge of the truth, and this should help you to appreciate the importance of having a regular, weekly share in these fea* tures of service to aid others onto the way of life. No farmer goes into his field to sow seed and then abandons it, allowing the weeds to take over. He patiently cultivates, clears out weeds and then works diligently to gather in the harvest. (Jas* 5:7; 1 Cor. 3:9) So it should be with your ministry. Having talked to people about God’s purposes and placed literature with them, now you ought to cultivate the interest, patiently clear out obstacles to spiritual growth and aid them to produce ‘’righteous fruit, which is through Jesus Christ, to God’s glory and praise.” (Phil. 1:11) If you are not regularly participating in these important aspects of the ministry, make it a matter of prayer to God, ask one of the appointed servants for aid and apply yourself diligently to the work. If you are already sharing in these privileges of service, why not consider how you can improve your effectiveness so as to accomplish more in the time you do devote to the field ministry? As your progress in the ministry becomes more manifest, the rewarding joy that goes with such a productive course will be yours.—Matt. 25:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The need for mature ministers, those who are ready and willing to accept increased responsibility, is great. How many are there associated with your congregation who, due to lack of appreciation, are devoting only a few hours to the field service each month and showing little in the way of increase? They need the loving assistance of zealous ones who are willing to sit down and study w<sup>T</sup>ith them, help them to prepare sermons, aid them to improve their handling of problems met in the house-to-house work, go along with them on back-calls and help them to establish home Bible studies. They need personal instruction and encouragement. “We, though, who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those not strong, and not to be pleasing ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor in what is good for his upbuilding.” (Rom. 15:1, 2) Are you taking steps to make room in your ministry for this special privilege of service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Productive field ministry has resulted in increase in the number of congregations, and this too opens opportunities for special service. Over a period of years thousands of additional congregation overseers and tens of thousands of ministerial servants are needed. Yet this is not all. In nearly every congregation there are openings Tor mature brothers to enlarge their privileges by taking on servant responsibilities, for many of those now assigned hold two or three positions. The apostle Paul commends those who are reaching out for such service, saying: ‘&quot;If any man is reaching out for an office of overseer, he is desirous of a fine work.” (1 Tim. 3:1) It is not honor that they seek; they are desirous of work, a fine work; they want to do more in Jehovah’s service and to be of greater service to their Christian brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As we have already seen in the parable of the minas, a person shows himself worthy of being entrusted with greater responsibility by proving himself faithful and showing increase in caring for what has already been put into his care. If he is diligent and acquires skill in the house-to-house ministry, makes back-calls, conducts progressive Bible studies, is regular in all the available features of the service, handles each assignment on the congregation meetings in an upbuilding manner, goes out of his way to do things for his brothers, and manifests in all that he docs the fruits of God’s spirit, he is showing by his faithful course that he qualifies for additional privileges of service. In time he may be appointed as a ministerial servant, and when he has gained experience in connection with the work of each of the ministerial servants, he may, when the need arises, be appointed as congregation overseer. Of these, some</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">who are spiritually qualified, and circumstanl ially able, may even be entrusted with the responsibilities of circuit or district servants. They receive such appointments, not because they have gained the attention of some prominent brother, but because they have won the approval of God. Having proved themselves faithful in little things, they are blessed by God with greater responsibilities, (Ps. 75:5-7; Luke 16:10) Does the course that you are pursuing in the ministry give evidence that you are reaching out for these privileges of service?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There are other opportunities to share in special privileges of service too. As we consider them together, perhaps you will find that they are within your reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVTNG WHERE THE NEED IS GREATER</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">No matter where you live, there is work to be done in Jehovah’s service. Even though some territories have been covered repeatedly, continued preaching makes the name of the true God more prominent and aids those who sigh and groan over the detestable things being done in Christendom to embrace Jehovah’s loving provision for salvation. (Ezek. 9:4; 2 Pet. 3:15) There is no reason for ministers of God who live in such territories to slow down in their service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Yet there arc places where the need for Kingdom preachers is greater. In some areas the territory is not covered even once a year. Persons living there have had only limited opportunity to hear God’s Word. As reported in the Yearbook o/ </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s witnesses,</span><span class="font23"> there are even locations where so many persons want to study the Bible that the publishers there cannot care for them all. When we view those areas we are moved to say, as did Jesus: &quot;Yes, the harvest is great, but the workers are few. Therefore, beg the Master of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.” (Matt. 9:37, 38) The call for workers in the harvest is loud and clear. No other work being done on earth is as important as this urgent work of witnessing that Jehovah is having done under angelic supervision.-—Rev. 14:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Many have heard the call and have responded. They have felt as did the apostle Paul and his companions when Paul had a vision of a Macedonian man who was beseeching him and saying: “Step over into Macedonia and help us.” “Now as soon as he had seen the vision,” the account continues, “we sought to go forth into Macedonia, drawing the conclusion that God had summoned us to declare the good news to them.” (Acts 16:9, 10} So, today, those who have responded to the call feel that it is God who has summoned them and that it is he who, through his organization, has showed them this open door leading to enlarged service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Some who enjoy this service do so along with their congregation, devoting full weekends during the summer months to preaching in territories designated by the Society as being in special need of attention. Family groups may arrange their affairs to spend their vacation time each year in territory where the need is greater, using a portion of each day for the field ministry. Many who have done this report that these are the most refreshing and delightful vacations that they have had anywhere. Some individuals and families have even moved into these areas to live, so that they can advance the Kingdom interests where the need is particularly great. They are like the apostle Paul, who, having worked hard to preach and build up congregations in one area, was anxious to move out into new fields.—Rom. 15: 23, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Are you in position to take up service where the need is greater in the country where you are now living? Then feel free to write to the Society’s office for suggestions on locations. Tell the Society the name of your congregation, your age, date of baptism, what servant's position you have in the congregation and whether you arc married and have a family. If you have in mind a particular section of the country, be sure to mention this in your letter. If your desire is to move to another country to serve, write directly to the branch office responsible for the territory in which you are interested. Such a move requires careful planning and strong reliance on Jehovah; it can also bring rich blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">REGULAR PIONEER SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Another privilege that is open to qualified ministers is the regular pioneer service, in which one devotes a hundred or more hours each month to the field ministry. Is this something that you </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">could do? It is not really difficult. Just three hours </span><span class="font23">and twenty minutes a day, on an average, needs to be set aside for the actual field service, and the rest of the day remains in which you can care for other responsibilities. You may serve cither in your home territory or elsewhere. With careful planning, many thousands of Jehovah's witnesses find that, they can do it, and they rejoice to be able to express their love for Jehovah so fully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">This is a field of service to which every young person ought to give serious consideration. When he completes his years of required secular education, what is he going to do with his life? Does he truly Jove Jehovah and has he made an unreserved dedication of himself to God? Then there should be no doubt. He will serve Jehovah to the full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is true, there are some young folks who find themselves confronted with heavy responsibilities because of unfortunate situations that have developed at home; others have severe physical limitations. (1 Tim. 5:4) They may build their lives around their ministry, but their circumstances limit to some extent what they arc able to do in the direct field ministry. Yet no one, young or old, who truly loves God will shove the ministry into a secondary place so that he can devote the best of his time and effort to other activity simply because he prefers it. (Matt. 6:24, 33; 1 John 2: 15) When he got baptized in symbol of his dedication he was, in effect, saying before all observers that he loved Jehovah with all his heart and mind and soul and strength and that, more than anything else, he wanted to devote himself to the service of God. Now, is he backing up that profession by works?—Luke 10:25-28; Fs. 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Pioneer service is not limited to any certain age-group. The pioneer ranks include young and old, single and married, the physically strong and some who have limited resources of health. Most of them had obstacles to overcome in order to become pioneers. But deep-seated love for Jehovah, full reliance on him and careful planning have made it possible for tens of thousands to enjoy the pioneer ministry. The field ministry is not all that there is to our lives as Christians, and other Scriptural obligations cannot be ignored simply because one prefers the field service. But those who, on examining their own situation, find that they can make adjustments in their lives to become pioneers, and who do so out of love, will enjoy rich blessings at the hand of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Do you qualify to be a pioneer? There are certain pre-en rollmen t requirements to be met. One should have been a baptized minister for at least six months, and he should be a regular publisher, having reported service each month for the past six months- His field service averages for the past half year should show at least ten hours and six back-calls and be should currently be conducting a home Bible study. Also, he should have a reputation for fine Christian conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If you meet these requirements, you may obtain an application blank from your overseer, the circuit servant or the Society. Road it carefully and answer all the questions. Then, at least thirty days before you desire to start pioneering, submit the application to your congregation overseer for consideration by the committee. He will check it for accuracy, and the committee will fill in its recommendation. If you meet the qualifications set out in the preceding paragraph, they will recommend that the Society accept your application. However, if anyone is presently on probation for unchristian conduct, uses tobacco or does not have a reputation as a fine example ol’ a Christian, they kindly inform the applicant that they cannot recommend him and they do not send the application to the Society. In some situations, there may be doubt in the minds of the committee members; so they submit the application to the Society along with a statement of the factors that bear on the case, and, of course, the Society makes the decision. If anyone’s application is not approved by the Society, the Society will notify that person directly. But if you are appointed by the Society to be a regular pioneer, notification of appointment will be sent to your overseer so that he can make announcement to the congregation, and he will give you all the supplies sent for your use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Your application to be a pioneer is also an expression or willingness to accept the responsibilities that go with that special service. Pioneel’s arc expected to devote at least 100 hours to the field ministry each month, on the average, or 1,200 hours a year. And, because they are spending much time in the service, they are urged to make it their goal to place at least 100 magazines each month, make 35 back-calls and conduct 7 home Bible studies each week. Promptly at the end of the monlh, a pioneer report card is to be filled out and handed to the congregation servant. He has the figures from it noted on your Publisher’s Record card in the congregation file, signs your report card and mails it to the Society no later than the third of the month. If, for some reason, you are unable to report a full 100 hours for certain months, a note of explanation should be included on your report card and then you should arrange to make up the time before the service year ends, so that your total report for the entire service year, which runs from September 1 through the following August 31, will be at least 1,200 hours. As for your Bible study reports, these are to be turned in to the congregation each month for the Bible study file, though the congregation will not count them in its report, since you have already reported them to the Society,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those pioneers living in isolated territory send their reports directly to the Society, including on them a notation of any public meetings held in the territory and any pensions baptized during the month. In their case, so that there will be a record of their service available for consultation during the visit of the circuit servant, they need to keep their weekly record sheets for at least a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Participation in the field ministry and submitting regular reports are not all that is involved in being a pioneer. As is true of all of Jehovah’s witnesses, pioneers need to work closely with Jehovah’s organization, cooperate with the appointed servants and benefit fully from the meetings provided. Furthermore, as an appointee of the Society, each pioneer ought to be keenly aware of his responsibility to be exemplary in Christian conduct. He should refrain from any activity that might result in reproach to the name of God and to the congregation of His people. (2 Cor. 6:3, 4) Any pioneer who commits an act of sexual immorality with another person will be removed from the pioneer ranks for at least a year, even if he is not disfellowshipcd, and the same is true if he engages in any other conduct that would necessitate his removal if he were an appointed servant in the congregation. Pioneers are to be exemplary ministers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Flach one who is a pioneer must determine for himself how much secular work he needs to do in order to care for his physical needs. The apostle Paul set a fine example by working with his hands so as not to impose an expensive burden on the congregation in whose territory he served. (Acts 18:2-4;' 20:33, 34; 2 Thess. 3:7, 8) However, he made the ministry his chief concern, and did only what tentmaking was required to provide the physical necessities of life. Pioneers do well to follow that example, “seeking first the kingdom” and looking to God to bless their efforts to obtain the food and covering that they require. (Matt. 6:33) To aid pioneers to meet their expenses, the Society provides them with literature at less than cosh</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">When a pioneer desires a change of assignment because of moving or because he will be in another location for more than three months, he returns his pioneer assignment card to the Society and requests reassignment. The same procedure is followed when a congregation divides and the pioneer finds himself in the territory of the newly formed group. But if he is going to be away visiting for only three months or less, no change is required, and he will continue to send his report card to his congregation at the end of each month to be forwarded to the Society. Pioneers who move to another country, with the intention of staying for more than three months, request the Society to transfer their records to the branch office under which they will be serving, and then they arrange with that branch office for assignment in the area where they would like to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Anyone who finds it necessary to leave the pioneer ranks may do so by returning his pioneer identification and assignment card to the Society. Sometimes circumstances arise in one's life that make this necessary. But, wherever possible, we encourage those in the pioneer ministry to make it their career, staying with it, just as Jesus continued full time in the preaching work down to the time of his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">VACATION PIONEER SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There are many of Jehovah’s witnesses who, after honest ly appraising their personal circumstances, do not find that they can be regular pioneers. But they are able to be vacation pioneers from time to time, it takes careful planning on their pari and extra effort, but their love for Jehovah moves them to do it when they can. Many share in this activity during the month of April each year, when there is much special activity in the congregations. Others do it during those months when the circuit servant visits their congregation, or at vacation time or at regular intervals all year long. For them, these are the happiest and most spiritually stimulating months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Have you considered enrolling as a vacation pioneer? The requirements are not difficult. To qualify for appointment, you must be baptized and be a regular publisher (which means that you have reported field service during each of the past six months), and you must be given a favorable recommendation by the congregation committee. Applications are handled in the same manner as was described in connection with regular pioneer service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is possible to enroll as a vacation pioneer for two consecutive weeks, or for one, two or more months. Those who apply agree to devote at least 100 hours to the Held service each full month that they are vacation pioneers, and two-week vacation pioneers agree to spend not less than 75 hours in the field ministry for the month. These service goals can easily be met by arranging for four hours of service each day of the month or three or four eight-hour days of service each week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At the end </span><span class="font23" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font23"> the month those who are vacation pioneers each fill out a report card and hand it to their overseer. He has the information listed on each one’s Publisher's Record card, with a notation that the individual was a vacation pioneer. The report cards arc then signed and sent to the Society by the third of the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If you have not yet been a vacation pioneer, we urge you to do so. This is a special service that is within the reach of nearly every Christian minister at some time during the year. Most, publishers who do it once arc anxious to do it again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">SPECIAL PIONEER SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Pioneers whose record of service shows that they are getting results in their ministry and who are free to move to any assignment where they are needed may be invited by the Society to become special pioneers. Some are assigned to work with congregations that have much territory that is not being regularly covered, but usually they go into isolated territory to carry on the preaching work and organize new congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">For best results, they select a well-populated portion of their territory and work it thoroughly, covering it again and again. They follow through on all who show interest and patiently conduct studies with them, at the same time keeping the house-to-house work going on a regular basis, Gradually they try to get those attending the home Bible studies acquainted with one another. In time one of the newly interested persons may be willing to open his home for a study that others are welcome to attend. This provides the basis for a meeting much like the congregation book studies that are sponsored by every congeenation. To stimulate the gathering of newly interested ones, public meetings arc planned periodically. Then, as the group manifests readiness to progress, arrangements are made for the Watch?i.tota€?r study and other congregation meetings, one at a time. Special care is given to acquaint these people with Jehovah’s organization and how it operates. The privilege of participating in the field service is always kept before them, and, when they qualify, they are trained in the preaching work, This requires patient, steady work. When men who are associated with the group get baptized, special attention is given to training them so that they will be able to assume responsibility as seiwants in a congregation. Then, when the congregation is organized, the special pioneer stays with it to build it up until it is </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">firmly established and able to continue making </span><span class="font23">good progress with Jehovah’s blessing.—Acts 20: 17-21, 31; 19:1, 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">From this it can readily be seen that qualifications for special pioneer service include ability to conduct productive home Bible studies, a good knowledge of Jehovah’s organization and willingness to stay with an assignment until it is done. Those are qualifications that all of us should have, and they will help to make your ministry more fruitful no matter where you seive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those who accept assignments of service as special pioneers agree to devote 150 hours to the field ministry each month, and they endeavor to place 150 magazines a month. They also put much emphasis on follow-up work, striving to make 50 back-calls each month and to conduct 10 home Bible studies weekly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">This full program of service leaves little time for secular work; so the Society supplies special pioneers with a nominal money allowance each month that 150 hours of field service and 50 back-calls are reported, to aid them in obtaining the needed “sustenance and covering.” (1 Tim. 6:8) And, as is true of all other pioneers, they receive their literature supplies at less than cost. Additional financial assistance is given to special pioneers about November 1 each year to obtain clothing. These zealous ministers work hard, and at times a change is needed; so provision is made for them to take two weeks off each year, and if they have a record of continuous service in various branches of the pioneer work for twenty years, the vacation time is extended to three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">TTie Society is keenly interested in the work of these brothers and keeps in touch with them, both by correspondence and through regular visits of the circuit servant* Each time around the circuit he spends a full week with them, helping them to analyze and organize their work, sharing together in every’ feature of service, doing personal study with them and having each of the congregation meetings during the course of the week. In this way they are strengthened and encouraged in their ministry. There are special joys in this work of opening up new territory and organizing congregations. It was in this type of service that the apostle Paul took pleasure, and the record of his ministi’y continues to be a source of inspiration to those who reach out for this privilege of service.—Rom. 15:20-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">MISSIONARY </span><span class="font23" style="font-variant:small-caps;">service:</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Among the Christians of the first century there was a keen awareness of the need for missionaries who were willing to carry the message of salvation 1.0 foreign lands. After his resurrection, had not. Jesus told an assembly of his disciples: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations”? (Matt* 28:19) And, immediately before his ascension to heaven, did he not say: “You will be witnesses of me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the most distant part of the earth”? (Acts 1:8) In response, the apostle Peter traveled east as far as Babylon; the apostle John served in the Roman province of Asia; and Paul and his close associates penetrated into Europe in their missionary travels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The need for missionaries is still groat in our day, and it is gratifying to know That young men and women arc taking up this work. Those who enter missionary service and stay there are not persons who indifferently reason that, after all, God could use someone else to do the job. To the contrary, their heartfelt love for Jehovah moves them to volunteer in the spirit of that faithful prophet Isaiah, who said: “Here I am! Send me.” (Isa. 6:8) They know that the Kingdom good news is to be preached “in all the inhabited earth,” and they are delighted to be used by God, having a full share in it. (Matt. 24:14) Their faith gives them the conviction that, no matter where they are on earth, Jehovah will look after them as long as they arc busy doing his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Some have been missionaries for ten, fifteen or twenty years, and they love their work. But there is still much work to do, and they rejoice when they can welcome new missionaries into the field. Can you join them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Those who are sent into missionary service by the Society are first given special training at the Watchtower Bible Schoo] of Gilead in Brooklyn, New York. Here they make an intensive study of the Bible, receive instruction in organizational matters and are helped to acquire a foundation knowledge of the language of the land to which they will be going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The prospective missionaries who are invited to attend Gilead School arc selected from among persons who meet the following qualifications: baptized at least three years; pioneering for the past two years; generally, between the ages of 21 and 40; single, or married at least two years and with no dependent children. They must know the English language. Those who apply should have good health; they should be willing to serve anywhere; and they should plan to stay in their missionary assignment, making it their home. Applications may be requested directly from the Society or they may be obtained and filled out at special meetings arranged for this purpose at most district assemblies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Missionaries carry on their work in the same way as do the special pioneers, and they have the same service requirements to meet. However, where possible, the Society provides a missionary home from which a group of them can carry on their work and sees to it that they are able to obtain the needed food. In addition, each missionary is given some financial assistance once a year to obtain clothing, as well as a small monthly allowance for personal items, if he is meeting the service requirements. There is also a vacation provision each year, as for special pioneers. Because they are devoting all their time and effort to advancing the interests of God’s kingdom, Jehovah, through his organization, makes loving provision to care for their physical needs.—Luke 12:22-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">At first the customs and foods in another country may seem strange, but soon one grows accustomed to them. A loving desire to aid the people to learn the truth about God and his kingdom makes any inconveniences of a changed way of life pale out of sight. As one sees the truth of God’s Word bring about changes in their lives, he cannot but be humbly thankful that Jehovah has privileged him to have a share in the work. What a thrill it has boon to the missionaries to see congregations grow up in the territory where they serve, and to know that, persons with whom they studied have become publishers, pioneers, congregation overseers and circuit- servants! Jehovah has indeed blessed them because they have worked hard in his service and have done so with a willing heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Are you able to share in this urgent work? Do you qualify? Does your heart, move you to do so? We urge you to give it serious consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;">liiJTiiKL SER VICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">In order to supply Jehovah’s witnesses around the globe with Bibles and Bible literature for their persona) study, for use in congregation meetings and for distribution in the field ministry, it is necessary for the Society to operate Belhel homes, branch offices and printing plants. Those who do the work at these places are all ordained ministers. Some have been in Bethel service for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There is work of many kinds to be done by those at Bethel. Some have office assignments; others do typesetting, run printing presses, bind books or prepare literature for mailing. In addition, it is necessary to have workers who care for the home, wash clothes and cook and serve meals. All of this is done to further the Kingdom interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Much of this work is like that done by early Christians who are mentioned in the Bible. For example, Tertius and Silvanus did scribal work, recording portions of the Bible at the direction of the apostles Paul and Peter. (Rom. 16:22; 1 Pct. 5:12) Today brothers in Bethel service are privileged to print and bind copies of the Bible in many languages, and some run printing presses on which Scriptural counsel provided through the <sup>4</sup>‘faithful and discreet slave” is reproduced for the benefit of God’s people everywhere. (Matt. 24: 45-47) Others serving in Bethel homes have assignments like that of Stephen and his associates, who, as waitci's, 'distributed food to the tables’ of early Christians who were serving to-gcthcr in Jerusalem. At the same time, the Bible informs us, Stephen had an outstanding record as a fearless preacher of the Word of God.—Acts 6:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Bethel family members start their day's activity early. Gathered at the breakfast table, they enjoy a thorough discussion of the day's Scripture text and comments* After breakfast they go to their assigned work, at which they spend at least 8 hours and 40 minutes a day for five days of the week, and four hours on Saturdays. Monday evenings the members of the family study the Wafcft-itnoer lesson for the week and attend the family's Theocratic Ministry School, Other evenings as well as Saturday afternoon and Sunday arc used for attending congregation meetings, sharing in the field ministry and attending to personal matters. Many brothers at Bethel serve as congregation overseers or ministerial servants, and those who are qualified speakers have the privilege of giving public talks in nearby congregations. The schedule is a full one and richly rewarding in a spiritual way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Applicants for Bethel service must be dedicated and baptized ministers for at least a year, and preference is shown for those who are pioneers. The work to be done requires good health, ability to do hard work and willingness to do whatever is assigned. Most of the ones invited to live and work at Bethel are single brothers, between seventeen and thirty-five years of age; though at times sisters are invited, and some married couples without dependent children. Anyone who applies for Bethel service should have deep love for Jehovah, his Word and his organization, and a strong desire to serve on behalf of his Christian brothers. The ones whose applications are accepted agree to serve at Bethel for a minimum of four years, but any who can do so are encouraged to stay beyond that and make service at Bethel their life's work. If you meet these qualifications and want to serve at. Bethel, you may obtain an application from a circuit servant, from the Society or at one of the meetings arranged for Bethel applicants at most district assemblies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The Society takes good care of the members of the Bethel family. They are provided with a comfortable room and good food<sub>+</sub> There is a small monthly allowance to care for personal expenses, and each year financial assistance is provided to help them to obtain needed clothing. Time is also allowed for a two-week vacation, and three weeks for those who have served for twenty years or more. The physical provisions to sustain them are made possible through the contributions of Jehovah's witnesses world wide to the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, and the Bethel family appreciates these things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Bethel is a marvelous place to serve. In such a theocratic atmosphere as exists at Bethel homes there is excellent opportunity for spiritual growth. It is richly rewarding to work all day in association with others who love Jehovah and to know that one’s work benefits SO many of Jehovah's people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Of course<sub>r</sub> not everyone in Jehovah's organization is in position to share in Bethel service; nor are all able to be pioneers* But each one can walk in the footsteps of Jesus Christ, whose whole purpose in life was the doing of his Father’s will. Love of God moves one to keep Jehovah’s service in first place and to plan everything else in life around it. If our share in the preaching work is somewhat, limited, let us be sure that it is because of circumstances over which we have no control and not because of indifference, If we have been entrusted with special assignments of service, let us be watchful so that they do not become commonplace but that we cherish them as privileges extended to us by God. No matter where we serve, we cannot afford to let ourselves become complacent, reasoning that we are having at least some share in Jehovah’s service and, after all, that is the important thing. Whole-souled service is what pleases God. So it is wise for each one of us to examine his service to God and to search his heart. Do as the Bible counsels: “Keep testing whether you are in the faith, keep proving what you yourselves are/’—2 Cor. 13:5.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Endurance Needed to Gain Everlasting Life</span></h3>
<p><span class="font23">/T1ECAUSE you permit God’s Word to light </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">|.7j</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font23">your path, you have dedicated yourself to Jehovah God and symbolized that by water immersion. With that Word as your guide, you have become an ordained minister of God, and now you have before you the prospect of eternal life in the satisfying service of God. But the foremost enemy of God and man docs not want you to gain that prize. As the apostle Peter wrote to fellow members of the Christian congregation: “Your adversary, the Devil, walks about like a roaring lion, seeking to devour someone.” (1 Pet. 5:8) He would like to destroy your spirituality, cause you to cease serving Jehovah and so bring you to ruin. It is most appropriate, therefore, that the Bible cautions us: “You have need of endurance, in order that, after you have done the will of God, you may receive the fulfillment of the promise.”—Hcb. 10:36*</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">To endure, you must never lose sight of the fact that die warfare in which you are engaged is a spiritual one. Your principal foes are “wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.** Therefore, if you are going to come off victorious, you must make full use of the provisions that Jehovah has made. You need to “go on acquiring power in the Lord and in the mightiness of his strength.** (Eph. 6:10-13) How can this be done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Jehovah has provided his written Word, and daily study and meditation on it will help to fortify both your mind and your heart. It will keep God’s thoughts to the fore in your life, so that decisions will be in harmony with his will. If you heed what you learn from the Bible, you will also stay close to Jehovah’s organization, regularly attending and sharing in the meetings. This will prevent you from getting into a position where, by yourself, you are easy prey for the enemy. Regular participation in the field ministry is also important. If one is going to endure, he surely cannot afford to allow himself to become indifferent about the work that God has given his people to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">But some have done that. They may have reported some field service from time to time in the past; yet they were not persons who made a habit of attending all the congregation meetings. They were weak spiritually. When assistance was offered, they did not respond fully. In their case it was just a short step to inactivity. Failing to “go on acquiring power in the Lord J* they fell easy victims to the pressures of the Adversary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">There are others who at one time shared to a considerable extent in the ministry, but then they too slowed down, reasoning that perhaps it is not so vital to preach since God is going to resurrect the vast majority of people anyway. In doing so, are they really walking in the footsteps of Jesus Christ? Do they view the matter as he did? When Jesus was here on earth, he was well aware of the fact that the majority of those to whom he preached would be raised up on Judgment Day. (Matt. 11:20-24) Did he conclude that this made his preaching work really unimportant? By no means! Ho devoted all his time to it. and so did his apostles. Why? As Jesus reported to his Father in prayer on the last night of his life as a human: 'T have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work you have given me to do/’ (John 17:4) That is why Jesus preached -—to glorify his Father. Is that why you share in the preaching work? If so, the fact that God will raise the dead docs not lessen the importance of preaching; it gives added reason to publicly praise the name of God. “Give thanks to Jehovah, you people, for he is good; for his loving-kindness is to time indefinite/’ IPs. 118:1) Strong love for Jehovah and an earnest desire to see his name magnified will stimulate you to press on in his sc twice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Nor should we minimize the importance of the preaching work in relation to the salvation of those to whom we preach now. This generation faces the downfall of Babylon the Great and the war of Armageddon. Jehovah has set a time limit, and the opport unity to choose his side of the issue of universal sovereignty is now! There is no promise in God's Word of a resurrection for those destroyed by his Executioner at the conclusion of this wicked system of things, now near at hand. Their failure to take note of impending destruction will not save them. The destruction will be everlasting. (Matt. 24:38, 39; 2 Thess. 1:6-10) If they are going to be delivered, they must hear the warning message now, believe it and call in faith upon the name of Jehovah.—Joel 2:32; Rom. 10:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Of course, not all are going to respond favorably. Many will be indifferent; some will be unkind. Their attitude will require endurance on your part so that you do not get discouraged and quit. Regularly reviewing the fine examples of faithful endurance recorded in the Bible can help you. Is your territory as difficult as Noah’s was? In all the years that he preached before the Flood, only his own wife, his sons and their wives joined with him in doing the will of God. The world scoffed, but Noah did “according to all that God had commanded him?’ Jehovah preserved Noah and his household when that “world of ungodly people” was destroyed, and ho will preserve you at the end of this system of things if vou endure as Noah did.—Gen. 6:22; 2 Pet. 2:5, 9?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">The prophet Jeremiah was another one who had a difficult assignment. For forty years he preached to people who professed to serve the true God but who ignored His commandments. They did not approve of Jeremiah's work, but Jehovah did. (Jer. 1:7, 8) With faith in Jehovah, Jeremiah endured. Faith in God will also enable you to endure. So do not let the unresponsive attitude of other people cause you to slack off in your service to God. Some will appreciate the message that you bring to them; others will rejedit. But Jehovah’s blessing will be on you if, now that you have heard the word of God, you “retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”—Luke 8:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">An even more severe test of your devotion to God and Christ may be brought to bear by those who are members of your own family. Jesus warned: “I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her* mother, and a young wife against her mother-inlaw. Indeed, a man’s enemies will be persons of his own household.” He knew that family members would in many cases react with opposition against the one who embraced his teachings. Has that occurred among your relatives? If so, it puts you to the test. Which is the stronger tie, the controlling one in your life? Is it your attitude toward your family that dictates your attitude toward God? Or is it your love of God and Christ that influences how you deal with your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">(Matt. 10:32-37) There is only one right way. Forsaking God is not going to bring benefits to anyone. Not only does it result in loss to the quitter, but it removes from the home the line influence that might have aided others there to gain salvation. (1 Cor. 7:16) Manifesting the fruits of God’s spirit, in your coping with difficult situations will help you to endure, and, as Jesus said to his disciples, “by endurance on your part you will acquire your souls.”—Luke 2 I : 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Even though your fleshly relatives do not encourage you in the service of God, there are many who do. As one of Jehovah’s witnesses you enjoy association with a large family under the loving headship of Jehovah God. The psalmist David wrote: “In case my own father and my own mother did leave me, even Jehovah himself would take me up.” (Ps. 27:10) And Jesus himself said: “No one has left house or brothers of' sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the good news who will not get a hundredfold now in this period of time, houses and brothel’s and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming system of things everlasting life.” (Mark 10:29, 30) Regular fellowship with these spiritual brothers and sisters of yours will build you up. It will keep you strong in faith and help you to endure, with everlasting life in view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Living as we do in a world where the spirit of nationalism is strong, we ought to expect that from this quarter too our faith will be put to the test. In fact, the book of Revelation, after discussing in symbolic language God's view of this situation, says: “Here is where it means endurance for the holy ones, those who observe the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” (Rev. 14: 9-12) The “holy ones” have repeatedly had their faith put to the test on this issue, and their “other sheep” companions are now being called on to manifest their faithful endurance in connection with the same issue. Do they really take to heart Jesus* statement concerning his disciples: “You are no part of the world*’? (John 15:19) Do they really believe that all the kingdoms of the world lie in the power of the wicked one, Satan the Devil? (Luke 4:5-8; 1 John 5:19; Rev. 13:1, 2) Is their full confidence in the kingdom of God, now established in the heavens in the hands of Jesus Christ? If they have that faith, it will fortify them to endure without compromise when put to the test; because “this is the conquest that has conquered the world, our faith.**—1 John 5:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Tests may come because of wars, revolutions or outright persecution and official bans, which may make it impossible for you to carry on Christian worship in all the details outlined in this book. It may be impossible to hold large congregation meetings. Contact with the Society may temporarily be broken oil. Visits by circuit servants may be interrupted for a while. New publications may not arrive. If any of those things happen to you, what should you do? The answer is: Do whatever you can in the way of pure worship under the circumstances. Personal study should be possible. Usually small groups of brothers can meet for study in homes. Publications that were studied in the past, along with the Bible, can be used as a basis for meetings. Experience has shown that some form of worship is possible even in times of difficulty; so do not become excited or worried. Generally in a short time some form of communication with Jehovah’s visible organization will be established, because the Society always seeks to find ways of getting in touch with the brothers. But even if you find yourself isolated from all your Christian brothers, keep in mind that, you are not isolated from Jehovah. Ue can still hear your prayers and he can strengthen you with his spirit. Look to him for guidance. Remember that you are a min-</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">1st er, and, as opportunities to witness to others open up, make good use of them. Jehovah will bless your efforts, and others may soon join you in worship.—PhiL 1:27-30; 4:6, 7; 2 Tim, 4:16-18; Acts 4:13-31; 5:27-42.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">That it is not one’s own strength but one’s trust in Jehovah that enables one to hold firm in the face of pressures brought by Satan is particularly driven home when one’s life is threatened by opposers of pure worship. Of his own experience in this regard, the apostle Paul wrote to the congregation of God in Corinth: “We do not wish you to be ignorant, brothers, about the tribulation that happened to us in the district of Asia, that we were under extreme pressure beyond our strength, so that we were very uncertain even of our lives. In fact, we felt within ourselves that we had received the sentence of death. This was that we might have our trust, not. in ourselves, but in the God who raises up the dead. From such a great thing as death he did rescue us and will rescue us; and our hope is in him that he will also rescue us further/'—2 Cor. 1:8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Do you have such strong trust in “the God who raises up the dead”? There is every reason for you to do so, because God has raised Christ from the dead and through him made provision for resurrection of others of mankind. The threat of death has been one of the foremost methods used by Satan to hold men in bondage, but Christ died “that he might emancipate all those who for fear of death were subject to slavery all through their lives/’ (Hob. 2:15) Your faith in this provision of the resurrection can help you to endure even the most severe opposition.’—Luke 21:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Whether the trials of your faith are great or apparently small, remember that Jehovah is always near to sustain you. Look to him for guidance and for the strength to stand firm. Instead of asking yourself, ‘Can I endure?’ pray to Jehovah,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">ENDURANCE NEEDED TO GAIN EVERLASTING LIFE </span><span class="font23">215 ‘Strengthen me to endure, for your own name’s sake/ Jesus prayed earnestly to his Father when undex* trial, and he urged his disciples to do the same.—Heb. 5:7; Luke 22:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Consider carefully the fine example set by Jesus Christ. At Hebrews 12:2, 3 it is recorded: “For the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake, despising shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Indeed, consider closely the one who has endured such contrary talk by sinners against their own interests, that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">you may not get tired and give out in </span><span class="font23">your souls/’ What Jesus did is not something that you cannot do. As the Scriptures show, he provided a model for you, when under suffering, to follow his steps closely. (1 Pet. 2:21) When faced with severe tests he kept in focus the outcome of the situation. He knew that faithfulness on his part would result in honor to Jehovah, and in this he found joy. He realized, too, that his faithfulness under test would strengthen others to endure, and </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font23">had their interests at heart. (John 16:33) Also, he rejoiced in the prospects of future service in Jehovah’s organization that would be his as a reward for his integrity-keeping course. (John 17: 4, 5) Doing these things will also strengthen you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible </span><span class="font23">makes clear to us that </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font23">trials of one's faith are not limited to opposition from other persons. The Devil has other methods, too, and we need to be on guard against them if we are to gain everlasting life. Surely we do not want to manifest traits that are in any way comparable to those displayed by the Devil. But on every hand such traits arc displayed by the world around us, and if we arc not on guard we may adopt them. How that would please the Devil! He himself is proud, self-willed and rebellious, and when humans develop those characteristics he is able to use them as his </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">tools. (1 Tim. </span><span class="font23">3:6; </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. </span><span class="font23">2:2) This is why God's Word admonishes: “Quit being fashioned after</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”—Rom. 12:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">If we do this, we will carefully avoid any tendencies toward pride, (Jas, 4:16) We will not become faultfinders or complainers, either about the provisions that Jehovah makes for his people or about our own lot in life. (Num. 11:1; 1 Cor, IO: 10; Jude 16) Never will wc give in to a spirit of self-will or rebellion, (2 Pct, 2:10; 1 Sam. 15:23) Rather, by seeking the help of Jehovah's spirit and putting forth a sincere effort to respond to it, we will cultivate qualities that are well-pleasing in the eyes of God. (Eph. 5:8-18) Wc will learn to put full trust in Jehovah and show ourselves ready to obey the counsel of his Word. (Prov. 3:o; Jas. 3:17) We will be humble, not thinking more of ourselves than wc ought to think and not overestimating the value of our own opinions. (Prov. 22:4; Rom. 12:3) We will be cooperative with all our brothers and submissive to the leading of the “faithful and discreet slave<sup>1</sup>’ and those overseers with whom we are more closely associated. (Matt. 24:45-47; Heb. 13:17; 1 Cor. 16:16; 2 Cor. 9:13) This will be a protection to us. It will keep us close to Jehovah and to his organization. It will make our service a joy, and so will aid us to enduro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Another snare of the Devil is materialism. Some who stand firm in the face of persecution later give in to the lure of materialistic desires. The Bible warns: “The love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.” But that does not have to happen to you, and it will not if you recognize the danger and act in harmony with the admonition that is given next in the Bible: “You, O man of God, flee from these things/’ Do not toy with them. Do not fool yourself, allowing materialistic desires to dominate your life while you make a pretense of serving God. “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also* . , . You cannot slave for God and for Riches/’ Instead of allowing a love for material possessions to take hold of your heart, “pursue righteousness, godly devotion, faith, love, endurance, mildness of temper. Fight the fine fight of the faith, get a firm hold on the everlasting life for which you were called and you offered the fine public declaration in front of many witnesses.”—1 Tim. 6:10*12; Matt. 6:21, 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">As you face arid pass each test of endurance, it will strengthen you to meet others. But do not grow overconfident. Remember that, although the Israelites were delivered from Egypt, “on most of them God did not express his approval, for they were laid low in the wilderness.” Not all died for the same reason. But even after long years in the wilderness, just before they were to cross the Jordan River into the Promised I^and, a large number fell into a trap of Satan and lost out. They got involved in sexual immorality. Concerning this, Paul wrote: “Neither let us practice fornication, as some of them committed fornication, only to fall, twenty-three thousand of them in one day. . . , Now these things went on befalling them as examples, and they were written for a warning to us upon whom the ends of the systems of things have arrived. Consequently let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall,” (1 Cor, 10:5, 8-12) If we would endure, we cannot afford to become careless. We must keep on socking, not only God’s kingdom, but also his righteousness. —Matt. 6:33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Regular attendance at the meetings of the congregation with which you are associated will aid you immeasurably to keep strong your love of righteousness. It will help you to stay close to</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">Jehovah and active in his service. With a view to faithful endurance, take seriously the Bible’s admonition not to forsake gathering with the Christian congregation for worship. To the extent possible, prepare for those rpcetings and participate in them. Include all of them in your program of activity- If you plan to move to another community, find out in advance where the nearest congregation is and when the meetings are field. With everlasting life in view, stay close to those who are walking in the way that will load to that reward. Regardless of how often you have attended congregation meetings, the Scriptures encourage you to do it “all the more so as you behold the day drawing near/’—Heb. 10:24, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">It is not only this year that wc must be faithful to Jehovah, but next year and the year after that, yes, “from now on and to time indefinite/<sup>1</sup> (Ps. 115:18) We dedicated ourselves to serve him, not for just a few years, but forever. In response to Jehovah’s direction, Abraham left behind the comforts of Ur of Chaldea for life in tents in another land. Tic did not grow weary in five or ten years and return to the life that he had left behind. Ue showed endurance, living as a temporary resident for a hundred years, while awaiting in faith “the city having real foundations, the builder and creator of which city is God/’ (Heb. 11:10) Have you endured that long? No, but the endurance that you have shown because of your love of God is pleasing to him, and, if you continue faithful, it will be your happy privilege to prove faithful to God, not just a hundred years or even a thousand, but forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">You have need of endurance. But you were not born with it, and it is not something that you can acquire as a gift. It comes as a result of having your faith pul to the test. For that reason, the disciple James wrote: “Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you meet with various trials, know-</span></p>
<p><span class="font22" style="font-variant:small-caps;">endurance needed to gain everlasting life</span><span class="font25"> 219 ing as you do that this tested quality of your faith works out endurance. But let endurance have its work complete, that you may be complete and sound in all respects, not lacking in anything?’ (Jas. 1:2-4) So those experiences through which Satan means to tear you down can, in fact, build you up. Instead of causing you to lose out, they can produce in you a quality that wins Jehovah’s approval Understandably, then, Paul wrote: “Let us exult while in tribulations, since we know that tribulation produces endurance; endurance, in turn, an approved condition.” (Rom. 5:3, 4) What a happy reversal of matters that is!</span></p>
<p><span class="font25">It becomes plain, then, that in order to endure we must always look to God's inspired Word for guidance. We need to work closely with the organization that he is using to accomplish his will. We need to make full use of the privilege of prayer. If we do so, we will persevere in the work that the resurrected Jesus Christ set out for all his disciples when he said: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you?* (Matt. 28:19, 20) Having applied ourselves wholeheartedly to that work during this period of time, we will be blessed with the opportunity to serve Jehovah everlastingly in his righteous new order. That happy prospect is yours if you persevere in proving by your way of life now that you concur with the psalmist in saying to Jehovah our God: &quot;Your word is a lamp to my foot, and a light to my roadway?’—Ps. 119: 105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORD OF CHRISTIAN BAPTISM</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As one of Jehovah's Christian witnesses I appreciate that the holy Bible is the written Word of God and that it must be &quot;a lamp Io my foot, and a light to my roadway/' [ Ps. 119:105) I am firmly convinced that &quot;'Jehovah is righteous in all his wuys/' and It is my earnest desire to live in full harmony with his will as he has made it plain to his servants. (Ps<sub>r</sub> 145:17) For that reason I have dedicated myself without reservation to Jehovah God through Jesus Christ to be his possession and do his will both now and for all time to come.</span></p>
