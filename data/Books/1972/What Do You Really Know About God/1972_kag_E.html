<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>What Do You Really Know About God?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What will knowing or not knowing mean for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT IS GOD'S PERSONAL NAME?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How many people today know? Do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God's name is Jehovah. Is that just our idea? No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Protestant King James Version Bible says: &quot;Thou, whose name alone is Jehovah, art the most high.&quot; —Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Catholic Encyclopedia (1910, Vol. VIII, p. 329) says: &quot;Jehovah [is] the proper name of God in the Old Testament.&quot; And according to a new Catholic translation, God says: &quot;Yahweh [Hebrew form of Jehovah] ... is my name for all time.&quot;—Exodus 3:15, The Jerusalem Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Do you use that name?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO IS GOD?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is he three Gods in one—a trinity? No, the Bible says ‘there is actually one God the Father.'—1 Corinthians 8:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Is he the same as Jesus Christ? No, for Jesus himself said: “The Father is greater than I am.&quot; And Jesus also said that his Father in heaven is &quot;the only true God.” —John 14:28; 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Did you realize this? Have you been worshiping the true God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO KNOW GOD?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many believe that God exists and has great power. Some also know his name. Does that prove that they really know God? No, far from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To know God means to know what kind of person he is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He is a wise and loving God. You have evidence of this all around you—in the sun, air, rain, food and beauty of this earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He is also a God of power and justice—a fact that some persons do not like. Yet because he is, he will soon put an end to all injustice, all crime and corruption, all oppression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Really, how well do you know God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">HAVE THE CHURCHES TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT GOD?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No, they have not. They have grossly misrepresented God by their teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For example, the churches have taught that the dead are alive—perhaps even suffering fiery torment from God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God’s Word says that the dead “are conscious of nothing at all.&quot;—Ecclesiastes 9:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The churches have taught that God blesses nations when they hate and make war against people of other lands —even those who have the same religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God's Word says that those selfishly hating their fellowman are murderers and that they will not get eternal life.—1 John 3:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The churches have winked at immorality, many clergymen saying that sex relations outside marriage, even homosexual relations, are not wrong—that it 'all depends upon the circumstances.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God's Word says plainly that 'neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor men who lie with men will inherit God's kingdom.'—1 Corinthians 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">God's Word forcefully declares that very soon now he will destroy all who reproach his name by their immoral course and by false worship. Surely you do not want to be found among those whom God says he will destroy, do you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is something else to consider too. Not only will all false religion be brought to its end, but God also declares: “The nations shall know that I am Jehovah.&quot; Because they stubbornly reject his Word, the Bible shows that when they get to know God it will be too late, because destruction from Him will be upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, no matter what nation you live in, whether you are a church member or not, you are affected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You have the opportunity to come to know Jehovah now. Avail yourself of this opportunity now while time still allows. The 416-page book &quot;The Nations Shall Know that </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I Am Jehovah&quot;—How? </span><span class="font0">will help you to do this. You may obtain a copy for 50 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW GOD BETTER?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Appreciation for the gift of life itself should make us want to do that. But by doing so we also bring great benefit to ourselves and to those we love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We should want to know how God views things. Why has he allowed wickedness to continue till now? What is his answer to that question?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why does man grow old and die, and what hope is there for the dead? Only God can tell us that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What does he require in our prayers for them to be heard with approval? How does he view the use of images in worship?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Yes, your life depends on knowing what God's standards are—what he approves and what he hates. It is vital to know what God has done, what he is doing and what he will do in the future—to know his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">GET THE ANSWERS BY LOOKING INTO THE BIBLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you have a sincere desire to know what God has to say on these matters, Jehovah's witnesses will be happy to help you. How? By a free, one-hour-a-week discussion of the Bible in your home, for six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Because they feel the urgency of our times, and because they have full confidence in the truthfulness of God's Word, Jehovah's witnesses last year provided such free home Bible instruction for over a million households.</span></p>
