<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font17"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Who Are They?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font13">JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES sincerely desire that you become better acquainted with them. You may have met them as neighbors, fellow employees, or schoolmates. Perhaps you have been greeted by them on the street while they were talking with people about the Bible. Or you may have enjoyed their personal visit at your home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s Witnesses are Christians. They have been present in Russia for more than a century. Their worship in Russia can be dated to the time of the czars. The Witnesses experienced persecution during the Soviet era. Today they worship in over 2,200 congregations and groups throughout Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia are part of a worldwide brotherhood, an international Christian religious organization active in</span></p>
<div><img src="2008_pb_E_files/2008_pb_E-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:521pt;height:319pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">more than 230 lands and island groups. Jehovah’s Witnesses are legally recognized in the countries of the European Union, and in many of them, the Witnesses enjoy the same privileges as other major religions. In Italy and Spain, Jehovah’s Witnesses are the second-largest religion. In Germany they have over 2,200 congregations and are protected by a legal status given only to recognized major religions. They have a similar status in Hungary. There are over 7,000,000 of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide, and among them Russian is the fifth-largest language group after Spanish, English, Portuguese, and French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s Witnesses face the same economic, physical, and emotional problems as everyone else. In all their activities, they seek guidance from the Holy Bible, and they try to be exemplary in Christian conduct not just with fellow Witnesses but also with friends, neighbors, and relatives. Being imperfect, they do not always succeed. Yet, it is the desire of their hearts to do good to all people and to extend a helping hand whenever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Witnesses believe that the entire Bible, which includes what are commonly called the Old Testament as well as the New Testament, is God’s Word. (1 Thessalonians 2:13) When it comes to teachings offered as Bible truth, they encourage people to follow the course of some of the inhabitants of Beroea in ancient Macedonia, who heard the apostle Paul preach. The historical account relates that “they received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.”—Acts 17:11.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Their Name—Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">The name, Jehovah’s Witnesses, is descriptive. It is based on the statement at chapter 43, verse 10, of the Bible book of Isaiah, which says: “ ‘You are my witnesses,’ is the utterance of Jehovah.” Since all of Jehovah’s Witnesses have dedicated their lives to God, they bear witness concerning his name, his Godship, and his purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A careful reading of the Bible, will show you that Jehovah is the personal name of Almighty God, the Creator of the universe. In the Synodal translation of the Russian Bible, Exodus 15:3 says about God: “Jehovah is His name.” (See also Exodus 33:19.) The name Jehovah appears several thousand times in the Hebrew Scriptures of the Bible, which were</span></p>

The 1825 Russian Bible Society Octateuch, edited by Gerasim Pavsky, contains the name Jehovah over 700 times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “president,” “king,” and “general”—are titles. Titles are neither personal nor distinctive. However, the name Jehovah identifies the true God as a real Person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Hence, some 7,000,000 of Jehovah’s Witnesses in over 230 lands are today telling the good news of God’s heavenly Kingdom by his Son, Christ Jesus, and they are using God’s name regularly in their worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s Witnesses use the form “Jehovah,” which people have been familiar with for centuries. In the foreword to his translation, Professor I. Maksimovich writes that the name “Jehovah ... is preserved in the Russian translation in every place it is found in the Hebrew text because the word [Ky</span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">'ri-os],</span><span class="font12"> which replaces it everywhere in the LXX [Septuagint], and the Slavonic word for ‘Lord’ do not at all express the meaning contained in the Hebrew word ‘Jehovah.’ &quot;—Kings and Chronicles, Tsarstva, Paralipomenon, Kiev, 1860.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">God’s name has been in use throughout history, even down to this day. It is noteworthy that God’s name, written in the Hebrew letters of the Bible (the Tetragrammaton), is a part of the decoration of many religious buildings, indicating that it is not a new term but, rather, a well-established name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Below: A congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Siberia, 1956</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font12">The modern-day history of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia began more than one hundred years ago. By 1887 the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watch Tower </span><span class="font12">magazine was being read in Russia. In 1891, Charles Taze Russell—who was taking the lead in the work of the Bible Students, as Jehovah’s Witnesses were then known—made a</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">trip to Russia and met with people who were interested in Bible truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">At about the same time, Semyon Kozlitsky, a graduate of a Russian theological seminary, got acquainted with the teachings of the Bible Students. He zealously sought to bring the good news of the Bible to those who were searching for it. In 1891 he was exiled to Siberia for allegedly insulting the archbishop of Moscow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1904 a letter from a small group of Bible Students in Russia reported that they had received Bible literature, though not without difficulty. The group was so grateful to receive the literature that they said, “It is like gold here—it is so difficult to obtain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Writing after the 1917 revolution, one Bible Student painted this dreary picture: “You are probably aware of the situation here in Russia. We have a Soviet government based on Communist principles. While it is true that one can note the well-known push in the direction of justice, everything to do with God is being jettisoned.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">“Send Me a Little Bit of Everything”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During that same time period after the revolution, the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses received a letter from a schoolteacher in Siberia who was searching for Bible truth. He wrote: ‘Here in Russia publications that enlighten are very much needed.’ He concluded the letter with a request for more literature, writing, “Please, send me a little bit of everything.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As a result of those early beginnings, small Bible study groups and congregations of Bible Students were formed in various parts of Russia and other territories of the Soviet Union. In 1928 a representative of the headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">visited Moscow in order to obtain permission to have Bible literature shipped into the country. Permission was granted to print 15,000 copies of the booklets </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Where Are the Dead?</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Witnesses in Prison</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">A number of Russian citizens, along with millions of people of other nationalities, endured great suffering in concentration camps located throughout the territories under Germany’s cruel totalitarian regime. According to historians, some 12,000 of Jehovah’s Witnesses were imprisoned—about a third of them in concentration camps. Hundreds received death sentences and were executed. Many prisoners met Jehovah’s Witnesses in concentration camps and then became Witnesses themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the Ravensbruck camp, 300 Russians became Jehovah’s Witnesses, and in another camp, 227. When released after the war, all of them carried their newfound faith back with them into the vast territory of the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Enduring Under Persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In spite of persecution, more than 8,600 regularly attended the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union in 1946. In 1956 more than 17,000 people in the Soviet Union regularly worshipped with Jehovah’s Witnesses at their meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Soviet Union were especially persecuted in the years 1949 and 1951. Many of them were exiled to Siberia and the Far East. What, though, was the outcome? Walter Kolarz, in his book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Religion in the Soviet Union,</span><span class="font12"> writes: “This was not the end of the ‘Witnesses’ in Russia, but only the beginning of a new chapter in their proselytising activities.... In deporting them the Soviet Government could have done nothing better for the dissemination of their faith.” Yes, as a result of being exiled, Jehovah’s Witnesses flourished beyond the Urals, in Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Far East, and even on Sakhalin and Kamchatka.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">During these trialsome years, Jehovah’s Witnesses were looking forward to the time when they could freely worship God in their own country. They tried fearlessly again and again to receive legal recognition. For example, on June 9, 1949, Jehovah’s Witnesses, acting on behalf of their fellow believers in all the territory of the Soviet Union, addressed a petition to the Ministry of the Interior of the U.S.S.R. in Moscow. On August 16, 1949, a delegation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Moscow personally submitted a copy of this petition to the vice-chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the USSR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Throughout the world at 199 conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses held from June 1956 to February 1957, 462,936 delegates unanimously adopted a petition, copies of which were sent to the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union in Moscow. Among other things, the petition stated: “There are witnesses of Jehovah kept in more than fifty camps from European Russia into Siberia and northward to the Arctic Ocean, even on the Arctic island of Novaya Zemlya.... In America and other western lands, Jehovah’s witnesses have been called ‘communists’ and in countries under communist rule ‘imperialists’ . . . Communist governments have accused and tried them as ‘imperialistic spies’ and have sentenced them to as many as twen-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Freedom at Last!</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">By the end of the 1980’s, a new period began for Jehovah’s Witnesses in the territory of the Soviet Union—an era of freedom of worship. In 1989 and 1990, when the government authorities stopped viewing them as enemies, thousands of Witnesses were given the opportunity to go to Poland for their first Bible educational convention. Millions of their fellow believers around the world watched with keen interest and anticipation and wondered, ‘When will Jehovah’s Witnesses be legally recognized in Russia?’</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Soon it happened. On March 27, 1991, the “Religious Organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the USSR” was registered. Shortly after the breakup of the Soviet Union, Jehovah’s Witnesses were registered in the Russian Federation on December 11, 1992. Following the first legal registration, a series of conventions was held in different cities throughout Russia and neighboring territories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On March 14, 1996, Jehovah’s Witnesses were fully exonerated by a Russian Federation Presidential Decree (No. 378) as victims of political repression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In 1999, the religious organization “Administrative Center of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia” was reregistered under the current religious law.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>What Is Happening Today?</span></h5>
<p><span class="font12">Today Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia enjoy their freedom of worship. Currently, there are over 2,200 congregations and groups as well as more than 400 legally registered local religious organizations of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. More than 118,000 free courses in Bible education are being conducted regularly with interested people right in their own home. In the early part of 2008, nearly 300,000 people were present at the annual commemoration of the Memorial of Christ’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s Witnesses are motivated by genuine Christian love of neighbor. The Witnesses hope that others in Russia will listen to their message of good news from the Bible with an open mind, letting their history, their public service work, and their Christian conduct speak for themselves.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> BIBLE: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that the entire Bible is the inspired Word of God. Instead of adhering to a creed based on human tradition, they hold to the Bible as the standard for all their beliefs. —2 Timothy 3:16,17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> GOD: </span><span class="font11">There is only one true God. He is supreme, the Creator of the heavens and the earth. His name is Jehovah.—Exodus 15:3;Psalm 83:18.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> JESUS CHRIST: </span><span class="font11">Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He came to earth from heaven and laid down his perfect human life as a ransom sacrifice. His death and resurrection make salvation and eternal life possible for those exercising faith in him. As King of God’s Kingdom, Jesus will rule from the heavens over an earth restored to righteousness and peace.—John 3: 16;Revelation 11:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> NEUTRALITY: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah’s Witnesses do not interfere with the efforts of the nations to raise armies and defend themselves. However, Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that they must individually ‘beat their swords into plowshares and learn war no more.’ (Isaiah 2:3, 4) Accordingly, they do not fight in the wars of nations or take sides in partisan affairs. (John 17:16) Their stand is well documented in history and can be traced to the example of the first-century Christians. At the same time, Jehovah’s Witnesses never interfere with what others choose to do.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> GOOD CITIZENSHIP: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah’s Witnesses obey the laws of the government and conscientiously pay their taxes. (Romans 13:1, 7) Additionally, their publications and public ministry encourage everyone to be law-abiding. They are not a cult or a sect. They do not isolate themselves from the rest of society. They do not follow a human leader; their Leader is Jesus Christ. In order to become Jehovah’s Witnesses, many among them overcame such harmful practices as stealing and the abuse of drugs and alcohol.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> FAMILY LIFE: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah’s Witnesses highly regard family life and follow the Biblical commands that husbands love their wives, wives respect their husbands, and children obey their parents. (Ephesians 5:21-6:3) They are very interested in the well-being of their children and try to raise them to become worthwhile members of society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> HEALTH: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah’s Witnesses desire long and healthy lives. For this reason they do not smoke or abuse drugs. They may use alcoholic beverages in moderation, but they shun drunkenness. They do not practice abortion or engage in sexual relations outside of marriage. Jehovah’s Witnesses seek to obtain the best medical care available for themselves and their children. They obey the Bible’s command to “abstain . . . from blood” and thus avoid the hazards and often fatal complications arising from transfusion of another person’s blood.—Acts 15:20, 28, 29.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> FINANCIAL SUPPORT: </span><span class="font11">The work of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia is sustained by voluntary contributions of fellow believers, who fully support the work. —2 Corinthians 9:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font15">•</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> MINISTRY: </span><span class="font11">All of Jehovah’s Witnesses talk to others about Jehovah, and they follow Jesus’ command to “make disciples.” (Matthew 28:19, 20) All their ministerial activity is done on a volunteer basis, and Jehovah’s Witnesses have no paid clergy.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark35"></a>What Others Say About Jehovah’s Witnesses</span></h3>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah’s Witnesses realize that not everyone agrees with their explanation or application of the Scriptures. Since we live in a pluralistic society, tolerance of differences in lifestyles, ethnic backgrounds, and religious beliefs makes for peace. Many journalists, judges, and others have commented on the fine spirit and positive contributions that Jehovah’s Witnesses have made to the communities in which they live. The following are but a sample.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In his book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses—A Traditionally Russian Religious Organization, </span><span class="font12">Dr. Sergei Ivanenko, a Russian religion scholar, says this about Jehovah’s Witnesses: “Their religious organization has had members on Russian territory for over a hundred years, and in many cases believers who profess the religious teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses are second-, third-, or even fourthgeneration members. In any case, from an analysis of the . . . facts characterizing the role and place of the religious organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russian history from the Great Patriotic War, it may be concluded that this religious organization has become one of the visible components of the religious life of the former USSR and Russia and also that affiliation with the religious organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses, including that spread over several generations, does not mean the loss of national self-awareness and cultural identification by its believers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In his work </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses: History and Present,</span><span class="font12"> Academician N. S. Gor-dienko, professor of religious studies, writes: “Although the association of Jehovah’s Witnesses is an international organization, whose Governing Body is located in the U.S.A., it does not import into Russia a strange, ‘foreign’ spirituality, but fulfills the spiritual needs of Russians, helping them in the context of religion to solve problems of a social, ideological, or simply everyday nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The organization of Jehovah’s Witnesses does not pretend to have a dominant position among Russia’s religions. Its members belong to a religious minority and do not count on anything more, neither now nor in the future. They occupy their own niche in the spiritual life of believers among the citizens of the Russian Federation, giving a certain sector of Russians that which they do not receive from other religious and secular ideological systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Jehovah’s Witnesses are loyal citizens of Russia, who are invariably law-abiding and obedient to authorities and have high morals and a healthful lifestyle—all of which serve the basic interests of individuals and society. They strive to be friendly not only toward fellow believers but also toward all other citizens. ...</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“The association of Jehovah’s Witnesses is a normal religious organization, and in the spirit of the constitutional guarantee of the freedom of conscience, it should be treated just as tolerantly as other confessions and denominations legally existing in Russia and acting within the ramifications of the Constitution of the Russian Federation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Lyudmila Alekseeva, chairman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, stated: “As a result of pressure from Soviet authorities, I had to immigrate to the U.S.A., where from 1979 to 1986, I lived in the small town of Tarrytown, New York. On one of the streets in my neighborhood, there were churches of many confessions: Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, and a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. All the believers lived peaceably with one another, there were no conflicts between them, and externally (according to the way they dressed and conducted themselves), there was no great difference between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“Some of my neighbors were Jehovah’s Witnesses. They were pleasant, cultured people, who did not engage in aggressive behavior. When Jehovah’s Witnesses preached and called at my door, I always answered that I was Orthodox and would not discuss religious beliefs with them. They left peacefully, and we had no arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“In 1993, I returned to Russia, and while I was engaged in legal defense activities, I became acquainted with Jehovah’s Witnesses in our country (they appealed to the Moscow Helsinki Group about the violation of their rights). Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses made a good impression on me. They are able to remain calm and keep their dignity even in an atmosphere of hostility, which is sometimes stirred up against them and influences authorities and members of society. Usually people who are confronted with injustice and loss of their legal rights become nervous, irritable, and angry. This did not happen to Jehovah’s Witnesses who turned to the Moscow Helsinki Group. Most likely they have... developed their own kind of stoicism, considering that they are suffering for their loyalty to Christ and must rely on both their own strength and God’s help to fulfill their mission without despair.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Religions of the Nations of Modern Russia,</span><span class="font12"> released under the editorship of Miran Petrovich Mchedlov, Chairman of the Expert Council for Conducting State Expert Religious Studies With the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, the following is noted: “The Authorities are considered by Jehovah’s Witnesses as an arrangement that is permitted to exist by God. They do not take part in conflicts with the law. </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">They respect order and obedience to the</span><span class="font12"> law.”—Italics ours; 1999, page 463.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Commenting on the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses, a July 2008 ruling of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">“Jehovah’s Witnesses are loyal citizens of Russia, who are invariably law-abiding and obedient to authorities and have high morals and a healthful lifestyle—all of which serve the basic interests of individuals and society. They strive to be friendly not only toward fellow believers but also toward all other citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">—Professor N. S. Gordienko </span><span class="font12">European Court of Human Rights upholding religious freedom, stated that Jehovah’s Witnesses are “long established” and are among “religious groups with a long-standing existence internationally.”—Case </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">of Religions-gemeinschaft DerZeugen Jehovas and Others v. Austria,</span><span class="font12"> (Application No. 40825/98).</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">On November 5, 1996, Professor Dr. h.c. Karel Dobbelaere, a member of the Belgian Royal Academy, wrote that Jehovah’s Witnesses are a worldwide established religion. His document was notarized on November 12,1996, by the Apostille of the Belgium Minister of Foreign Affairs. It states:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“For about 20 years, I have observed the Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses. In 1976, I... conducted a survey with professor Bryan R. Wilson from All Souls College, Oxford, to study the social aspects of that religious minority in Belgium ... I can say that Jehovah’s Witnesses are people issued from every social stratum. Their children attend public schools and universities. They are not sectarian. Their religion is established world-wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“I can add that Jehovah’s Witnesses cooperate closely with the medical staff and that they love their children. If a blood transfusion is prescribed, they request an alternative treatment out of respect for their convictions. In many large hospitals, effective techniques have been developed to accommodate them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Concerning an assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Greek magazine ENA noted: “As we saw them praying, we were impressed by their peaceable attitude. The presence of the police was limited to only a few men....</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">These are people with strong family ties, they are taught to love and to live by their conscience so as not to harm others.”—July 22, 1993, pages 114-116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A deputy of the local parliament of the city of Luxembourg, Pierre Frieden, commented in a letter dated December 7,1990:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“[Jehovah’s Witnesses] are typical of the men of our day who meet the demands of our modern society. Perhaps more than others, they demonstrate the union of higher morality with sincere loyalty toward our democratic institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">“To my knowledge, the representatives of the Watch Tower Society have always adhered to their resolve to perform no act that would not entirely and faithfully conform to the requirements of the law and the regulations of the City of Luxembourg.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The premiere of the video documentary </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault</span><span class="font12"> was held at the Ravensbriick Memorial in Germany on November 6, 1996. Regarding the documentary, then Prime Minister Manfred Stolpe of the Federal State of Brandenburg wrote: “I would like to reassure you in writing that I greatly respect Jehovah’s Witnesses for resisting NationalSocialism courageously and for unselfishly assisting other inmates.. .. The presentation of your video is an important step toward informing the public about the role of your religious group under the NS-regime. For sure it would be very appropriate to have the video included in the educational program of the Memorials in Ravensbruick and Sachsenhausen and to have them always available for visitors.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16">As you can see, Jehovah’s Witnesses </span><span class="font13">are an upright and well-established religion, whose members have contributed much to the well-being of their neighborhoods and to peaceful relations among the people in their communities. Their resoluteness in upholding the high moral standards of the Bible and their love of neighbor, as expressed especially in their Bible education, have had a wholesome effect in all countries where they exist. At times they have been misunderstood, as this brief review of history shows. However, they have endured quietly under adversity, not allowing it to dampen their love of God and love of neighbor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although Jehovah’s Witnesses have often been the subject of criticism and sometimes the object of ridicule and scorn, the same was true of the Christian congregation when it was founded by Jesus Christ in the first century. For instance, opposers spoke of the apostle Paul as “a pestilent fellow,” and called the Christians associated with him a “sect.” (Acts 24:5; 28:22) Jehovah’s Witnesses try their best to seek God’s approval, which they regard as being of higher value than the approval of fellow men. We agree with the first-century lawyer Gamaliel, who said of the early Christian preaching activity: “If it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them.” (Acts 5:39) We trust that all sincere and honesthearted people of Russia will be convinced of the uprightness of Jehovah’s Witnesses and conclude that they are law-abiding citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">It is hoped that this brochure will be accepted as an expression of our sincere desire to inform the authorities and honesthearted people firsthand of the Christian activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses in doing the will of God in Russia.</span></p>
