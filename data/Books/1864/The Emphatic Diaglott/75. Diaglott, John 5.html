It was and a sabbath in that the day.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:10 Said then the Jews to the having been healed: A sabbath it is; not it is lawful for thee to carry the bed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:11 He answered them: He having made a sound, he to me said: Take up the bed of thee, and walk.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:12 They asked then him: Who is the man, he saying to thee: Take up the bed of thee, and walk?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:13 He but having been cured not knew who it is; the for Jesus slipped out, a crowd being in the place.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:14 After these finds him the Jesus in the temple, and said to him: See, sound thou hast become; no longer do thou sin, that so worse to thee anything may happen.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:15 Went away the man, and told to the Jews, that Jesus it is, he having made him sound.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:16 And through this persecuted the Jesus the Jews, because these he did in a sabbath.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:17 The and Jesus answered them: The father of me till now works, and I work.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:18 Through this therefore more sought him the Jews to kill, because not only he was breaking the sabbath, but also a Father his own said the God, equal himself making to the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:19 Answered then the Jesus and said to them: Indeed indeed I say to you, not is able the son to do of himself nothing, if not anything he may see the Father doing; what for ever he may do, these also the son in like manner does.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:20 The for Father loves the son, and all shows to him, what he does; and greater of these shows to him works, so that you may wonder.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:21 As for the Father raises the dead ones and makes alive; thus also the son, whom he will, makes alive.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:22 Not even for the Father judges any one; but the judgment all has given to the son;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:23 so that all may honor the son, even as they honor the Father. He not honoring the son, not honors the Father, that having sent him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:24 Indeed indeed I say to you, that he the word of me hearing, and believing, the having sent me has life age-lasting, and into judgment not comes, but has passed out of the death into the life.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:25 Indeed indeed I say to you, that comes an hour, and now is, when the dead ones shall hear the voice of the son of the God; and those having heard will live.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:26 As for the Father has life in himself; so he gave also the son life to have in himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:27 And authority he gave to him also judgment to execute, because a son of man he is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:28 Not wonder you this; because comes an hour, in which all those in the tombs, shall hear the voice of him,</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:29 and shall come forth, those the good things having done, to a resurrection of life; those and the evil things having done, to a resurrection of judgment.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:30 Not am able I to do of myself nothing. Even as I hear, I judge, and the judgment the mine just is; that not I seek the will the mine, but the will of the sending me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:31 If I testify concerning myself, the testimony of me out not is true.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:32 Another is he testifying concerning me; and I know, that rue is the testimony, which he testifies concerning me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:33 You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:34 I but not from a man the testimony receive; but these things I say, that you may be saved.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:35 He was the lamp the burning and shinning; you and were willing to rejoice for an hour in the light of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:36 I but have the testimony greater of the John; the for works, which gave to me the Father, that I might finish them, these the works, which I do, testifies concerning me, because the Father me has sent.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:37 And he having sent me Father himself has testified concerning me. Neither a voice of him have you heard at any time, nor form of him have you seen.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:38 And the word of him not you have abiding in you; because whom sent he, this you not believe.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:39 You search the writings, because you think in them life age-lasting to have; and they are those testifying concerning me;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:40 and not you are willing to come to me, so that life you may have.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:41 Glory from men not I receive;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:42 but I have known you, that the love of the God not you have in yourselves.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:43 I have come in the name of the Father of me, and not you receive me; if another should come in the name the own, him you will receive.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:44 How are able you to believe, glory from one another receiving, and the glory that from the only God not you seek?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:45 Not think you, that I will accuse you to the Father; is he accusing you, Moses, into whom you have hoped.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:46 If for you believe Moses, you would believe me; concerning for me he wrote.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 5:47 If but the of him writings not you believe, how the my words will you believe.</span></p></body></html>
