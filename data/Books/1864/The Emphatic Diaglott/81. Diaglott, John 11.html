If any one may walk in the day, not he stumbles, because the light of the world this he sees.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:10 If but any one may walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light not is in him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:11 These things he said; and after this he says to them: Lazarus the friend of us is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:12 Said then the disciples of him: O lord, if he is fallen asleep, he shall be saved.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:13 Had spoken but the Jesus about the death of him; they but thought, that concerning the repose of the sleep he speaks.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:14 Then therefore said to them the Jesus plainly: Lazarus died;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:15 and I rejoice because of you, that you may believe, that not I was there; but we may go to him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:16 Said then Thomas, that being called a twin, to the fellow-disciples: May go also we, that we may die with him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:17 Coming therefore the Jesus found him four days already been in the tomb.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:18 Was now the Bethany near the Jerusalem, about from furlongs fifteen.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:19 And many of the Jews had come to those about Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning the brother of them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:20 The then Martha when she heard, that Jesus was coming, met him; Mary but in the house was sitting.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:21 Said then the Martha to the Jesus: O lord, if thou hadst been here, the brother of me not would have died;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:22 but and now I know, that whatever things thou mayest ask the God, will give to thee the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:23 Says of her the Jesus: Will rise again the brother of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:24 Says to him Martha: I know, that he will rise again, in the resurrection in the last day.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:25 Said to her the Jesus: I am the resurrection and the life; he believing into me, even if he may die, he shall live;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:26 and all the living and believing into me, not not may die into the age. Believest thou this?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:27 She says to him: Yes, O lord, I have believed, that thou art the Anointed, the son of the God, he into the world coming.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:28 And these things saying, she went, and called Mary the sister of her privately, saying: The teacher is present, and calls thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:29 She when she heard, rises up quickly, and comes to him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:30 (Not yet now had come the Jesus into the village; but was in the place, where met him the Martha.)</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:31 The therefore Jews, those being with her in the house and were comforting her, seeing the Mary, that quickly she rose up and went out, followed her, saying: That she goes into the tomb, that she may weep there.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:32 The therefore Mary when came where was the Jesus, seeing him, she fell of him to the feet, saying to him: O lord, if thou hadst been there, not would have died of me the brother.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:33 Jesus therefore when he saw her weeping, and those having come with her Jews weeping, he was agitated in the spirit, and troubled himself,</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:34 and said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: O lord, come, and see.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:35 Wept the Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:36 Said then the Jews: See, how he loved him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:37 Some but of them said: Not was able this, he having opened the eyes of the blind to have caused, that even this not should die?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:38 Jesus therefore again being agitated in himself, comes to the tomb. It was now a cave, and a stone was lying on it.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:39 Says the Jesus: Take away the stone. Says to him the sister of the having died, Martha: O lord, now he smelling; fourth day for it is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:40 Says to her the Jesus: Not I said to thee, that if thou wouldst believe, thou shalt see the glory of the God?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:41 They took away then the stone. The but Jesus lifted up the eyes above, and said: O Father, I give thanks to thee, that thou didst hear me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:42 I and knew, that always me thou hearest; but on account of the crowd that standing I spoke, so that they may believe, that thou me has sent.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:43 And these things saying, with a voice loud he cried out: O Lazarus, come out.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:44 Came out he having been dead, having been bound the feet and the hands with bandages, and the face of him with a napkin bound about. Says to them the Jesus: Loose you him, and allow to go.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:45 Many therefore of the Jews, those having come to the Mary, and having gazed upon what he did, believed into him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:46 Some but of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what did the Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:47 Assembled then the high-priests and the Pharisees a high council, and said: What are we doing? because this the man many signs does.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:48 If we allow him thus, all will believe into him; and will come the Romans, and will take away of us both the place and the nation.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:49 One and a certain of them, Caiaphas, high-priest being of the year that, said to them: You not know nothing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:50 Neither do you consider, that it is better for us, that one man should die in behalf of the people, and not whole the nation should perish.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:51 This but from himself not he said; but high-priest being of the year that, he prophesied, that was about Jesus to die in behalf of the nation;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:52 and not in behalf of the nation alone, but that also the children of the God those having been scattered he should gather into one.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:53 From that therefore the day they took counsel together, that they might kill him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:54 Jesus therefore no longer publicly walked among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, into Ephraim being called a city; and there remained with the disciples of himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:55 Was and near the passover the Jews; and went up many into Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:56 They sought then the Jesus, and said with each other in the temple standing: What think you? that not not he may come to the feast?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 11:57 Had given now both the high-priests and the Pharisees a commandment, that if any one should know where he is, he should show, how they might seize him.</span></p></body></html>
