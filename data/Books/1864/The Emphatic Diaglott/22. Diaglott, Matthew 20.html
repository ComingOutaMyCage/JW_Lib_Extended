<h3><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Diaglott, Matthew 20</span></h3><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:1 Like for is the kingdom of the heavens to a man a householder, who went out with morning to hire laborers into the vineyard of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:2 Having agreed and with the laborers for a denarius the day, he sent him into the vineyard of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:3 And going out about third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:4 and to them he said: Go and you into the vineyard; and whatever may be just, I will give you. They and went away.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:5 Again going out about sixth and ninth hour, he did in like manner.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:6 About and the eleventh hour going out, he found others standing, and he says to them: Why here stood you all the day idle?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:7 They say to him: Because no one us hired. He says to them: Go also you into the vineyard; and whatever maybe just, you shall receive.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:8 Evening and having come on, says the lord of the vineyard to the steward of him: Call the laborers, and give to them the hire, beginning from the last, till the first.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:9 And having come those about the eleventh hour, received each a denarius.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:10 Having then those first, supposed, that more they shall receive; and received also they each a denarius.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:11 Having received but they murmured against the householder,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:12 saying: That these the last one hour worked, and equal to us them thou hast made, to the having endured the burden of the day, and the burning heat.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:13 He but answering said to one of them: Friend, not I wrong thee; not of a denarius didst thou agree to me?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:14 Take thee thine and go, I wish and to this the last to give as also of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:15 Or not is it lawful to me to do what I will with the my own? or the eye of thee evil is, because I good am?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:16 Thus shall be the last, first; and the first, last. Many for are called, few but chosen.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:17 And going up the Jesus to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples privately in the way, and said to them:</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:18 Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the son of the man will be delivered up to the high-priests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:19 and they will deliver up him to the Gentiles for the to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and in the third day he will stand up.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:20 Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with the sons of her, prostrating, and asking something from him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:21 He and said to her: What wilt thou? She says to him: Say that may sit these the two sons of me, one at right of thee, and one at left of thee, in the kingdom of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:22 Answering but the Jesus said: Not you know, what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup, which I am about to drink? They say to him: We are able.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:23 And he says to them: The indeed cup of me you shall drink; the but to sit at right of me and at left of me, not is mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared by the Father of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:24 And having heard the ten, were angry on account of the two brothers.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:25 The but Jesus, having called them, said: You know, that the rulers of the nations domineer over them. Not thus great exercise authority over them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:26 Not thus it shall be among you; but whoever may wish among you great to become, let him be of you servant;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:27 and whoever may wish among you to be first, let him be of you a slave;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:28 even as the son of the man not came to be served but to serve, and to give the life of him a ransom for many.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:29 And departing of them from Jericho, followed him a crowd great.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:30 And lo, two blind men, sitting by the way, hearing that Jesus passes by, cried out, saying: Pity us, O lord, son of David.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:31 The and crowd reproved them, that they might be silent. They but more did cry out, saying: Pity us, O lord, son of David.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:32 And having stopped the Jesus he called them, and said: What do you wish I should do to you?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:33 They say to him: O lord, that may be opened of us the eyes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 20:34 Being moved with pity and the Jesus, he touched the eyes of them; and immediately saw again of them the eyes; and they followed him.</span></p></body></html>
