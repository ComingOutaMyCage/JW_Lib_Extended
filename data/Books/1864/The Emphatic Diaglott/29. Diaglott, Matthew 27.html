They but said: What to us? Thou wilt see.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 27:5 And hurling the pieces of silver in the temple, he withdrew; and having gone forth strangled himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 27:6 The and high-priests, taking the pieces of silver, said: Not it is lawful to put them into the treasury, since price of blood it is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 27:7 Counsel and taking, they bought with them the field of the potter, to bury the strangers.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 27:8 Therefore is called the field that, a field of blood, to the day.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 27:9 Then was fulfilled the word spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying: And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of the having been valued, whom they valued from sons of Israel,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 27:10 and gave them for the field of the potter; even as directed me a Lord.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 27:11 The and Jesus stood in presence of the governor; and asked him the governor, saying: Thou art the king of the Jews?
