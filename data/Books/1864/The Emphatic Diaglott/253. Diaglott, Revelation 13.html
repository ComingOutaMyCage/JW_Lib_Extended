<h3><a name="bookmark508"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark509"></a>Diaglott, Revelation 13</span></h3><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:1 And I placed on the sand of the sea. And I saw out of the sea a wild-beast coming up, having horns ten and heads seven, and on the horns of him ten diadems, and on the heads of him names of blasphemy.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:2 And the wild-beast which I saw, was like to a leopard, and the feet of him as of a bear, and the mouth of him as a mouth of a lion. And gave to him the dragon the power of himself, and the throne of himself, and authority great.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:3 And one of the heads of him as if having been slain to death; and the stroke of the death of him was healed. And wondered whole the earth after the wilds beast,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:4 and they did homage to the dragon, because he gave the authority to the wild-beast, and they did homage to the wild-beast, saying: Who like to the wild-beast? and who is able to make war with him?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:5 And was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and was given to him authority to act months forty two.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:6 And he opened the mouth of himself for blasphemy against the God, to blaspheme the name of him, and the tabernacle of him, and those in the heaven, tabernacling.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:7 And it was given to him war to make with the holy ones, and to overcome them; and was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:8 And will worship him all those dwelling on the earth, of which not has been written the name in the scroll of the life of the lamb of that having been killed, from a casting down of a world.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:9 If any one has an hear, let him hear.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:10 If any one captivity leads together, into captivity he shall be led; if any one with a sword will kill, it is necessary him with a sword to be killed. Here is the patient endurance and the faith of the holy ones.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:11 And I saw another wild-beast coming up out of the earth, and he had horns two like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:12 And the authority of the first wild-beast all he does in presence of him; and he makes the earth and those in her dwelling that they should worship the wilds beast the first, of whom was healed the stroke of the death of him;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:13 and he makes signs great, and fire so that out of the heaven it may come down into the earth, in presence of the men.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:14 And he deceives those dwelling on the earth, by means of the signs which it was given to him to do in presence of the wild-beast; saying to those dwelling on the earth, to make an image to the wild-beast, which has the stroke of the sword and lived.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:15 And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the wild-beast, so that both should speak the image of the wild-beast, and should cause, as many as not would do homage to the image of the wild-beast that they should be killed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:16 And hew causes all, the little ones and the great ones, and the rich ones and the poor ones, and the freedom and the bondmen, that they should give to them a mark on the hand of them the right, or on the forehead of them;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:17 and that no one may be able to buy or to sell, if not the one having the mark, the name of the wild-beast, or the number of the name of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Revelation 13:18 Here the wisdom is; the one having a mind, let him compute the number of the wild-beast; a number for of a man it is, and the number of him six hundred and sixty-six.</span></p></body></html>
