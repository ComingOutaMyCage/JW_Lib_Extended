And seeing the Jesus the faith of them, he said to the paralytic: Take courage, son; are forgiven thee the sins of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:3 And lo, some of the scribes said among themselves: This blasphemes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:4 And knowing the Jesus the thoughts of them, says: Why you think evils in the hearts of you?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:5 Which for is easier? to say: Are forgiven of thee the sins? or to say: Arise and walk?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:6 That but you may know that authority has the son of the man on the earth to forgive sins; (then he says to the paralytic:) Arising take up of thee the bed, and go into the house of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:7 And arising he went to the house of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:8 Seeing and the crowds wondered, and glorified the God, that having given authority so great to the men.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:9 And passing on the Jesus from thence, he saw a man sitting at the custom-house, Matthew being named; and he says to him: Follow me. And rising up he followed him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:10 And it happened, of him reclining at table in the house, and lo, many publicans and sinners coming reclined with the Jesus and the disciples of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:11 And seeing the Pharisees said to the disciples of him: Why with the publicans and sinners eats the teacher of you?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:12 The Jesus hearing, says to them: No need have those being well of a physician, but those sick being.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:13 You are going but learn, what is; Mercy I wish, and not a sacrifice. Not for I am come to call just persons, but sinners.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why we and the Pharisees fast much, the but disciples of thee not fast?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:15 And says to them the Jesus: Not are able the sons of the bridal chamber to mourn, in as much with them is the bridegroom? Shall come but days, when may be taken from them the bridegroom, and then they shall fast.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:16 No one now puts a patch of cloth unfulled on to a mantle old; takes away for the patch of it from the mantle, and worse a rent becomes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:17 Nor do they put wine new into bottles old; if but not, burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are destroyed; but they put wine new into bottles new, and both are preserved together.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:18 These of him speaking, of them, lo, a ruler certain coming prostrated to him, saying: That the daughter of me now is dead; but coming lay the hand of thee upon her, and she shall live.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:19 And arising the Jesus went after him, and the disciples of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:20 And lo, a woman having a flow of blood twelve years, approaching behind, touched the tuft of the mantle of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:21 She said for within herself: If only I can touch the mantle of him, I shall be healed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:22 The but Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Take courage, daughter; the faith of thee has saved thee. And she was well the woman from the hour of that.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:23 And coming the Jesus into the house of a ruler, and seeing the flute-players, and the crowd making noise,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:24 says to them: Withdraw; not for is dead the girl, but sleeps. And they derided him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:25 When but they put out the crowd, he entering took hold of the hand of her; and was raised the girl.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:26 And went forth the report this into all the land that.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:27 And passing on from there the Jesus, went after him two blind men, crying out and saying: Have pity on us, O son of David.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:28 Being come and into the house, came to him the blind men, and says to them the Jesus: Do you believe, that I am able this I do? They say to him: Yes O master.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:29 Then he touched the eyes of them, saying: According to the faith of you be it done to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:30 And were opened of them the eyes. And strictly charged them the Jesus, saying: See, no one knows.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:31 They but having gone published him in all the land that.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:32 These and going away, lo, they brought to him a man dumb, being demonized.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:33 And having cast out the demon, spoke the dumb. And were astonished the crowds, saying: Never was it seen thus in to the Israel.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:34 The but Pharisees said: By the prince of the demons he cast out the demons.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:35 And went about the Jesus the cities all and the villages, teaching in the synagogues of them, and publishing the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every malady.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:36 Seeing and the crowds, he moved with pity for them, because they were jaded and scattered, like sheep not having a shepherd.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:37 Then he says to the disciples of him: The indeed harvest plenteous, the but laborers few.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:38 Implore then the Lord of the harvest, that he would send out laborers into the harvest of him.</span></p></body></html>
