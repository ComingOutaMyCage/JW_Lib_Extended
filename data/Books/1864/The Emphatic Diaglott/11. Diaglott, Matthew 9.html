Not for I am come to call just persons, but sinners.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying: Why we and the Pharisees fast much, the but disciples of thee not fast?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:15 And says to them the Jesus: Not are able the sons of the bridal chamber to mourn, in as much with them is the bridegroom? Shall come but days, when may be taken from them the bridegroom, and then they shall fast.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:16 No one now puts a patch of cloth unfulled on to a mantle old; takes away for the patch of it from the mantle, and worse a rent becomes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:17 Nor do they put wine new into bottles old; if but not, burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are destroyed; but they put wine new into bottles new, and both are preserved together.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:18 These of him speaking, of them, lo, a ruler certain coming prostrated to him, saying: That the daughter of me now is dead; but coming lay the hand of thee upon her, and she shall live.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:19 And arising the Jesus went after him, and the disciples of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:20 And lo, a woman having a flow of blood twelve years, approaching behind, touched the tuft of the mantle of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:21 She said for within herself: If only I can touch the mantle of him, I shall be healed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:22 The but Jesus turning and seeing her, said: Take courage, daughter; the faith of thee has saved thee. And she was well the woman from the hour of that.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:23 And coming the Jesus into the house of a ruler, and seeing the flute-players, and the crowd making noise,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:24 says to them: Withdraw; not for is dead the girl, but sleeps. And they derided him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:25 When but they put out the crowd, he entering took hold of the hand of her; and was raised the girl.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:26 And went forth the report this into all the land that.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:27 And passing on from there the Jesus, went after him two blind men, crying out and saying: Have pity on us, O son of David.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 9:28 Being come and into the house, came to him the blind men, and says to them the Jesus: Do you believe, that I am able this I do?
