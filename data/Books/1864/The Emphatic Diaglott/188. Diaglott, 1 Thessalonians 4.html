<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Thessalonians 4:3 This for is will of the God, the sanctification of you; to abstain you from the fornication;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Thessalonians 4:4 to have known each one of you the of himself vessel to possess in satisfaction and honor,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Thessalonians 4:5 not in passion of inordinate desire, as even the Gentiles those not knowing the God;</span></p></li>
