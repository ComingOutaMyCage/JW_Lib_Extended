<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 11:2 I praise and you, brethren, because all things of me you have remembered, and as I delivered to you the traditions you retain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 11:3 I wish but you to have knowledge, that of every man the head the Anointed is; head but of woman, the man; head but of Anointed, the God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 11:4 Every man praying or prophesying upon head having, disgraces the head of himself.</span></p></li>
