The but Jesus down stooping, with the finger wrote on the ground.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:7 When but they continued asking him, having raised up he said to them: He without sin of you, first the stone on her let him cast.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:8 And again down stooping, wrote on the ground.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:9 They and having heard, and by the conscience being convinced, went out one by one, beginning from the elders even to the last ones; and left alone the Jesus, and the woman in middle standing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:10 Having raised up and the Jesus, and no one seeing but the woman, said to her: The woman, where are those the accusers of thee? no one thee condemned?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:11 She and said: No one, O lord. Said and to her the Jesus: Neither I thee condemn; go, and no longer do thou sin.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:12 Again therefore the Jesus to them spoke, saying: I am the light of the world; he following me, not not shall walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of the life.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:13 Said therefore to him the Pharisees: Thou concerning thyself dost testify; the testimony of thee not is true.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:14 Answered Jesus and said to them: Even if I testify concerning myself, true is the testimony of me; because I know, whence I came, and where I go; you but not know, whence I came, or where I go.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:15 You according to the flesh judge, I not judge no one.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:16 Even if judge but I, the judgment the my true is; because alone not I am, but I and the having sent me Father.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:17 Also in the law and the your it has been written: That two of men the testimony true is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:18 I am he testifying concerning myself, and testifies concerning me the having sent me Father.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:19 They said then to him: Where is the father of thee? Answered Jesus: Neither me you know, nor the Father of me. If me you knew, also the Father of me you would know.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:20 These the words he spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one seized him, because not yet had come the hour of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:21 Said therefore again to them the Jesus: I go away, and you will seek me, and in the sin of you you will die; where I go, you not are able to come.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:22 Said then the Jews: Not will he kill himself, because he says: Where I go, you not are able to come?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:23 And he said to them: You from the beneath are, I from the above am; you from the world this are, I not am from the world this.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:24 I said therefore to you, that you will die in the sins of you; if for not you may believe, that I am, you will die in the sins of you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:25 They said therefore to him: Thou who art? And said to them the Jesus: The beginning what, what even I say to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:26 Many things I have about you to say, and to judge; but he having sent me true is; and I what I heard from him, these things I say to the world.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:27 Not they knew, that the Father to them he spoke.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:28 Said then to them the Jesus: When you may left up the son of the man, then you will know that I am; and from myself I do nothing, but as taught me the Father of me these things I say;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:29 and he having sent me, with me is; not left me alone the Father, because I the things pleasing to him do always.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:30 These of him speaking, many believed into him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:31 Said then the Jesus to those having believed him Jews: If you may abide in the word the my, truly disciples of me you are,</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:32 and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make free you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:33 They answered him: Seed of Abraham we are, and to no one have we been slaves at any time; how thou sayest: That free you shall become?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:34 Answered them the Jesus: Indeed indeed I say to you, that every one who is doing the sin, a slave is of the sin.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:35 The but slave not abides in the house to the age; the son abides to the age.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:36 If then the son you may make free, really free you shall be.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:37 I know, that seed of Abraham you are; but you seek me to kill, because the word the mine not has place in you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:38 I what have seen from the Father of me, I speak; and you therefore what you have seen from the father of you, do.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:39 They answered and said to him: The father of us Abraham is. Says to them the Jesus: If children of the Abraham you are, the works of the Abraham you would do.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:40 Now but you seek me to kill, a man, who the truth to you has spoken, which I have heard from the God; this Abraham not did. You do the works of the father of you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:41 They said then to him: We from fornication not have been born; one father we have, the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:42 Said to them the Jesus: If the God a father of you was, you would love me; I for from the God came out and am come; not even for of myself I have come, but he me sent.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:43 Why the speech the mine not know you? Because not you are able to hear the word the mine.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:44 You from the father the accuser are, and the lusts of the father of you you wish to do. He a manslayer was from a beginning, and in the truth not has stood; because not is truth in him. When may speak the falsehood, from the own he speaks; because a liar is, also the father of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:45 I but because the truth I speak, not you believe me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:46 Who of you convicts me concerning sin? If truth I speak, why you not believe me?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:47 He being from the God, the words of the God hears; through this you not hear, because from the God not you are.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:48 Answered the Jews and said to him: Not well say we, that a Samaritan art thou, and a demon thou hast?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:49 Answered Jesus: I a demon not have, but I honor the Father of me, and you dishonor me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:50 I but not seek the glory of me; it is he seeking and judging.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:51 Indeed indeed I say to you, if any one the word the mine may keep, death not not he may see to the age.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:52 Said then to him the Jews: Now we know, that a demon thou hast; Abraham died and the prophets, and thou sayest: If any one the word of me may keep, not not may taste of death to the age.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:53 Not thou greater art of the father of us Abraham, who died? and the prophets died; whom thyself makest thou?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:54 Answered Jesus: If I glorify myself, the glory of me nothing is. He is the Father of me he glorifying me, whom you say, that a God of you he is,</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:55 and not you know him; I but know him. And if I say, that not I know him, I shall be like you, a liar. But I know him, and the word of him I keep.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:56 Abraham the father of you ardently desired, that he might see the day the my; and he saw, and was glad.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:57 Said then the Jews to him: Fifty years not yet thou art, and Abraham hast thou seen?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:58 Said to them the Jesus: Indeed indeed I say to you, before Abraham to have been born, I am.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 8:59 They took up therefore stones, that they might cast on him; Jesus but hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span></p></body></html>
