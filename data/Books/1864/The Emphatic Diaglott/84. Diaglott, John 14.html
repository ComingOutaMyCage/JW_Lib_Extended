He having seen me, has seen the Father; and how thou sayest: Show to us the Father?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:10 Not believest thou, that I in the Father, and the Father in me is? The words which I speak to you, from myself not I speak; the but Father, he in me abiding, he does the works.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:11 You believe me, because I in the Father, and the Father in me, if but not, on account of the works themselves believe me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:12 Indeed indeed I speak to you, he believing into me, the works which I do, also he shall do, and greater of these shall he do; because I to the Father of me am going,</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:13 and what any thing you may ask in the name of me, this I will do; that may be glorified the Father in the son.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:14 If any thing you may ask in the name of me, I will do.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:15 If you love me, the commandments the mine keep you;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:16 and I will ask the Father, and another helper he will give to you, that he may abide with you into the age;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:17 the spirit of the truth, which the world not is able to receive, because not it beholds it, nor knows it; you but know it, because with you it abides, and in you it will be.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:18 Not I will leave you orphans; I am coming to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:19 Yet a little, and the world me no more beholds; you but behold me; because I live, also you shall live.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:20 In that the day shall know you, because I in the Father of me, and you in me, and I in you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:21 He having the commandments of me, and keeping them, that is he loving me; he and loving me, shall be loved by the Father of me; and I will love him, and will manifest to him myself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:22 Says to him Judas (not the Iscariot): O lord, and how has it happened, that to us thou art about to manifest thyself, and not to the world?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:23 Answered Jesus and said to him: If any one love me, the word of me he will keep; and the Father of me will love him; to him we will come, and a dwelling with him we will make.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:24 He not loving me, the words of me not will keep; and the word which you hear, not is mine, but of the sending me Father.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:25 These things I have spoken to you, with you abiding;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:26 but the helper, the spirit the holy, which will send the Father in the name of me, that you will teach all things, and will remind you all things which I told you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:27 Peace I leave to you, peace the mine I give to you; not as the world gives, I give to you. Not let be troubled of you the heart nor let it be afraid.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:28 You heard, that I said to you: I am going away, and I am coming to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, that I am going to the Father; because the Father of me greater of me is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:29 And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 14:30 No more much I will speak with you.

Arise you, let us go from this place.</span></p></body></html>
