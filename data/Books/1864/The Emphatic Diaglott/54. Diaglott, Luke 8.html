And came down a squall of wind on the lake, and they were filling, and were in danger.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:24 Coming to and they awoke him, saying: O master, O master, we are perishing. He and arising rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:25 He said and to them: Where is the faith of you? Fearing and they wondered, saying to one another: Who then this is, that even to the winds he gives a charge and to the water, and they hearken to him?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:26 And they sailed into the country of the Gadarenes, which is over-against the Galilee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:27 Going out and to him on the land, met him a man certain out of the city, who had demons from times many, and a mantle not he put on, and in a house not he remained, but in the tombs.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:28 Seeing and the Jesus, and crying out, he fell down to him, and with a voice loud he said: What to me and to thee, Jesus, O son of the God of the highest? I beseech thee, not me thou mayest torment.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:29 (He had commanded for the spirit the unclean to come out from the man; many for times it had seized him; and he was bound with chains and fetters, being guarded; and breaking the bonds, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.)</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:30 Asked and him the Jesus, saying: What to thee is a name? He and said: Legion; for demons many had entered into him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:31 And he besought him, that not he would command them into the abyss to go.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:32 Was and there a herd of swine many feeding in the mountain; and they besought him, that he would permit them into them to enter. And he permitted them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:33 Having gone out and the demons from the man, they entered into the swine; and rushed the herd down the precipice into the lake, and were chocked.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:34 Seeing and those feeding that having been done, fled and reported in the city and in the villages.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:35 They came out and to see that having been done; and came to the Jesus, and found sitting the man, from whom the demons had gone out, having been clothed and being of sane mind, at the feet of the Jesus; and they were afraid.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:36 Reported and to them and those having seen, how was saved he having been demonized.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:37 And asked him whole the multitude of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes, to go from them; for with a fear great they were seized. He and having gone into the ship, returned.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:38 Begged and of him the man, from whom had gone out the demons, to be with him. Sent away but him the Jesus, saying:</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:39 Return to the house of thee, and relate, how much has done to thee the God. And he went away, through whole the city publishing, how much had done to him the Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:40 It happened and in the to return the Jesus, gladly received him the crowd; they were for all waiting for him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:41 And lo, came a man, to whom a name Jairus, and he a ruler of the synagogue was; and falling at the feet of the Jesus, besought him to come into the house of himself;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:42 for a daughter only was to him about years twelve, and she was dying. In and to the to go him, the crowds pressed him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:43 And a woman being in a flow of blood from years twelve, who with physicians having expended whole the living, not had strength by any one to be cured;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:44 coming behind, touched the tuft of the mantle of him; and immediately stopped the flow of the blood of her.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:45 And said the Jesus: Who the having touched me? Denying and all, said the Peter and those with him: O master, the crowds press on thee and crowd; and sayest thou: Who the having touched me?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:46 The and Jesus said: Touched me some one; I for know a power went out from me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:47 Seeing and the woman, that not she was unnoticed trembling came, and falling down to him, through what cause she touched him, related to him in presence of all of the people, and how she was cured immediately.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:48 He and said to her: Take courage, O daughter; the faith of thee has saved thee; go in peace.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:49 While of him speaking, comes some one from of the synagogue-ruler’s, saying to him: That is dead the daughter of thee; not trouble thou the teacher.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:50 The but Jesus having heard, answered him, saying: Not fear; only believe you, and she shall be saved.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:51 Coming and in to the house, not he suffered to enter no one, except Peter and John and James, and the father of the child and the mother.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:52 Was weeping and all, and lamenting her. He but said: Not weep you; not she is dead, but sleeps.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:53 And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:54 He but having put out all, and having grasped the hand of her, called out, saying: The child, arise.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:55 And returned the breath of her, and she stood up immediately. And he commanded to her to be given to eat.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 8:56 And were astonished the parents of her. He but charged them no one to tell that having been done.</span></p></body></html>
