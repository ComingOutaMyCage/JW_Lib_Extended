and thou sittest judging me according to the law, and violating the law thou orderest me to be struck?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:4 Those and having been standing by said: The high-priest of the God revilest thou?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:5 Said and the Paul: Not I had known, brethren, that it is a high-priest; it is written for: A ruler of the people of thee not thou shalt speak evil.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:6 Knowing and the Paul, that the one part is of Sadducees, the and other of Pharisees, he cried out in the sanhedrim: Men brethren, I a Pharisee am, a son of a Pharisee; concerning hope and a resurrection of dead ones I being judged.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:7 This and of him having spoken, was a disciple of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and was divided the multitude.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:8 Sadducees indeed for say not to be a resurrection, nor a messenger, nor a spirit; Pharisees but confess the both.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:9 Was and an outcry great; and having arisen the scribes of the party of the Pharisees contended, saying: Nothing evil we find in the man this; if but a spirit spoke to him, or a messenger.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:10 Great and becoming dispute, fearing the commander lest would be torn to pieces the Paul by them, he ordered the armed force having gone down to take him from midst of them, to lead and into the castle.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:11 On the and next night having stood by him the Lord said: Take courage; as for thou didst testify the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so thee it behooves also in Rome to testify.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:12 Becoming and day, having formed a conspiracy the Jews, they bound with a curse themselves, saying neither to eat nor drink till they might kill the Paul;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:13 were and more forty those this the conspiracy having been engaged;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:14 who having come to the high-priests and the elders, said: With a curse we have cursed ourselves, of nothing to taste till we have killed the Paul.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:15 Now therefore you make known to the commander with the sanhedrim, in order that him he may lead down to you, as being about to examine more accurately the things concerning him; we and, before of the to have come nigh him, ready we are of the to kill him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:16 Having heard but the son of the sister of Paul the lying in wait, having come near and having gone into the castle, he related to the Paul.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:17 Having summoned and the Paul one of the centurions, he said: The young man this lead thou to the commander; he has for something to relate to him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:18 Indeed then having taken him led to the commander, and said: The prisoner Paul having summoned me, asked this the young man to lead to thee, having something to say to thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:19 Having taken and the hand of him the commander, and having related by himself, he inquired: What is it which thou hast to relate to me?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:20 he said and: That the Jews agreed together of the to ask thee, that to-morrow into the sanhedrim thou mayest lead down the Paul, as being about something more accurately to investigate concerning him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:21 Thou therefore not shouldst be persuaded by the; lie in wait for him of them men more forty, who bound with a curse themselves, neither to eat nor to drink till they killed him; and now ready they are looking for the from thee promise.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:22 The indeed then commander dismissed the young man, having charged to no one to speak out, that these things thou didst report to me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:23 And having summoned two certain of the centurions, he said: Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go to to Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, from third hour of the night;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:24 animals and to have provided that having mounted the Paul they might convey safely to Felix the governor;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:25 having written a letter containing the form this:</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:26 Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix health.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:27 The man this having been seized by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them, having come suddenly with the armed force I rescued him, having learned that a Roman he is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:28 Wishing and to know the cause on account of which they were accusing him, I led down him into the sanhedrim of them;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:29 whom I found being accused concerning questions of the law of them, nothing but worthy of death or bonds an accusation having.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:30 Having been disclosed but to me a plot against the man to be about to be by the Jews, instantly I sent to thee, having commanded also the accusers to say the things against him before thee. Farewell.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:31 The indeed therefore soldiers, according to that having been commanded them, having taken the Paul, they led through the night into the Antipatris.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:32 On the and morrow having left the horsemen to go with him, they returned to the castle.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:33 Who having come into the Caesarea, and having delivered the letter to the governor, presented and the Paul to him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:34 Having read and, and having asked from what province he is, and having understood that from Cilicia;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Acts 23:35 I will fully hear thee, he said, when also the accusers of thee may arrive. He commanded and him in the judgment-hall of the Herod to be kept.</span></p></body></html>
