<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 12:6 and varieties of inworking are, the but same God, who is working the all things in all.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 12:7 To each one but is given the manifestation of the spirit to the benefit;</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 12:8 to one indeed for through the spirit is given a word of wisdom, to another and a word of knowledge, according to the same spirit;</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
