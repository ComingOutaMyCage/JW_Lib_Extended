If but the salt become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? for nothing is it of service any more, except to be cast out, and trodden under foot by the men.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:14 You are the light of the world. Not possible a city to hide upon a hill being situated;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:15 nor they light a lamp, and place him under the measure, but on the lamp-stand; and it gives light to all those in the house.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:16 Thus let it shine the light of you in the presence of the men, that they may see of you the good works, and may praise the Father of you that in the heavens.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:17 Not think ye, that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; not I have come to destroy, but to fulfill.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:18 Indeed for I say to you, till pass away the heaven and the earth, iota one or one fine point in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:19 Whoever therefore breaks one of the commandments of these of the least, and teach thus the men, least he shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens; who but ever shall do and teach, the same great shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:20 I say for to you that except abound the righteousness of you more of the scribes and Pharisees, by no means you may enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:21 You have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou kill; who ever shall kill, liable shall be to the tribunal.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:22 I but say to you, that all the being angry to the brother of him, without cause, liable shall be to the tribunal: who and ever shall say to the brother of him, Vile fellow, liable shall be to the Sanhedrim; who and ever shall say: O fool, liable shall be to the Gehenna of the fire.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:23 If therefore thou bring the gift of thee of the altar and there remember, that the brother of thee has somewhat against thee,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:24 leave there the gift of thee before the altar, and go, first be thou reconciled to the brother of thee, and then coming offer the gift of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:25 Be thou willing to agree with the opponent of thee quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest thee deliver up the opponent to the judge, and judge thee deliver up to the officer, and into prison thou shalt be cast.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:26 Indeed I say to thee, by no means thou wilt come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:27 You have heard, that it was said: Not thou shalt commit adultery.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:28 I but say to you, that all who looking at a woman in order to lust after her, already has debauched her in the heart of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:29 If and the eye of thee the right ensnare thee, tear out it, and cast it from thee, it is profitable for to thee, that should perish one of the members of thee, and not whole the body her, and cast from thee;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:30 it is profitable for the right of thee hand ensnare thee, cut off her, and cast from thee; it is profitable for to thee that should perish one of the members of thee, and not whole the body of thee should be cast into Gehenna.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:31 It was said and: that whoever shall release the wife of him, let him give her a bill of divorce.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:32 I but say to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except on account of fornication, makes her to commit adultery; and whoever her being divorced, may marry, commits adultery.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:33 Again you have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou shall swear falsely; shalt perform but to the Lord the oaths of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:34 I but say to you not swear at all; not even by the heaven, for a throne it is of the God;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:35 nor by the earth, for a footstool it is of the feet of him; neither by Jerusalem, for a city it is of the great king;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:36 nor by the head of thee shalt thou swear, for not thou art able one hair white or black to make.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:37 Let be but the word of you; yes yes; no no; that for over and above of these, of the evil is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:38 You have heard, that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:39 I but say to you, not resist the evil; but whoever thee shall slap upon the right of thee cheek, turn to him also the other;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:40 and to the purposing thee to sue at law, and the tunic of thee to take, give up to him also the mantle;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:41 and whoever thee shall force to go mile one, go with him two.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:42 To the asking thee do thou give; and the wishing from thee to borrow money, not do thou repulse.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:43 You have heard, that it was said: Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee, and hate the enemy of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:44 I but say to you, love the enemies of you, bless those cursing you, good do to those hating you and pray for those injuring you and persecuting you;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:45 that you may be sons of the Father of you, of the in heavens; for the sun of him it rises on evil and good, and it rains on just and unjust.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:46 If for you love those loving you, what reward have you? not even the tax-gatherers the same to do?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:47 and if you salute the brothers of you only, what more do you? not even the Gentiles so do?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 5:48 Shall be therefore you perfect, as the Father of you, who in the heavens, perfect is.</span></p></body></html>
