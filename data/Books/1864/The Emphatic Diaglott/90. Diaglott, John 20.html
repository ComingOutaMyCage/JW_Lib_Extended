As therefore she wept, she stopped down into the tomb,</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:12 and sees two messengers in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where was laid the body of the Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:13 And say to her they: O woman, why weepest thou? She says to them: Because they took away the Lord of me, and not I know where they laid him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:14 These things having said, she turned into the behind, and sees the Jesus standing; and not knew, that Jesus it is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:15 Says to her the Jesus: O woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing that the gardener it is, says to him: O sir, if thou didst carry off him, tell me where thou didst lay him, and I him will take away.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:16 Says to her the Jesus: Mary. Turning round she says to him: Rabboni, which means, O teacher.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:17 Says to her the Jesus: Not me touch; not yet for I have gone up to the Father of me; go but to the brethren of me, and say to them: I go up to the Father of me and Father of you, even God of me and God of you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:18 Comes Mary the Magdalene telling the disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and these things he said to her.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:19 Being then evening in the day that the first of the week, and the doors having been shut, where were the disciples having been assembled, through the fear of the Jews, came the Jesus, and stood into the midst, and says to them: Peace to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:20 And this having said, he showed to them the hands and the side of himself. Were glad therefore the disciples, seeing the Lord.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:21 Said then to them the Jesus again: Peace to you; as sent me the Father, also I send you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:22 And this having said, he breathed on, and says to them: Receive you a spirit holy.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:23 If of whom you may forgive the sins, they are forgiven them; if of whom you may retain, they have been retained.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:24 Thomas but, one of the twelve, he being called a twin, not was with them when came the Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:25 Said then to him the other disciples: We have seen the Lord. He but said to them: If not I may see in the hands of him the mark of the nails, and may put the finger of me into the mark of the nails, and may put the hand of me into the side of him, not not I will believe.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:26 And after days eight again were within the disciples of him, and Thomas with them. Comes the Jesus, the doors having been shut, and stood into the midst, and said: Peace to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:27 Afterwards he says to the Thomas: Bring the finger of thee here, and see the hands of me, and bring the hand of thee, and put into the side of me; and not be thou unbelieving, but believing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:28 Answered Thomas and said to him: The Lord of me and the God of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:29 Says to him the Jesus: Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed they not having seen, and having believed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:30 Many indeed then and other signs did the Jesus in presence of the disciples of him, which not it is having been written in the book this.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 20:31 These things but have been written, that you may believe, that Jesus is the Anointed, the son of the God, and that believing life you may have in the name of him.\</span></p></body></html>
