<p><span class="font3">1 John 1:1 What was from a beginning, what we have heard, what we have see with the eyes of us, what we gazed on, and the hands of us felt, concerning the Word of the life;</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">1 John 1:2 (and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and we bear testimony, and we declare to you the life the age-lasting, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 1:3 what we have seen and we have heard, we declare to you, so that also you fellowship may have with us; indeed the fellowship and the our with the Father and with the son of him Jesus Anointed.</span></p></li>
