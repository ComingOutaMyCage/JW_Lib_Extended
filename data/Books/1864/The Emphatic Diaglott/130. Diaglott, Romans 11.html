Not let it be; and for I an Israelite I am, of seed of Abraham, of tribe of Benjamin.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:2 Not did put away the God the people of himself, whom he before knew. Or not know you, in Elijah what says the writing? as he complains to the God against the Israel:</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:3 O Lord, the prophets of thee they killed, and the altars of thee they drug down; and I was left alone, and they are seeking the life of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:4 But what says to him the dive oracle? I left to myself seven thousand men, who not bent a knee to the Baal.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:5 Thus then even in the present season a remnant according to an election of favor, has been made.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:6 If but by favor no longer from works; otherwise the favor no longer is favor.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:7 What then? What seeks Israel, this not he obtained, the but chosen obtained; the and remaining ones were hardened,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:8 (as it has been written: Gave to them the God a spirit of deep sleep, eyes of the not to see, and ears of the not to hear,) till the to-day day.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:9 And David says: Let be made the table of them into a snare, and into a trap and into a stumbling block, and into a recompence to them;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:10 let be darkened the eyes of them, of the not to see; and the back of them always bow down.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:11 I say then: Not did they stumble, so that they might fall? Not let it be; but by the of them fall the salvation to the nations, in order that to excite to emulation them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:12 If but the fall of them wealth of a world, and the failure of them wealth of nations; how much more the full acceptance of them?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:13 To you for I speak the Gentiles; in so much indeed am I of Gentiles an apostle, the service of me I shall glorify,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:14 if possibly I may excite to emulation of me the flesh, and I may save some from of them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:15 If for the casting off of them a reconciliation of a world; what the receiving, if not life out of dead ones?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:16 If and the first-fruit holy, also the mixture; and if the root holy, also the branches.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:17 If but some of the branches were broken off, thou and a wild olive being wast ingrafted instead of them, and a partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive thou didst become,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:18 not do thou boast of the branches; if but thou doest boast, not thou the root sustainest but the root thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:19 Thou wilt say then: Were broken off branches, so that I might be grafted in.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:20 True; by the unbelief they were broken off, thou and by the faith hast been standing; not be-high-minded, but fear.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:21 If for the God those according to nature branches not spared, perhaps not even thee will he spare.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:22 See then kindness and severity of God; towards indeed those having fallen, severity; towards but thee, kindness, if thou shouldst remain in the kindness; otherwise even thou shalt be cut off.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:23 Also they but, if not they should remain in the unbelief, shall be ingrafted; able for is the God again to graft them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:24 If for thou out of the according to nature wast cut off wild olive, and in violation of nature thou wast ingrafted into a good olive, by how much more these who according to nature, shall be ingrafted in the own olive.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:25 Not for I wish you to be ignorant, brethren, the secret this, (that not you may be with yourselves wise, that hardness from a part to the Israel has happened, till the fulness of the Gentiles may come in;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:26 and then all Israel shall be saved, as it has been written: Shall come out of Zion the deliver, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:27 And this with them the from me covenant, when I may take away the sins of them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:28 According to indeed the glad tidings, enemies on account of you; according to but the election, beloved on account of the fathers.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:29 Things not to be repented of for the gracious gifts and the calling of the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:30 As for you once disobeyed the God, now but obtained mercy by the of these disobedience;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:31 thus also these now disobeyed, in the your mercy that also they may obtain mercy.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:32 Shut up for the God the all for disobedience, so that the all he might compassionate.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:33 O depth of wealth and of wisdom and of knowledge of God. How unsearchable the judgments of him, and untraceable the ways of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:34 Who for knew mind of Lord? or who a counsellor of him became?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:35 or who first gave to him, and it shall be given in return to him?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 11:36 Because out of him, and through him, and for him the things all; to him the glory for the ages. So be it.</span></p></body></html>
