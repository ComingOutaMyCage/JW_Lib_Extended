And heard the disciples of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:15 And they come to Jerusalem; and going into temple he began to cast out those selling and buying in the temple; and the tables the money-changers, and the seats of those selling the doves he overturned;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:16 and not suffered, that any one should carry an article through the temple.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:17 And he taught, saying to them: Not is it written: That the house of me, a house of prayer shall be called for all the nations? you but have made it a den of robbers.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:18 And heard the scribes and the high-priests, and they sought how him they might destroy; they feared for him, because all the crowd was amazed at the teaching of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:19 And when evening it became, he went out of the city.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:20 And in the morning passing along, they saw the fig-tree having been withered from roots;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:21 And remembering the Peter, says to him: Rabbi, lo, the fig-tree, which thou didst curse, has been withered.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:22 And answering the Jesus says to them: Have you faith of God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:23 Indeed for I say to you, that whoever may say to the mountain this: Be lifted up, and cast into the sea; and not should doubt in the heart of himself, but should believe that what he says comes to pass; it shall be to him whatever he may say.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:24 Through this I say to you, all things whatever praying you desire, believe you that you receive, and it shall be to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:25 And when you stand praying, forgive, if any thing you have against any one; that also the Father of you, that in the heavens, may forgive you the faults of you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:26 If but you not forgive, neither the Father of you, that in the heavens, will forgive the faults of you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:27 And they come again to Jerusalem. And in the temple walking of him, come to him the high-priests and the scribes and the elders,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:28 and they say to him: By what authority these things doest thou? and who to thee the authority this gave, that these things thou mayest do?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:29 The but Jesus answering said to them: I will ask you also I one word; and answer you to me, and I will tell to you, by what authority these things I do.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:30 The dipping of John from heaven was or from men? answer you to me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:31 And they reasoned among themselves, saying: If we should say: From heaven, he will say: Why then not did you believe him?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:32 But if we should say: From men; they feared the people; all for held the John, that really a prophet was.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 11:33 And answering they say to the Jesus. Not we know. And the Jesus answering says to them: Neither I say to you, by what authority these things I do.</span></p></body></html>
