<h3><a name="bookmark474"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark475"></a>Diaglott, 1 John 4</span></h3><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:1 Beloved ones, not every spirit do you believe, but do you prove the spirits, if from of the God is; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:2 By this you know the spirit of the God; every spirit which confesses Jesus Anointed in flesh having come, from of the God is.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:3 And every spirit who not confesses the Jesus, from the God not is; and this is that of the antichrist, which you heard that it comes, and now in the world is already.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:4 You of the God are, dear children, and have overcome them; because greater is he in you, than he in the world.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:5 They from the world are; on account of this of the world they speak, and the world them hears.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:6 We of the God are; the one knowing the God, hear us; who not is of the God, not hears us. By this we know the spirit of the truth and the spirit of the error.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:7 Beloved ones, we should love each other; because the love of the God is, and every one the loving, by the God has been begotten, and knows the God;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:8 he not loving, not knew the God, because the God love is.</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:9 in this was manifested the love of the God in us, because the son of himself the only-begotten sent forth the God into the world, so that we might live through him.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:10 In this is the love, not that we loved the God, but that he loved us, and sent forth the son of himself a propitiation respecting the sins of us.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:11 Beloved ones, if thus the God loved us, also we ought each other to love. God no one at any time has seen.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:12 If we love each other, the God in us abides, and the love of him having been perfected it is in us.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:13 By this we know, that in him we abide, and he in us, because out of the spirit of himself he has given us.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:14 And we have seen and we testify, that the Father sent forth the son a savior of the world.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:15 Whoever may confess, that Jesus is the son of the God, the God in him abides, and he in the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:16 And we have known and we have believed the love, which has the God in us. The God love is, and the one abiding in the love, in the God abides, and the God in him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:17 By this has been perfected the love with us, so that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because as he is, also we are in the world this.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:18 Fear not is in the love, but the perfect love outside casts the fear; because the fear a restraint has; the but one fearing not has been perfected in the love.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 John 4:19 We love him, because he first loved us.</span></p><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:20 If any one may say: That I love the God, and the brother of himself he may hate, a liar he is; the for not one loving the brother of himself, whom he has seen, the God, whom not he has seen, how is he able to love?</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 John 4:21 And this the commandment we have from him, that the one loving the God should love also the brother of himself.</span></p></li></ul></body></html>
