And he eating, to Lord eats, he gives thanks for to the God; and he not eating, to Lord not eats, and he gives thanks to the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:7 No one for of you to himself lives, and no one to himself dies.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:8 If both for we live, to the Lord we live; if and we die, to the Lord we die. If both therefore we live, if and we die, of the Lord we are.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:9 To this for Anointed both died and lived, so that both of dead ones and living he might be lord.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:10 Thou but, why judgest the brother of thee? or also thou, why settest at nought the brother of thee? all for shall stand before the judgment seat of the Anointed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:11 It has been written for: Live I, says Lord, because to me shall bend every knee, and every tongue shall confess to the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:12 So then each one of us concerning himself an account shall give to the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:13 No longer therefore each other we should judge; but this judge you rather, that not to place a stumbling-block to the brother or a cause of fall.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:14 I know, and have been persuaded in Lord Jesus, that nothing common through itself, if not to him regarding anything common to be, to him common;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:15 If but through food the brother of thee is grieved, no longer according to love dost thou walk. Not with the food of thee him do thou destroy, on behalf of whom Anointed died.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:16 Not let be evil spoken of therefore of you the good.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:17 Not for is the kingdom of the God eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in spirit holy;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:18 he for in this doing service for the Anointed, well-pleasing to the God, and approved by the men.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:19 So then the things of the peace we should pursue, and the things of the building up of that for each other.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:20 Not on account of food demolish the work of the God. All things indeed you pure; but evil for the man for that through a stumbling-block eating.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:21 Good the not to eat flesh, not to drink wine, nor by which the brother of thee stumbles, or in ensnared, or in weakened.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:22 Thou faith hast; according to thyself hold it in presence of the God. Blessed he not judging himself in what he approves.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Romans 14:23 He but discerning a difference, if he should eat, has been condemned, because not from faith; every thing and which not from faith, sin is.</span></p></body></html>
