The and slaves said to him: Dost thou wish then going forth we should gather them?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:29 He said: No; lest, gathering the darnel, you should root up with them the wheat.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:30 Leave them to grow together both till the harvest; and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvesters: Gather you first the darnel, and bind you them into bundles, for the to burn them; the but wheat bring together into the barn of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:31 Another parable he proposed to them, saying: Like is the kingdom of the heavens to a grain of mustard, which taking a man sowed in the field of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:32 Which less indeed is of all of the seeds; when but it may be grown, greater of the herbs is, and becomes a tree, so that to come the birds of the heaven, and to make nests in the branches of it.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:33 Another parable he spake to them: Like is the kingdom of the heavens to leaven, which taking a woman mixed in of meal measures three, till of it was leavened whole.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:34 These all spake the Jesus in parables to the crowds, and without a parable not he spake to them;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:35 so that it might be fulfilled the word spoken through the prophet, say: I will open in parables the mouth of me; I will openly declare things having been hid from a beginning of the world.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:36 Then leaving the crowds, went into the house the Jesus. And came to him the disciples of him, saying: Explain to us the parable of darnels of the field.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:37 He and answering said to them: He sowing the good seed, is the son of the man;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:38 the and field, is the world; the and good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom; the and darnel, are the sons of the wicked (one);</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:39 the and enemy, he having sown them, is the adversary; the and harvest, end of the age is; the and reapers, messengers are.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:40 As therefore are gathered the darnel, and in a fire are burned; so will it he in the end of the age this.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:41 Will send the son of the man the messengers of him, and they will gather out of the kingdom of him all the seducers and those working the lawlessness,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:42 and they will cast them into the furnace of the fire; there shall be a weeping and gnashing of the teeth.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:43 Then the righteous shall shine, as the sun, in the kingdom of the father of them. He having ears to hear, let him hear.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:44 Again like is the kingdom of the heaven to a treasure having been hid in the field, which finding a man be hides, and from the joy of him he goes, and all as much he has sells, and buys the field that.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:45 Again like is the kingdom of the heaven to a man a merchant, seeking choice pearls.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:46 Finding and one costly pearl, going he sold all as much as he had, and bought it.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:47 Again like is the kingdom of the heaven, to a drag-net, being cast into the sea, and of every kind bringing together;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:48 which when it is full, drawing to the shore, and sitting down they collected the good into vessels, the but bad away they cast.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:49 So it will be in the end of the age. Shall go forth the messengers, and shall separate the wicked from among the just,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:50 and shall cast them into the furnace of the fire; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:51 Says to them the Jesus: Have you understood these things all? They say to him: Yes O Lord.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:52 He then said to them: Therefore this every scribe, being instructed to the kingdom of the heavens, like is to a man an householder, who brings out of the treasury of him new and old.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:53 And it came to pass, when had concluded the Jesus the parables these, he departed thence.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:54 And coming into the country of him, he taught them in the synagogue of them, so as to astonish them, and to say, Whence this the wisdom this, and these powers?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:55 Not this is the of the carpenter son? Not the mother of him is called Mary? and the brothers of him James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:56 and the sisters of him not all with us are? whence then this these all?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:57 And they found a difficulty in him. The and Jesus said to them: Not is a prophet unhonored, if not in the country of him, and in the house of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 13:58 And not he did do there mighty works many, because of the unbelief of them.</span></p></body></html>
