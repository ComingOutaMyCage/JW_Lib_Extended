What then the God has joined together, a man not disunites.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:7 They say to him: Why then Moses did enjoin to give a scroll of separation, and to release her?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:8 He says to them: That Moses for the hardness of heart of you suffered you to release the wives of you; from a beginning but not it was so.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:9 I say but to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except for fornication, and may marry another, commits adultery; and he her being released marrying, commits adultery.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:10 They say to him the disciples of him: If thus is the case of the man with woman, not it is profitable to marry.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:11 He but said to them: Not all admit the word this, but to whom it has been given.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:12 There are for eunuchs, who from womb of mother were born so; and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by the men; and there are eunuchs, who made eunuchs themselves on account of the kingdom of the heavens. He being able to admit, let him admit.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:13 Then were brought to him little children that the hands he might lay on them, and he might pray; the but the disciples rebuked them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:14 The and Jesus said: Suffer the little children and not hinder them to come to me; of the for such like is the kingdom of the heavens.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:15 And laying on them the hands, he departed thence.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:16 And lo, one coming, said to him: O teacher good, what good must I do, that I may have life age-lasting?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:17 He and he said to him: Why me askest thou concerning the good? one is the good.</span></p><p><span class="font3">If but thou wishest to enter into the life, keep strictly the commandments.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:18 He says to him: Which?
