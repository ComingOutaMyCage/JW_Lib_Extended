What then the God has joined together, a man not disunites.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:7 They say to him: Why then Moses did enjoin to give a scroll of separation, and to release her?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:8 He says to them: That Moses for the hardness of heart of you suffered you to release the wives of you; from a beginning but not it was so.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:9 I say but to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except for fornication, and may marry another, commits adultery; and he her being released marrying, commits adultery.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:10 They say to him the disciples of him: If thus is the case of the man with woman, not it is profitable to marry.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:11 He but said to them: Not all admit the word this, but to whom it has been given.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:12 There are for eunuchs, who from womb of mother were born so; and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by the men; and there are eunuchs, who made eunuchs themselves on account of the kingdom of the heavens. He being able to admit, let him admit.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:13 Then were brought to him little children that the hands he might lay on them, and he might pray; the but the disciples rebuked them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:14 The and Jesus said: Suffer the little children and not hinder them to come to me; of the for such like is the kingdom of the heavens.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:15 And laying on them the hands, he departed thence.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:16 And lo, one coming, said to him: O teacher good, what good must I do, that I may have life age-lasting?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:17 He and he said to him: Why me askest thou concerning the good? one is the good.</span></p><p><span class="font3">If but thou wishest to enter into the life, keep strictly the commandments.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:18 He says to him: Which? The and Jesus said: This; Not thou shalt kill; Not thou shalt commit adultery; Not thou shalt steal; Not thou shall testify falsely;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:19 Honor the father and the mother; and Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee as thyself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:20 Says to him the young man: All these I kept from childhood of me; what more do I want?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:21 Said to him the Jesus: If thou wishest perfect to be, go, sell of thee the possessions, and give to poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and hither, follow me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:22 Having heard and the young man the word, went away sorrowing; he was for having possessions many.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:23 The and Jesus said to the disciples of himself: Indeed I say to you, that with difficulty a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:24 Again and I say to you, easier it is a camel through a hole of needle to pass, than a rich man into the kingdom of the God to enter.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:25 Having heard and the disciples, were amazed exceedingly, saying: Who then is able to be saved?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:26 Looking but the Jesus said to him: With man this impossible is; with but God all possible.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:27 Then answering the Peter said to him: Lo, we left all, and followed thee; what then shall be to us?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:28 The and Jesus said to them: Indeed I say to you, that you the having followed me, in the new birth day when may sit the son of the man upon a throne of glory of him, shall sit also you upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of the Israel.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:29 And all who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, on account of the name of me, a hundred fold shall receive, and life age-lasting shall inherit.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 19:30 Many but shall be first, last and last first.</span></p></body></html>
