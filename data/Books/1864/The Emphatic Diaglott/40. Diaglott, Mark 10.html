So that no longer they are two, but one flesh.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:9 What then the God has joined together, a man not disunites.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:10 And in the house again the disciples of him concerning of the him asked him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:11 And he says to them: Whoever may release the wife of himself, and may marry another, commits adultery with her.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:12 And if a woman may release the husband of herself, and may be married to another, commits adultery.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:13 And they brought to him little children, that he might touch them; the but disciples rebuked those bringing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:14 Seeing but the Jesus was displeased, and said to them: Allow the little children to come to me, not hinder them; of the for such like is the kingdom of the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:15 Indeed I say to you, whoever not may receive the kingdom of the God like a little child, not not may enter into her.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:16 And embracing in his arms them, having placed the hands upon them, he blessed them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:17 And going out of him into a way, running up one, and kneeling before him, he asked him: O teacher good, what must I do, that life age-lasting I may inherit?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:18 The and Jesus said to him: Why me callest thou good? no one good, if not one, the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:19 The commandments thou knowest: Not thou must commit adultery; Not thou must kill; Not thou must steal; Not thou must testify falsely; Not thou must defraud; Honor the father of thee, and the mother.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:20 He but answering said to him: O teacher, these all I kept from childhood of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:21 He but Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One to thee lacks; go, whatever thou hast sell, and give to the poor; and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and hither, follow me, take up the cross.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:22 He but looking sad at the word, went away sorrowing; he was for having possessions many.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:23 And looking round the Jesus, says to the disciples of himself: How hardly those the riches having into the kingdom of the God shall enter.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:24 They and disciples were astonished at the words of him.

Are you able to drink the cup, which I drink, and the dipping, which I am dipped, to be dipped?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:39 They and said to him: We are able. The and Jesus said to them: The indeed cup, which I drink, you will drink; and the dipping, which I am dipped, you will be dipped;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:40 the but to sit at right of me and at left, not is mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:41 And having heard the ten, they began to be angry about James and John.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:42 The but Jesus having called them, he says to them: You know, that those presuming to rule the nations, lord it over them, and the great of them exercise authority over them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:43 Not so but it shall be among you; but whoever may wish to become great among you, shall be of you a servant;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:44 and whoever may wish of you to become first, shall be of all a slave.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:45 And for the son of the man not came to be served, but to serve, and to give the life of himself a ransom for many.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:46 And they come into Jericho; and going out of him from Jericho, and the disciples of him, and a crowd great, a son of Timeus, Bartimeus the blind, sat by the way begging.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:47 And hearing, that Jesus the Nazarene it is, he began to cry out and to say: The son of David, Jesus, have pity me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:48 And rebuked him many, so that he might be silent; he but much more cried out: O son of David, have pity on me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:49 And stopping the Jesus, said him to be called; and they called the blind, saying; to him: Take courage, rise up; he calls thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:50 He and throwing off the mantle of himself, arising came to the Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:51 And answering says to him the Jesus: What dost thou wish I may do to thee? The and blind said to him: Rabboni, that i may see again.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 10:52 The and Jesus said to him: Go; the faith of thee has saved thee.
