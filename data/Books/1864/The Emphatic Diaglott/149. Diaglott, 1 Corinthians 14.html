<h3><a name="bookmark300"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark301"></a>Diaglott, 1 Corinthians 14</span></h3><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:1 Pursue you the love; earnestly desire but the spirituals, rather but that you may prophesy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:2 The for one speaking with a tongue, not to men speaks, but to the God; no one for hears, in spirit but he speaks mysteries;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:3 the but one prophesying, to men speaks edification and exhortation and consolation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:4 The one speaking with a tongue, himself build ups; the but one prophesying, a congregation builds up.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:5 I wish and all you to speak with tongues, rather but that you may prophesy; greater for the one prophesying than the one speaking with tongues, unless if not he should interpret, so that the congregation edification may receive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:6 Not but, brethren, if I should come to you with tongues speaking, what you shall I profit, if not to you I shall speak either in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in a prophesy, or in teaching?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:7 In like manner the things without life a sound giving, whether a flute, or a harp, if a difference to the notes not they should give, how shall be known that being played on flute or that being played on harp?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:8 Also for if an uncertain sound a trumpet should give, who will prepare himself for battle?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:9 So also you through the tongue if not a well-marked word you give, how shall be know that having been spoken? you will be for into air speaking.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:10 So many, if it may be, kinds of voices is in world, and no one of them unmeaning.</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:11 If then not I know the power of the voice, I shall be to the one speaking a barbarian; and the one speaking, to me a barbarian.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:12 So also you, since zealots you are for spirits, for the building up of the congregation seek you that you may abound.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:13 Wherefore the one speaking in a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:14 If for I pray in a tongue, the spirit of me prays, the but mind of me unfruitful is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:15 What then is it? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray but also with the understanding; I will sing praise with the spirit I will sing praise but also with the understanding.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:16 Otherwise, if thou shouldst bless with the spirit, the one filling the place of the private person how shall say the so be it on the thy thanksgiving? since what thou sayest not he knows.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:17 Thou indeed for well givest thanks; but the other not built up.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:18 I give thanks to the God, all of you more with tongues, speaking;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:19 but in a congregation I wish five words through the understanding of me to have spoken, that also others I may instruct, then a myriad words in a tongue.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:20 Brethren, not children become you in the mind; but in the evil be you child like, in the and minds perfect ones become you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:21 In the law it has been written: That by other tongues and by lips others I will speak to the people this, and not even so will they listen to me, says Lord.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:22 So that the tongues for a sign are, not to those believing, but to the unbelievers; the but prophesies not to the unbelieving, but to those believing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:23 If therefore should come together the congregation whole to the same, and all with tongues should speak, should come in and unlearned ones, or unbelievers, not will they say, that you are mad?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:24 If but all should prophesy, should come in and any one unbelieving, or unlearned, he is convinced by all, he is examined by all,</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:25 the secrets of the heart of him manifest become; and so falling on a face he will worship the God, announcing, that the God really among you is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:26 Why then is it, brethren? When you may come together, each one of you a psalm has, teaching has, a tongue has, a revelation has, an interpretation has; all things for building up let it be done.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:27 If with a tongue any one speaks, by two, or the most three, and in succession; and one let interpret.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:28 If but not may be an interpreter, let him be silent in congregation; to himself but let him speak and to the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:29 Prophets but two or three let speak, and the others discern;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:30 if but to another may be revealed sitting by, the first let be silent.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:31 You are able for one by one all to prophesy, that all may learn, and all may be comforted;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:32 and spirits of prophets to prophets are subject;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:33 not for is of confusion the God, but of peace. As in all the congregation of the saints,</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:34 the women of you in the congregation let be silent; not for it has been permitted to them to speak, but to be submissive, as even the law says.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:35 If and anything to learn they wish, in a house the own husbands let them ask; an indecent thing for it is women in congregation to speak.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:36 Or from you the word of the God went out? or to you alone did it come?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:37 If any one thinks a prophet to be or spiritual, let him acknowledge the things I write you, because of Lord they are commandments;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:38 if but any one is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:39 So that, brethren, be you zealous that to prophesy, and that to speak with tongues not hinder you;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 14:40 all things but in a becoming manner and according to order let be done.</span></p></body></html>
