Says to them the Jesus: I am. (Was standing and also Judas, the delivering up him, with them.)</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:6 When therefore he said to them: That I am; they went into the behind, and fell on the ground.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:7 Again then them he asked: Whom seek you? They and said: Jesus the Nazarene.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:8 Answered Jesus: I said to you, that I am; if therefore me you seek, suffer these to go.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:9 So that might be fulfilled the word, which he said: That whom thou hast given to me, not I lost of them no one.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:10 Simon then Peter having a sword, drew her, and struck the of the high-priest slave, and cut off of him the ear the right. Was now a name to the slave Malchus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:11 Said therefore the Jesus to the Peter: Put up the sword into the sheath; the cup which has given to me the Father, not not should I drink it?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:12 The then band and the commander and the officers of the Jews apprehend the Jesus, and bound him,</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:13 and led him to Annas first; he was for father-in-law of the Caiaphas, who was high-priest of the year that.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:14 Was now Caiaphas he having advised the Jews, that it is better one man to be destroyed in behalf of the people.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:15 Followed and the Jesus Simon Peter, and the other disciples. The and disciples that was known to the high-priest, and went in with the Jesus into the palace of the high-priest.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:16 The but Peter stood at the door without. Went out therefore the disciples the other, who was known to the high-priest, and spoke to the door-keeper, and brought in the Peter.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:17 Says then the female-servant the door-keeper to the Peter: Not also thou of the disciples art the man this? Says he: Not I am.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:18 Stood and the slaves and the officers a coal fire having made, because cold it was, and warmed themselves; was and with them the Peter standing and warming himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:19 The therefore high-priest asked the Jesus concerning the disciples of him, and concerning the teaching of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:20 Answered him the Jesus: I publicly spoke to the world; I always taught in a synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and in secret I said nothing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:21 Why me dost thou ask? ask those having heard, what I said to them; lo, they know what things said I.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:22 These things and of him having said, one of the officers having stood by gave a blow to the Jesus, saying: Thus dost thou answer the high-priest?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:23 Answered him the Jesus: If evil I spoke, testify concerning the evil; if but well, why me dost thou beat?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:24 Sent him the Annas having been bound to Caiaphas the high-priest.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:25 Was and Simon Peter standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him: Not also thou of the disciples of him thou art? Denied he, and said: Not I am.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:26 Says one of the slaves of the high-priest, a relative being of whom cut off Peter the ear: Not I thee saw in the garden with him?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:27 Again therefore denied the Peter; and immediately cock crew.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:28 They led then the Jesus from of the Caiaphas into the Jerusalem hall; it was and morning. And they not went into the judgment hall, that not they might be defiled, but that they might eat the passover.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:29 Went out therefore the Pilate to them, and said: What accusation bring you against the man this?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:30 They answered and said to him: If not was this an evil-doer, not would to thee we delivered up him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:31 Said then to them the Pilate: Take him you, and according to the law of you judge him. Said therefore to him the Jews: To us not it is lawful to kill no one.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:32 So that the word of the Jesus might be fulfilled, which he said, pointing out by what death he was about to die.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:33 Went then into the judgment hall again the Pilate, and called the Jesus, and said to him: Thou art the king of the Jews?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:34 Answered him the Jesus: From thyself thou this sayest, or others to thee told concerning me?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:35 Answered the Pilate: Not I a Jew am? the nation the thine and high-priests delivered up thee to me; what didst thou do?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:36 Answered Jesus: The kingdom the mine not is of the world this; if of the world this was the kingdom the mine, the officers would those for me contend, that not I might be delivered up to the Jews, now but the kingdom the mine not is from this place.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:37 Said then to him the Pilate: Not then a king art thou? Answered the Jesus: Thou sayest; that a king am I. I for this have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I may testify to the truth. Every one who being of the truth, hears of me the voice.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:38 Says to him the Pilate: What is truth? And this saying, again he went out to the Jews, and says to them: I not one fault find in him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:39 It is but a custom for you, that one to you I release in the passover; are you willing therefore, to you I release the king of the Jews?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 18:40 They cried out then again all saying: Not this, but the Barabbas. Was now the Barabbas a robber.</span></p></body></html>
