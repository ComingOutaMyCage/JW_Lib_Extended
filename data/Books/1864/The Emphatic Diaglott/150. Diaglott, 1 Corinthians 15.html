<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:6 After that he was seen above by five hundred brethren at once, out of whom the greater number remain till now, some but also have fallen asleep.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:7 After that he was seen by James; then by the Apostles all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:8 Last and of all, just as if by the abortion, he was seen also by me.</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:9 (I for am the least of the apostles; who not am fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the congregation of the God.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:10 By favor but of God I am what I am; and the favor of him that to me, not vain was made, but more abundantly of them all I labored; not I but, but the favor of the God that with me.)</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:11 Whether therefore I, or they, thus we proclaim, and thus you believed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:12 If but Anointed is proclaimed, that out of dead ones has been raised, how say some among you, that a resurrection of dead ones not is?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:13 If but a resurrection of dead ones not is, not even Anointed has been raised;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:14 if but Anointed not has been raised, void then the preaching of us, void and also the faith of you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:15 We are found and even false witnesses of the God; because we testified concerning the God, that he raised up the Anointed, whom not he raised up, if indeed dead ones not are raised up.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:16 If for dead ones not are raised up, not even Anointed has been raised;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:17 if but Anointed not has been raised; deceptive the faith of you; still you are in the sins of you;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:18 then also those having fallen asleep in Anointed, perished.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:19 If in the life this having been hoping we are in Anointed alone, more pitiable of all men we are.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:20 Now but Anointed has been raised up out of dead ones, a first-fruit of those having fallen asleep.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:21 Since for through a man the death, also through a man a resurrection of dead ones.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:22 As for in the Adam all die, so also in the Anointed all will be made alive.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:23 Each one and in the own band; a first-fruit Anointed, after that those of the Anointed, in the presence of him;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:24 then the end, when he should have delivered up the kingdom to the God and Father, when he should have abrogated all government and all authority and power.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:25 It behooves for him to reign, till he may have placed all the enemies under the feet of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:26 Last enemy is rendered powerless the death;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:27 all things for he subjected under the feet of him. When but it may be said, that all things have been subjected, it is evident, that is excepted the one having subjected to him the all things.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:28 When but may be subjected to him, the all things, then also himself the son will be subject to the one having subjected to him the all things so that may be the God the all things in all.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:29 Otherwise what shall they do those being dipped on behalf of the dead ones, if at all dead ones not are raised up? why and are they dipped on behalf of them?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:30 Why and we are in danger every hour?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:31 Every day I die, by the your boasting, which I have in Anointed Jesus the Lord of us.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:32 If according to man I fought with a wild beast in Ephesus, what to me the profit? if dead ones not are raised up, we may eat and we may drink; to-morrow for we die.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:33 Not be you led astray. Corrupt habits virtuous companionships evil.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:34 Awake you as it is fit, and not sin you; ignorance for of God some have; for shame to you I speak.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:35 But will say some one: How are raised up the dead ones? in what and body do they come?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:36 O foolish one; thou what sowest, not is made alive, if not it should die;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:37 and what thou sowest, not that body that going to be born thou sowest, but a naked grain, if it may happen, of wheat, or some of the others;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:38 the but God to it gives a body as he willed, and to each of the seeds the own body.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:39 Not all flesh, the same flesh; but one indeed of men, another and flesh of cattle, another and of fishes, another but of birds.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:40 And bodies heavenly, and bodies earthly; but one indeed that of the heavenlies glory, another and that of the earthlies.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:41 One glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars; a star for from a star differs in glory.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:42 Thus and the resurrection of the dead ones. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a body soulical, it is raised a body spiritual.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:44 Is a body soulical, and is a body spiritual.</span></p><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:45 So and it has been written: Was made the first man Adam into a soul living; the last Adam into a spirit life-giving.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:46 But not first the spiritual, but the soulical; afterwards the spiritual.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:47 The first man, from earth earthy; the second man, the Lord from heaven.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:48 Of what kind the earthy, such like also the earthy ones; and of what kind the heavenly, such like also the heavenly ones;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:49 and even as we bore the image of the earthy, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:50 This and I say, brethren, that flesh and blood a kingdom of God to inherit not are able, nor the corruption the incorruption shall inherit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:51 Lo, a mystery to you I speak: All indeed not we shall be asleep; all but which we shall be changed,</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:52 in a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, in the last trumpet. (It shall sound for, and the dead ones shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.)</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:53 It is necessary for the incorruptible this to be clothed with incorruption, and the mortal this to be clothed with immortality.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:54 When but the corruptible this shall be clothed with incorruption, and the mortal this shall be clothed with immortality, then will happen the word that having been written: Was swallowed up the death into victory.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:55 Where of thee, O death, the sting? where of thee, O unseen, the victory?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:56 The but sting of the death, the sin; the and power of the sin, the law.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:57 To the but God thanks, to the one having given to us, the victory through the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 15:58 Wherefore, brethren of me beloved, steadfast be you, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing, that the labor of you not is vain in Lord.</span></p></body></html>
