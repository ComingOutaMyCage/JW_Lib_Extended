These things but to you from a beginning not I said, because with you I was.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:5 Now but I go to him having sent me, and no one of you asks me: Where goest thou?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:6 But because these things I have spoken to you, the sorrow has filled of you the heart.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:7 But I the truth say to you; it is better for you, that I should go away. If for not I should go away, the helper not will come to you; if but I go, I will send him to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:8 And having come he will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:9 Concerning sin indeed, because not they believe into me;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:10 concerning righteousness but, because to the Father of me I go away, and no more you behold me;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:11 concerning and judgment, because the ruling of the world this has been judged.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:12 Yet many things I have to say to you, but not you are able to bear now.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:13 When but many may come he the spirit of the truth, he will lead you into all the truth. Not for he will speak from himself, but whatever he may hear, he will speak, and the things coming he will declare to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:14 He me will glorify, because out of the mine will take, and will declare to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:15 All things what was the Father, mine is. On account of this I said, that out of the mine he takes, and declares to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:16 A little while, and not you see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, because I am going to the Father.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:17 Said then of the disciples of him to each other: What is this which he says to us: A little while, and not you see me; and again a little while and you shall see me; and: Because I am going to the Father?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 16:18 They said therefore: This what is which he says, the little while?

In the world affliction you have; but be you of good courage, I have overcome the world.</span></p></body></html>
