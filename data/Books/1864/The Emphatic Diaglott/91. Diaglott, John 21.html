<h3><a name="bookmark184"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark185"></a>Diaglott, John 21</span></h3><p><span class="font3">John 21:1 After these things manifested himself again the Jesus to the disciples on the sea of the Tiberias. He manifested and thus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:2 Were together Simon Peter, and Thomas he being called a twin, and Nathanael he from Cana of the Galilee, and they of the Zebedee, and others of the disciples of him two.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:3 Says to them Simon Peter: I am going to fish. They say to him: Are going also we with thee. They went out, and entered into the ship immediately, and in that the night they caught nothing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:4 Morning but now being come, stood the Jesus on the shore; not however knew the disciples, that Jesus it is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:5 Says therefore to them the Jesus: Children, not any food have you? They answered him: No.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:6 He and said to them: Cast you into the right parts of the ship the net, and you will find. They cast then, and no longer it to draw were able from the multitude of the fishes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:7 Says therefore the disciple that whom loved the Jesus, to the Peter: The Lord it is; Simon then Peter, having heard that the Lord it is, the upper garment he girded; he was for naked; and threw himself into the sea.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:8 The but other disciples by the little ship came (not for they were far from the land, but about from cubits two hundred), dragging the net of the fishes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:9 When therefore they went up to the land, they see a fire of coals lying, and a fish lying on, and bread.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:10 Says to them the Jesus: Bring you from the fishes, which you caught just now.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:11 Went up Simon Peter, and drew the net to the land, full of fishes, great a hundred fifty-three; and so many being, not was torn the net.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:12 Says to them the Jesus: Come, breakfast you. No one but presumed of the disciples to ask him: Thou who art? knowing, that the Lord it is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:13 Comes the Jesus, and takes the bread, and gives to them, and the fish in like manner.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:14 This already third was manifested the Jesus to the disciples of himself, having been raised out of the dead ones.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:15 When therefore they had breakfasted, says to the Simon Peter the Jesus: Simon of Jona, lovest thou me more of these? He says to him: Yes, O lord, thou knowest, that I dearly love thee. He says to him: Feed the lambs of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:16 He says to him again a second time: Simon of Jona, lovest thou me? He says to him: Yes, O lord, thou knowest, that I dearly love thee. He says to him: Tend thou the sheep of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:17 He says to him the third: Simon of Jona, dearly lovest thou me? Was grieved the Peter, because he said to him the third, Dearly lovest me thou? and he said to him: O lord, thou all things knowest; thou knowest, that i dearly love thee. Says to him the Jesus: Feed the sheep of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:18 Indeed indeed I say to thee, when thou wast younger, thou didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou didst wish; when but thou art old, thou wilt stretch out the hands of thee, and another thee will gird, and will carry where not thou wishest.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:19 This now he said, signifying, by what death he will glorify the God. And this having said, he says to him: Follow me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:20 Having turned about and the Peter sees the disciples, whom loved the Jesus, following (who also reclined at the supper on the breast of him, and said: O lord, who is he betraying thee?)</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:21 Him seeing the Peter says to the Jesus: O lord, this and what?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:22 Says to him the Jesus: If him I wish to abide till I come, what to thee? thou follow me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:23 Went out therefore the word this among the brethren, that the disciple that not dies. And not said to him the Jesus, that not he dies; but: If him I wish to abide till I come, what to thee?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:24 This is the disciple, he testifying concerning these things, and having written these things; and we know, that true is the testimony of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 21:25 Is and also other many things did the Jesus, which if they should be written every one, not even him I suppose the world to contain the being written books.</span></p></body></html>
