As the branch not is able fruit to bear of itself, if not it may abide in the vine; so neither you, if not in me you abide.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:5 I am the vine, you the branches. He abiding in me, and I am in him, this bears fruit much; because apart from me not you are able to do nothing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:6 If not any one may abide in me, he is cast out, like the branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and into a fire they cast, and it is burned.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:7 If you abide in me and the words of me in you may abide, whatever you may wish you shall ask, and it shall be for you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:8 In this was glorified the Father of me, that fruit much you might bear, and you shall be to me disciples.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:9 As loved me the Father, and I loved you; abide you in the love the mine.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:10 If the commandments of me you may keep, you will abide in the love of me; as I the commandments of the Father of me have kept, and abide of him in the love.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:11 These things I have spoken to you, that the joy the mine in you may abide, and the joy of you may be fulfilled.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:12 This is the commandment the mine, that you love each other, as I loved you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:13 Greater of this love no one has, that any one the life of himself may lay down in behalf of the friends of himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:14 You friends of me are, if you may do what things I command you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:15 No more you I call slaves; because the slaves not knows what does of him the lord; you but I have called friends, because all things which I heard from the Father of me, I made known to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:16 Not you me did choose, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you might go and fruit might bear, and the fruit of you might abide; so that whatever you may ask the Father in the name of me, he may give to you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:17 These things I command you, that you may love each other.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:18 If the world you hates, you know, that me before you it has hated.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:19 If of the world you were, the world would the own kiss, because but of the world not you are, but I chose you out of the world, on account of this hates you the world.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:20 Remember you the world, of which I said to you. Not is a slave greater of the lord of himself. If me they persecuted, also you they will persecute; if the word of me they kept, also the yours they will keep.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:21 But these things all they will do to you on account of the name of me, because not they know him sending me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:22 If not I had come and spoken to them, sin not they had; now but an excuse not they have about the sin of them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:23 He me hating, also the Father of me hates.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:24 If the works, not I had done among them, which no one other has done, sin not they had; now but even they have seen, and have hated both me and that Father of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:25 But, that may be fulfilled the word of having been written in the law of them: That they hated me without cause.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:26 When but may come the helper, whom I will send to you from the Father, (the spirit of the truth, which from the Father shall come out,) that will testify concerning me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 15:27 Also you and shall testify, because from a beginning with me you are.</span></p></body></html>
