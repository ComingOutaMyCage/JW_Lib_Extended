Most gladly therefore rather I will boast in the weaknesses of me, so that may dwell upon me the power of the Anointed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:10 Wherefore I am well-pleased with weaknesses, with insults, with necessities, with persecutions, with distresses on behalf of Anointed; when for I may be weak, then strong I am.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:11 I have become unwise; you me have constrained. I for ought by you to be commended; nothing for I was behind those in highest degree apostles, if even nothing I am.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:12 The indeed signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in signs and prodigies and powers.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:13 What for it is which you were inferior beyond the other congregations, if not that myself I not was burdensome to you? Forgive to me the injustice this.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:14 Lo, a third time this in readiness I am to come to you, and not I will burden you; not for I seek the things of you, but you. Not for it is fitting the children for the parents to treasure up, but the parents for the children.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:15 I but most gladly will spend and will be utterly spent on behalf of the souls of you; if even more abundantly you loving, less I am loved.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:16 Let it be so but; I not did burden you; but being crafty, with guile you I took.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:17 Not any one of whom I have sent to you, through him I overreached you?</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:18 I exhorted Titus, and I sent with the brother, not overreached you Titus? not in the same spirit we walked? not in the same steps?</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:19 Again do you think, that to you we apologize? In presence of the God, in Anointed, we speak. But all things, beloved ones, on behalf of the you build up.</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:20 I am afraid for, lest perhaps having come not such ones I wish I should find you, and I should found by you such a one not you wish, lest perhaps strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil-speakings whisperings, puffings up, disturbances;</span></p><p><span class="font3">2 Corinthians 12:21 lest again having come me should humble the God of me before you, and I should lament over many of those having previously sinned, and not having reformed in respect to the impurity and fornication and lewdness, which they practiced.</span></p></body></html>
