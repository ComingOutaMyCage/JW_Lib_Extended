<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 2:2 Not for I determined any thing to make known among you, if not Jesus Anointed, and this having been crucified.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 2:3 And I in weakness, and in fear and in trembling much was with you;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 2:4 and the speech of me and the preaching of me not in persuasive wisdom of words, but in a display of spirit and of power;</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 2:5 so that the faith of you not may be in wisdom of men, but in power of God.</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
