They and say: Seven.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:6 And he gave orders to the crowd to recline upon the ground; and taking the seven loaves, giving thanks he broke, and gave to the disciples of himself, that they might set before; and they set before the crowd.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:7 And they had small fishes a few; and giving praise, he said: Place before also them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:8 They ate and, and were filled; and they took up over and above of fragments, seven large baskets.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:9 Were and those having eaten, about four thousand; and he dismissed them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:10 And immediately entering into the ship with the disciples of himself, he came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:11 And came forth the Pharisees, and began to argue with him, seeking of him a sign from the heaven, tempting him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:12 And groaning deeply to the spirit; of himself, he says: Why the generation this a sign seeks? Indeed I say to you, if shall be given to the generation this a sign.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:13 And leaving them, entering again into the ship, he departed to the other side.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:14 And they forgot to take loaves, and except one loaf not they had with themselves in the ship.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:15 And he charged them saying: Look you, beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:16 And they reasoned with one another saying: Because loaves not we have.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:17 And knowing the Jesus he says to them: Why reason you, because loaves not you have? Not yet perceive you, neither understand you? Yet having been stupified have you the heart of you?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:18 Eyes having not see you? and ears having not hear you? and not remember you?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:19 When the five loaves I broke to the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took you up? They say to him: Twelve.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:20 When and the seven to the four thousand, how many large baskets full of fragments took you up? They and said: Seven.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:21 And he said to them: How is it not you understand?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:22 And he comes to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man and beseech him, that him he would touch.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:23 And having taken the hand of the blind man, he led him outside of the village; and having spit into the eyes of him, having placed the hands to him, he asked him, if any thing he sees.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:24 And looking up he says: I see the men, like trees, walking.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:25 Then again he placed the hands upon the eyes of him, and he made him look up and was restored, and he saw plainly every one.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:26 And he sent him to house of him saying: Neither into the village mayest thou enter, nor mayest thou tell any one in the village.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:27 And departed the Jesus and the disciples of him into the villages of Caesarea of the Philip. And on the way he asked the disciples of himself, saying to them: Who me they say the men to be?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:28 They and answered: John the dipper; and others, Elias; others and, one of the prophets.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:29 And he says to them: You but who me you say to be? Answering and the Peter says to him: Thou art the Anointed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:30 And he strictly charged them, that no one they should tell about him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:31 And he began to teach them, that must the son of the man many things to suffer, and to be rejected of the elders and of the high-priests and of the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to stand up;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:32 and plainly the word he spoke. And taking aside him the Peter, he began to rebuke him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:33 He but turning round, and seeing the disciples of himself, he rebuked the Peter, saying: Go thou behind me, adversary; because not thou thinkest the things of the God, but the things of the men.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:34 And having called the crowd with the disciples of himself, he said to them: Whoever wishes after me to follow, let him deny himself, and let him bear the cross of himself, and let him follow me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:35 Who for ever may wish the life of himself to save, shall loose her. Who but ever may lose the of himself life on account of me and of the glad tidings shall save her.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:36 (What for will it profit a man, if he should win the world whole, and he should forfeit the life of himself?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:37 or what shall give a man in exchange for the life of himself?)</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 8:38 Who for ever may be ashamed me and the my words in the generation this the adulterous and sinful, also the son of the man will be ashamed him, when he may come in the glory of the Father of himself with the messengers of the holy ones.</span></p></body></html>
