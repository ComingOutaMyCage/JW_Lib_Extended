<h3><a name="bookmark102"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark103"></a>Diaglott, Luke 4</span></h3><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:1 Jesus and spirit of holy full returned from the Jordan; and was led about by the spirit into the desert,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:2 days forty being tempted by the accuser. And not he ate nothing in the days those; and being ended of them, afterwards he was hungry.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:3 And said to him the accuser: If a son thou art of the God, say to the stone this, that it may become a loaf.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:4 And answered Jesus to him, saying: It is written: That not on bread alone shall live the man, but on every word of God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:5 And having led up him the accuser into mountain high, he showed to him all the kingdom of the habitable in a moment of time.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:6 And said to him the accuser: To thee I will give the authority this all, and the glory of them; that to me it has been prepared, and to whoever I will, I give her;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:7 thou then if thou wilt do homage before me, shall be to thee all.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:8 And answering to him said the Jesus: It is written: Thou shalt worship a Lord the God of thee, and to him alone thou shalt render service.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the wing of the temple; and said to him: If a son thou art of the God, cast thyself from this place down.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:10 It is written for: That to the messengers of himself he will give charge concerning thee, of the to guard thee;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:11 and that on hands they shall bear thee, lest thou shouldst strike against a stone the foot of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:12 And answering said to him the Jesus: That it is said: Not thou shalt tempt a Lord the God of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:13 And having ended every temptation the accuser, departed from him for a season.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:14 And returned the Jesus in the power of the spirit into the Galilee; and a report went out through whole the surrounding region about him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:15 And he taught in the synagogues of them, being glorified by all.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:16 And he came into the Nazareth, where he was having been brought up; and entered, according to the custom to him in the day of the sabbaths, into the synagogue; and stood up to read.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:17 And was delivered to him a roll of Esaias the prophet; and having unrolled the roll, he found the place, where it was having been written:</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:18 A spirit of a Lord upon me; of which on account of he has anointed me to publish glad tidings to poor ones, he has sent me to publish to captives a deliverance, and to build ones recovery of sight, to sent away those having been crushed in freedom,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:19 to publish a year of a Lord acceptable.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:20 And having rolled up the roll, having given back to the attendant, he sat down; and of all in the synagogue the eyes were looking steadily to him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:21 He began and to say to them: That to-day is fulfilled that writing this in to the ears of you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:22 And all bore testimony to him, and wondered at the words of the graciousness, those proceeding out of the mouth of him, and said: Not this is the son of Joseph?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:23 And he said to them: Surely you will say to me the illustration this: Physician, heal thyself; what things we have heard having been done in Capernaum, do thou also here in the country of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:24 He said and: Indeed I say to you, that no one a prophet acceptable is in the country of himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:25 In truth but I say to you, many widows were in the days of Elias in the Israel, when was shut up the heaven for years three and months six, so that came a famine great over all the land;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:26 and to no one of them was sent Elias, if not into Sarepta of the Sidon to a woman a widow.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:27 And many lepers were in of Elisha the prophet in the Israel; and no one of them were cleansed, if not Naaman the Syrian.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:28 And they were filled all of wrath in the synagogue, having heard these things.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:29 And rising up they cast out him outside of the city; and they led him even to a brow of the mountain, on which the city of them was built, so as to cast down him;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:30 he but passing through midst of them, went away.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:31 And he came down into Capernaum, a city of the Galilee; and he was teaching them in the sabbaths.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:32 And they were astonished on the teaching of him; for with authority was the word of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:33 And in the synagogue was a man having a spirit of a demon unclean, and he cried out with a voice loud,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:34 saying: Ah, what to us and to thee, Jesus O Nazarene? comest thou to destroy us; I know thee who thou art, the holy of the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:35 And rebuked him the Jesus, saying: Be silent, and come out out of him. And having thrown him the demon into midst, came out of him, nothing hurting him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:36 And came amazement on all; and talked to one another, saying: What the word this, for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:37 And went forth a report concerning him into every place of the country around.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:38 Having risen up and out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon; motherin-law and of the Simon was seized with fever great; and they asked him about her.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:39 And standing above her, he rebuked the fever; and it left her. Forthwith and rising up she served them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:40 Setting and of the sun, all as many as had being afflicted with disease various, brought them to him; he and one by one separately of them the hands having placed, he healed them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:41 Came out and also demons from many, crying out and saying: That thou art the son of the God. And rebuking not he permitted them to say, that they knew the Anointed him to be.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:42 Being come and day, coming out he went into a desert place; and the crowds sought him, and came to him, and urged him not to depart from them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:43 He but said to them: That also to the other cities to publish glad tidings me must the kingdom of the God; because for this I have been sent forth.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 4:44 And he was preaching in the synagogue of Galilee.</span></p></body></html>
