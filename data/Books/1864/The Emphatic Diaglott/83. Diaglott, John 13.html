Answered him the Jesus: If not I may wash thee, thou hast a part of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:9 Says to him Simon Peter: O lord, not the feet of me alone, but also the hands, and the head.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:10 Says to him the Jesus: He having been bathed not need has than the feet to wash, but is clean wholly; and you clean are, but not all.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:11 He knew for the betraying him; on account of this he said: Not all clean you are.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:12 When therefore he had washed the feet of them, and taken the mantles of himself, falling down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you:</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:13 You call me: The teacher and the lord; and well you say; I am for.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:14 If then I washed of you the feet, the lord and the teacher, also you are bound of one another to wash the feet.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:15 An example for I gave to you, that as I did to you, also you should do.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:16 Indeed indeed I say to you, not is a slave greater of the lord of himself, nor a messenger greater of the sending him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:17 If these things you know, blessed are you, if you should do them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:18 Not about all of you I speak; I know whom I chose; but, that the writing may be fulfilled: He eating with me the loaf, lifted up against me the heel of himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:19 From now I say to you, before the to happen, that when it may happen, you may believe, that I am.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:20 Indeed indeed I say to you: He receiving if any one I may send, me receives; he and me receiving, receives him having sent me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:21 These things saying the Jesus was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said: Indeed indeed I say to you, that one of you will betray me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:22 Looked then to each other the disciples, doubting about whom he was speaking.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:23 Was now reclining one of the disciples of him in the bosom of the Jesus, whom loved the Jesus.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:24 Nods then to him Simon Peter, to ask who it might be concerning of whom he speaks.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:25 Falling and he on the breast of the Jesus, he says to him: O lord, who is it?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:26 Answers the Jesus: He it is, to whom I have dipped the little piece shall give. And having dipped the little piece, he gives to Judas of Simon Iscariot.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:27 And after the little piece, then answered into him the adversary. Says then to him the Jesus: What thou doest, do thou quickly.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:28 This now no one knew of those reclining with why he said to him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:29 Some for thought, seeing that the box had the Judas, that says to him the Jesus: Buy what things need we have for the feast; or to the poor that something he should give.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:30 Having taken then the little piece he immediately went out; it was and night.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:31 When he went out, says the Jesus: Just now was glorified the son of the man, and the God was glorified in him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:32 If the God was glorified in him, also the God will glorify him in himself, and immediately will glorify him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:33 O little children, yet a little with you I am. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews: That where I go, you not are able to come; even to you I say now.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:34 A commandment new I give to you, that you may love each other; as I loved you, that also you might love each other.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:35 By this will know all that to me disciples you are, if love you have in each other.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:36 Says to him Simon Peter: O lord, where goest thou? Answered him the Jesus: Where I go, not thou art able me now to follow; afterwards but thou shalt follow me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:37 Says to him Peter: O lord, why not I am able thee to follow now? the life of me in behalf of thee I will lay down.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 13:38 Answered him the Jesus: The life of thee in behalf of me wilt thou lay down? Indeed indeed I say to thee not not a cock will crow, till not thou wilt deny me thrice.</span></p></body></html>
