<h3><a name="bookmark126"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark127"></a>Diaglott, Luke 16</span></h3><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:1 He said and also to the disciples of himself: A man certain was rich, who had a steward; and this was accused to him as wasting the possessions of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:2 And having called him, he said to him: What this I hear concerning thee? render the account of the stewardship of thee; not for thou wilt be able longer to be steward.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:3 Said and in himself the steward: What shall I do, for the lord of me takes the stewardship from me? To dig not I have strength, to beg I am ashamed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:4 I know what i will do, that, when I may be put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into the house of themselves.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:5 And having summoned one each of the debtors of the lord of himself, he said to the first: How much owest thou to the lord of me?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:6 He and said: A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him: Receive of thee the bill, and sitting down quickly write thou fifty.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:7 Then to another he said: Thou and how much owest thou? He and said: A hundred cors of wheat. And he says to him: Receive of thee the bill, and write eighty.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:8 And praised the lord the steward the unjust, because prudently he had done; for the sons of the age this more prudent above the sons of the light for the generation that of themselves are.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:9 And I to you say: Make you to yourselves friends out of the mammon of the unjust; that, when you may fail, they may receive you into the age-lasting tabernacles.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:10 He faithful in least also in much faithful is; and he in least unjust, and in much unjust is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:11 If therefore in the unrighteous mammon faithful not you have been, the true who to you will entrust?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:12 and if in the another faithful not you have been, the yours who to you will give?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:13 No one domestic is able two lords to serve; either for the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or one he will cling to, and the other he will slight. Not you are able God to serve and mammon.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:14 Heard and these all also the Pharisees, money-lovers being; and they mocked him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:15 And he said to them: You are those justifying yourselves in presence of the men; the but God knows the hearts of you; for that by men highly prized, an abomination in presence of the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:16 The law and the prophets till John; from then the kingdom of the God is preached, and every one into her presses.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:17 Easier but it is the heaven and the earth to pass away, than of the law one fine point to fail.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:18 Every one who dismissing the wife of himself, and marrying another, commits adultery; and every one who her being divorced from an husband marrying, commits adultery.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:19 A man now certain was rich, and was clothed purple and fine linen, feasting every day sumptuously.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:20 A poor and certain was named Lazarus, who was laid at the gate of him being covered with sores,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:21 and longing to be fed from the crumbs those falling from the table of the rich; but even the dogs coming licked the sores of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:22 It happened and to die the poor, and to be borne away him by the messengers into the bosom Abraham. Died and also the rich, and was buried.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:23 And in the unseen having lifted the eyes of himself, being in torment, sees the Abraham from a distance, and Lazarus in the bosoms of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:24 And he crying out said: O father Abraham, do thou pity me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of the finger of himself of water, and may cool the tongue of me; for I am in pain in the flame this.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:25 Said and Abraham: O child, remember, that thou didst receive the things good of thee in the life of the, and Lazarus in like manner the things bad; now but this is comforted, thou and art in pain.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:26 And besides all these, between of us and of you a chasm great has been fixed, so that those wishing to pass over hence to you, not is able, nor those thence to us cross over.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:27 He said then: I beseech then thee, O father, that thou wouldst send him to the house of the father of me;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:28 I have for five brothers; that he may testify to them, that not also they may come into the place this of the torment.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:29 Says to him Abraham: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:30 He and said: No, O father, Abraham; but if one from dead ones may go to them, they will reform.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Luke 16:31 He said but to him: If Moses and the prophets not they hear, neither if one out of dead one should rise, will they be convinced.</span></p></body></html>
