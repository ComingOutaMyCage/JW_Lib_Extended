<h3><a name="bookmark290"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark291"></a>Diaglott, 1 Corinthians 9</span></h3><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:1 Not am I a freeman? not am I an apostle? Not Jesus Anointed the Lord of us have seen? not the work of me you are in Lord?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:2 If to others not I am an apostle, at all events to you I am; the for seal of the my apostleship you are in Lord.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:3 The my defence to those me condemning, this is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:4 Not not have we a right to eat and to drink?</span></p><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:5 Not not have we a right a sister a wife to lead about, as also the others apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:6 Or only I and Barnabas not have we a right of the not to work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:7 Who serves in war with his own wages any time? who plants a vineyard, and from of the fruit of it not eats? or who tends a flock, and from of the milk of the flock not eats?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:8 Not according to man these things I speak? or not and the law these things says?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:9 In for the Moses law it has been written: Not thou shalt muzzle an ox threshing. Not for the oxen cares the God?</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:10 or on account of us altogether he says? On account of us for it was written, because in hope it is right he plowing to plow; and he threshing, in hope of that to partake.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:11 If we to you the spiritual things sowed, a great thing, if we of you the fleshly things shall reap?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:12 If others of the of you right partake, not rather we? But not we did use the right this; but all things we endure, so that not hindrance any we may give to the glad tidings of the Anointed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:13 Not know you, that those the holy things performing, from of the temple eat? those to the altar attending, with the altar are partakers?</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:14 Thus also the Lord has appointed for those the glad tidings proclaiming, from of the glad tidings to live.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:15 I but not have used not one of these things. Not I did write and these things, that thus it may be done to me; well for to me rather to die, than the boasting of me that any one should make void.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:16 If for I may announce glad tidings, not it is to me a cause of boasting; necessity for to me lies on; woe for to me is if not I should preach glad tidings.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:17 If for willing this I do, a reward I have; if but unwilling, a stewardship I have been entrusted with.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:18 What then to me is the reward? So that announcing glad tidings without expense I will place the glad tidings of the Anointed, in order that not to fully use the authority of me in the glad tidings.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:19 Free for being from all, to all myself I was enslaved, that the more I might gain;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:20 and I became to the Jews as a Jew, that Jews I might gain; to those under law as under law, (not being myself under law,) that those under law I might gain;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:21 to those without law as without law, (not being without law to God, but within law to Anointed,) that I might gain lawless ones;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:22 I became to the weak as weak, that the weak ones I might gain; to them all I have become the all things, that by all means some I may save.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:23 This but I do on account of the glad tidings, that a co-partner of it I may become.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:24 Not know you, that those in a race-course running, all indeed run, one but receives the prize? Thus run you, that you may obtain.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:25 Every one but the contending, all things possesses self-control; they indeed therefore, that a perishable wreath they may receive; we but, an imperishable.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:26 I therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; thus I box, as not air beating;</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 9:27 but I browbeat of me the body and lead it captive, lest possibly to others having proclaimed, myself without proof should become.</span></p></body></html>
