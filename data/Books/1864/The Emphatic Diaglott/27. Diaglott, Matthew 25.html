Lo, the bridegroom comes; go out to a meeting of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:7 Then arose all the virgins those, and put in order the lamps of them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:8 The but foolish to the prudent said: Give to us out of the oil of you, because the lamps of us are extinguished.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:9 Answered but the prudent, saying: Lest not it might suffice to us and to you; go you rather to the selling, and buy to yourselves.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:10 Going away and of them to buy, came the bridegroom; and the prepared ones entered with him into the nuptial-feasts; and was closed the door.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:11 Afterwards and came also the remaining virgins, saying: O lord, O lord, open to us.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:12 The but answering said: Indeed I say to you, not know you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:13 Watch you therefore, because not you know the day, nor the hour.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:14 Like for a man going abroad called the own slaves, and delivered to them the goods of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:15 and to him indeed he gave five talents, to him and two, to him and one; to each according to the own power; and went abroad immediately.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:16 Going and he the five talents having received, traded with them, and made other five talents.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:17 Likewise also he the two, gained also he other two.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:18 He but the one having received having retired digged in the earth, and hid the silver of the lord of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:19 After but time much comes the lord of the slaves those, and adjusts with them an account.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:20 And coming he the five talents having received, brought other five talents, saying: O lord, five talents to me thou delivered; see, other five talents I gained upon them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:21 Said to him the lord of him: Well, O slave good and faithful; over a few (things) thou wast faithful, over many thee I will place; enter into the joy of the lord of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:22 Coming and also he the two talents having received, said: O lord, two talents to me thou deliveredst; lo, other two talents I gained upon them;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:23 Said to him the lord of him: Well, O slave good and faithful; over a few (things) thou wast faithful, over many thee I will place; enter into the joy of the lord of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:24 Coming and also he the one talent having taken, said: O lord, I knew thee, that hard thou art a man, reaping where not thou sowed, and gathering whence not thou scatteredst;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:25 and being afraid, going away I hid the talent of thee in the earth; lo, thou hast the thine.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:26 Answering and the lord of him said to him: O wicked slave and slothful, didst thou know, that I reap where not I sowed, and gather whence not I scattered?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:27 It behooved then thee cast the silver of me to the bankers; and coming I might have received the mine with interest.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:28 Take you therefore from him the talent, and give to him having the ten talents.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:29 To the for having all shall be given, and he shall abound; from but the not having, even what he has, shall be taken away from him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:30 And the useless slave cast you into the darkness the outer; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:31 When and may come the son of the man in the glory of him, and all the messengers with him, then shall be sit on a throne of glory of him,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:32 and will be gathered in presence of him all the nations; and he will separate them from each other, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:33 and and he will place the indeed sheep by right of him, the and goats by left.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:34 Then will say the king to the by right of him: Come the having been blessed of the Father of me, inherit the having been prepared to you kingdom from a foundation of world.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:35 I hungered for, and you gave to me to eat; I thirsted, and you gave drink to me; a stranger I was, and you entertained me;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:36 naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; in prison I was, and you came to me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:37 Then shall answer to him the just one, saying: O lord, when thee we saw hungering, and nourished? or thirsting, and we gave drink?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:38 When and thee we saw a stranger, and we entertained? or naked, and we clothed?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:39 When and thee we saw sick, or in prison, and we came to thee?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:40 And answering the king will say to them: Indeed I say to you, in whatever you did, to one of these of the brothers of me of the least, to me you did.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:41 Then he will say also to the of left: Go from me the having been cursed into the fire the everlasting, that having been prepared to the accuser and to the messengers of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:42 I hungered for, and not you gave to me to eat; I thirsted, and not you gave drink to me;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:43 a stranger I was, and not you entertained me; naked, and not you clothed me; sick, and in prison, and not you visited me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:44 Then will answer and they, saying: O lord, when thee we saw hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and not we served thee?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:45 Then he will answer them, saying: Indeed I say to you, in as much not you did to one of these of the least, neither to me you did.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 25:46 And shall go away these into a cutting-off age-lasting;
