The and Jesus says them: Yes; Never have you read: That out of mouth of babes and of suckling (ones) thou has perfected praise?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:17 And having left them, he went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:18 Early but, returning into the city, he was hungry.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:19 And seeing a fig-tree one by the way, he came to her, and nothing found in her except leaves alone; and he says to her: No more by thee fruit may be produced to the age. And withered immediately the fig-tree.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:20 And seeing the disciples wondered, saying: How soon withered the fig-tree?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:21 Answering and the Jesus said to them: Indeed I say to you, if you may have faith, and not should doubt, not only the (miracle) of the fig-tree you shall do, but also if to the mountain this you should say: Be thou lifted up, and be cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:22 And all, whatever you shall ask in the prayer, believing you shall receive.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:23 And having come to him into the temple, came to him teaching the high-priests and the elders of the people, saying: By what authority these (things) doest thou? and who to thee gave the authority this?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:24 Answering and the Jesus said to them: I will ask you also I word one; which if you may say to me, also I to you will tell, by what authority these (things) I do;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:25 the dipping of John whence was? from heaven, or from men? They and reasoned among themselves, saying: If we should say, from heaven; he will say to us: Why then not did you believe to him?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:26 if but we should say from men; we fear the crowd; all for hold the John as a prophet.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:27 And they answering to the Jesus said: Not we know. Said to them and he: Neither I say to you by what authority these (things) I do.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:28 What but to you seems right? A man had children two; and coming to the first, he said: Son, go, to-day work in the vineyard of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:29 He and answering said: Not I will; afterward but having changed his mind, he went.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:30 And coming to the other, he said just the same. He and answering said: I lord, and not went.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:31 Who of the two did the will of the father? They say to him: The first. Says to them the Jesus: Indeed I say to you, that the tax-gatherers and the harlots go before you in the kingdom of the God.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:32 Came for to you John in a way of righteousness, and not you believed him; the but tax-gatherers and the harlots believed him; you and seeing not repented afterwards, of the to believe him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:33 Another parable hear you; a man was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and a hedge to it placed around, and digged in it a wine-press, and built a tower; and let out it to husbandmen, and went abroad.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:34 When and drew near the time of the fruits, he sent the slaves of him, to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:35 And having taken the husbandmen the slaves of him, him indeed they flayed, him and they killed, him and they pelted with stones.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:36 Again he sent other slaves, greater the first; and they did to them in like manner.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:37 Afterwards and he sent to them the son of him, saying: They will regard the son of me.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:38 The but husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir; come, we may kill him, and may retain the inheritance of him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:39 And having taken him, they cast out of the vineyard, and killed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:40 When therefore may come the lord of the vineyard, what will he do to the husbandmen to those?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:41 They say to him: Wretches wretchedly destroy them; and the vineyard will let out to other husbandmen, who will render to him the fruits in the seasons of them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:42 He says to them the Jesus: Never have you read in the writings: A stone which rejected they building, the same was made into a head of a corner; from Lord was this, and it is wonderful in eyes of us?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:43 On account of this I say to you, that shall be taken from you the kingdom of the God, and shall be given to a nation making the fruits of her.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:44 And he falling on the stone this, shall be broken; on whom but it shall fall, it will crush to pieces him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:45 And having heard the high-priests and the Pharisees the parables of him, knew, that about them he says.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Matthew 21:46 And seeking him to seize, they feared the crowds; since as a prophet him they held.</span></p></body></html>
