He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:10 Not even the writing this have you read: A stone which rejected those building, this was made into a head of a corner;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:11 by a Lord was done this, and it is wonderful in eyes of us?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:12 And they sought him to seize, but they feared the crowd; they knew for, that to them the parable he spoke. And leaving him, they went away.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:13 And they send to him some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that him they might catch in word.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:14 They having come they say to him: O teacher, we know, that true thou art, and not cares thee about no one; not for thou lookest into face of men, but in truth the way of the God thou teachest; is it lawful tribute to Caesar to give, or not? should we give, or not should we give?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:15 He but knowing of them the hypocrisy, said to them: Why me do you tempt? bring you to me a denarius, that I may see.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:16 They and brought. And he says to them: Of whom the likeness this, and the inscription? They and said to him: Of Caesar.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:17 And answering the Jesus said to them: Give you back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of the God, to the God. And they wondered at him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:18 And come Sadducees to him, who say a resurrection not to be; and they asked him, saying:</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:19 O teacher, Moses wrote for us, that if any brother should die, and should leave behind a wife, and children not should leave, that should take the brother of him the wife of him, and should raise up seed, to the brother of himself.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:20 Seven brothers were; and the first took a wife, and dying not left seed.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:21 And the second took her, and died, and neither he left seed; and the third in like manner.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:22 And took her the seven, and not left seed. Last of all died also the woman.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:23 In the therefore resurrection when they shall rise, of whom of them shall be a wife? the for seven had her a wife.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:24 And answering the Jesus said to them: Not through this do you err, not knowing the writings, neither the power of the God?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:25 When for out of dead (ones) they may rise, neither they marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as messengers in the heavens.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:26 Concerning but the dead (ones), that they rise, not have you read in the book of Moses, at the bush as said to him the God, saying: I the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:27 Not is the God of dead (ones), but of living (ones). You therefore greatly err.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:28 And approaching one of the scribes, having heard them disputing, knowing that well to them he answered, asked him: Which is first of all commandment?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:29 The and Jesus replied to him: That first of all commandment; Hear you Israel, a Lord, the God of us, Lord one is;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:30 and thou shalt love a Lord the God of thee out of whole of the heart of thee, and out of whole of the soul of thee, and out of whole of the mind of thee, and out of whole of the strength of thee. This first commandment.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:31 And second like, this: Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee as thyself. Greater of these another commandment not is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:32 And said to him the scribe: Well, O teacher, in truth thou speakest, that one he is and not is another besides him;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:33 and the to love him out of whole of the heart, and out of whole of the understanding, and out of whole the soul, and out of whole of the strength, and the to love the neighbor as himself, more is of all of the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:34 And the Jesus, seeing him, that discreetly he answered, said to him: Not far thou art from the kingdom of the God. And no one no longer presumed him to ask.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:35 And answering the Jesus said, teaching in the temple: How say the scribes, that the Anointed a son is a David?</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:36 Himself for the David said by spirit holy: Says the Lord to the lord of me: Sit thou at right of me, till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool of the feet of thee.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:37 himself therefore David calls him lord; and whence a son is he? And the great crowd heard him gladly.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:38 And he said to them in the teaching of himself: Beware you of the scribes, those desiring in long robes to walk about, and salutations in the markets,</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:39 and first seats in the synagogues, and upper couches at the feasts;</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:40 those devouring the houses of the widows, and for a show long are praying; these will receive heavier judgment.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:41 And sitting the Jesus over against the treasury, he beheld how the crowd casts copper into the treasury. And many rich cast much.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:42 And coming one widow poor, cast mites two, which is a farthing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:43 And having called the disciples of himself, he said to them: Indeed I say to you, that the widow this the poor more of all has cast of those casting into the treasury.</span></p><p><span class="font3">Mark 12:44 All for out of the abounding fulness to them have cast; this but out of the poverty of herself all as much as she had cast, whole the living of herself.</span></p></body></html>
