He went away therefore, and washed himself, and came seeing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:8 The then neighbors, and those seeing him the before, because a beggar he was, said: Not this is he sitting and begging?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:9 Others said: That this is. Others but: That like him it is. He said: That I am.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:10 They said then to him: How were opened of thee the eyes?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:11 Answered he and said: A man, being named Jesus, clay made, and rubbed of me the eyes, and said to me: Go into the Siloam, and wash thyself. Going and and washing myself, I obtained sight.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:12 They said then to him: Where is he? He says: Not I know.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:13 They bring him to the Pharisees, that once blind.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:14 It was and a sabbath, when the clay made the Jesus, and opened of him the eyes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:15 Again therefore asked him also the Pharisees, how he obtained sight. He and said to them: Clay he put of me on the eyes, and I washed myself, and see.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:16 Said therefore of the Pharisees some: This the man not is from the God, because the sabbath not he keeps. Others said: How is able a man a sinner such signs to do? And a division was among them.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:17 They say to the blind again: Thou what sayest concerning him, seeing that he opened of thee the eyes? He and said: That a prophet he is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:18 Not believed therefore the Jews concerning him, that blind he was, and obtained sight, till when they called the parents of him the having obtained sight.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:19 And they asked them, saying: This is the son of you, whom you say, that blind he was born? how then now he sees?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:20 Answered them the parents of him and said: We know, that this is the son of us, and that blind he was born;</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:21 how but now he sees, not we know; or who opened of him the eyes, we not know, he full age has, him ask you; he concerning himself shall speak.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:22 These things said the parents of him, because they feared the Jews. Already for had agreed the Jews, that if any one him should confess Anointed, from a synagogue should be.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:23 Through this the parents of him said: That full age he has, him ask you.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:24 They called therefore a second time the man, who was blind, and said to him: Give glory to the God; we know, that the man this a sinner is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:25 Answered then he and said: If a sinner he is, not I know; one I know, that blind being, now I see.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:26 They said and to him again: What did he to thee? how opened of thee the eyes?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:27 He answered them: I said to you already, and not you did hear; why again do you wish to hear? not also you wish of him disciples to be?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:28 They reviled him, and said: Thou art a disciple of him; we but of the Moses are disciples.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:29 We know, that to Moses has spoken the God; this but not we know whence is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:30 Answered the man and said to them: In for this a wonder is, that you not know whence he is, and he has opened of me the eyes.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:31 We know but, that sinners the God not hears; but if any one a worshipper of God may be, and the will him may do, this he hears.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:32 From the age not it was heard, that opened any one eyes of blind having been born.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:33 If not was this from God, not were able to do nothing.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:34 They answered and said to him: In sins thou wast born wholly; and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:35 Heard the Jesus, that they cast him out; and having found him, said to him: Thou believest into the son of the God?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:36 Answered he and said: And who is he, O sir, that I may believe into him?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:37 Said and to him the Jesus: Even thou hast seen him, and he talking with thee, he is.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:38 He and said: I believe, O sir; and he prostrated to him.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:39 And said the Jesus: For judgment I into the world this came, that those not seeing might see, and those seeing blind might become.</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:40 And heard of the Pharisees these things those being with him, and said to him: Not also we blind are?</span></p><p><span class="font3">John 9:41 Said to them the Jesus: If blind you were, not you would have sin; now but you say: That we see; the therefore sin of you remains.</span></p></body></html>
