<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:7 I wish for all men to be as even myself; but each own has gift from God, one indeed so, another and so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:8 I say but to the unmarried and to the widow; good for them, if they should remain as even I;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:9 if but not they possess self-control, let him marry; better for it is to have married, than to be inflamed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:10 To those but having been married I charge, not I, but the Lord, a wife from an husband not to be separated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:11 (if but even she should be separated, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband let her be reconciled;) and a husband a wife not to dismiss.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:12 To the but remaining things I speak, not the Lord; if any brother a wife has an unbeliever, and she thinks well to dwell with him, not let him dismiss her;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:13 and a wife who has a husband an unbeliever, and he thinks well to dwell with her, not let her dismiss him.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:14 Has been sanctified for the husband the unbelieving in the wife, and has been sanctified the wife the unbelieving in the husband; otherwise indeed the children of you unclean is, now but holy is.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:15 If but the unbelieving withdraws, let him withdraw; not is enslaved the brother or the sister with the such like. In but peace has called us the God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:16 How for knowest thou, O wife, if the husband thou shalt save? or how knowest thou, O husband, if the wife thou shalt save.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:17 If not to each other as distributed the Lord, each one even as has called the God so let him walk. And thus in the congregations all I appoint.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:18 Having been circumcised any one who called, not let him be uncircumcised; in uncircumcision any one was called, not let him be circumcised.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:19 The circumcision nothing is, and the uncircumcision nothing is, but keeping of commandments of God.</span></p><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:20 Each one in the calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:21 A slave wast thou called, not to thee let it be a care; but if also thou art able free to become, rather use.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:22 He for in Lord being called a slave a freedman of Lord is; in like manner also the freeman being called, a slave is of Anointed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:23 For a price you were bought; not become you slaves of men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:24 Each one in which he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:25 Concerning and the virgins, a commandment of Lord not I have; a judgment but I give, as having obtained mercy from Lord faithful to be.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:26 I declare then, this well to be because of the having been present distress, that well for a man the true to be.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:27 Art thou having been bound to a wife, not seek thou a release; hast thou been loosed from a wife, not seek thou a wife.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:28 If but even thou shouldst have married, not thou didst sin; and if should have married the virgin, not she sinned; affliction but in the flesh shall have those such like; I but you spake.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:29 This but I say, brethren, the season having been shortened the remainder is; that both those having wives, as not having should be;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:30 and those weeping; as not weeping; and those rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and those buying, as not possessing;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:31 and those using the world this, as not abusing. Passes by for the form of the world this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:32 I wish but you free from anxieties to be. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:33 hew but having married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.</span></p></li></ul><ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:34 Has been divided the wife and the virgin; the unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, so that may be holy both in body and in spirit; the but one having married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please the husband.</span></p></li></ul><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:35 This and for the of you yourselves benefit I say; not that a snare to you I may throw, but for the decorum and devotedness to the Lord without solicitude.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:36 If but any one to behave indecently toward the virgin of himself thinks, if she may be beyond age, and to it is fitting to be; what he wishes let him do, not he sins; let them marry.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:37 Who but he has stood settled in the heart, not having necessity control but has concerning the own will, and this has resolved in the the heart of himself the to keep the himself virgin, well does.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:38 So that even he giving in marriage, well does; and he not marrying, better does.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:39 A wife is bound for so long time may live the husband of her; if but should fall asleep the husband of her, free she is to whom she wills to be married, only in Lord.</span></p><p><span class="font3">1 Corinthians 7:40 Happier but she is, if thus she should remain according to the my judgment; I think and even I spirit of God to have.</span></p></body></html>
