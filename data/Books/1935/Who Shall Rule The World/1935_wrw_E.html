<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>FOREWORD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5">THE present rule of the world is unsatisfactory to all who desire good government In every country there is much poverty, suffering, distress and perplexity. Are the rulers responsible therefor? It is written: &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish.&quot; (Proverbs 29:18) Will there soon be a change of world rule for the peoples' good? These questions are clearly and satisfactorily answered in this booklet. Read it carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Who Shall Rule The World?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WHO shall rule the world has been the cause of controversy for centuries past. The greatest controversy of all time is just now beginning, and will bring upon the nations of the earth such tribulation as was never before known, and that will settle for ever the question as to who shall rule the world. The settlement of that question involves the peace, prosperity and life of the entire human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nothing could be of such momentous interest, convenience and necessity to the people as a knowledge of the truth of and concerning the cause of world conditions and what is to be the outcome. I wish that you might understand that what I have to say is not an attack upon any man. My sole purpose is to bring to the attention of the people the indisputable truth, that we may all see what is the proper course for us to take. There is a desperate effort being put forth to prevent the people from hearing the truth at the present time, and if you will bear with me I will tell you the reason. Of necessity the truth is controversial, because it exposes error, and hence the advocates of error always oppose the message of truth. Today the world conditions have reached an acute crisis, and thoughtful persons must lay aside religious and political prejudice and give calm and sober consideration to what is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you are a Protestant, that is no cause or excuse for you to fight your Catholic neighbor. If you are a Catholic, that is no reason why you should persecute one holding a different view. If you have been associated with one great political party, that is no reason why you should war on those of an opposite political faith. This is neither a political nor a religious argument. The purpose is not to induce anyone to join some organization. You are asked only to give calm and sober consideration to the facts which are herein stated and which are well known to exist, and to consider these facts alongside God's Word of truth, as stated in the Bible, and then determine what is the right course to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You will readily agree that in every nation the political and economic conditions are entirely unsatisfactory. Since the World War many different men have aspired to rule the people in an arbitrary manner. The people were induced to believe that the great war of 1914 would result in making the world safe for democracy. Had that fantastic prediction been realized it would have meant a government of the people, for the people, and by the people. The slogan, however, proved to be even more elusive than a dream. Italy was on the winning side of that war, and today that nation is ruled by a dictator and democracy is there unknown. Russia fell between the battle lines and the Soviets came into power, and in that government there is no democracy. Germany was on the losing side of the war, and now that nation is arbitrarily ruled by a dictator and all the people are in great dread. Each one of the dictators aspires to be the world ruler. In America there is what is, called a democracy, but the people have little or nothing to say about their government. They vote for supposed public servants, but the elected ones do as they are told by a few men. A bureaucracy would be a better name for the government. The World War did not make this nation safe for democracy, by any means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Out of all the world confusion came the League of Nations, and the claim was that it would establish peace and prosperity and rule the world harmoniously. That makeshift is already a failure and is doomed to pass away leaving no beneficial results to the human race. In every nation fear has possessed the people. What rights they once enjoyed and were supposed to possess they now fear to assert. They know no one to whom they may look to lead them out of the dismal swamp of despair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Everywhere the people are in perplexity, and they look to the future with fear and dread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For centuries a foreign power, having its seat of operation at Rome, and parading under a religious name, has had its covetous eyes fixed upon America. Today that subtle power seemingly is exercising a supernatural influence over other organizations of men and it is stealthily and subtly moving forward to lay its slimy hand upon the wealth of the nation and take away from the people their last vestige of liberty. In order to do that they are scheming to rule the nation with a mailed fist. I venture the prediction that unless there is a decided change in their operations within two years that religious, commercial, and political combine will have so completely carried forward their selfish schemes that the American people will be completely bound hand and foot and their once boasted liberty entirely gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the public press published on the first day of this month I quote the following: &quot;Reds riot in Holland, French cavalry shoot down the Parisian mob. German Nazis fall before firing squads of other Nazis, and Russian peasants starve to fulfil Moscow's orders. Austrian Socialists die on barricades, and the Austrian chancellor lies murdered in a putsch. Polish anti-Semites kill Jews, and the Polish Minister of the Interior dies by an assassin's bullet. Rumania mourns a slain premier, France her foreign minister, and Yugoslavia her king. This is the continental Europe scene in the year 1934.&quot; Thus is described a horrible condition existing throughout the entire earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">And what about the American nation, once known as &quot;the land of the free and the home of the brave&quot;? What has become of the noble-hearted statesmen that once guarded the general welfare of the people? They have practically disappeared. The time was in America when the farmer felt free to till his land and lie down in peace at night and soundly rest. Today farmers are so perplexed and distressed, because they are required to plow up portions of their crops and destroy their pigs, that some of them &quot;in utter despair commit suicide. The tax burdens of the people are daily being increased while the government issues interest-bearing bonds and obtains money by selling the same, and then uses the money to loan on farms, to be secured by mortgage. Within a short time that scheme will permit the politicians and their allies to make the common people ordinary serfs. Millions of American citizens are now entering a winter - faced with suffering and starvation. It is not unusual today to hear one say, &quot;It seems that a supernatural power is goading men on to desperation.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Never before have you known of so much selfishness amongst men. Never before have you observed such covetousness for power and selfish gain. Never before so much unfaithfulness of officeholders toward the people whom they are supposed to represent. In America prohibition brought a wave of crime that swept many into untimely graves and debauched the lives of many more. The repeal of prohibition is attended with even worse conditions and a constant increase of crime. Every issue of the public press tells of all manner of wickedness, crime and suicides that are being committed. This is but a mild statement of the facts as they exist, and it is useless for us to try to close our eyes to these facts. Let us face the facts calmly and make an honest endeavor to learn the cause and to ascertain if there is a possible remedy. What is the cause of these conditions of woe that now afflict the people of all nations of the earth? Can the responsibility be laid at the door of any political party? Is there a sure and safe remedy to which the people may pin their hope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The full and complete answer to these questions is found in only the Bible, which is God's Word of truth. Long centuries ago by his holy prophets God foretold the coming about of exactly the conditions that you now see and experience. There are millions of Bibles in the land, but there are few persons who have any knowledge or understanding thereof. The people have been kept in ignorance of the truth as it is set forth in the Bible, and that condition of ignorance is due to the subtle machinations of our common enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For more than a hundred years this nation has claimed to be a Christian nation, which means that the people of the nation are supposed to believe and rely upon the Word of God and of Christ Jesus. I beg you as sober-minded persons to prove at least to some degree that this is a Christian people by giving heed to what the Word of God says concerning these unhappy things that now exist. At Proverbs 29:2 it is written: &quot;When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice; but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.&quot; That the people all over the earth now are mourning is an indisputable fact. Can it be properly said, then, that the dictators that rule in the various nations are the wicked referred to in the scripture just quoted? Primarily, No. Those men are only the agents of the great invisible wicked one; and that means that those men have been made blind to the truth and have been goaded on by an unseen influence to desperate deeds. In that same chapter of Proverbs (verse 18) it is written: &quot;Where there is no vision [or understanding], the people perish.&quot; The various earthly dictators are merely men, and, having no vision or understanding of God's purpose, those men are blind guides, and they are leading the blind people. All must fall into the ditch, except those who get an understanding and change their course.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>WICKED RULER</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Who, then, is the wicked ruler mentioned in the scripture just quoted? The true answer is that said wicked one is Satan, the Devil, the invisible overlord or ruler of the world. At 1 John 5:19 it is written that the whole world lies in that wicked one, Satan. Jesus Christ, the greatest teacher ever on earth, repeatedly stated that Satan the Devil is the invisible ruler or god of this wicked world: &quot;Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.&quot; &quot;Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.&quot; (John 12:31; 8:44) It is written, in 2 Corinthians 4:3,4, that Satan is the god of this world and that he blinds men to the truth. At Revelation 12:17 is found the proof that Satan attempts to destroy all those who in obedience to Jehovah's commandments tell the truth of and concerning God's coming kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You have said time and again that it seems that there is an unseen power that holds sway over the nations and people; and in that conclusion you are correct. That unseen power is Satan and a host of wicked angels, or spirit creatures, who operate with him to wrongfully influence and control man. Not only that, Satan the Devil uses men who wrongfully claim to represent God and Christ, to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. Such men attempt to prevent you from hearing or reading anything that would make clear to you the Scriptures. Instead of encouraging the people to study the Bible, they use all means within their power to prevent the people from hearing and learning what the Bible contains. That of itself is the best evidence that such men do not represent God and Christ, but that they are blinded by our common enemy, Satan, and that they serve him and deceive the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You know that the visible rulers of the nations of the earth are extremely selfish and that human schemes are operated to accomplish selfish ends. Those in power are proud, boasters, unthankful and unrighteous. Never before in the history of man was there so much peril threatening the peoples of all nations. What is the Scriptural explanation thereof? Long ago God caused to be written, at 2 Timothy 3:14, the answer in these words: &quot;This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God.&quot; These are the last days, and are fraught with great peril.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today the practice of &quot;Christian religion&quot;, so called, has become merely a formalism and is entirely void of the spirit of God. Further speaking of those who lead in the practice of formal Christian religion the scripture states (2 Timothy 3:5): &quot;Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The fact that &quot;perilous times&quot; have come and that the people suffer and mourn and are in despair is conclusive proof that we have reached the &quot;last days&quot; long ago foretold by the Bible. What is the meaning of the Scriptural term here used, &quot;the last days&quot;? It does not mean the end of time, because time never ends. It does mean the end of Satan's rule of the world is at hand; hence these are &quot;the last days&quot; of the operation of that wicked ruler. It means that a world crisis has been reached and the nations are in a transition period and that we stand at the portals of a righteous rule of the world wherein the people will have an opportunity to avail themselves of the blessings of a righteous government. What, then, could be of such vital interest, necessity . and convenience to the people as a knowledge of the truth of and concerning this matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">You should know how the Devil became the invisible ruler of the world and what will bring about the complete end of his wicked rule. The brief Scriptural account thereof is this: When God created the perfect man and put him on the earth He made His spiritual son Lucifer the overlord or invisible ruler of man. Lucifer, having a covetous and ambitious desire to commercialize and use the human race for his own wicked ends, rebelled against Jehovah God. He led the perfect man into sin, thereby causing him to be sentenced to death, and, by inheritance, death passed upon all men, and since then all men have been born imperfect, and for that reason men have been dying. (Romans 5:12) God then and there changed the name of Lucifer, and since that time Lucifer has been known by the four names: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Satan</span><span class="font4">, meaning the adversary of God; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Devil</span><span class="font4">, meaning slanderer; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dragon</span><span class="font4">, meaning the devourer; and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Serpent</span><span class="font4">, meaning the deceiver who deceives and attempts to devour all men or destroy their prospects for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan the Devil challenged Jehovah God to put on the earth any man who under a crucial test would remain true and faithful to Jehovah. Satan boasted that he could turn all men away from and cause them to curse God. &quot;And Satan answered the Lord, and said, Skin for skin; yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. So went Satan forth from the presence of the Lord.&quot; (Job 2:4-7) To the end that this question of supremacy might be completely and for ever settled in the right way, and that a way might be provided for mankind to gain life everlasting, Jehovah God accepted the challenge of Satan and permitted him to put forth all his power in an effort to carry out his wicked boast. The settlement of that controversy must of necessity determine who is supreme or the all-powerful ruler of the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God sentenced Satan to death at the time of his rebellion, but deferred the execution of that sentence until a future time. He permitted Satan to remain for a long period of time that this question of supremacy might be fully tried and that all creation might have an opportunity to see it settled once and for ever. It is therefore written that Jehovah said to Satan (Exodus 9:16, Leeser]: &quot;But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they [my witnesses] may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thereafter Satan the Devil builded his own organization, which at all times has been wicked, and in his organization he has used wicked angels and wicked men. By the prophecy of Daniel God foretold that wicked spirits and wicked human creatures would &quot;bear rule over all the earth&quot; for a long period of time. (Daniel 2:39) In keeping with these prophetic statements the facts are that all the nations of the earth have been ruled in wickedness and not one has been righteous.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>SATAN'S ORGANIZATION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Appropriate thereto the following quotation is taken from the book Prophecy: &quot;That Satan's organization invisible is divided into and operated by departments under sub-rulers is quite reasonable; and the conclusion is supported by the Scriptures. We know that is true with reference to the visible part, and the visible always reflects that rule by which the invisible is governed. In addition to this, the prophet of God mentions the 'prince of Persia' and the 'prince of Grecia' that opposed the angel of the Lord and therefore represented the Devil. (Daniel 10:13, 20) This would indicate that the Devil has appointed an acting prince over each nation or earthly division of his organization. Paul tells of these 'rulers of the darkness', and that they war against the members of God's organization. — Ephesians 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Many have been deceived concerning Satan and made to believe that he does not amount to much, and that he was bound long ago, and that he has no organization. Many have also been induced to believe that Satan has horns and hoofs, and carries an asbestos poker with which he stirs the fires of his inferno and tortures the creatures who fall into his clutches. Satan himself is authority for all such fantastic lies which his agencies use to confuse the people and to blind them to his real course of action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The Scriptural proof is that Satan is a subtle, wily, elusive, fraudulent, hypocritical and very deceptive enemy of righteousness. He represents himself as an angel of light, and covers his deadly lies with a little truth, that he may deceive the unsuspecting. (2 Corinthians 11:14; 2 Thessalonians 2:9) So subtle are his methods that he has induced many good Christian people to believe that he has nothing to do with the present world governments, and comparatively few have ever seen and appreciated the fact that he has a powerful organization. Therefore it appears to be both important and necessary to set out here the proof concerning his organization, its inception and development, and its purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;That which moved Lucifer to rebel and become Satan, the enemy of God, was covetousness. He desired to have an exalted throne above others of creation, that they might bow and worship him even as creation bows before the throne of Jehovah and worships him. He set about to complete his organization, both among the spirit creatures and among human creatures. On earth he organized men into religious systems. Then he organized the commercial power and supported it with a military arrangement, and then a political organization. He saturated the entire organization with a religion. The leaders in the commercial and political parts of his organization he made the principal ones of the flock of the religious part of the organization, and thereby formed a combination of all three parts. Babylon well represents the religious, Assyria the political, and Egypt the commercial factor of his powerful organization. In the world powers that succeeded these three named above, the three elements of commercial, ecclesiastical and political are always prominent and appear as the governing factors.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>TYPICAL NATION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The Israelites were God's chosen people, organized by him into a typical nation by which he foretold his purpose to establish in due time a righteous rule of the world by and through his great Son, the Messiah. The Israelites had an opportunity to prove their integrity toward God, but only a few of them did so. The nation fell away to the Devil and became wicked, and for that reason God cast that people away and permitted them to be destroyed as a nation. At the time of the overthrow of the last king of Israel Jehovah declared that he would not interfere with Satan's rule of the world until the coming of him whose right it is to rule and that then that rightful ruler should rule in righteousness. &quot;And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, Thus saith the Lord God, Remove the diadem, and take off the crown; this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high. I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.&quot; (Ezekiel 21: 25-27) A long period of time must follow till the coming of the rightful ruler; and in that period of time Satan has been the god or invisible ruler of the whole world. He is that one who oppresses the people and defames Jehovah's name.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>RIGHTEOUS RULER</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures declare, &quot;When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.&quot; (Proverbs 29:2) Who, then, is the rightful ruler of the world, who will rule in righteousness? The scripture answers: Christ Jesus, the Son of Jehovah God, the Redeemer of the human race, the Vindicator of Jehovah's name, and who is the great Prince of Peace. From the days of the prophets till now order-loving people have waited, prayed and hoped for the coming of the true and righteous ruler of the world who shall rule and bring peace and prosperity. When that righteous rule is established the people will be happy and prosperous, and never before that time can they be prosperous and happy. Today the nations stand in darkness, but at the very portals of the bright and happy day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">While Satan has been carrying on his wicked rule Jehovah God has been preparing his royal house for the establishment of the government of righteousness. Mark now the progressive steps in carrying forward the great divine purpose. More than 1900 years ago Jehovah sent Jesus to earth as his representative to tell the truth to those who would hear, and to redeem the human race from death, and to make ready for his kingdom. Jesus began his ministry by boldly declaring that he is God's chosen one to rule the world in the place and stead of Satan, the wicked one. It is plainly written in the Bible, at Matthew 4:8-10, that the Devil offered to turn over the rulership of the world to Jesus upon the condition that Jesus would honor and worship the Devil, which offer Jesus flatly refused. From that time forward Satan sought to kill Jesus Christ. To accomplish this purpose he resorted to all manner of wicked means. He poisoned the mind of the clergy of that day against Jesus, and they tried to kill Jesus. To those clergymen Jesus said (John 8:40,43,44): &quot;Ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God [my Father]. . . . Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.&quot; This proves that the mere fact that a man claims to represent God is no evidence whatsoever of the truth of such claim. It is written, in Romans 6:16, that 'man is the servant of him whom he serves'. If you find men, therefore, who claim to be servants of God and of Christ but who are persecuting others who are serving God and Christ, and trying to prevent them from telling the truth to the people as it is set forth in the Scriptures, then you may know for a certainty that such persecutors are not the servants of God but are the servants of God's enemy, the Devil. — John 15:19-21; 2 Corinthians 4: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Satan and his agents continued to persecute Jesus to the end, and God suffered them to crucify his beloved Son. When Jesus died Satan concluded that he had destroyed the world's rightful ruler, but Jehovah exhibited his own supreme power, to the disappointment of Satan. God raised Jesus Christ out of death and exalted him to the highest place in the universe and made him Lord and Ruler of the whole world. Concerning this God caused to be written in the Scriptures these words (Philippians 2: 9-11): &quot;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name; that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.&quot; — See also Acts 3:26; Isaiah 9: 6, 7. .</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>PERIOD OF WAITING</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">When Jesus Christ ascended into heaven, why did he not then, as the world's rightful ruler, begin his rule? The Scriptural answer is, because it was not God's due time for him to begin to rule the world. Therefore God said to Jesus, as recorded in Psalm 110:1: &quot;Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.&quot; (Acts 2:34,35; Hebrews 10:13) That meant that a long period of waiting must elapse till Christ would begin his rule of the world. Within that period of waiting God has been taking out of the world other men whom he has made his witnesses, and who must continue to deliver the testimony of Jesus Christ concerning Jehovah and his kingdom. &quot;Symeon [Peter] hath fully told how God first visited to take out of the nations a people for his name.&quot; (Acts 15:14, Rotherham) The apostles were the first ones taken out, and they immediately began, at Pentecost, to declare to the people that Jesus Christ is the world's rightful ruler. Their testimony was a challenge to Satan's right to rule the world, and hence the Devil continuously persecuted the apostles. They were charged with sedition and treason and other crimes, were thrown into prison, and beaten, and were finally killed because of their faithfulness unto God and unto Christ as witnesses to the truth. For the same reason others of the early period of the Christian era suffered martyrdom.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>CHANGE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Then in the fourth century a great change came about. And why that change? Because the Roman Catholic hierarchy was organized and professed followers of Christ Jesus in that organization entered into politics and attempted to rule the nations of the earth, falsely claiming that they and their allies were ruling by divine right as Christ's representatives on earth. That course they took doubtless because they were entrapped by the Devil and caused to serve him. From then till now the Roman Catholic hierarchy has persecuted every man on earth who has boldly given testimony to the truth of God's Word and His kingdom. They persecuted the Protestants until the Protestant organizations entered into politics and ceased to protest, and then the two religious organizations became close bedfellows. Now the Roman Catholic hierarchy, the Protestant clergy, and the Jewish rabbis walk hand in hand, participate in the politics of the world, support wicked and selfish organizations that oppress the people, and persecute everyone who dares to tell the truth of and concerning God's kingdom. The big radio corporations of the world, owned and controlled by selfish interests, permit their facilities to be used only by this allied company of political religionists and refuse their facilities for the purpose of bringing to the&quot; attention of the people the plain truths of God's Word. The effort of Satan and his agents is to keep the people in ignorance of the world's rightful Ruler and of His righteous government by which He will rule the earth for the benefit of men. There are millions of good people in the Catholic and in the Protestant organizations who are in no wise responsible for the derelictions of their clergy and leaders; and those millions of people are entitled to hear the truth, that each one of them may determine for himself what course he wants to take. For that reason the truth is now being brought to the attention of all persons who desire to hear.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>END OF WAITING</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Jehovah having fixed a time limit for Satan to attempt the execution of his wicked boast to turn all men away from God, that period of waiting must come to an end sometime. The prophecies of the Bible, including the great prophecy uttered by Jesus Christ, show that such period of waiting must end in 1914, and that then Christ Jesus, the rightful ruler of the world, would begin his reign. At that time Jehovah God sent forth Christ Jesus, saying to him, as written in Psalm 110:2: &quot;Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.&quot; The prophecies show that the time of the end of Satan's world would be marked by a world war, followed quickly by famine, pestilence and distress of nations, and the perplexity amongst men. (Matthew 24: 3-13) The physical facts conclusively prove the beginning of the fulfilment of that prophecy was in 1914, thus disclosing the clear and proper understanding of the prophecy. At the same time, as the prophecy shows, there would also be a war in the invisible realm between Christ Jesus and Satan, and that the result would be the defeat of Satan and the casting of Satan and his angels down to earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To quote from the book Government:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;This is corroborated by the prophecy of Daniel wherein it is stated that Michael began his activities against Satan. 'Michael' means the Anointed One of God, which is Christ Jesus. The prophet said: 'And at that time [to wit, at the end of the world, in 1914, or the &quot;beginning of sorrows&quot;] shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, even to that same time.' (Daniel 12:1) There the time of trouble began in heaven; and at the same time the trouble broke out in the earth.... 'And there was</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.' — Revelation 12:7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;We are enabled to interpret this prophecy as to time, because of what happened in the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This having taken place, the Devil now confines his wicked work to the peoples and nations of this earth and is making a desperate attempt to turn all mankind away from God and to plunge them into destruction. You well know that since the beginning of the World War the distress and woe upon the peoples of earth have continued to increase; and the reason therefor is that Satan, having been cast down to earth, brings these woes upon mankind, as it is written, in Revelation 12:12: &quot;Woe to the inhabiters of the earth, and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.&quot; That is the real reason why there is now so much suffering and distress on earth. The Devil is trying to keep the people in ignorance of this fact while he prepares his forces for Armageddon. He particularly uses religionists to blind the people to the truth. This I say that those who hear may begin to think for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures also show that approximately at the same time the Lord gathers unto himself his faithful witnesses whom he has selected to give testimony before the peoples of the earth. He commits his testimony concerning the world rulership to his witnesses, and who are named in the Scriptures as Jehovah's witnesses, and these the Lord sends forth to deliver his testimony. &quot;And the dragon was wroth with the woman [symbolizing God's Kingdombearing organization], and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.&quot; (Revelation 12:17) &quot;Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour. I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.&quot; — Isaiah 43:10-12, A.R.V.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>A CHALLENGE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Necessarily this testimony delivered by Jehovah's witnesses, announcing that Christ Jesus is earth's rightful ruler, is a direct challenge to the Devil, and a declaration of war against him; and the Scriptures declare that for that reason the old Dragon, the Devil, makes war against Jehovah's witnesses who keep the commandments of Jehovah God. (Revelation 12:17) Because Christ Jesus when on the earth testified to the truth and declared himself the King, whom God had selected to rule the world, Satan sought to kill him. For the same reason now the Devil and his emissaries vigorously oppose the testimony delivered by Jehovah's witnesses and seek to kill them. For this reason Jesus has said to his faithful followers (John 15: 20): &quot;The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In fulfilment of this prophetic statement the Roman Catholic hierarchy now takes the lead in a world-wide cruel campaign in opposition to Jehovah's witnesses; and this is positive proof that such opposition is carried on at the command and instance of the Devil, and all who join in this opposition to the message concerning God and his kingdom under Christ put themselves on the side of the Devil. Jehovah's witnesses are few in number, and in themselves are of little importance. To be sure, the Roman Catholic hierarchy and her allies are not at all afraid of Jehovah's witnesses, but both they and their father are afraid of the message of truth which these witnesses, by God's grace, deliver to the people, because that message tells the people that within a very short time Satan's organization shall be completely destroyed and that Christ Jesus shall rule the world in righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the present time the Roman Catholic hierarchy maintains a publicity bureau in Washington, D.C., and from that headquarters copy is sent to every part of &quot;Christendom&quot;, and all the Catholic newspapers use that copy and engage in the publication of all manner of vicious and slanderous falsehoods against Jehovah's witnesses. Why is that done? Because Jehovah's witnesses are announcing that the Almighty God Jehovah is supreme, and that Christ is his King, and that Satan's rule of the world must completely end within a short time. Jehovah's witnesses are not complaining, nor are they asking any quarter of men. By the Scriptures they have been fully informed that this opposition would develop, even before it began, and if it had not come they would have been disappointed. This cruel opposition is only further evidence that Jehovah's witnesses are right and have the approval of the Almighty God and of Christ his King. For that reason men and women who make up the little company of Jehovah's witnesses now go from house to house throughout the land, exhibiting to the people in book form the message concerning God and Christ and his kingdom. They call attention of the people to these truths emphasizing the fact that the change of the rulership of the world is now at hand. The more the Roman Catholic hierarchy and her allies oppose, the more Jehovah's witnesses will rejoice and sing the praises of God and his King. They know the fight is on to a finish, and that God will win. It is a glorious fight, and will continue to increase in glory, and will have a glorious end. Never has there been such a joyful company of people on earth as Jehovah's witnesses, because they are privileged to be the publicity agents of the Almighty God and his King and to announce to the people that soon oppression shall end and righteousness shall rule the world. Let all of Satan's agents take notice now that the end is near and that all such opposers or enemies of God and his kingdom will meet everlasting defeat. The Bible proof, fully supported by the physical facts, is set forth in detail in the books that are brought to your door by Jehovah's witnesses, and by the study of such you may clearly see the reason for the present world distress, what shall shortly follow, and what is the complete remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Quoting again from the book Government:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;All sober-minded persons concede the great need for a better government. All must agree that there is no satisfactory government on earth. All must admit that man has never been able to establish and carry on a satisfactory government. There is no reason to conclude that imperfect man will ever be able to establish a righteous government. What then shall the people do? The Bible discloses the reason for man's inability to set up a perfect government and God's purpose to remove, the hindrances and give mail a perfect and righteous government. Why then do the clergymen, both Catholic and Protestant, oppose and speak against those who insist on telling the people about the Bible and God's provision for a righteous government? Why are they aided and abetted in this opposition by the profiteers and professional politicians? The answer is plain. The clergy, the profiteers and the politicians are in an alliance to govern the peoples of earth, and their god or invisible ruler is Satan the Devil, the prince of evil. Because they refuse to hear and to obey the truth and because they oppose every effort to give the people the truth, and insist on keeping the people under the oppressive organization, God will destroy Satan and his organization and for ever put down the haughty, the proud, and the oppressor, and the deceiver, including the clergymen, profiteers and politicians. God is now taking a hand in the fight, and the result is certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;When Jesus was on earth he spoke often to the multitudes. It is written that 'the common people heard him gladly'. When he offered himself to Israel as King the multitudes hailed him with songs of praise. At the instance of the governing powers, however, and particularly of the clergy, the people were turned against him. Had the common people</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">been left to themselves, great multitudes would have accepted the Lord. A similar condition exists in the earth today. The common people hear the truth gladly, and would follow it were it not for the fact that they are hindered by the clergy and the principal of their flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Are these common people a part of the Devil's organization? They are not directly so. The Devil's organization is made up principally of those that rule and that are called the official part of the nation. The government is represented under the symbol of 'beast'. The Revelation speaks of those that have the 'mark of the beast in their hand or in their forehead'. (Revelation 14:9) There are certain ones amongst the rank and file of the people who are controlled in their minds by what the governments do, and yield thereto. These may be said to have the mark of the beast in their forehead, which is a symbol of the place of intelligence. Others lend active support to the oppressive government. The 'hand' is a symbol of power; therefore those who have the mark of the beast in their hand are supporters of the beast. But there are millions of people upon earth whose minds and hearts are not in sympathy with beastly governments and who have no part therein. These are not a part of the Devil's organization, yet they are under the influence and power of that organization. Turning away therefrom and seeking the Lord they will early receive the blessings that the Lord has for them.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>ABOMINATION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">For centuries those who love God have been looking for the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom. Now the King is upon his throne, and it is the will of God that announcement of this stupendous truth shall be made to the peoples of earth. During the World War some clergymen in London issued a manifesto to the effect that the extraneous evidence then apparent showed that the kingdom of Christ was at hand. Shortly thereafter, however, the League of Nations was brought forth as the scheme for ruling the world, and at once the clergy of &quot;Christendom&quot; hailed the League of Nations as a substitute for God's kingdom on earth. Now the leaders amongst the Catholics, Protestants and Jews unite to declare that the League of Nations is the only light of the world. The League of Nations being made a substitute for God's kingdom under Christ, necessarily that League is an abomination in the sight of Almighty God. Both the prophet Daniel and Jesus Christ speak of &quot;the abomination that maketh desolate&quot; because it stands in the holy place, where it ought not to stand, that is to say, as a substitute for God's kingdom. — Daniel 11:31; 12:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mark now the advice which Jesus Christ gives to the people of good will concerning that abomination (Matthew 24:15,16): &quot;When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains.&quot; Those in Judea here mentioned are the ones who are in heart sympathy with the kingdom of God under Christ; hence they are persons of good will. The mountains mentioned here symbolically mean Jehovah God and his organization under Christ. Therefore the advice of Christ Jesus is to all people of good will, that they now &quot;flee to the mountains&quot;, that is to say, take their stand on the side of God and Christ and his kingdom, and that they do by entirely forsaking Satan's organization. The Lord admonishes such persons of good will to separate themselves from selfish world organizations and not to try to seek honor at the hands of men nor to uphold the institutions that are against the kingdom of God. He admonishes all such to take their stand on the side of Jehovah God before the &quot;winter&quot; time. The words &quot;winter time&quot; there used symbolically mean the time of great suffering and distress which will come at the battle of Armageddon. Why does Jesus warn the people to flee now? He answers that question in these words (Matthew 24: 21): &quot;For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>ARMAGEDDON</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">That stupendous tribulation is the battle of the great day of God Almighty, otherwise named in the Scriptures &quot;Armageddon&quot;. In the book called Preparation you will find a full description of that great battle, how it will be fought, and what will be the result. Here I can only say that now all the nations of earth are gathering together under Satan's leadership to the battle of Armageddon. That will be a war and slaughter such as never before was known in the history of man. Both the invisible and visible forces of the universe will fight, and many of them will die. But by far the greatest fighting will be amongst the unseen forces. Christ Jesus, the mighty Warrior and Chief Executive Officer of Jehovah, will lead the fight on the side of righteousness. Why should there be such a great battle? The reason is that Satan the Devil will not give way to the world's rightful ruler, and therefore Satan and his organization must be and will be completely destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">To quote from the book Prophecy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The day of battle draws nigh. The day for the judgment of the nations is at hand. The Lord is in his holy temple for judgment. 'Hear, . all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is; and let the Lord God be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.' — Micah 1:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Notice must be given to the world, because God does not take action in secret. Through his prophet Jehovah says: 'Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong. Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat [the place and time for Jehovah to pronounce and execute judgment]: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about.' — Joel 3:9,10,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Satan marches his great army into 'the valley of decision' for war. With blaring bands of military music and flying banners his officers approach. In the van march the kings, the princes, the presidents, the governors, and the smaller political rulers; the judges and the attendants upon the great judicial systems; the parliaments, the congresses, and all others having to do with the political machinery of the world. More bands and banners, and on come the financial giants of the world, comparatively small in number, but great in power. More music, banners and floats, and then appear in the line of march the mighty ecclesiastical pontiffs, the bishops, the cardinals, the priests, the rabbis, the doctors of divinity, the right reverends and all the other clergy, each wearing an apparel that identifies him, and accompanied by lay leaders and those who serve and receive the collections. Proud, haughty, cold, calculating and severe, and with heavy dignity, each one of the three great governing factors of the visible part of the Devil's organization takes its respective position in the line of inarch. Self-importance is written upon their countenance, and self-praise is upon all lips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;March! March! March! And on they come! In the line there are great magazine owners and publishers, who use their columns to extol the virtues of the mighty worldly organization. There are the owners and publishers of the great metropolitan newspapers, which mold public opinion in favor of the ruling heroes. More bands of music, and on come the chariots and horses of war. These are no part of the ruling factors, but they are instruments employed by the ruling factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Tramp! Tramp! Tramp! Will they never cease to tramp? All the nations must come, because they must assemble to drink of that cup of wrath which God has poured for them, and none can refuse. ['And it shall be, if they refuse-to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the Lord of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.'] — Jeremiah 25:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;There are more than sixty nations that are putting forth their best endeavors to equip for war. Some idea of the number of poor souls that are prepared for the slaughter, and which form a military instrument of</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the Devil's organization, may be gathered from the following table . . . published by the U. S. War Department, as of September 24, 1928....</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;It will be observed that the total military manpower set forth above is, to wit, 124,192,440 men. For all these men there must be war equipment, such as guns, swords, knives, knapsacks, gun carriages, tanks, ammunition, bombs, and all other instruments of destruction used by men of war. Then add to the above the tremendous navies of the countries which are not here set forth, including torpedoes and numerous submarines. To this add the enormous aircraft that fly through the air and drop deadly missiles upon men. To this add poison gases, a comparatively small quantity of which would destroy a whole city in less than a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;These are all marching into 'the valley of decision', the mass of them ignorant of why they are going there. There are multitudes upon multitudes of people who are no part of this organization, but who are either indirectly or directly affected thereby. These include the drivers of motors, the hospital corps, those who supply and convey the food necessary to feed the armies, the doctors and the nurses. And then there are other multitudes upon multitudes of people who are indirectly affected, because their . necessities of life must be curtailed in order to supply the military organization. And then, over and above all this visible organization, unseen by all and known by a very few, rides the Devil, its mighty god, flanked and supported by hordes of evil angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;In view of all this array of organized power, even some who claim to be Christians scorn the thought of a Devil's organization. It might here be asked, Whose organization is it that is above described? Surely God does not need such; and while these come in the name of the Lord, they come hypocritically in his name, but in fact in the name of Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The visible part of God's organization is really small and insignificant, so small, in fact, as to hardly deserve notice. They are on the other side of the valley of decision, under the banner of the Lord. They bear no weapons of warfare; only their trumpets do they have with which to sound the praises of Jehovah God. The visible members of Satan's organization look upon this small and insignificant company of trumpeters with contempt. They are the only visible foes of Satan, and they refuse to compromise with any part of his organization. They persist in singing forth Jehovah's praise and in declaring the wonders of his works. Satan incites the clergy to destroy the little band of trumpeters, or singers, because the great ecclesiastics are annoyed by the presence of and the noise made by this small company of witnesses. The little company is doing no harm to anyone; the politicians would find no occasion against them except for the influence of the ecclesiastics, and the financiers are too busy to give them any heed; but both must heed their ally's demands, because Satan is very mad at this little company and would destroy them. (Revelation 12:17) The Lord says to them: 'Continue to sound your trumpets, cease not day or night, and fear not; no evil shall befall you; I have put my words in your mouth; tell it out that others might know that I am God.' — Isaiah 62:6; 51:16; Psalm 91:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The power and military strength of the invisible part of God's organization cannot be stated, because it is not revealed. We know that Jesus said that he could call for twelve legions of angels for his own defense. We know, therefore, that there are angels of great power who form a part of God's mighty organization. Christ Jesus is the Head of it, the Field Marshal leading the forces; and over and above it all rides the Almighty God. The power thereof may be approximated somewhat by the results that follow. The great issue to be determined finally is, Who is the Almighty God? The day of decision is at hand, and those who have some knowledge of and faith in the Word of God are now enabled to determine from the words of the prophets what shall be the result.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Right Hand and Executioner for Jehovah God is Christ Jesus. Satan and all of his host are the enemies of God, and concerning these it is written, in Psalm 21: 8-10: &quot;Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.&quot; That destruction of the enemies of God will include all the visible and invisible ones who oppose God and his kingdom, as it is written, in Psalm 104: 35: &quot;Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.&quot; All who support Satan's wicked rule of the world, and who are therefore the friends of the world, are God's enemies, and concerning that it is written, at James 4:4: &quot;Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The visible kings and rulers of the earth, made up of the commercial, political and religious elements, are now in a conspiracy against Jehovah and his kingdom, as it is written (Psalm 2:2-9): &quot;The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree; the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I shall give thee the [nations] for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Roman Catholic hierarchy and its arrogant allies now, think they can assault with impunity Jehovah's witnesses and bring reproach upon God's holy name and get away with it. They will find, however, that in the battle of Armageddon their wealth, worldly influence, position and power amongst men will afford them no help whatsoever and that there will be no place for them to escape, as it is written, in Jeremiah's prophecy (25:33-35): &quot;And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>RIGHTEOUS GOVERNMENT</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Let all the people who desire to see a righteous government now be calm and sober-minded. Cease fighting or quarreling over immaterial matters. No political party can bring you relief and happiness. No church organization can bring what you desire. No earthly organization can bring you any real blessing; because all those things must soon pass away. The world crisis is here, and the all-important question is concerning God's kingdom of righteousness and man's relation thereto. Christ Jesus the King is the righteous and elect servant of Jehovah God to whom Jehovah has committed the ruler-ship of the world, and concerning him Jehovah says through his prophet (Matthew 12:18, 21): 'Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall show judgment to the nations. And in his name shall the nations hope.' (Isaiah 42:1, 3) You find no hope of relief by looking to the rulers of this wicked world, and here is the positive statement of Almighty God that in the name of Christ Jesus, the world's rightful ruler, shall the nations hope. And why shall the people hope in his name? The prophet of God answers, at Isaiah 9:6,7: &quot;For . . . the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of [Jehovah] of hosts will perform this.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Scriptures name Satan as the prince of darkness who keeps the people in the dark concerning God and his kingdom of righteousness under Christ. Those who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, and wholly devoted themselves to him and Jehovah, have been taken out of darkness into the light of truth; and these are commanded to make known the truth to others, that they also might hear and obey the Lord. (Colossians 1:13; 1 Peter 2:9,10) That is the reason why Jehovah's witnesses in these days are calling at your homes to tell you the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This is the time of great darkness upon the earth, as it is written in Isaiah 60: 2: &quot;For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.&quot; This is the time when Jehovah says to his faithful witnesses on earth: &quot;Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.&quot; These witnesses must point the people to the fact that Jehovah is supreme and that Christ Jesus is the Leader of the people and the world's rightful ruler. The nations of earth are sick unto death, and the people are at the point of desperation. In this hour of great peril Jehovah says to the people, as it is written (Isaiah 55:3,4): &quot;Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of [the Beloved]. Behold, I have given him [Christ Jesus] for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.&quot; Christ Jesus and his kingdom is the hope of the world, and there is none other. He is the rightful and invisible ruler of the world, whom God has appointed to destroy Satan's organization and to establish righteousness amongst men.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>VISIBLE RULERS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Since Christ Jesus will always be invisible to human eyes, there must be men on earth who will rule as his visible representatives. Such men as Hitler, Mussolini, the Catholic hierarchy, and the selfish politicians of America, will have nothing whatsoever to do with the rule of the nations of the earth under Christ. No man of that kind will have anything to do with God's kingdom; and that is stated at Daniel 2:44, to wit: &quot;And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">shall not be left to other people</span><span class="font4">, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The men who will represent Christ Jesus on earth as the visible rulers amongst the people will be such men as Abraham and Moses, a list of the names of which men appears in the eleventh chapter of Hebrews. Those faithful men of old saw by faith the day coming when God would have a righteous government on the earth. They desired that government and they devoted themselves to Jehovah. Amidst great persecution heaped upon them by Satan and his agents those men maintained their integrity toward God and died faithful to him. They must remain dead until God's due time to awaken them out of death; and that due time is at hand. The Scriptures give full assurance that those faithful men shall be resurrected soon as perfect men and made the representatives on earth of the world ruler Christ Jesus. (Hebrews 11:39, 40) In former days those faithful men were called &quot;fathers&quot; in Israel because under the direction of the Lord they tried to lead the Israelites in the right way. (Psalm 45:16) &quot;Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Concerning this the book Government says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;These men become the children of Christ, because they receive their blessings according to the covenant by and through Christ; and, the fact being that they are children of Christ, they are properly called 'princes'. These faithful men or princes will be the visible representatives of God's government on earth. They shall constitute the head ones or leaders amongst the people and shall lead them in the way of righteousness. The people will recognize them as the visible rulers or deputies of the heavenly kingdom of righteousness. That these men are to be associated with the kingdom as visible rulers under The Christ is further testified to by the prophet: 'Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.' — Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The Scriptures disclose that Jehovah has a mighty organization through which he carries out his purposes. The chief or principal one of that organization under Jehovah is Christ the King. To that mighty King God gives all the nations as an inheritance [Psalm 2:6-8], and he shall reign over them in righteousness. The kingdom will not be visible to human eyes, but the kingdom will have representatives on earth that will be visible to human eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The visible representatives will be made up of those faithful men who before the coming of Christ to redeem mankind were faithful and true to God, and to whom God will give a 'better resurrection'. [Hebrews 11:35] Such are the princes who shall carry into operation the judgments of the great King. As such representatives of the kingdom they will constitute a part of God's organization. The people will seek them out that they may be instructed in the right way. These honest and faithful representatives of the kingdom will be so different from the officers of the present wicked world that all will readily see that the good and faithful representatives are members of God's organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;That this organization will include all the faithful prophets of God, raised to life as perfect men and made representatives of the kingdom on earth, is further proved by the words of Jesus: 'Ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in [not of ] the kingdom of God.' The people shall come from every direction of the compass and sit down in the kingdom with these faithful men and learn of them. (Luke 13:28,29) 'And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.' — Matthew 8:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Those loyal and true men of old all died in faith, and God has promised to raise them up out of death and that they will be resurrected as perfect men. The promise is that their resurrection shall follow the completion of the body members of Christ. (Hebrews 11:35,40) The proof showing that 1914 was the great turning point, that God has placed his King upon his throne, and that he has come to his temple and is putting his kingdom in operation, it may be reasonably concluded that the [faithful patriarchs and prophets] will be back on earth as perfect men within a comparatively short time. Their presence as perfect men on the earth will enable the people to see more clearly that the time has come for God's righteous rule to take complete charge of all the affairs of men.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The apostle Peter under inspiration wrote concerning the new world rule, which is composed of the &quot;new heaven&quot;, or invisible part, and the &quot;new earth&quot;, the visible part, and then said (2 Peter 3:13): &quot;We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; The battle of the great day of God Almighty will mark the passing away for ever, of the old, wicked world, and then shall come into full sway and full view the new and righteous rule. Today we stand at the very portals of that righteous world rule, and to us Jehovah says (Isaiah 32:1,17,18): &quot;Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment. And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under that righteous rule there will never be another war, nor even the fear of war, because Armageddon will mark the end of all war. The kingdom of God will be over all the nations. (Isaiah 2: 4) &quot;And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>BENEFITS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Appropriately quoting from Prophecy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;God will have peace, and have it in his own way; and when he brings peace, it shall come to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;It should be apparent, to all who think, that there could be no real peace on earth until wickedness is completely put down. While unrighteousness rules, some will be given advantage at the expense of others. The strong survive for a time, and fall when another stronger one arises. Disorder, strife, oppression and murder have ruled amongst men for centuries, because Satan, the evil one, has been in control. There must come One greater and stronger than Satan, and who acts in exact harmony with and under the direction of the Almighty God, and who will joyfully obey the commandments of Jehovah God. Then in peace and righteousness he will draw the people to him. Jehovah long ago foretold by his prophet the coming of his mighty One. He who would be the peacemaker for the people, and be their peace, must also be the Redeemer of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Jehovah arranged that his beloved Son the Logos should leave the courts of heaven and be born a man child, grow to manhood's estate, suffer death to provide the price of redemption for man, and then become the great Ruler of the world and establish peace for ever amongst men. Therefore, when Jesus was born at Bethlehem, where the prophet foretold he would be born (Micah 5:2), God caused his mighty angel from heaven to announce this prophecy: 'I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall [in future days] be to all people. For unto you is born this day, in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.' Immediately following that great prophetic announcement a host of angels joined in the song of praise, which was heard by men; and the words of that song were prophetic, because they foretold the day when the people would be at peace, and when Jehovah God would bring them peace through the beloved One who was born that day in the city of David. The angels sang: 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.' — Luke 2:10-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;That great prophecy must be fulfilled, and with the conclusion of the great battle of God Almighty it will be fulfilled. God will fight for peace (and then peace will be on earth for ever), and this he will do by and through his beloved Son. Like a mantle of light, peace will cover the earth and good will toward men shall be permanently established. It can come in no other way. Men who attempt to run ahead of Jehovah and establish peace by their arrangements are an abomination in his sight.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the righteous rule of Christ there will be no officials who will collect money by taxation and then loan that money to the farmer with a view to making the farmer a serf. There will no more be the harsh and oppressive government agents to browbeat and put in fear the people and harshly judge and misuse them. Armageddon will end all oppression, as it is written (Psalm 72:4): &quot;He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.&quot; No more shall men be put in fear of losing their homes, which they have builded at great effort and sacrifice, nor shall they be compelled to destroy portions of their crops, and their animals, in order to make higher prices. Concerning this it is written (Isaiah 65:21): &quot;And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them&quot;; (Micah 4:4) &quot;and none shall make them afraid.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Appropriate thereto the following quotations are taken from the book Government:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Small property owners have long been oppressed by those who have power and riches. The wage earners have been oppressed concerning their wages. The widows and the orphans have been oppressed, and the hand of the oppressor has been upon all the weaker ones in every nation. Such oppression has been aided and abetted by those who have called themselves by the name of Christ. (James 2: 6, 7) In the administration of God's righteous government all oppression must cease, because the Ruler will ['reign in righteousness']. No oppressor shall be permitted any more among the people. (Zechariah 9:8) Concerning those who have oppressed, the Lord says: 'And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith the Lord of hosts.' — Malachi 3:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The administration of the Lord's government will be favorable to the poor. 'With righteousness shall he judge the poor.' (Isaiah 11:4) Every one will be compelled to deal fairly with his neighbor. 'Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother: and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.' — Zechariah 7:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;In the present evil governments men who produce nothing lie upon their beds and work out schemes to rob their fellow man. Such will cease under the righteous government of the Lord. None of their schemes will be permitted to mature. Then there will be no more Teapot Dome oil thefts or like crimes committed. There will be no more cruel corporations called trust companies to unjustly burden the people. 'Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand. And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.' — Micah 2:1,2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The founders of the American government said that all men are created equal and that all men should stand equal before the law. They said well, but their sayings have not been put into action. On the contrary, the common people have not stood equal and have not had an equal show. They have been exploited and the fruits of their labor spoiled. It shall not be so under the righteous government of the Lord; for then it will be said: 'For the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.' — Isaiah 16:4,5.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Under God's government the people 'shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble'. (Isaiah 65:23) They will all enjoy the fruits of their work. Thorns and thistles have long encumbered the ground and made it difficult for man to obtain a good yield from the soil. The Lord will show man how to remove these hindrances, that his crops may be raised in abundance. — Isaiah 55:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Famine has been one of the great enemies of man under Satan's reign. There will be no famines when God's government is in full sway in the earth. 'Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.' — Psalm 67: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;It is quite the rule obtaining in present evil governments that those who govern do not suffer from famine, but have plenty. The prophet describes these: 'And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.' — Malachi 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Conditions will be entirely different when the righteous One has full sway and exercises it. Then the people will have plenty and will rejoice. 'When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.' (Proverbs 29: 2) With the production and distribution of food and raiment carried on in justice and righteousness the people will be contented and happy. 'And in this [government] shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.' — Isaiah 25:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The health of the people is of very great importance. If all the people could have health, that would be a great benefit to them. The present governments take some steps to safeguard the health of the public, but in so doing the people are exploited. Many who claim to serve the sick connive at making even the well sick that they may be able to reap pecuniary gain therefrom. Foods are adulterated to such an extent that much sickness results therefrom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Under the Lord's righteous government the people will be taught what is proper to eat and how to eat it; they will be taught proper sanitary conditions, how to sleep and exercise, and no one will be permitted to deceive them. They will be told the truth; and knowing that they are receiving the truth, they will be encouraged and benefited and will progress rapidly. ... The great Interpreter of the truth and righteousness is God's Anointed One, Christ his King. He is the Messenger that will bring truth and peace to the people at Jehovah's command. All men will be brought to an exact knowledge of the truth, and particularly that truth that Jesus Christ gave his life that all men might have an opportunity to live. Then hearing and obeying the truth, man will benefit thereby and will be restored to the days of his youth. (Job 33:25).&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The people will grow into health and strength and will come to a knowledge of the truth, and those who learn the truth and obey God and his King, Christ Jesus, shall be granted everlasting life on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For this reason God provided redemption of man from death through Christ Jesus; and therefore a knowledge of the truth is now of the greatest importance to the people, because, said Jesus Christ (John 17:3): &quot;This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.&quot;</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>CONTRAST</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">More than 6,000 years of world history has been written, and every page thereof is smeared with human blood unrighteously shed. God has declared that due recompense must be made for that wicked slaughter of humankind. In every age wars of conquest have been waged resulting in robbing the common people of their just rights, while the marauders have lived wantonly upon their ill-got gains. During all the ages political gangsters, claiming to represent the interests of the people, have played into the hands of the greedy and heartless commercial highwaymen, who have carried on their business in an apparently legal manner, but to the detriment of the people. In all of these centuries religionists hypocritically have claimed to serve God, but by their course of action they have continuously brought reproach upon his name and upon the name of Christ Jesus, and they have turned the masses of the people into darkness and despair. Such are the fruits of the world ruled by Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The time was in America when the nation stood for liberty, freedom of speech, and freedom of press. Today human liberty has practically disappeared and the fundamental law of the land, represented in the Constitution of the United States, is treated as a mere scrap of paper. No longer can men freely speak the truth without being subjected to all manner of vilification at the hands of those who are against the truth. The time was when the public press published news that was of public interest and convenience. Today the public press is the tool of the heartless commercial and political rulers and it publishes the very opposite of the truth. The metropolitan press is in fact the propaganda instrument used by and for the selfish interests and is against God and his kingdom message and refuses to publish that which is of public interest, convenience and necessity. Each issue of the great newspapers carries glaring headlines telling of rape, kidnaping, theft, robbery, murder, and suicide. These things are the fruits of the satanic rule of the world. Is it your desire to see such wicked rule continue for ever, or have you had enough of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The present unrighteous rule of the world holds forth not one vestige of hope for humankind. That part of the world called &quot;Christendom&quot; is in a particularly unhappy state. Men who once called upon the name of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus laid the foundation of the American nation that it might be an asylum for those persecuted in and driven from other lands, and that it might be the home of those who would promote the general welfare. Today such true and stalwart men have practically disappeared. America, like other countries of &quot;Christendom&quot;, is ruled by ultraselfish men, and its institutions hold out no inducement for the youth to grow into God-fearing men and women. The visible religious-political leaders march the people through the streets in the name of Christ, and yet every act and word of such leaders dishonors the name of Jehovah God and his King. &quot;Christendom&quot; has become a mockery and a reproach to Jehovah's name; and this has been accomplished by Satan's overreaching and using the leaders of religion falsely called &quot;Christianity&quot;. Why should the people of good will longer stand in the darkness and mourn in despair?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Look now with hope to the kingdom of righteousness. In this hour of great distress and sorrow the trumpet message sounds calling your attention to the mighty truth that Jehovah is the supreme and almighty God, that Christ is the King and the righteous and rightful ruler who has taken his power, and that his rule will bring the desire of all honest hearts and will bestow boundless blessings upon all who are obedient to his commandments. The rule of the world under Christ Jesus not only will bring lasting peace and prosperity, but also will give to the people liberty, health and strength, lead them fully into the paths of righteousness, and bestow upon them everlasting life here upon the earth. &quot;Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment,&quot; (John 5:28,29, A.R.V.) &quot;For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:25,26) Your beloved dead shall return from the graves, and all who love God and his King shall then walk together amidst the flowers beside the peaceful waters, singing together the praises of the Most High. Tears of bitterness will cease to flow, and the fear of death will for ever disappear. In beautiful symbolic phrase the revelator says concerning that glorious world (Revelation 21:1-4) that 'Jehovah God will wipe away all tears from the eyes of men and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, and no more pain; for the former wicked things of the world are passed away'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The battle of Armageddon, which is just ahead, will open the gates of that glorious and righteous rule of the world, and which righteous rule will be seen and felt upon the earth. Because of the great change for good that is just at hand God commands his witnesses on the earth to now (Psalm 96:10) 'say to the nations that the Lord Jesus Christ reigns, the world shall be established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people in righteousness'. Do you desire that world rulership and the blessings it will bring?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regardless of what men might want, Christ Jesus is now the rightful Ruler of the world and is going to rule the world in righteousness. All the wicked he will destroy. All the people will have an opportunity to choose to serve the Devil and be destroyed or to serve Jehovah God and his King and live. The time for you to choose is now here!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Let every person, both in this visible and in the invisible audience, who sincerely desires to see the world ruled in righteousness, and who desires to enjoy these blessings which God has provided through Christ Jesus, take his stand now on the side of the Lord. Then inform yourselves of the great truths of God's Word now due to be understood, seek righteousness, and do right, prove your integrity to God and his King, and your blessings shall be complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">I now call upon all in this and in the invisible audience who desire to be on the side of Jehovah God and his righteous King to arise and say, Aye!</span></p>
