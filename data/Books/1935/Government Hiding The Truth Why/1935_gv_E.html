<p><span class="font5">(The full text of Judge Rutherford’s Washington radio speech broadcast to all parts of the earth)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font8">HE EARTH and its fullness belong to Jehovah God. (Psalm 24:1) He created it for man and created man to dwell upon the earth forever in prosperity, peace and happiness. The earth can be properly and justly governed only in harmony with the will of Jehovah. All righteous power and authority proceed from him. No government organized and carried on by men contrary to the will of Jehovah God can bring peace and prosperity to the people. Jehovah has given men the opportunity to establish good government amongst themselves. Men have failed. The nations of earth are now in dire extremity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the capital city of America it is my privilege to speak today, and by the grace of Jehovah this message may be heard throughout America, Europe, Africa and the isles of the sea. No attempt will be made on this occasion to give advice to the men who hold the offices as rulers of the people. Such advice, if given, would not be heeded. This is proved by the fact that heretofore notice and warning have been given to the rulers of the earth, which has not only gone</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">unheeded by them but which they have spurned and treated with ridicule and contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Immediately before God destroyed the first world power that governed the earth he sent his messengers to give notice and warning to the rulers thereof. That message was contemptuously cast aside, Jehovah was defied, and his name reproached, and then God directed his messengers to turn to the common people. (Exodus 5:1-4) Similar conditions now obtain, for the reason that the last world power to rule the earth is tottering to the fall. Disregarding the Word of God the blinded governing powers are leading the blinded and oppressed people, and all such are headed for the ditch. There is hope now only for those people who hear and give heed to the Word of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This message today is addressed to all people of good will regardless of nationality, creed or previous condition of servitude; to those persons who have an honest and sincere desire to have and to enjoy a government of equal and exact justice, administered unselfishly, honestly and righteously for the general welfare; to the people who sincerely desire and pray that the will of Jehovah God may be done on earth even as in heaven. I am persuaded that there are millions of such people who are held in bondage by the oppressive powers that now rule the earth. Such people of good will, by the grace of God, must have an opportunity to hear his Word, and he has made such provision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I shall not speak the wisdom of men, because such wisdom has accomplished no lasting good to the people. All the treasures of knowledge and true wisdom are found in the Bible, which is the Word of God. I call your attention to the expressed wisdom of God’s Word which, when set alongside the well-known physical facts, will enable you to understand what is the right course to take. Knowledge of these truths is now indispensable to all who will survive the great tribulation that is impending and immediately about to fall upon the world. I bid you therefore to follow carefully this speech and then to exercise your right of choice and take whatsoever course you may desire. The sole purpose here is to bring to your attention the true cause of the unhappy condition now prevailing on the earth and point you to the only possible way of ever having and enjoying a government that will fully satisfy the desire of every honest person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Centuries ago, upon the plains of Shinar, men organized their first government, and in doing so they defied Jehovah God, set up a creature above the Creator, and gave praise to man and reproached the name of Almighty God. That government fell. Ancient Egypt was the first world power. That government defied Jehovah God and cruelly persecuted and oppressed those people who served God. That world power was destroyed. The course taken by that government and its untimely end foreshadowed the course and untimely end of the governments that now rule the earth. In their order ancient Egypt was followed by other world powers, to wit, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome, all of which pursued a course contrary to the Word of Jehovah God, oppressed the poor and wickedly persecuted those who told the truth. All of those governments went to destruction. Today the nations called “Christendom” dominate the peoples of the earth. These nations claim to be Christian nations, but they proceed exactly contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ. In practically all of these- nations there is now a dictator in the saddle who in turn is guided and controlled by a selfish, subtle and concealed power, and which controlling and governing power tramples jipon the rights of the people, puts forward falsehood for truth, and gives no heed to the Word of Almighty God. In all of such governments religion is employed as a means to keep the people in ignorance of Jehovah’s truth which is set forth in the sacred word of the Bible. The religions which are practiced by the governments of earth are diametrically opposed to God and to Christ Jesus. Claiming to be what it is not, and putting forward itself in the name of Christ, religion is the most effective means employed , to deceive and mislead the people. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Long ago God caused to be recorded in the Bible the description of the conditions that would be manifest in the last days; and I ask you to bear witness to the fact that the conditions described in the Lord’s Word exist right now and which conditions prove that we are in the “last days”. That scripture, recorded at 2 Timothy 3:1-5, says: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, [covenant]-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power there-of.”—2 Timothy 3:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Everyone knows that this is a time of great peril and that the people are in dire distress and in great perplexity. They have lost confidence in those that rule because they have been so often deceived, misled and oppressed. The Word of God shows that greater peril upon the world will come in the very near future and of that peril the common people must be warned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The testimony of the keenest statesmen of the world today is that the governments of the earth not only are imperfect and unsatisfactory, but are generally corrupt. It is freely admitted that all the efforts of men to establish a</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">just and satisfactory government have signally failed. All must admit that the combined wisdom and counsel of men have failed to set up and administer a satisfactory government. There must be a primary reason for such failure. There is a reason, and the full and complete explanation is stated in the Bible-, which is now due to be understood because God’s time has come to make it understandable. When you see that man’s counsel has failed, then why longer follow that imperfect and unwise counsel? All fair-minded persons, whether they be Catholic or Protestant, Jew or infidel, must, if they would find the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font8"> way, cease fighting each other, cease following the lead of selfish and imperfect men, and sincerely, calmly, soberly and honestly endeavor to learn what is set forth in the Word of Jehovah and obey Him. Satan the Devil is the common enemy of man and he uses selfish and prejudiced men to keep the people in ignorance of how the desirable government can be had and enjoyed by mankind. Satan, by employing fraud and deceit, has kept, and now would continue to keep, the people in ignorance of the truth for the reason, as Jesus said, that the truth alone shall make you free. Bear with me, then, if you will, while I recount in brief the Bible reasons for the cruel and oppressive conditions that now obtain throughout the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">God created man and placed him in a beautiful and perfect home. He made his spiritual son Lucifer the invisible overlord of man and of the earth. Lucifer rebelled against Jehovah, led men and angels into that rebellion, and then challenged Jehovah God to put men on earth who would remain true and faithful to him when put to the most severe test. God sentenced Lucifer to death and changed his name to that of Satan, Dragon, Serpent, and Devil. To be sure, God could have immediately executed that sentence of death by destroying Satan, but, had he done so, Satan would have had no opportunity to prove his boastful challenge and there would have been no opportunity to put men to the crucial test to prove their integrity toward Jehovah. God accepted the challenge and permitted Satan thenceforth full liberty to prove his challenge, and for this reason God said to Satan, as is recorded&quot; in Exodus 9:16: “But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they [my witnesses] may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.” (Exodus 9:16, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser)</span><span class="font8"> Satan was given a limited time within . which to prove his boastful challenge, and when that time ends Jehovah must make known to all his own supremacy and vindicate his own word and name and must cause his witnesses to proclaim throughout the earth his name that the people might know who is their Friend and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Life-giver and from whom their blessings flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God then gave his word that when his due time should arrive he would set up a righteous government and that by and through that government Satan’s wicked rule and power must be destroyed. Jehovah decreed that at the proper time all mankind should have the opportunity to choose between Satan and Jehovah, and that those choosing to obey and serve God’s righteous government could have everlasting life and all attending blessings. Jehovah God is supreme, and his law is above the laws of man. His purposes cannot fail. He having given his word to do a thing, it is absolutely certain that in due time he will accomplish that thing, regardless of what men may do. Therefore he caused his prophet to write: “I have purposed it, [and] I will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) “So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth; it shall not return unto me void; but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” (Isaiah 55:11) It is therefore of paramount importance to the people that they learn what is the purpose of Jehovah God; and that purpose is set forth in the Scriptures now due to. be understood. Satan is the one who would keep the people in ignorance of that purpose. Now. the time has come when the people must have” opportunity to hear the truth, and then each one for himself must decide whether he wants to follow Satan and his agents and die, or whether he will obey Jehovah God and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY GOVERNMENTS FAILED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah God gave to man his Word, the Bible, for .man’s guidance. But men have failed to follow it. Satan, by employing fraud and deceit, has induced men to create and follow a system of formalism, falsely labeling it “divine worship” and religion, and the practice of such religion is indulged in by every government of “Christendom”. To those who would learn, and go in the right way, Jehovah has said: “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.” (Proverbs 3: 5, 6) Disregarding such divine injunction, men have organized governments and followed their own devices. Disaster has resulted. In the organization and conduct of governments men have chosen to honor man and not God, and for that reason many men have fallen easy victims to the subtle influence of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This point is particularly emphasized in the history of the Jews and their government. To that people God gave his law and outlined for them a perfect form of government; but instead of following Jehovah’s guidance, that people turned to their own selfish devices. Their priests and clergymen were commanded to teach to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">people the truth of God’s Word, but instead of doing so they created a form of worship and gave glory and adulation to men. It was the Devil who overreached them and induced them to take that course, and the Devil was able to do so by reason of the selfishness of men. That was a test put upon the Jews, and as a nation they failed, only a few men standing the test. Referring to this matter the Scriptures, at Romans one, state: “Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened: professing themselves to. be wise, they became fools. . . . Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is’blessed for ever. Amen.” (Verses 21, 22, 25) The Devil thus turned that people away from God, and their government was destroyed. The prophecies expressly show that the very forces that led the Jews into error and caused their downfall would likewise lead “Christendom” into error &quot;&nbsp;and cause her downfall and the destruction of all of her governments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Necessarily truth is controversial, because the truth exposes error. I do not choose to have controversy with any person or group of persons. But I ask you, Which is the most impor- ’' tant for the people: To tell the truth, which marks out the only way to life and happiness,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">or to hide the truth, and let the people ignorantly rush on to destruction? God commands that now his truth must he told in order that the people may have an opportunity to intelligently choose their own destiny. God has commanded those who teach the Bible to keep themselves unspotted from the political affairs of this world and to confine themselves to • the teaching of his Word. (James 1:27; 4:3,4) Exactly contrary to the Scriptural injunction, as everyone well knows, the clergy of all the religious organizations are today more or less indulging in the politics of the world and are failing to teach the people what is the Word of God. Each session of the Congress of the United States is opened with a formal prayer uttered by some clergyman; but is the Bible advice sought or used as a guide for those lawmakers? On the contrary, the laws of earthly governments are now invoked to prevent the people from hearing what is set forth in the Bible. Attention is called to these derelictions, not for the purpose of provoking controversy, but that the common people may see the importance of now turning to the Word of God and following its advice and not the advice of imperfect men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OPPOSITION &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why is there such great opposition to proclaiming to the people the truth as set forth in the Bible? The answer in brief is this: For centuries Satan has been the invisible ruler, or “god of this world” (2 Corinthians 4:3,4;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1 John 5:19), is violently opposed to the truth, and is striving to turn all men from the truth and against God, as he boasted he could do. Jehovah declared his purpose to give to the people a righteous ruler, who should destroy Satan and his power and lead honest people in the right way. To carry out his expressed purpose Jehovah sent Jesus to the earth, primarily to bear testimony to the truth, and, secondarily, . to shed his own lifeblood as the redemptive price for man, to the end that all men who will take their stand on the side of Christ and God might gain life everlasting. Satan sought to kill the man Jesus, and to that end Satan employed the priests and clergymen of that time and they put forth their efforts to kill him. Why did they take that course? Was it because Satan and his agents were afraid that Jesus would do them bodily harm? No, not for that reason, but because Jesus told them and the people the truth and Satan wished to prevent the people from knowing of God’s purpose to establish a righteous government in the earth and open to them the way to life. Satan blinded the clergymen and used them as his instruments to accomplish his wicked purpose. To those*, blinded clergymen Jesus said (John 8:40-44): ‘Ye seek to kill me because I have told you the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">truth, ... .Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do; he was a murderer and a liar from the beginning.’ When a council *of clergymen met to consider what they should do to Jesus to prevent him from teaching the truth to the people, it is written, the high priest presiding at that council used these words, to wit: “It is expedient . . . that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. . . . Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put [Jesus] to death.”—John 11:50-53.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Because Jesus was God’s appointed One to set up a righteous government on earth, and because he spoke the truth of Jehovah’s purpose, he suffered crucifixion at the hands of Satan and his earthly agents. (John 18:37; 19:18) But Jehovah then manifested his supreme power by raising Jesus from the dead and exalting him to the highest place in the universe, and God commands that in due time everything, that lives shall bow to Jesus and confess that he is the Lord and the-rightful Rider of the world, and this to the glory of God. —Philippians 2: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of all the doctrines of the Bible, that which is magnified as of greatest importance is the doctrine concerning the government of God under Christ, which shall rule the world in righteousness. Jesus repeatedly told his disciples of his coming government and that after his</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">resurrection he would come again and set up that government in his Father’s name. He admonished them to continuously praj for the coming of that government, that the will of God might be done on earth as in heaven and &lt;&nbsp;that the people might have a chance to live in peace and happiness. (John 14:1-3; Matthew 6: 9,10) From then till now every person who has honestly and sincerely advocated that coming government of righteousness has suffered persecution at the hand of Satan and his earthly agents; and that persecution has reached a climax since the year 1914, and the reason therefor is made plain in the Scriptures. Jehovah fixed a time during which Satan should ' have uninterrupted opportunity to prove his boastful challenge that he could turn all men away from God, and that fixed time ended officially in 1914, marking the end of the uninterrupted rule of Satan as the god of this world. It was then that Jehovah placed Christ Jesus upon his throne of authority and sent him forth to begin his rule. Immediately the-great issue became, Who shall rule the world? Shall Satan continue his misrule, or shall Jehovah’s righteous government be put in operation? All people must now choose to remain with Satan or to take their stand on Jehovah’s side. The question of supremacy and ruler ship now must be settled, and once and for all time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord Jesus referred to this very time ... when he commanded his true followers to proclaim to the peoples of the nations the truth concerning his government; and for telling the truth, in obedience to his commandment, he said, “ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matthew 24: 9) Not for the purpose of provoking a controversy, but in obedience to God’s commandment, and that you might know the truth, I must now recount to you the facts which show the fulfillment of these prophetic utterances of the Lord Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the World War a little company of men and women, who are wholly devoted to God and his government, have in obedience to the Lord’s commandment carried the message of truth concerning his kingdom to the people, and because they have done so they have been and are hated and persecuted in all nations of “Christendom”. As it was in the days of Jesus, so it is now with his faithful followers; therefore such persecution is induced and carried on chiefly by religionists, even as Jesus foretold it would be. (John 15:18-20) Such religious leaders exercise great influence in the political councils of the governments of this world; and that of itself is conclusive evidence that they are the enemies of God and his government, because it is so written in the Scriptures, at James 4:4. At every period of the world’s history the facts <sub>r</sub> show that it has been and is religionists that induce the political element to persecute those who proclaim the truth of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A powerful organization, which came into existence fifteen centuries ago, and which organization is foreign to America and has always opposed American institutions of freedom, and which has always been given to inquisition and persecution, operates under a religious name. It maintains its seat of government at Vatican City, Rome, and extends its selfish influence to every nation under the sun. It exercises today a tremendous influence in the political councils of America, both in the legislative halls and in the law-enforcement part of the government. The head of that foreign power issues an order that everywhere in the earth the work of Jehovah’s witnesses must be crushed, and at once a vigorous campaign is launched to accomplish that purpose in America and in the other nations of the earth. That same foreign power orders that Jehovah’s witnesses be denied the use of the radio facilities to broadcast the message of and concerning Jehovah’s government. Immediately a vicious campaign of slander, threats, boycott and other means of coercion is begun, and carried on in America, to thus deprive the people of an opportunity to hear the truth of God’s Word. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In proof of the influence exercised in America by that foreign power I cite this indisputable</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">fact, to wit: Millions,of American citizens petitioned the Congress of the United States to take action to prevent that foreign and sinister power from interfering with such proper use of the radio facilities, but, instead of giving heed to the petition of American citizens, the Congress has side-stepped the issue and failed to take any action whatever to safeguard the interests of the American people from this foreign foe. If the spirit that controlled and moved the statesmen of young America, leading those men to write the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, now moved and controlled the men of the present-day Congress, some man would rise on the floor of that lawmaking body and say to the agents of such foreign power: /‘Hands off, and cease interfering with the American people in the exercise of their constitutional and God-given rights to speak the truth and worship Almighty God as they see fit.” Freedom of speech is the God-given and an inalienable right of men, and no political body can properly and justly prevent the exercise thereof; and woe be unto the organization, political, religious or otherwise, that does attempt to prevent or prevents the free and uninterrupted service and worship of Almighty God. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That sinister and cruel influence is now being vigorously exercised in Italy, Austria, Germany, France, Japan, Canada and in America, and,</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">exercised against the witnesses of Jehovah prevent the people from hearing the truth and concerning the government of Jehovah God which is now at the door. Thousands, of men and women today are languishing in prisons because in obedience to God’s commandment. I have gone about amongst the people telling them of and concerning his righteous government. Imprisonment is not only inflicted upon such faithful men and women in Germany and in Canada, but the state of New Jersey,- the</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">constitution of which state guarantees freedom of worship, likewise indulges in the imprisoi ment of such men and women because of faithfulness to God and Christ Jesus. The life influence and power that moved men to cruelly crucify Jesus Christ now moves other selfish men to crush those who are carrying the message of God’s truth to the people, and the is the invisible power that fathers and pushes forward such wicked persecution. This he does because he is desperately fighting against Gbdtf kingdom of righteousness, which is the only hope of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">jfi</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">But Jehovah’s witnesses are in no wise discouraged by reason of such persecution. They know what will be the final outcome, because Jehovah has plainly stated in his Word what</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">are wholly devoted to God and to his government. Based upon the plain Word of Jehovah and his dealings with his enemies, I now say to you that no government can endure which by law or otherwise prevents the free proclamation of the message of and concerning Jehovah’s government of righteousness. A government that indulges in the persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses, or connives at or tacitly approves others in such persecution and oppression of the witnesses of Jehovah, can not and will not long endure. Jehovah has commanded his witnesses to proclaim his name and his kingdom, and to those who oppose he says: “Touch not mine anointed, and do my [witnesses] no harm.” (Psalm 105:15) All those who oppose God and his kingdom are his enemies, and all such he declares he will destroy. (Psalms 21: 8, 9; 145: 20) Since the days of ancient Egypt all the nations that have opposed God and persecuted his witnesses have fallen into the dust; and now there is stronger reason than ever that all the nations of “Christendom” shall be destroyed, because the day of Armageddon is at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ARMAGEDDON</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And what is Armageddon? The Scriptures answer it is the battle of the great day of God Almighty and at that battle no nation shall escape. (Revelation 16:13-16; Jeremiah 25: 29-35) Today all nations are feverishly preparing for war. In every nation there is a wasteful and^ extravagant expenditure of money to build war machines and to manufacture ammunition and other instruments of destruction. The selfish manufacturers of guns and ammunitions are now reaping a material harvest by the permission of their respective governments. But their day of prosperity soon will end. Their dreadful machines will accomplish nothing at Armageddon. Neither will material wealth nor political influence furnish any protection at Armageddon to those who are now the mighty and the strong. Armageddon will not be fought by America against Japan, nor by any other nations of “Christendom” fighting against each other. Who, then, will fight at the battle of Armageddon? The Scriptures answer that, as to the enemy of Jehovah God, Satan assembles all his host of wicked angels, and men, under the leadership of his field marshal Gog, to fight against the forces of righteousness. At Revelation twelve it is written that Satan knows that his time is short; and manifestly he knows that he cannot win the battle of Armageddon, but his purpose is to gather all the nations together and plunge them all into destruction that he might thus turn all mankind away from God and thus accomplish his boastful challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">—Revelation 16:13-16; 12:12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">BATTLE ARRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On the other side and against the enemy is Christ Jesus and all the forces of righteousness. Take now a mental view of the victorious army of Almighty God led by his Field Marshal, Christ. At Revelation nineteen he is shown as coming forth upon his righteous war mount, and there are recorded these words of description, to wit: ‘He is the Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes are as a flame of fire, and on his head many crowns. . . . His name is called the Word of God. . . . And his armies in heaven follow after him? His armies are composed of a host of holy and righteous angels that have always been faithful and true to Jehovah God. Christ Jesus is the world’s rightful Ruler and is the King of kings and Lord of lords. The time has come for his rule. Therefore God says to his beloved Son, as recorded in the 110th Psalm: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” Christ acts upon this command and first ousts Satan from heaven, and next he will destroy Satan’s wicked and oppressive rule of the entire world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Scriptures, together with the extraneous evidence, now conclusively prove that Jehovah’s kingdom has come and that Christ is enthroned with all power and authority; therefore, at Psalm two, Jehovah makes proclamation concerning his government under Christ in these words: T have installed my King on Zion. . . . I shall give thee the nations of the earth for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ That decree will be fully executed at the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At the 107th Psalm it is written that Jehovah gives the command and the great battle begins. My language is wholly inadequate to describe that battle. But I cite a few scriptures that will give you some idea of how the Lord Jesus, the world’s rightful Governor, shall dash Satan’s organization to pieces. Repeatedly Jehovah has • declared by his prophets that all mankind shall know that he is the Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah. (Psalm 83:18) The presentday governors or rulers of the earth, by reason of their wealth and influence and their armies and navies, and strong-arm squads, and their instruments of destruction, foolishly think that they are impregnably entrenched and that their power is unbreakable. But the demonstration of Jehovah’s power at Armageddon will be so great that all earthly rulers will come to know that they are merely pygmies and that all of them together are not so much as a drop of </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">bucket or as the small dust in the balance. (Isaiah 40:15) Jehovah declares that with tfie forward movement of his great army the nations of earth shall reel to and fro and stagger</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">like a drunken man and shall quickly reach their wits* end. (Psalm 107:27) His prophet Habak-kuk says of the Lord: ‘He . . . drove asunder the nations, and the everlasting mountains were scattered. . . . Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers, and the deeps lifted up their hands on high.’ (Habakkuk 3: 6, 9,10) The &quot;wiseacres” of this world will say that such a thing would be impossible; but the Biblical record of the great deluge that swept the entire earth should teach them better. The power of Jehovah is unlimited. In times past God has done like things literally, and at Armageddon he will again do them, both literally and symbolically, and on a far greater scale than ever before. The things which Jehovah caused to be recorded in connection with the nation of Israel and other nations opposing Israel are pictures or types of what shall come to pass shortly upon &quot;Christendom”.—! Corinthians 10:11; Hebrews 10:1; Isaiah 28: 21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Jehovah was about to deliver his peo-pie from Egypt • he brought great darkness upon the Egyptians that they might see nothing, while at the same time he gave the Israelites light. (Exodus 10: 21-23) At the battle of Sisera the rivers swept away great multitudes. (Judges 5:20,21) At the battle of Armageddon, the Scriptures show, the earth will literally be split and out of these open places shall flow floods of water, and shall sweep away multitudes of the enemy. Also tidal waves of the sea shall overflow the land, resulting in indescribable destruction. When Joshua led the armies of Jehovah’s chosen people against his enemies God made the sun and the moon to stand still and caused great chunks of ice to fall down from the skies, killing multitudes.—Joshua 10: 10-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Says Habakkuk concerning Armageddon: ‘The sun and the moon shall stand still,’ and that the only light at that time shall be the flashings of the fiery ‘arrows and spears of the Lord’ flying on their mission of destruction. Concerning this same battle Jehovah’s prophet Isaiah records: “Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven, and the constellations thereof, shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to 'cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.”—Isaiah 13:9-11; see Joel 3:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Imagine, if you can, the terrors that shall take hold of the earthly division of Satan’s forces, enfolded in thick darkness, neither the sun, moon nor stars giving the slightest ray of light; the mountains sinking; the earth split-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ting and quaking;.newly-made rivers rushing violently forth, and the seas lashing the mountains, and tidal waves sweeping over the land; with all the wild beasts of all the zoos on earth and of the forests loose and charging upon the enemy’s army, while the fiery darts and spears of the angels of heaven fly through the air, killing millions. The terror that will seize all men on earth is indescribable. Then steel helmets and gas masks will furnish no protection. Men have thought that the armies of the world are invulnerable, but they will find that these are mere weaklings. And what will the armies of the earth then do? The Lord answers by his record made concerning Gideon’s battle, and recorded in the seventh and eighth chapters of Judges. These earthly armies, frightened out of their wits and in thick darkness, will fight amongst themselves and destroy each other. Here are appropriate the words of Zechariah, to wit: “And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the Lord shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.” —Zechariah 14:13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The surviving forces of Satan’s earthly army will then attempt to destroy those who have taken their stand on the side of God’s government, and the Lord will smite them with his plague, concerning which he says: ‘And this shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite all the people that have made war against his organization: Their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongues shall consume away in their mouth.’ (Zechariah 14:12) That will convince them that Jehovah is fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For long centuries Jehovah has held his peace and permitted the enemy to reproach his name and to oppress his faithful witnesses, but the time is at hand when the Lord declares that he will take the offensive. Now the faithful followers of Christ Jesus meekly bear the reproach of Satan’s earthly representatives; but for their encouragement Jehovah says to them, by his prophet Zephaniah: “Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.” (Zephaniah 3:8) In times past great trouble has come upon the earth, but concerning Armageddon Jesus says: ‘It shall be great tribulation such as the world has never known.’-Matthew 24: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Why is the battle of Armageddon necessary? In brief the answer from the Scriptures is: The earth belongs to Jehovah; he made it for man to live upon provided man would be obedient and do what is right; Satan boasted he could turn all men away from God, and has been permitted to try it. Satan’s time is now up. Jehovah has given his word that he will set up a righteous government, make his beloved Son Christ Jesus the Redeemer and Savior of men, and the Ruler of the world. God’s Government is here. The enemy Satan refuses to get out, but boastfully arrays himself against God and his Christ; therefore Satan and his organization must be destroyed; and this destruction' God will bring about by and through earth’s rightful Governor. Satan and his agents now boast that the earth belongs to them and that they rule it as they please. Like Pharaoh of old they say: “Who is Jehovah, that I should obey him?” Now Jehovah will show his power to all creation and vindicate his name and open the way for men to live.—Exodus 5:1-4; 6:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Men have organized governments and carried them on. They have failed and refused to obey Jehovah’s Word, but have yielded to the wicked influence of Satan subtly exercised through his religious agents, and the result has been and is that every nation and government has been controlled by a selfish and corrupt class of men. Such governments and their leaders have sought to carry on everything contrary to Jehovah’s law. Their end has come; therefore Jehovah says to them through his prophet: ‘The earth is defiled under the rulers [inhabitants thereof], because they have transgressed his laws, changed the ordinances, and broken the everlasting covenant’; therefore the governments of the world shall be destroyed. (Isaiah 24:3-6) The governments of this world have transgressed God’s law, particularly in this: Jehovah says, “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,” and honor his name by giving testimony before men of and concerning his 'name and his kingdom. Worldly lawmakers say, “You cannot do this unless you have a permit from our officers. You must do it the way we direct.” They set their law above God’s law. They have changed God’s ordinances in this: God commands all men to tell the truth of his Word; but the governments of this world, and particularly the foreign power operating under a religious name and which exercises so much influence, says: “You cannot tell the truth, be- <sub>x </sub>cause, if you do, it will shock the religious susceptibilities of our people.” The everlasting covenant of Jehovah declares the sanctity of life and says: “Thou shalt not kill.” Every nation on earth has broken that everlasting covenant by needlessly and unrighteously shedding blood. God alone can give life, because he is the source of life, and he alone possesses the right to say when and how life shall be taken, and he who kills contrary to God’s law breaks the everlasting covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When shall Armageddon be fought? At the present time all governments of this world are talking peace and making peace treaties and forming leagues to conserve the peace, while at the same time all are preparing for war. You may expect in the very near future to hear the leading governing powers of this world say in substance: ‘Now we have brought about peace on earth, and henceforth we shall be safe from wars and troubles.’ To this the Scriptures answer, at 1 Thessalonians 5:3: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Since the World War the League of Nations has been set up by “Christendom” in the place and stead of God’s government under Christ. The religionists of the world hail that League as the light of the world, which statement is an insult to Jehovah. The League of Nations is the desolating abomination spoken of by Daniel the prophet. (Daniel 12:11) Concerning it Jesus said that its coming into view would be an evidence that Armageddon is just ahead. His words are (Matthew 24:15,16, 21): “When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, . . . then . . . flee into the mountains [God’s Government]; for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS GOVERNMENT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah long ago gave his word that he would set up a righteous government that shall rule and bless all the nations that will obey. Armageddon will clear the way for the uninterrupted operation of that glorious government. Soon all the selfish governments of this world. shall perish. Monarchies, democracies, aristocracies, fascism, communism and Nazis, and all suchlike efforts to rule, shall pass away at Armageddon and will soon be forgotten. Those abortive attempts at government will not be remembered by the people, because they will have good things to think about. God’s government of righteousness under Christ shall have full sway and shall be justly administered and bring boundless blessings to all who do right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ . Jesus is the beloved Son of Jehovah God. Nineteen centuries ago Jehovah sent Jesus to the earth to tell the truth concerning his name and his government. The man Jesus was put to death, and Jehovah caused his death to . operate as the redemptive price for all men who believe on and serve him and who worship God in spirit and in truth. Christ Jesus is the seed</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">of promise through which the world must be blessed. (Galatians 3:16-29) Now Christ Jesus, the glorified Lord, has come to vindicate his Father’s name and to rule the world in righteousness and to administer blessings to the people. Jehovah by the mouth of his prophet says concerning Jesus Christ (Isaiah 9: 6,7): “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He shall be called “Wonderful Counsellor” because his counsel will always be wise, perfect and infallible, and those who follow it shall never die. (John 8:51) He is called “The mighty God” because into his hand is committed all power in heaven and in earth and all creation is commanded to serve and obey him. (Matthew 28:18; John 5: 22-27; Revelation 19: 16) He is called “Everlasting Father” because -he is the Life-giver to man by the commandment of Jehovah God and there is no other way to obtain life. (Romans 6:23; Acts 4:12) He is called “The Prince of Peace” because under his righteous government there shall never be another war. (Matthew 24:21) Soon all the people who survive Armageddon and live shall know that peace has come to stay for ever; concerning which it is written (Isaiah 2:4): “They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PEACE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The peoples of earth desire peace, and not war, and for this reason the League of Nations, to many, has been like a straw held out to a drowning man. Jehovah has expressly declared that the League of Nations is a fraud and a snare and shall be completely destroyed. (Isaiah 8:9,10) Selfish men ruling the nations in a selfish manner can never bring peace to the people. Everlasting peace can come ouly by and through the government of Jehovah under Christ. Concerning that blessed peace, which shall proceed from the government of the Lord, it is written (Psalm 72:4,7): “He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon en-dureth.” Every man who tries to do right, but who because of inherent weakness needs mercy, to him the Lord will extend mercy. Under his righteous government no one shall be permitted to deceive or mislead others, but, always, the truth shall be spoken; Then in the language of God’s prophet the people will sing (Psalm 85:10-12): “Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">PROSPERITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Neither the NBA nor any other man-made scheme can bring lasting prosperity to the people. Prosperity cannot be brought about by the employment of Unjust and unrighteous methods. God’s commandment is that every man shall love his neighbor; which means that he must deal honestly and justly with his fellow man. Work is a blessing to man, because God has so declared. When all men work and receive the just fruits of their labor they shall all be prosperous. Under the government of the Lord, says the prophet, the people “shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble”. (Isaiah 65: 23) Furthermore, under the rule of the righteous Governor of the earth the land shall be free from pests that destroy the crops and shall produce abundantly and plentifully and for all, as it is written: “Then shall the earth yield her increase.” (Psalm 67: 6) Says Jehovah’s Word: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.” (Proverbs 29:2) God’s government will be wholly righteous, and under his government “shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined”.—Isaiah 25:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All sane persons desire life everlasting. With all the boasted power and strength of the present-day governments and the various organizations on earth, with all the braggadocio and boast of the Devil and his agents, none of them can give life to any creature. Life is the gift of God through Jesus Christ our Lord, and there is no other way to get life. (Romans 6:23; Acts 4:12) It is written (John 17:3): “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” It is Satan who has lied to man and fraudulently induced men to believe that all men shall live for ever. When the terrible battle of Armageddon is raging, then many who have been deceived will come to know that Satan is the great liar and that Jehovah alone can give life. Those who survive Armageddon will be the ones who now hear the message of truth and give heed thereto and who seek meekness and righteousness, and to such Jehovah promises that they may be hid in that time of distress and woe. (Zephaniah 2:2,3) Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, gave his life as the redemptive price for as many as believe and serve him. (Matthew 20:28; John 10:10; Hebrews 2:9)) Under his government the people will be granted full opportunity to obey and live. Furthermore, those who have died and now sleep in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">grave shall be resurrected and given an opportunity to obey and live. Jesus uttered these words: ‘All that are in their graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth.’—John 5: 25-30, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These are, some of the blessings that shall come to the people under the government of Jehovah. It is concerning the destruction of the oppressive rule of Satan and the gracious and righteous government of Christ Jesus and the blessings to the people thereunder that Jehovah’s witnesses are now commanded to go and tell to the people. It is because they are telling these great and wonderful truths that Jehovah's witnesses stand accused before the courts of the various governments. It is for bringing this message of consolation to the people that many of Jehovah’s witnesses today languish behind prison bars. Because Jehovah’s witnesses are carrying this message of cheer and comfort to sin-sick and oppressed and suffering humanity the clergy stand in their synagogues and denounce them and falsely accuse them of being breakers of the law and secretly induce the strong-arm squad to hale these servants of God into the courts. But let those faithful witnesses today remember the words of Jesus concerning this very matter, to wit (Mark 13:9): “They shall deliver you up to councils [courts]; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">sake, for a testimony against them.” At Armageddon the Lord will remember the indignities now being cast upon his name and upon his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Attention of the public is called to these things not for the purpose of holding up men to ridicule, because ridicule of a man would accomplish no good. Attention is called to these things that the people may see that Satan the enemy of God is man’s worst enemy and oppressor and that those religionists who lead in the persecution of faithful witnesses of Jehovah do not represent God but in fact represent the Devil. When honest jDatholics, honest Protestants, honest Jews, and honest infidels see these things, they, will break away from the oppressive power of Satan and his agents and take their stand wholly on the side of God and his government of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If the proclamation of these great and satisfying truths does &quot;shock the religious susceptibilities of some”, then that is their misfortune. These heart-cheering truths must now be told to the people because the Lord has commanded it shall be done. To those who are Jehovah’s witnesses the Lord says: &quot;Every one who does not obey the commandments of the Lord shall be destroyed.’ (Acts 3:22,23) Jehovah’s witnesses have no alternative. They must and will obey God and not man. Nor will they ask any man or body of men for </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">permission</span><span class="font8"> to do what</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah has </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">commanded</span><span class="font8"> they must do. Prison houses, and even death, hold no terrors to those ' who love and obey Jehovah now. Concerning this very time and these very conditions Jesus spoke to his followers these words (Matthew 10: 27,28): ‘Fear them not, therefore; what I tell you, that preach from the housetops.’—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">You who are anointed of the Lord know that you are in a covenant with Christ Jesus to die with him. Some of you may be killed because of your faithfulness unto the Lord in giving testimony of and concerning his government; and if so, upon the heads of those who cause your death shall your blood be. Remember the words of Jesus to you: “Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.” (Revelation 2:10, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">R.V.)</span><span class="font8"> This is the most blessed time yet when men have been on earth, and it is now the blessed privilege of all persons of good will who hear the message of God’s government to take up that glad song and pass it ' on to others. You who are “Jonadabs”, therefore, continue to grow in a knowledge of the truth and tell it to others, and, doing so, you shall receive the boundless blessings of Jehovah’s government.—2 Kings 10:15-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VISIBLE RULERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ Jesus is the world’s rightful Ruler and is invisible to human eyes. Who, then, shall <sub>x</sub>be the visible governors? No man who is now con-neeted with the present-day earthly governments will have any part therein, whether that man be in the political, commercial or religious element. Concerning Jehovah’s government under Christ it is written (Isaiah 32:1): “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” The King here mentioned is Christ Jesus, and the princes are the faithful men of old who proved their integrity unto God. (Psalm 45:16) The names of some of these men are set forth in the Bible at Hebrews, the eleventh chapter. Those were men of faith and faithful devotion to God. They told the truth, and Satan caused them to be cruelly and wickedly persecuted therefor. The Lord will . reward their faithfulness by making them the visible rulers on earth. Concerning them it is written (Hebrews 11:33, 34, 36-38): “Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens, ... and others ‘ had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover, of bonds and imprisonment; they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented: (of whom the world was not worthy).” These men are set before Jehovah’s witnesses as ensamples of faithfulness. God caused to be recorded that the world was not worthy of those men; and in the days to come it shall be said of the faithful witnesses of Jehovah, who now boldly declare the truth, “The world was not worthy of them.” Blessed are they that suffer reproach and indignities because of faithful devotion to Jehovah God, because Jesus likewise suffered, and it is written, at 2 Timothy 2:11,12: “For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: if we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let all people of good will now on earth hear and understand that the message of and concerning God’s government under Christ is brought to you as a gracious favor from the Lord. It is not man’s message, but the message of Almighty God. Whether you hear or refuse to hear brings no profit to those who declare that message. Jehovah has laid upon his witnesses the responsibility of speaking to others of and concerning his government. When you hear the truth, the responsibility is then upon you to choose whom you will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Present-day governments are controlled by Satan and are unsatisfactory, and can never bring blessings to mankind. The government of Jehovah under Christ will lift all burdens from the people and offer to you life and endless blessings. You must choose to remain with Satan’s organization and die or serve Jehovah and his government and live. All the nations of “Christendom” are sentenced to death, and God’s angel of destruction is at the gate to execute them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Germany has openly declared for the Devil and against God and Christ Jesus. Will the people of America and the other nations follow Germany’s lead or will they serve Jehovah and his Government under Christ? Choose this day whom you will serve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[At the conclusion of the address the following resolution was proposed and unanimously adopted:]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolved, that we the people desire a righteous government of equal justice to all and that which will bring to us peace, prosperity and life in happiness; and we so declare ourselves by publicly taking our stand on the side of Jehovah God and his Government under Christ Jesus our Redeemer and Lord, to whom our allegiance is joyfully given and in whom we implicitly trust.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark3"></a>HIDING THE TRUTH</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">(Broadcast over radio chain by Judge Rutherford)</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">T</span><span class="font0">HERE is a conspiracy well organized and carried forward to hide the truth and to prevent the honest people of the world from gaining a knowledge thereof. This is of such great importance now that every person who desires to do right should know about this conspiracy. Some evidence of the conspiracy is here submitted and should be carefully considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Devout men and women who are diligent in their efforts to advertise the kingdom of Jehovah God under Christ arranged for a convention at Washington, D.C., the dates being May 30 to June 3, 1935. One of the outstanding events of that convention was a speech on the subject “Government”. Arrangements were made to broadcast that speech by radio. More than a hundred independent radio stations in the United States were engaged. By the co-operation of the Bell Telephone system and the R.C.A. the speech was transmitted to all parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Iceland, Scandinavian countries, Belgium, France, Switzerland, and also to Africa, Australia, China, the Philippines and other islands of the sea. Space was engaged in various newspapers in Great Britain to make announcement of the lecture, but at the last moment those papers refused to take the advertisement under any condition. The British Broadcasting Company refused to take the program. But telephone wires were used, and the speech was transmitted</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">43 </span><span class="font0">mitted by this means to many halls throughout England and other places where the people were assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The speech was delivered at Washington, D.C., to a visible audience of more than twenty thousand persons and was simultaneously broadcast; and, from reports that immediately followed, millions of others heard. The speech was carried to and heard in almost all parts of the earth. Never before in the history of man had there been the like transmission of the human voice by means of these God-given devices of telephone, telegraph and radio. That fact was real news of great interest to the people, but the newspapers said not one word about it. The newspapers claim to publish the news, but this news of great interest to the people was ignored. Why ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two of the leading papers of Washington, namely, the Washington </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font0"> and the Washington </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font0"> agreed for hire to publish the full text of the speech “Government”. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font0"> charged $887.00, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Star </span><span class="font0">$1,371.51, to publish the same. The full amount was paid to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font0"> and a receipt given for the same. Both papers, after having carefully read the speech, agreed to publish it and proceeded to put the same in type, and it was ready to go to press when suddenly some powerful influence was brought to bear causing both of those newspapers to repudiate their contracts and refuse publication of the speech unless they would be permitted to delete or strike out all that part of the speech referring to A FOREIGN POWER THAT WORKS AGAINST THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE* The Roman Catholic hierarchy exerted the necessary influence to prevent the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">* See pages 18-21,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">publication of the speech, and thus attempted to hide the truth from the people. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font0"> magazine, in its issue of June 19, 1935, published an account of this repudiation of contracts, as well as the speech, and the following is quoted from that magazine:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHO RULES AMERICA?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are you in favor of America being ruled by her own people? Or shall the nation be ruled by the FOREIGN POWER . from Vatican City, Rome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star</span><span class="font5"> and the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> choose the side of ROME.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Every American should carefully read Judge Rutherford’s speech “Government” and then say whether or not American newspapers are justified in suppressing any part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Which side will the FCC and Congress support?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH’S witnesses had been in convention at Washington, D.C., for five days; a convention that is of world-wide interest, 20,000 or more of those devoted men and women were present; two of Washington's leading newspapers, the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> and the Washington </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font5"> had contracted in writing for a money consideration to print the entire speech of Judge Rutherford, which was broadcast to the ends of the earth on Sunday, June 2; the convention waited for hours to receive a copy of those papers before returning to their homes; at the last moment both of the above newspapers, yielding to some sinister influence, repudiated their contracts to publish the speech; Judge Rutherford immediately went before the convention and delivered an address that will long survive in the memories of those who heard it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Immediately following that address the editor of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Age</span><span class="font5"> magazine approached Judge Rutherford and propounded these questions: “Why is the Roman Catholic hierarchy so deeply concerned about keeping the people in ignorance of the Bible, and particularly in ignorance of the hierarchy’s crooked work? In this connection would you care to express an opinion as to the present religio-political situation in America?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He replied: “You will recall, probably, that more than two years ago in a public speech broadcast by radio I submitted proof that there was a movement on to have a dictator in America. Well, everybody can see that now, if they want to see anything. And soon they will see that it is the Jesuit organization of the Roman Catholic hierarchy that is behind that movement to rob the American people of all their rights. The Catholic hierarchy is stealthily moving forward to grab control of the United States government, and for that reason is pursuing the policy that all such unrighteous organizations pursue: to keep the people blind to the truth until it is too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Every Catholic paper in the United States has boasted that the NBA program originated with the pope and that Mr. Roosevelt adopted it at the instance of the pope. Many other newspapers have quoted these boasts of the Catholic organization. The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States recently practically annihilated the NBA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ The president gave an interview to the public press shortly thereafter and, piqued by the decision of the Court, he was unable to restrain his anger and clearly let it be known that he had repudiated the Jeffersonian principles of the Democratic party that put him in office and now stands for centralization of power, dictatorship and against States’ rights. A movement is now being pushed at Washington to amend the Constitution of the United States, giving the federal government most of the power that the States now have, and thus further throttle the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Many of the official family of the president are Roman Catholics and are agents of the Roman Catholic hierarchy. If the people should now be informed that the Roman Catholic hierarchy is trying to not only control their religious thoughts and convictions but at the same time deprive them of their liberty of speech, and thought, that Would greatly hinder the efforts of the Roman Catholic hierarchy to get control of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“From these facts does it not look as if Mr. Roosevelt and the Roman Catholic hierarchy have some definite understanding? This reminds me of the memorable proverb carved by James, G. Blaine, referring to the Democratic party and the Roman Catholic hierarchy, to wit: ‘Rum, Romanism and Rebellion.’ That might be amended now by saying: Rum, Romanism and Dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">-“These circumstances appear to be very persuasive evidence that the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its American agents are desperately attempting to grab the job of dictator before the people know what is happening. Mr. Roosevelt seems to be the first candidate for that position. May I suggest that since his recent utterance about the Supreme Court’s decision and the States’ rights, and his close affiliation with the Roman Catholic hierarchy becoming well known, the toboggan slide has been drawn up before the White House. It might be interesting to watch it start down the incline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">‘ ‘ I am not interested in polities, but I am sure there are millions of loyal American citizens who love the principles of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution and many of them will be asking: ‘Shall America be ruled* by the _ people, or by a few selfish men in the interest of an entrenched and foreign power, which is inimical to the liberties that the American people have long enjoyed?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“How does it happen that practically all the postmasters that are appointed are agents of the Roman Catholic hierarchy? Why is it that members of Congress are so anxious to have the approval of the ‘distinguished’ postmaster general before they act? The more you uncover this thing, the higher the stench arises, and every honest man will cry out: ‘Shall we be governed by our own people, or shall we be governed by an Italian who lives in Rome?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE PRESS OF THE CAPITAL CITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. The press of Washington, as of all other great cities of the United States and of “Christendom”, is in the hands of Big Business. It is operated not at all in the interest of the people, but wholly for predatory interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fear to displease the Roman Catholic hierarchy has whipped the press into complete subjugation to a handful of priests, and priest and press hide behind the slogan: “We love peace and will print nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It requires the help of Jehovah God to see the two organizations, His own and that of the Devil. Jesus saw them plainly, and took his stand wholly on the side of Jehovah. He could honestly say of Jehovah God, “I do always those things that please him”; and Jesus could also honestly say, “The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah God created man, originally, with a desire to be truthful and to do right, and this desire persists in the hearts -of many. Such are astonished when they first discern that ‘the god of this world is a liar, and the father of it’, and that ‘the whole world lieth in the wicked one’ and are ‘taken captive by him at his will’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There was a time when the American press was somewhat interested in news. That time has passed. The desire of the press for money has overwhelmed its judgment. “The love of money is the root of all evil.” The press has determined that henceforth Jehovah’s witnesses shall see its face no more; that is, shall be denied a just and fair place in any news report, even when, as at Washington, they occupy the center of the stage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two great corporations, created and financed by Big Business, control most of the radio facilities in America. Those two giant corporations have created <sup>1 </sup>what they call “the church of the air”, which is made up of Catholic, Protestant and Jewish clergymen. Those radio corporations refuse the use of their radio facilities to all who teach the truth of the Bible, and permit only clergymen of the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish persuasion to say anything about religion, and this with the expressed understanding that no one will mention anything controversial. As an excuse for their action in refusing use of their radio facilities to Jehovah’s witnesses to broadcast the truth of the Bible they say, “We broadcast nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Radio station WMCA of New York contracted to broadcast the Washington speech on “Government”. When the speaker reached the point where he mentioned the ‘foreign power that maintains its headquarters at Vatican City, Rome’, that radio station immediately cut off the program and announced to its audience: “Our policy is to broadcast nothing that is controversial.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSPIRACY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A conspiracy is an agreement or understanding between two or more parties to accomplish some wrongful purpose. An agreement to hide the truth from the people, which truth is important to the people, is a conspiracy to accomplish a wrongful purpose. Circumstantial evidence is the best evidence to prove a conspiracy. Where the parties charged with a conspiracy use identically the same language or language of similar import in giving answer to their reason for taking a specific action, sueh is very strong and persuasive evidence that all of such parties are in the conspiracy. Note that all of the parties above mentioned use the same words, to wit: “We publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman Catholic hierarchy claims the exclusive, right to interpret the Scriptures, even forbidding their parishioners to express their own independent views or to read the expression of anyone differing from the hierarchy. The Roman Catholic hierarchy vigorously opposes the speaking or the broadcasting of anything about the Scriptures contrary to its own views, and as an excuse for so doing says: “Speech contrary to our views shocks our religious susceptibilities and causes controversies; therefore nothing controversial should be broadcast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The big radio corporations above mentioned control the NBC and the Columbia System, and they say: “We broadcast nothing that is controversial; hence only Catholics, Protestants and Jewish clergymen can use our radio facilities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The radio station that cut off the Washington program assigned as a reason, “We broadcast nothing that is controversial.” The newspapers, although</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">claiming to publish what is of public interest, say: “We will not even publish a paid advertisement that is controversial, for hire, and hence we will repudiate our contracts.” Says the Washington </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Star,</span><span class="font0"> after having received $1,371.51 and after having set the speech in type and being ready to go to press: “We regret that advertising containing controversial matter is not acceptable, and we are, therefore, returning your check.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All of the aforementioned persons and corporations vigorously oppose the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in telling the truth about the Bible, and the excuse of each and every one is that the truth is controversial. This evidence conclusively shows that all such are in a conspiracy to hide the truth from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTROVERSIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What is a controversy or controversial matter? The definition universally given by lexicographers and universally accepted is this: “That which relates to debates or disputations; the expression of different views or opinions; a discussion of questions of importance which call forth different expressions of opinions or views. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All lawsuits are controversial. One man claims something, and the other party makes an opposite claim, and each one gives expression to his views by submitting his testimony, and the court hears the evidence in order to ascertain what is the truth or right of the matter. If all controversial matters are to be rejected and that rule is followed, then there could be, no way in the courts of ascertaining the truth. It at once appears that the claim of the corporations, radio stations, papers and persons aforementioned about</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">controversial matter is a subterfuge to hide their real purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One political party is in power and is misleading the people and exercising official power and authority against the general welfare of the people. If nothing controversial can be published or broadcast by radio, then those people who are against the wrongdoers and who wish to be informed and to inform others could never be heard to open their mouths or publish a word of protest against the wrongdoers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An organization is formed and operated, the real purpose of which is to get control of the governments of the earth. That organization is operated and carries bn under a religious name, claiming to use the Bible as its authority. That organization, in order to keep the people in subjection and blind to its real purpose, misapplies the Scriptures to keep the people in fear and dread while it constantly and stealthily moves forward to get complete control of the governments. If no one is permitted to publish or speak or broadcast the truth as set forth in the Bible, because such is controversial and “shocks the religious susceptibilities” of wrongdoers and exposes their wrong, that would mean that the people would be kept in ignorance and not even permitted to protest against those who are robbing them of their just rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the forefathers who came to this country, had been denied the opportunity to speak of matters controversial, the American nation would never have come into existence. The Declaration of Independence is controversial, because it declares against wrong and for the rights of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Bible is controversial, because it specifically states what matters are wrong and points out to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">people the way that is right. The truth is always in controversy with falsehood, and the truth will never be uttered without raising a controversy with lies. Do you wish to support anyone who forbids the speaking or broadcasting of the truth because it is controversial ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A criminal kidnaps a child and informs the parents that unless they pay the ransom money the child will perish. The papers publish the details of the crime. Surely such publication is controversial, because it exposes the criminal and his dastardly deed. For centuries the Roman Catholic hierarchy has practiced upon the people the most gigantic fraud, in this: they teach the parents and the widows that their beloved ones that have died are suffering in “purgatory” and can be relieved only by the prayers of a priest and that they must pay money to the priest for such prayers. In this way they obtain a large amount of money. The priests pray in form only, and the people pay and get nothing, for the reason that their dead are not in “purgatory”. The Scriptures declare the dead are in their graves and know not anything. Witnesses for Jehovah try to tell the Bible truths to the people about “purgatory” and the state of the dead. The Roman Catholic hierarchy says: “You cannot tell or broadcast that stuff, because it is controversial and shocks our religious susceptibilities.” The public press, the big radio chain corporations, the lawmakers and lawenforcers, co-operate with those gigantic, fraudulent obtainers of money, and therefore all such are parties to the crime. Do you see why they want to hide the truth from the people?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Honest persons never object to their views’ being fully discussed and considered. Those who know that they are doing wrong and attempting to grab what does not belong to them always oppose anything and everything that might enlighten the people and expose the wrongdoers. That slogan, “We will publish nothing that is controversial,” is a subterfuge and a flagrant fraud practiced upon honest persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But newspapers do publish controversial matter when Jehovah’s witnesses can be libeled by them. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic News</span><span class="font0"> of June 15, 1935, under an editorial headed “Another Silly Season”, publishes the following, much of which is untrue:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Judge Rutherford’s cohorts are in the news once more. We learn from Washington that members of his strange cult, styled by its leaders ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’, made a visitation to the Nation’s Capital over a recent week-end. . . . Judge Joseph F. Rutherford, chief ‘Witness’, delivered an address at the rally which was broadcast by radio. Subsequently, Anton Koerber, who identified himself as director of the convention, revealed that two of Washington’s leading secular newspapers had refused to publish the full text of the Rutherford address, and charged the papers with repudiating contracts. The address contained attacks on the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■_ “But ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’ usually make themselves so ridiculous that after one or two publicity splurges by meetings and radio they retire into obscurity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roman Catholic newspapers in the United States constantly charge that the Mexican government is persecuting Roman Catholics in that land. But the Mexican government replies that it is doing nothing of the kind and that it is only trying to protect its citizens. The Catholic newspapers say nothing about the dastardly deeds committed in Mexico by Catholic priests for the purpose of keeping the truth from the people. In the latter part of May, 1935, Mr. and Mrs. Carlos V. Calderon, two Mexican native citizens, husband and wife, were going from house to house in the State of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hidalgo telling the poor and priest-ridden people of God’s gracious provision to bless them under the kingdom of Christ, which is the only hope of suffering humanity. They were doing so in obedience to Jehovah’s commandment as his witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They were foully murdered, and a Catholic priest is the one. guilty of the shocking crime. Those two harmless persons were shot, and their bodies thrown into the road, because they were carrying the truth to the people. Roman Catholics stopped their work with the use of gunpowder and leaden balls. That is one way of hiding the truth from the people. Further information about this matter may be had by addressing the Mexican Embassy at Washington, D.C. Doubtless the newspapers would refuse to publish the facts about this foul murder of two of Jehovah’s witnesses by a Catholic priest because, as they say: “This is controversial, and we publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSPIRATORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Who are the conspirators that seek to hide the truth from the people? The chief conspirator invisible to man is Satan the Devil. He is the father of lies and prefers always to tell a lie rather than the truth, and likewise do his agents. (John 8:44) The chief visible conspirator on earth that hides the truth from the people is that organization known as the Roman Catholic hierarchy. That organization is now aided, abetted and supported by dishonest Protestant and Jewish clergymen. All of these falsely claim to represent God and Christ. They have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof. (2 Timothy 3:5) They hypocritically hide from the people their real purpose and aet together to hide the truth from everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are millions oft honest Catholics, Protestants and Jews who are not in the conspiracy and who would not approve it if they knew it, but who at the same time are made blind by the wrongful influence exercised by the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its associates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the time of its organization, in the fourth century, till now the policy of the Roman Catholic hierarchy has been and is to keep the people in ignorance of the truth. Centuries ago it promulgated the false teaching of “purgatory”, “inherent immortality,” “eternal torment,” “apostolic succession,” and other doctrines, and punished all persons who would not accept such false teaching. The Roman Catholic hierarchy for years carried on a wicked inquisition in Spain and in Mexico and other countries, torturing millions who refused to bow to their false teachings. They hid the Bible from the people and prevented them from reading it. That wicked organization controlled and ruled from Rome for many years, and literally robbed the illiterate persons of Mexico, took away from that people millions of dollars, and continued its wrongful work until its power was broken by the Mexican government. That same Roman Catholic hierarchy now misrepresents Mexico to the whole world and likewise slanders and misrepresents other nations and peoples that oppose its wicked work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman Catholic hierarchy is the only organization under the sun that operates under a religious name while at the same time it sends its political ambassadors to the official courts of other political nations of the earth. It exercises more political influence than any other organization on earth. It bitterly ’persecutes everyone who dares to tell the truth about it and its nefarious work. It is the chief organization on earth that hides from the people the truth of and concerning the Word of God and his kingdom under Christ. It bitterly opposes all witnesses of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman Catholic hierarchy organizes political agitators into parties, such as the communists, and finances and encourages and pushes such organizations forward, and then uses such agitators as an excuse to organize another political party upon the pretext of saving the government, and then the latter party grabs the government away from the people. That is exactly what has been done recently in Germany. Both the communists and the Nazis were organized by the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and one played against the other to deceive the people and to. furnish an excuse for seizing the power to rule Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now, in order to blind the people to their real purpose, they send a nun to prison and cause wide publication of the same to be made in the newspapers. But note that the woman was not sent to prison because she told the truth,, but because she carried money out of Germany. At the same time more than 1,200 of Jehovah’s witnesses are imprisoned in Germany because they met together and studied the Bible, and celebrated the Memorial of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman Catholic hierarchy is in the saddle in Quebec, and there they imprison men and women on the charge of “sedition” because such men and women distributed books containing the message of God’s Word of truth. This is done to hide the truth from the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;«</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In northern New Jersey the Roman Catholic hierarchy controls the political offices, and within the past few years more than a thousand of Jehovah’s witnesses Have been imprisoned because they carried the message of truth of God’s Word to the people. Another effort to hide the truth from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The endeavor of the Roman Catholic hierarchy now is to gain control of the United States government, and its purpose is to keep the people in ignorance of what it is trying to do, and hence it uses its power to prevent the speaking or publishing of anything that is “controversial” or might expose that wicked organization. It is diligent to hide the truth from the people of and concerning the righteous government of Jehovah under Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why does the Roman Catholic hierarchy try to hide the truth from the people ? And what is the distinction between the hierarchy and the Catholics? The Roman Catholic hierarchy is composed of a body of men, which body of men constitute a form of government, and exercises authority over others, and particularly over those who are either directly or indirectly connected with the Catholic church. The seat of government of that organization is at Vatican City, Rome. All the common people who are associated with that organization, and generally known as “Catholics”, are not members of the hierarchy or of the Catholic church, but are designated by the hierarchy as “children of the church”, and these children are not supposed to have sufficient sense to attend to their own business or hear what they want to hear. Millions of persons have been induced to believe that the Roman Catholic hierarchy is a divine institution which they must obey. But such claim is entirely erroneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Scriptures make known that Jehovah God’s organization in heaven is made up of Christ Jesus, the Head thereof, and of cherubim, seraphim and angels. The Devil, who is- a mimic god, has attempted to imitate or mimic Jehovah by forming an organization, which organization the Scriptures describe, and name the Devil as the chief, and that the organization consists of ‘principalities, powers, and rulers of darkness of this world’. (Ephesians 6:12) The Devil seeks to . rule all peoples of earth and keep them in subjection to himself and to completely turn them away from God. The Devil resorts to fraud, deceit and lies, because he is the father of lies. (John 8:44) He well knows that he must deceive the people in order to rule them, because men do not willingly wish to follow the Devil. The Devil, therefore, causes an organization to be formed amongst men to represent him, and which organization falsely claims to be of divine origin and authority; but the fact is, that organization is fraudulent and is carried on to deceive the people, and millions are deceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Devil’s ambitious purpose is to rule all peoples of the earth. He employs the Roman Catholic hierarchy as his chief means on earth to accomplish that purpose. The Devil injects into the minds of those men who compose the Roman Catholic hierarchy the conclusion that they must rule the nations of the earth; and hence the Roman Catholic hierarchy puts forth its greatest efforts to get control of all the nations. For many centuries that fraudulent organization, operating under the name of Christ, ruled the people of Spain, Mexico and other countries, and, in order to do so, hid the truth from the people and kept most of them in illiteracy. For many years it has diligently attemped to gain complete control of the American government and to bring the people of the nation completely under its subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pope is the nominal head of the Catholic organization, but he is not the real power or head. The controlling earthly power is the hierarchy made up of a limited number of men known as cardinals, bishops and priests, and who maintain their official offices at Rome and direct even the pope what he must say and do, and use him to mislead the people. The power invisible that in fact controls the entire organization is Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Satan is named in the Scriptures as ‘the prince of the power invisible’; “the prince [ruler] of this world”; “the power of darkness”; ‘the ruler of darkness of this world.’ (Ephesians 2:2; 6:12; John 12:31; Colossians 1:13) Satan’s purpose is to keep everybody in ignorance of the truth of God’s Word and by this means hold them under his dominion and control and keep them away from God and His truth. For this reason Jesus says: “The truth shall make you free.” (John 8:32) Satan uses every agency that he can employ to hide the truth from the people, and for this reason he causes his agents to say: “We will publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman Catholic hierarchy falsely claims to represent God. If that organization did represent God, then, instead of hiding the truth from the people, it would be diligent to teach to the people the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom and would gladly co-operate with anyone else who tells the people about God’s kingdom, which is the hope of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From its foundation the United States has been known as the place of freedom of speech, but in recent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">years not only has there been put forth a desperate effort to hide the truth from the people and to prevent the publication thereof, but the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its allies have persecuted everyone that dares tell the people the truth of God’s Word or publish the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The people must now consider whether they wish to exercise freedom of speech or whether they wish to be completely dominated and controlled by that foreign power at Vatican City, Rome. In order to be free the people must have the truth. If the Roman Catholic hierarchy gets control of America, the people will not be permitted to receive and have the truth, much less to speak it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is not at all necessary to prevent the Catholic church from teaching its doctrines. Let all be free to speak as they will, and let the people hear both sides and then themselves decide which course they wish to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All true followers of Christ Jesus on earth must tell the truth to their neighbors, because such is the commandment of God and Christ Jesus. (John 18: 37; Matthew 24:14) God has selected for himself a people whom he has anointed and appointed and commanded to tell the truth to the peoples of earth.' (Acts 15:14; Isaiah 43:10) The Devil and his earthly agents conspire to hide the truth from the people and to cause Jehovah’s witnesses to fail in their covenant to obey God. Those conspirators led by Satan are against all whom God has sent forth to be his anointed witnesses. The Roman Catholic hierarchy has drawn into Satan’s net almost all of the kings and rulers of the nations of the earth, and now makes a last and desperate attempt to control the American govern-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ment. God foreknew and foretold these very things and caused his prophet to write: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.” (Psalm 2:2, 3) “For, io, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.”— Psalm 83: 2, 3, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Into this conspiracy Satan, operating through the Roman Catholic hierarchy, has drawn the owners of big broadcasting stations, the big newspapers and magazines, politicians and officers of the law and many others. All of these are trying to hide the truth of and concerning God’s kingdom and to prevent the people from hearing about it. That is the reason why hundreds of Jehovah’s witnesses are arrested and imprisoned ; that is the reason why the big radio corporations and the newspapers say, “We will publish nothing that is controversial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah’s witnesses are putting forth their best efforts to get to the people the truth of and concerning God’s purpose, in order that the people may see what is the only hope for their peace, prosperity and life. Jehovah’s witnesses are not asking or expecting the people to join some earthly organization. Their sole work is to tell God’s truth as commanded by him, that the people may make an intelligent choice as to whom they wish to serve. It is the will of Jehovah God that there shall be controversies between truth and lies, and, because the nations of the earth have</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">chosen to take the side of the Devil, God says to them, “[Jehovah] hath a controversy with the nations; he will plead [inform and reason with them] with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the </span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord.”</span><span class="font0"> (Jeremiah 25: 31) The people must hear the truth in order to be able to choose to serve God and live or remain with the Devil and suffer destruction. (Jeremiah 25: 32, 33) Satan seeks to turn all people away from God and bring them into destruction; therefore Satan and all of his deluded agents are desperately trying to hide the truth from the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With feigned honesty the desire is expressed by the big newspapers and radio owners to keep the peace by saying: “We will publish nothing controversial.” But such is really and in fact a trick, fathered by Satan the Devil, to deceive the people and hide from them the truth while his agents lead them all into the ditch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the Devil can succeed in hiding the truth from the American people, then he will accomplish two things, to wit: lie will enable the foreign power at Rome, which the Devil created, to get control of and rule America, and, second, to turn the people away from God and ultimately into destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Which side are you on ? Whom do you wish should rule ? If you want life, peace and happiness and continuous prosperity, learn the truth and stand over on the side of Jehovah God and his kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many persons have sincerely associated themselves with the Catholic church; but when they learn the truth, they find they have been greatly deceived by a small company of selfish men operating an organiza-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">* tion for a selfish purpose. Likewise many of you have associated yourselves with the Protestant church organization, which once vigorously protested against the Roman Catholic hierarchy; but now the Protestant leaders have ceased to protest and have joined forces with the hierarchy and entered into the conspiracy against God and against his anointed. The Jews are in a similar condition. That explains why the so-called “church of the air” was created by the two great radio chain corporations in America, and why the hierarchy’s representatives and the Protestant and Jewish clergymen are permitted to use the radio facilities to the exclusion of all others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Concerning all of those conspirators God caused this to be written: “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh; the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure. Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”—Psalm 2:4, 5, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The day of great crisis is here, and the people must choose whom they will serve. God will see to it that they have the opportunity to hear the truth, that they may intelligently choose their own destiny. Do your part. Hear the truth of God’s Word and be diligent to pass that truth on to your neighbors. The kingdom of God under Christ is here, and God points to Christ Jesus, his glorious King, and says to the people: “Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom I take delight: I will put my spirit upon him, and. he shall proclaim justice to the nations. The nations also will hope in his name. ’ ’—Matthew 12:18, 21, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">— Diaglott.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
