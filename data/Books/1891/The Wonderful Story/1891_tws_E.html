<p><span class="font9">I never should grow weary Of pointing out the way—</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The way to life and glory, Whose end is bliss complete, In which the blest old story Directs our willing feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And as you hear these tidings Of joy and peace, you’ll see They’re not the awful warnings Of endless misery;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Of a death “ whose pang outlasts The quiv’ring, fleeting breath,” Round which “eternal horrors hang,” A never dying death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">And this, the hopeless doom for all Except a “ little flock.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">You see they do not comprehend The precious old, old Book—</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">Their surroundings were delightful, Their eternal prospects fair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">But soon they disobeyed him</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the only thing denied: J Forbidden fruit they tasted, So in course of time they died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yet even with this sentence, God’s mercy was declared §</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In a promise of redemption, Through the woman’s seed prepar’d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Yes, one of Eve’s descendants Should bring to all the rest</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">*Rom. 3: 24-26; fGen. 2:8-1$; f2:16; g 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He should indeed be Son of Eve, But Son of God as well; * And bring a full salvation, f The Holy Scriptures tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus as a new creation—</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Son of God by Eve, No trace of condemnation</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Would he from man receive. J</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Thus escaping condemnation That fell on Adam’s race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a suitable oblation</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He’d take the sinner’s place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">He did not come of sinful blood, Though by a human mother, His spotless life wak but transferred When he became our Brother.</span></p>
