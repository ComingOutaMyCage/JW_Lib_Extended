<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a><a name="bookmark33"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">It is important that the following guidelines be understood and followed. The Bank has an expectation that Watchtower will use reasonable security precautions to protect the credit cards. Watchtower has a duty to ensure that credit cards are kept secure and that those using the cards are properly trained in the use and protection of the credit cards. Cards should be treated as if they were cash and should be safeguarded as such. If Watchtower fails in that duty, then it may be liable for any fraud that is committed using the credit card.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">Three basic groups are required to ensure that the necessary checks and balances are in place for the smooth operation of a credit card program. This structure ensures that two or three persons are always involved in the approval/purchasing/payment process. The three groups and their responsibilities are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Oversight</span><span class="font4">—Authorizes or approves the purchase of supplies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">B.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Purchasing</span><span class="font4">—Brothers or sisters given credit cards to purchase supplies at the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">direction of Oversight. A brother in oversight can be a cardholder. However, he cannot approve his own purchases.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">C.</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> Accounting</span><span class="font4">—It is required that a brother working with the Finance/Accounting</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Department be designated as a “project credit card coordinator” for each project. The project credit card coordinator cannot be a cardholder if he also serves as the project accountant.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>OBTAINING CREDIT CARDS FOR A PROJECT</span></h4>
<p><span class="font4">To request credit cards for a specific project, the Regional Building Committee should first appoint a project credit card coordinator. The project credit card coordinator should handle the application process. If the credit card coordinator does not have an RBC logon to </span><a href="http://www.jw.org/"><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">www.jw.org</span></a><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span><span class="font4"> he should be sent electronic copies of the most recent credit card forms and procedures located in the “Documents” section of the website under “Supplier Arrangements”, Category “Credit Cards”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Credit cards should be requested at least one month before they will be needed. Request only those cards that are actually needed. Credit cards are project specific. To request credit cards for a specific project, the Project Credit Card Coordinator should complete and forward to the Treasurer’s Office Credit Card Desk the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Credit Card Account Application</span><span class="font4">, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ACH Debit/Credit Authorization Agreement for RBC Credit Card Program </span><span class="font4">and a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">check photocopy</span><span class="font4">:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Credit Card Account Application—</span><span class="font4">This document is comprised of two worksheets, a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Project-Coordinator Information</span><span class="font4"> worksheet and a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cardholder Information</span><span class="font4"> worksheet. E-mail the completed application to the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk at </span><a href="mailto:treas@jw.org"><span class="font4">treas@jw.org</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> Project-Coordinator Information</span><span class="font4">—Please enter the names and contact in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">formation requested for the project credit card coordinator and his assistant.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">2.</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;"> Cardholder Information</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Cardholder Information</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span class="font4">Contact each person who will be issued a card and obtain the following information:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">•</span><span class="font4"> Name—In columns B to D list the cardholder’s name. The middle initial is optional.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">•</span><span class="font4"> Bank Security Questions—In column E enter the password provided by the cardholder. The password may be, but does not have to be, the mother’s maiden name. In column F enter the last four digits of the cardholders social security number or alternate four digit number. The number 90000 should precede the four digit number (900001234). To activate the card, the cardholder will need to answer the bank’s security questions based on the information provided. Or, if the card is lost, they will need to answer the bank’s security questions to close the credit card account.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">•</span><span class="font4"> Address and Phone Numbers—In columns G to N enter the cardholder’s address and phone numbers. The credit card will be mailed to the cardholder at the address provided. Upon receipt, the cardholder will need to call the bank to activate the credit card.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">NOTE</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">: </span><span class="font4">At the time the above information is requested for each cardholder, send (e-mail, fax, etc.) the cardholder a copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Purchasing Card Program Cardholder User Manual for Regional Building Committees</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">b. Credit Limit—Enter the monthly credit limit in column O.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">•</span><span class="font4"> Credit limits will be established by the Finance/Accounting Department or project credit card coordinator and will vary from one card to the next depending on the needs of the buyer. For example, one brother may be assigned to purchase all electric lighting for the project. That card may only need a credit limit of $20,000.00. Another brother may be a ‘runner’ to pick up miscellaneous supplies on the weekend of the project. That card may only need a credit limit of $5,000.00.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">•</span><span class="font4"> If a card’s monthly credit limit needs to be adjusted during the course of the project, the project credit card coordinator should contact the Treasurer's Office credit card desk to request the adjustment.</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>GENERAL INFORMATION</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Use of the Credit Card</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Credit cards are issued in the name of a specific person. Embossed on line one of the credit card is the name of the cardholder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. The card is to be used only by the person whose name is embossed on the card and is not to be shared.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Addresses</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Bill to Address—The street address of the cardholder provided by the cardholder to the Regional Building Committee and submitted to the Treasure’s Office on the card application. The cardholder will not be billed or receive a credit card statement in the mail. The cardholder’s street address is in the bank’s computer system as the “bill to address” because some suppliers use address verification as a fraud prevention measure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. Ship to Address—If an item is ordered via the Internet and the ship to address needs to match the bill to address, the item may need to be shipped to the street address of the cardholder.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">B Credit cards are issued in the name of a specific RBC project.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Embossed on the second line of the credit card will be the name of the congregation that holds title to the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Because the title holding congregation’s name is embossed on the face of the card, the card can be used in combination with the title holding congregation’s state sales and use tax exempt certificate, if any. The assumption is made that the congregation’s legal documents are in order and that the name of the title holding congregation matches the name on the title holding congregation’s state sales and use tax exemption. This is important, since some states require that the exempt entity be the direct payer. Therefore, the name on the card should match the name on the sales and use tax exemption certificate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. The card is to be used only for the project embossed on the face of the card. It is not to be used to purchase materials for any other Regional Building Committee project.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Important Telephone Numbers</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A JPMorgan Chase Customer Service at 800-270-7760 (24/7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a cardholder calls the bank, the cardholder will need to answer the bank’s security questions. The answers to the security questions are the last four digits of the cardholder’s social security number or alternate four digit number (90000-1234) and password (may be, but does not have to be, mother’s maiden name). If a cardholder forgets this information, call the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">B Treasurer’s Office credit card desk at 718-560-5000 extension 25490.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Call Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">am</span><span class="font4"> to 12:00 noon and 1:00 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">pm</span><span class="font4"> to 5:00 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">pm</span><span class="font4"> Eastern Standard Time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">PaymentNet</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">PaymentNet is an Internet based credit card management tool provided by JPMorgan Chase to assist in managing the Watchtower Purchasing Card Program. The Treasurer’s Office will provide instruction on how to use PaymentNet. PaymentNet is used to review transaction activity for all cards, print the central bill statement, or dispute a transaction online.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Treasurer’s Office will give the project credit card coordinator a logon ID and password. One logon ID will be provided for all credit cards issued to an RBC project. It is permissible to share the PaymentNet logon ID and password with the person assisting the project credit card coordinator. Passwords must be at least eight characters long and are case sensitive. A password can be a mixture of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, and symbols. The system will prompt you to update your password every six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The project credit card coordinator or his assistant are required to use the Internet tool PaymentNet to monitor credit card transactions for cards assigned to their project. Receipts or an e-mail listing of recent transactions forwarded by cardholders are compared to posted transactions. This should be done at a minimum of once a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Reports Available In PaymentNet</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The following three reports are available in PaymentNet:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Monitor cardholder credit limits—</span><span class="font4">This report will allow you to see if a cardholder is getting close to exceeding the credit limit on his/her card before the billing cycle ends. If a card’s credit limit needs to be increased, the project credit card coordinator should call the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk to request a credit limit increase. The credit increase can be permanent or temporary. Monitoring credit limits will help avoid putting the cardholder in the embarrassing situation of having his/her card declined because the credit limit has been exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">B &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Monitor spend per card and total spend for all cards for the current billing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">cycle</span><span class="font4">—This report tells you how much has been spent from the beginning of the billing cycle to date. This report may be useful if a project has a tight budget and the project overseers want to know how much has been spent on credit cards before the billing cycle ends. Two versions of this report are available.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Transaction detail. List of transactions per card, total spend per card, and a grand total for all cards.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Summary detail. Total spend per card and grand total for all cards.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Project Credit Card Coordinator Responsibilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Keep a project specific list of phone numbers for each cardholder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">B Use the Internet tool PaymentNet to monitor credit card activity for fraudulent transactions and to ensure that expected credits are received. This is done by comparing transactions reported by cardholders to what is posted online. The arrangement for cardholders to communicate transaction activity to the credit card coordinator can be worked out locally. The following are two common arrangements:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Within three to four days cardholder gives receipt(s) to the credit card coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. Within three to four days cardholder e-mails transaction activity to the credit card coordinator and sends receipts at a later time. If it is necessary to reference the credit card account number use the last 4 digits. Never email the full account number.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">C Develop a filing system for pending (unpaid) receipts/invoices. When the statement is available, receipts/invoices are removed from the pending file and attached to the statement. This may not be necessary if the arrangement is for the cardholder to send receipts/invoices directly to the project accountant to match to the statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">D Maintain the security of the PaymentNet logon and password. Computers used should have adequate virus and spyware protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">E Shred any discarded paperwork showing the credit card account number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Cardholder Responsibilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A A cardholder is responsible for the security of the purchasing card. Keep the card in a secure location and keep the account number confidential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">B Credit cards are issued in the name of a specific person and project. The card is for the exclusive use of the cardholder whose name appears on the card. It is not a community card that can be shared with others. The card should only be used to purchase goods or services for the project embossed on the face of the card.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">C </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">If a card is lost or stolen</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span><span class="font4"> immediately call the bank to cancel the credit card account. Customer service can search on the cardholder’s name. It is not necessary to know your complete account number. However, it may be helpful to know or keep a record of the last four digits of your account number. If a cardholder feels that it necessary to keep a written record of the complete account number or a photocopy of the credit card, it should be kept in a secure location. When calling the bank, the cardholder should be prepared to answer the bank’s security questions such as mother’s maiden name or some other password and the last four digits of your social security number or an alternate four digit number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition, call the project credit card coordinator to report that the card was lost or stolen. Let the project credit card coordinator know if a replacement card was issued. The project credit card coordinator will notify the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">D Before using the credit card to make a purchase, the cardholder must have oversight approval just as he would when making purchases to be paid for by other means.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">E The cardholder is responsible for obtaining a receipt for all purchases and returned merchandise. Depending on local arrangements, the receipts must be forwarded to the project credit card coordinator or the Finance/Accounting Department for filing with the project’s permanent accounting records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">F Within three to four days the cardholder must communicate to the project credit card coordinator all transactions (debit and credit) on the card so that the credit card coordinator, via the Internet, can monitor card activity for fraudulent transactions and expected credits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">G Under no circumstances is the card to be used for personal purchases. If this happens, the Regional Building Committee will determine if the buyer is qualified to use a credit card issued by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">H Shred any discarded paperwork showing the credit card account number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Card Limits</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Spending Amount Limits</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The Regional Building Committee or their credit card coordinator determines the monthly credit limit of the card. If a cardholder needs to increase the monthly spending limit, the cardholder should contact the project credit card coordinator.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Merchant Limits</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The JPMorgan Chase credit card can be used with any merchant that accepts MasterCard. However, use of the card at some merchants has been blocked. Credit card companies have assigned all suppliers a Merchant Category Code (MCC). Merchant category codes have been blocked for merchants that would not be used by an RBC. For example, airlines, hotel/motel, or car rental merchants are blocked. There are two exceptions for car rental merchants, Hertz Rent-A-Car and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Hertz Rent-A-Car is made available so that RBCs can use Hertz Equipment Rental to rent equipment such as a scissor lift. The card should not be used for renting vehicles due to liability issues should an accident occur. However, if a need exists and approval is given by the Service Department’s Kingdom Hall Desk to use a branch credit card to rent a vehicle, please contact the Treasurer’s Office—Risk Management for instructions regarding insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If someone tries to make a purchase at a merchant whose MCC is blocked, the credit card transaction will be declined. This limits fraudulent use of the card should the card fall into the wrong hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a legitimate credit card transaction is declined, the cardholder should call the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk to determine why the transaction was declined. If the reason is a blocked MCC, the Treasurer’s Office can temporarily remove the block so the purchase can be completed and determine if the block should be permanently removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fraudulent Transactions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At a minimum of once a week, the credit card coordinator compares transactions posted in PaymentNet to receipts or e-mail reports of transactions forwarded by the cardholder. If there is a transaction posted in PaymentNet for which the credit card coordination does not have communication from the cardholder, the credit card coordinator will do the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Call the cardholder to determine if the transaction is legitimate.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If the transaction is legitimate, remind the cardholder to forward the receipt and/or e-mail transaction list to the project credit card coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If the transaction is not legitimate, ask the cardholder to immediately do the following:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Call JPMorgan Chase Customer Service at 800-270-7760, to cancel the card and request a replacement card if one is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. If a replacement card is requested, the cardholder should ask the bank for the last four digits of the new credit card account number and provide that information to the project credit card coordinator.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Project credit card coordinator is to notify the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk that a credit card has been closed due to fraudulent activity and whether a replacement card was issued.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">a. Obtain the following information from the cardholder: name, last four digits of the canceled card, last four digits of the replacement card, and congregation (project) name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">b. Provide the Treasurer's Office credit card desk with the information noted above by calling 718-560-5000 extension 25490, or by sending an e-mail to </span><a href="mailto:treas@jw.org"><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">treas@jw.org</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Should any fraudulent activity happen, it is important that it be stopped quickly because in some cases Watchtower may have to absorb the cost of the fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the bank suspects that transactions posted to a credit card account are fraudulent, they will freeze the credit card account. The bank will contact the cardholder by telephone to verify if the questionable transaction(s) is legitimate or fraudulent. This is one reason why it is important for the project credit card coordinator to obtain up-to-date telephone numbers from the cardholder during the application process, which contact information is passed on to the bank by the Treasurer’s Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Billing Discrepancies and Returns</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is a difference between a fraudulent charge and a billing discrepancy. For example, when comparing a cardholder’s transaction activity to transactions posted in Pay-mentNet, the project credit card coordinator may notice that they were double billed or billed for the wrong amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When there is a billing discrepancy or a credit for a return has not been posted to the credit card account, the project credit card coordinator should immediately contact the cardholder. The cardholder should try to resolve the problem in the following order:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A Communicate with the supplier. A supplier is able to credit your credit card account to resolve a billing discrepancy. In most cases, disputes can be settled directly between the cardholder and the merchant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">All suppliers have a right to resolve a problem with a purchase within a reasonable period of time, usually within two weeks of when the cardholder notifies the merchant of a problem. For example, when you receive either an incorrect or defective item, you must allow the merchant a reasonable amount of time to either replace the product, resolve the service issue, or issue a credit before turning the matter over to JPMorgan Chase Bank to resolve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">B As a last resort get the bank involved.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. If the incorrect charge cannot be resolved with the merchant, the cardholder should call customer assistance using the telephone number listed on the back of the credit card. The project credit card coordinator cannot call the bank for the cardholder but can dispute a transaction online. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Disputed transactions must be submitted to JPMorgan Chase within 60 days of the statement on which the transaction appears</span><span class="font4">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. If the cardholder needs assistance disputing a transaction with the bank or if the project credit card coordinator needs assistance disputing a problem online, call the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk at 718-560-5000 extension 25490.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">C The cardholder should communicate to the project credit card coordinator that the problem has been resolved. If a credit is expected, the project credit card coordinator should put a note in the credit card’s pending file as a reminder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Approval Process for Card Purchases</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The United States Branch Committee policy is that a cardholder should have approval from oversight before using the card to make a purchase. You should not use the card to purchase a product or service and get approval after-the-fact. Beyond this guideline, this procedure is not meant to replace or update any existing approval process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Cash Rebate</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The organization receives a cash rebate from JPMorgan Chase Bank for all credit card purchases.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Credit Cardholder</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A. Get approval before making a purchase. A cardholder may be given approval to carry out a task. This approval may cover multiple purchases needed to complete the task.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">B. When the card is used, get a receipt or invoice for each transaction. According to local arrangements, forward the receipts to either the credit card coordinator or Finance Accounting Department (project accountant).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">C. Communicate to the Project Credit Card Coordinator transaction activity within three to four days of the transaction.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Project Credit Card Coordinator or Assistant</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A. Monitor credit card activity for fraudulent transactions using the Internet tool PaymentNet. Compare transactions posted to the account to transaction activity (e-mail list or receipts) received from the cardholder. When reviewing transaction activity, one of four things may happen:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">1. Communication from cardholder matches transaction posted online. Enter a check mark in the “Reviewed” box in PaymentNet to mark transaction as valid.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">2. No transaction posted online that matches cardholder communication. Transaction has not been submitted by merchant to bank. Check again in a few days.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">3. Fraudulent Transaction—Transaction posted online but no communication from cardholder. Contact the cardholder to determine if transaction is fraudulent or if cardholder forgot to tell the project credit card coordinator about the transaction. If fraudulent, cardholder should contact the bank immediately. Follow the procedures listed above under the heading “Fraudulent Transactions.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">4. Billing Error—Transaction posted for wrong amount or double billed. Contact cardholder and request that he work with supplier to resolve the billing discrepancy.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE: </span><span class="font4">If transactions are not marked in PaymentNet as “Reviewed” and they are more than a week old on Monday, an e-mail reminder is sent to the project credit card coordinator notifying him that there are transactions that need to be reviewed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">B. File credit card receipts received from cardholders. The receipts would later be attached to the monthly credit card statement in the order in which they appear on the statement. The credit card statement with attached receipts would be sent to the project accountant. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE</span><span class="font4">: </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">No receipts would be attached if the local arrangement is to have the receipts mailed directly to the Finance/Accounting Department’s project accountant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">C. The credit card statement and attached receipts would be put in the permanent accounting records of the project and would account for the debit to the construction checking account to pay the credit card statement.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Central Billing Account Statement</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>Obtaining Central Billing Account Statement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The billing cycle ends on the 25<sup>th</sup> of each month. If the 25<sup>th</sup> is not a business day, the billing cycle may end on a business day before or after the 25th.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A. Internet— Print a copy of the central billing account statement from Pay-mentNet when the billing cycle ends. The central billing account statement lists all credit card accounts for the project and the transactions for each credit card account. A separate statement for each credit card account will not be available.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">PaymentNet will be set up to send an e-mail notifying you when the statement is available online.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">IMPORTANT</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">—</span><span class="font4">Print the statement as soon as it is available. Note the amount due and verify with the project accountant there are sufficient funds in the project’s local building account to pay the bill. If there is not enough money in the checking account to pay the credit card statement, arrangements should be made locally to ensure that funds are available to pay the bill. If there are not sufficient funds in the account and the JPMorgan Chase electronic debit ‘bounces,’ the bank will charge a 1% fee on the balance due on the statement. The late payment fee will appear on the next month’s credit card statement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">B. U.S. Mail—A paper statement will not be sent. You must use the Internet to obtain the monthly statement.</span></p></li></ul>
<h5><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>Reconciling Central Billing Account Statement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">Reconciling the central billing account statement involves matching the receipts in a pending file to transactions appearing on the credit card central billing account statement. If transactions are being reviewed weekly on PaymentNet, there should be no surprises. Assemble receipts and any supporting paperwork in the order that the transactions appear on the statement. Depending on local arrangements, reconciling the statement may be done by one of two persons:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">A. Project credit card coordinator—If receipts are sent to the Project credit card coordinator, the project credit card coordinator or his assistant is responsible for reconciling the central bill account statement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">B. Project Accountant—If the receipts are sent directly to the project accountant (Finance/Accounting Department), the project credit card coordinator would send the central billing account credit card statement to the project accountant. The project accountant would match receipts/invoices in a pending file to transactions listed on the credit card statement.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE</span><span class="font4">: Since transactions on the monthly central billing account credit card statement are grouped by individual credit card account, it may be good to group receipts in the pending file by cardholder.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Payment of Central Billing Account Statement</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">At the end of the billing cycle, the balance due on each individual credit card used by the RBC project will be automatically transferred to the central bill account. As a result, the monthly credit limit for each card is reset to the full amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The central bill account is paid from funds in the local RBC construction checking account. The Treasurer’s Office will set up payment so that JPMorgan Chase will automatically debit the RBC project’s construction checking account each month for the amount owed on the central billing account. The debit occurs 10 days after the billing cycle ends. The balance due on the central billing account statement is paid in full.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>END OF PROJECT</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Closing Credit Card Accounts</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">The project credit card coordinator will contact the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk via e-mail at </span><a href="mailto:treas@jw.org"><span class="font4">treas@jw.org</span></a><span class="font4"> when a project has been completed and the cards are not needed. In the e-mail, please provide the user ID to the project, a list of the cardholder names, the last four numbers of the credit card accounts, and the name and congregation number of the title holding congregation. The Treasurer’s Office credit card desk will close the individual credit card accounts. The cards should be destroyed locally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A few days after requesting that a card(s) be canceled, the credit card coordinator should logon to PaymentNet and access the listing of credit card holders in the PaymentNet module under menu option “Employee/User List” to ensure that card status is listed as “Canceled.” If a card does not have a status of “Canceled” within a few days after requesting the Treasurer’s Office to cancel a card(s), e-mail the Treasurer’s Office about the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NOTE</span><span class="font4">: Individual credit cards are to be canceled as soon as they are no longer needed even if the project has not ended.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Review Accounts Online For Credit Balance</span></h5>
<p><span class="font4">After the project ends, the project credit card coordinator should continue to use PaymentNet to monitor the closed credit card accounts online for any late credits that may result from returns. The project credit card coordinator may request the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk to have a check issued payable to the title holding congregation in the amount of the credit balance. The check should be deposited into the Kingdom Hall Operating account. If a request is not made for the return of these monies, JPMorgan Chase will issue a check payable to Watchtower. The Treasurer’s Office will process the check as a donation to the worldwide work.</span></p>
