<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Cardholder User Manual</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">for Regional Building Committees</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>INTRODUCTION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">It is important that the following guidelines be understood and followed. The Bank has an expectation that Watchtower will use reasonable security precautions to protect the credit cards. Watchtower has a duty to ensure that credit cards are kept secure and that those using the cards are properly trained in the use and protection of the credit cards. Cards should be treated as if they were cash and should be safeguarded as such. If Watchtower fails in that duty, then it may be liable for any fraud that is committed using the credit card.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>RECEIPT OF CREDIT CARD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">The bank will mail the credit card directly to the cardholder. The cardholder must call the bank to activate the card. Whenever the cardholder calls the bank, the cardholder must be able to answer the bank’s security questions. The security question answers are the last four digits of the cardholder’s social security number or an alternate four digit number and a password that may be, but does not have to be, the mother’s maiden name. The RBC should have requested this information from you when requesting a credit card for your use. If the cardholder has trouble activating the credit card, call the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “bill to address” and phone number tied to the credit card is the address and phone number the cardholder gave the RBC when the credit card was requested. The cardholder will not be billed or receive a credit card statement in the mail. The cardholder’s street address is in the bank’s computer system as the “bill to address” because some suppliers use address verification as a fraud prevention measure.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>GENERAL INFORMATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Important Telephone Numbers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">A. JPMorgan Chase Customer Service at 800-270-7760 (24/7).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">B. Treasurer’s Office credit card desk at 718-560-5000 extension 25490.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Call Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">am</span><span class="font2"> to 12:00 noon and 1:00 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">pm</span><span class="font2"> to 5:00 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">pm</span><span class="font2"> Eastern Standard Time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Cardholder Responsibilities</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">A. A cardholder is responsible for the security of the purchasing card. Keep the card in a secure location and keep the account number confidential.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">B. Credit cards are issued in the name of a specific person and RBC project.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Person—Embossed on the first line of the credit card is the name of a specific person. The card is for the exclusive use of the cardholder whose name appears on the card. It is not a community card that can be shared with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. RBC Project—Embossed on the second line of the credit card is the name of the congregation that holds title to the Kingdom Hall under construction or renovation.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">a. Because the title holding congregation’s name is embossed on the face of the card, the card can be used in combination with the title holding congregation’s state sales and use tax exempt certificate, if any.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">b. The card is to be used only for the project embossed on the face of the card. It is not to be used to purchase materials for any other RBC project.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">C.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"> If a card is lost or stolen</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span><span class="font2"> immediately call the bank to cancel the credit card account. Customer service can search on the cardholder’s name. It is not necessary to know your complete account number. However, it may be helpful to know or keep a record of the last four digits of your account number. If a cardholder feels that it necessary to keep a written record of the complete account number or a photocopy of the credit card, it should be kept in a secure location. When calling the bank, the cardholder should be prepared to answer the bank’s security questions such as mother’s maiden name or other provided password and the last four digits of your social security number or an alternate four digit number.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">In addition, call the project credit card coordinator to inform him that your card was canceled. If a replacement card was issued, give the project credit card coordinator the last four digits of the new account number.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">D. Follow the RBC approval process as outlined in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Regional Building Committee Accounting Manual</span><span class="font2"> (S-100).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">E. The cardholder is responsible for obtaining a receipt for all purchases and returned merchandise. Depending on local arrangements, all receipts should be forwarded to the project credit card coordinator or to the project accountant.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">F. Within three to four days the cardholder must communicate to the project credit card coordinator all transactions (debit and credit) on the card so that the credit card coordinator via the Internet can monitor card activity for fraudulent transactions and expected credits. Depending on local arrangements, two common ways to do this are as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Within three to four days cardholder forward receipt(s) to the project credit card coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. Within three to four days cardholder e-mails transaction activity to the project credit card coordinator. If it is necessary to reference the credit card account number use the last 4 digits. Never e-mail the full account number.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">G. Under no circumstances should the card be used for personal purchases. If this happens, the RBC will determine if the person is qualified to use a credit card issued by the organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">H. Shred any discarded paperwork showing the credit card account number.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Card Limits</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Spending Amount Limits</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The RBC or their appointed project credit card coordinator determines the monthly credit limit of the card. If the monthly spending limit needs to be increased, the cardholder should contact the project credit card coordinator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Merchant Limits</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The JPMorgan Chase credit card can be used with any merchant that accepts MasterCard. However, use of the card at some merchants has been blocked. Credit card companies have assigned all suppliers a Merchant Category Code (MCC). Merchant category codes have been blocked for merchants that would not be used by an RBC. For example, airlines, hotel/motel, or car rental merchants are blocked. There are two exceptions for car rental merchants, Hertz Rent-A-Car and Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Hertz Rent-A-Car is made available so that RBCs can use Hertz Equipment Rental to rent equipment such as a scissor lift. The card should not be used for renting vehicles due to liability issues should an accident occur. However, if a need exists and approval is given by the Service Department’s Kingdom Hall Desk to use a branch credit card to rent a vehicle, please contact the Treasurer’s Office—Risk Management for instructions regarding insurance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If someone tries to make a purchase at a merchant whose MCC is blocked, the credit card transaction will be declined. This limits fraudulent use of the card should the card fall into the wrong hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If a legitimate credit card transaction is declined, the cardholder should call the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk at 718-560-5000 extension 25490 to determine why the transaction was declined. If the reason is a blocked MCC, the Treasurer’s Office can temporarily remove the block so the purchase can be completed and determine if the block should be permanently removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fraudulent Transactions</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is important that any fraudulent use of the card be detected quickly. In some cases Watchtower may be required to absorb the cost of the fraud. If the bank suspects that transactions posted to your credit card account are fraudulent, they will freeze your credit card account. The bank will contact you by telephone to verify if the questionable transaction(s) is legitimate or fraudulent. This is one reason why it is important that up-to-date contact information is submitted to the RBC, which information is passed on to the bank by the Treasurer’s Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The project credit card coordinator or his assistant is required to use the Internet to monitor transaction activity for all cards assigned to a project. Receipts or an e-mail listing of transactions forwarded by the cardholder are compared to transactions posted online. If there is a transaction posted to the account for which there is no receipt, the project credit card coordinator or his assistant will call the cardholder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">A. If the transaction is legitimate, remind the cardholder to forward the receipt or e-mail a transaction list to the project credit card coordinator.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">B. If the transaction is not legitimate, the cardholder should immediately do the following:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. Call JPMorgan Chase Customer Service at 800-270-7760, to cancel the card and request a replacement card if one is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. If a replacement card is requested, the cardholder should ask the bank for the last four digits of the new credit card account number and provide that information to the project credit card coordinator.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Billing Discrepancies and Returns</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When comparing receipts or an e-mail transaction list forwarded by the cardholder to transactions posted online to the credit card account, the project credit card coordinator may notice that the account was double billed or billed for the wrong amount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When there is a billing discrepancy or a credit for a return has not been posted to the credit card account, the project credit card coordinator will contact the cardholder. The cardholder should try to resolve the problem in the following order:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">A. Communicate with the supplier. A supplier is able to credit your credit card account to resolve a billing discrepancy. In most cases, disputes can be settled directly between the cardholder and the merchant.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">All suppliers have a right to resolve a problem with a purchase within a reasonable period of time, usually within two weeks of when the cardholder notifies the merchant of a problem. For example, when you receive either an incorrect or defective item, you must allow the merchant a reasonable amount of time to either replace the product, resolve the service issue, or issue a credit before turning the matter over to JPMorgan Chase Bank to resolve.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">B. As a last resort get the bank involved.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. If the incorrect charge cannot be resolved with the merchant, the cardholder should call customer assistance using the telephone number listed on the back of the credit card. The project credit card coordinator cannot call the bank for the cardholder but can dispute a transaction online using Pay-mentNet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Disputed transactions must be submitted to JPMorgan Chase within 60 days of the statement on which the transaction appears</span><span class="font2">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. If the cardholder needs assistance disputing a transaction with the bank or if the project credit card coordinator needs assistance disputing a problem online, call the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk at 718-560-5000 extension 25490.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">C. The cardholder should communicate to the project credit card coordinator that the problem has been resolved. If a credit is expected, the project credit card coordinator will monitor the account online to ensure the credit is received.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Cash Rebate</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The organization receives a cash rebate from JPMorgan Chase Bank for all credit card purchases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Card Not Needed</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When a card for a specific project is no longer needed, inform the project credit card coordinator who will then inform the Treasurer’s Office credit card desk so that the account can be closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Payment of Credit Card Account</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The cardholder will not receive a credit card statement and is not involved in paying the credit card statement. The RBC Finance/Accounting Department will handle the payment of the credit card statement.</span></p>
