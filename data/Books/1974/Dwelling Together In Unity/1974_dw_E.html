<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Look! How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity! -Psalm 133:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To be read by all persons living in Bethel homes, both at headquarters and in the branches. As you progress with the reading, please look up and read every scripture cited. This booklet is the property of the Society and may not be taken away from the home in which you reside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Revised and Effective September 1, 1974 Printed by the WATCHTOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF NEW YORK, INC. 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201, U.S.A.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">COMING into one of the Society's homes will mean a change in your lifea big change. But we at Bethel want to make that change as easy as possible for you. Friendship with our brothers and sisters is the aim of every one of us living here in these homes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now, how can this best be achieved? Let's start at the beginning. When you first learned the truth, you began to make your mind over. You started to fill your mind with new ideas. You got these ideas from reading God's Word, the Bible, and you enjoyed them. These new truths thrilled you. Now you knew the right thing to do. You accommodated yourself to new ways of living. You quit being fashioned after the old system of things and you found out that, by making your mind over, a pleasant, happy new way of living was yours. You heard and believed the truth, and it was wonderful. Now your desire is to live in the new system. You are working to that end, so you continue to take in knowledge of Jehovah and his Son, because you know that this means everlasting life.Rom. 12:1, 2; John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being here at Bethel will be a new experience, also a new way of living and a pleasant one. We will admit right from the start that it isn't like living at home with your father and mother, yet it is still one of the very best places on earth to be living right now. In many places throughout the world our Bethel homes are big, our families large, larger in numbers than your natural family, but we are still one family and we dwell together in unity. In some places our families are small and it is easy for all of us to get acquainted with one another. But the point is this: We want you to feel at home since arriving; we want you to succeed. Always remember that brothers have been living here before you came and they have been getting along together in unity for many years. Bethel homes have been in operation a long time, and the occupants have contentment with their godliness. (1 Tim. 6:6 8) We have learned certain routines and habits, and they are good habits because they are based on God's Word and we accomplish much work as a result. We like it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You are now a newcomer and certainly you don't expect the Bethel family to change its ways of living and re- arrange them to accommodate each newcomer in the home; therefore you may have some changes to make. You're</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">like a baby here. You're new in our family and we all</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY love you and we want to get acquainted with you. We know that you want to get acquainted and accustomed to us too. We want you to love Bethel as we do. So let's get acquainted right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Brooklyn Bethel is a large home and hundreds of people live here. Since the Brooklyn Bethel family is so large, we may, when we see you, think you are just one of the many visitors that come in each day. We may think that you have some friend who is looking after you; so, not wanting to intrude into someone else's business, we go right ahead with our busy routine of life. We do not know that you are a new arrival. So would you please introduce yourself to us as you meet us at different places in the home, the factory or at a congregation? Thank you!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are scattered all around in the home and factory and offices. In some Bethel homes the family is not quite as scattered, because it is smaller. But, believe us, we want to know you. Sometimes, though, we are so busy with our routine in the home, factory or office, or with the house-to-house service and Bible studies, that we find ourselves with barely enough time to say Hello. So stop us and say, &quot;Hello, I am a new member&quot;; and we will try to learn your name, tell you ours and get acquainted. Please, try to get acquainted with us right from the start and help us to meet you. You are a part of our Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now for a little bit of information about us. We may work in an office, do housework, work in the laundry, print magazines and books, and cook wholesome meals; we also study our Bibles. Some of us work on farms; all of us go to school. And in all of this, we are really full-time servants of God's kingdom. We have a lot of preaching to do. We enjoy our family Watchtower study. We go to our congregation meetings and share in them, and we want you to get the full benefit of these meetings with us. We want you to enjoy your place in this big theocratic organization. We want you to do your part, and we want to help you to do it. When you know us as a busy, active family, you are going to be happy in our Bethel home. So be sure to get acquainted right from the start, the first day and the first week; let us know you are here. Thanks a lot!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>BETHEL STUDIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">We know that a Christian must keep on taking in spiritual food. This is true with regard to our family just as much as it is for any other Christian family. As a family we have our own weekly Watchtower study. Every member of the family should set aside this evening for study with the family. Nothing should interfere with it. Feeding on the things that Jehovah provides on his table is essential to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">gain life; don't neglect this study. This Bethel family study of The Watchtower is exclusively for the family; no out- siders are invited to attend unless they are overnight guests in the Bethel home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Watchtower study is followed by the Theocratic Ministry School. All who are members of the family are enrolled and all should take part in this meeting too. We are sure you realize that everything Jehovah provides through his organization is important and necessary. So come to both meetings; make comments. Feel at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will probably find it is a little difficult to get up in front of the Bethel family to give your first talks. But all of us went through that ordeal and lived; it will do you good. You may feel that everyone here is so experienced and has been at Bethel so many years that you should not even try. That is the wrong idea. We want you to be an ex- perienced, mature person in our family. So you need this training as all of us do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will also be assigned to a local congregation. You will attend the congregation book studies, Theocratic Min- istry School and service meetings, as well as the public talks and Watchtower studies, under the supervision of the local congregation with which you associate. It cer- tainly is for your good to attend these meetings. The more knowledge you take in during your youth, the happier you will be when you become of more mature years. All of us can tell you from experience that what you learn when you are young you will be very grateful for later on in life. Right study habits will work to your advantage!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You should arrange for some time during the week to study privately. You should read The Watchtower and Awake! as soon as you can after you get them in your room. Read all the new publications of the Society and keep abreast of the things that the Society knows to be im- portant for the blessing of all of Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Usually all Bethel homes have a study room or library, and this is provided for the use of the family. Concordances and files of The Watchtower and other publications are kept by the Bethel home in a place convenient for all. Also a good dictionary should be on hand in every Bethel home and available to the members of the family so that they can improve their language, learning to pronounce and to use words correctly every day as well as when giving talks. The branch office should mark in the front of all its library books that they are the property of the branch. Someone should be appointed to look after the library so that it will always be in a tidy condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ORGANISATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah has blessed his organization, as you well know. It certainly has grown rapidly in the last few years. Many new Bethel homes have been set up throughout the world at the various branch locations. We feel sure that Jehovah is pleased with the praises we are bringing to him day by day and we take great joy in carrying on true worship. Everyone who works in a Bethel home or a branch office shows interest in his brothers who are sharing in the worldwide witness work. He has a privilege of service that many other publishers do not enjoy; he is in this special service full time and can work in the interests of all his fellow workers in the country where he serves, helping to supply them with the things they need. We need you; that is why you were called. You will learn a lot, and the more years you spend at Bethel the better servant you will be. Yes, you said, &quot;Here I am! Send me.&quot; (Isa. 6:8) Now you have a special appointment in Jehovah's organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are not high-minded, feeling superior to someone else because of our service, but we do appreciate the organization and our part in it. In the same way as the eye is important to the body, and as the ear would not say to the hand, &quot;I have no need of you,&quot; we need you, and that is why we called you to Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jehovah's witnesses have land, buildings, furnishings, machinery, household equipment, linen, food everything that goes to make up the equipment that is committed into our care. We who have made expression of wanting to live in the Bethel home and who have been called to such a place certainly feel a responsibility in using these things. So in these various dwelling Places we want to use the property and equipment in the best way to praise Jehovah. We all look after it and hold it in trust for Jehovah and his theocratic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As you know, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is a Pennsylvania corporation, while Watch- tower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., is a New York corporation. The International Bible Students Association is a British corporation, and we have throughout the world a number of other corporations that are used by Je- hovah's witnesses. The president of the abovenamed three corporations has general supervision and control over all the business interests of the Society and is very much interested in the welfare of all those in Bethel homes everywhere. He wants to see the work move along well in all of the branch offices and on the farms and in all other places that come under the direct supervision of the office of the president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So that all of us may dwell together in unity in these homes, it is necessary to set out some instructions that will help us all to get along well together. (Prov. 15:22, 23; 19:2) All of us know that everyone who becomes a member of one of these many families has dedicated himself to Jehovah, and, according to his application, has told us that he has symbolized his dedication by water immersion. (Matt. 16:24; 28:19, 20) From what you have told us we know that you are in full accord with the Society's teachings and that you accept the Bible as the Word of God. (John 8:32; 17:17; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17) We know, too, that the truth is advancing more and more as we approach the perfect day; so it is necessary for us to keep on studying. An under- standing of God's Word and of his principles of truth and righteousness is more to be desired than fine gold.Ps. 19: 7-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reason we have come to the Bethel home is that we love Jehovah God above everything else. Loving him with all our heart, mind, soul and strength would certainly re- quire that we love our brothers too. In fact, Jesus said: '&quot; You must love your neighbor as yourself.&quot; (Mark 12:29-31; 1 John 4:20, 21) If we keep these two commandments, lov- ing God first and our neighbors as we do ourselves, we certainly will not have any difficulty in getting along with our brothers and sisters in the home where we are living. In fact, if we would carry out all the principles of truth and righteousness that God sets forth in his Word, we would not need this booklet of counsel, which sets out some helpful advice as to how we can get along together in unity. But we make mistakes, and so that we shall under- stand one another and what we may expect from one another, the Society publishes this booklet. If we really love our neighbor as we do ourselvesand certainly we do love ourselves, because we are always looking after ourselves we shall get along just fine with everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So, now that you are a new member of the family, let's see what you can expect of us as the organization moves along and, at the same time, what we may expect of you in order to make our life happy and contented here in our daily service to Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">First of all, we should appreciate that Jehovah God is the Great Theocrat. We recognize him as supreme and we have full faith that he is directing his organization through his Son, Jesus Christ. We should realize that organization instructions come from the head down and not from the bottom up. We who are young and new in these homes certainly want to find our right place in the organization and be contented. We should have confidence in Jehovah's organization and that Jehovah places the members in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">body or organization as it pleases him. We should be de- lighted to do whatever is required. Some of us act in the capacity of branch overseers, factory overseers, Bethel over- seers, teachers or special servants, and in numerous other assignments, but every one of us is a publisher of Jehovah's kingdom.1 Cor. 12:18, 28, 29; Ex. 18:21</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our brothers who are in charge of various departments of work have had experience in those departments and can help you and teach you much if you are willing to learn. After you have mastered the work in the way you have been taught and can do it excellently, then it will be time enough if you have suggestions for improvements to talk to those elders in charge about such improvements that you think will help all concerned. It is good first to follow the training given. You learn more quickly that way. We be- lieve that everyone in the Bethel home is working to advance the interests of the Kingdom. We will keep on believing that unless someone proves otherwise. &quot;By their fruits you will recognize them.&quot;Matt. 7:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We feel confident that Jehovah will keep his organization clean and will take out all those who cause others to stumble or who assume the attitude of a boss who is trying to lord it over the brothers. It is good to extend mercy and to be patient with such persons for a while. Maybe they will change their course of action when given some counsel and reproof. But if they do not have God's spirit they just cannot last at Bethel. All in Jehovah's organization must be diligent workers. Those who are placed in positions of responsibility as elders should be the best examples to all their fellow workers in word and in deed.1 Pet. 5: 1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The president of the Society appoints overseers in Bethel and has the privilege and responsibility of making any changes that he sees fit. The president of the Society ap- points the Bethel overseer who looks after the interests of the Bethel home, the office overseer in charge of the office management, the factory overseer who looks after general production and the shipping of factory production, the farm overseers who look after the farms and homes in connection with each and the branch overseers in charge of the work in general in the various countries. In some instances these overseers may hold more than one position. For example, the branch overseer may be the office overseer as well. Other appointments of brothers over divisions of work are usually made by the branch overseer, but he should make recommendations to the president before any selections are made of overseers to look after certain divi- sions of work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus if it becomes necessary to appoint someone to look after the pressroom as an assistant to the branch overseer, or if someone is to be put in charge</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 9</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the kitchen and will have Jurisdiction over other persons, or if someone is to be appointed to look after the service desk with considerable responsibility in connection with the handling of congregation matters, or if someone is to be appointed to do the translating of the Society's publications into another language, such appointments should always be brought to the attention of the president for final ap- proval. The president may have someone else in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every member of the Bethel family, no matter where he is located in Jehovah's organization, should feel perfectly free to register a complaint if he is mistreated by another individual. These complaints may be registered with the branch overseer or directly to the president, but I would like to say now that, whenever possible, such differences should be settled privately between the brothers involved. It will save you a lot of heartaches and bring you great happiness if you can gain your brother without calling in others. (Matt. 5:21-24; Luke 17:3, 4) If you have difficulties with your brother, it is always best to go to him first before you bring someone else in. Don't gossip about your trouble. Handle it yourself, or, if you must, go to an older brother, an elder, if you can't straighten it out. Don't carry bitterness in your heart. (Eph. 4:31, 32) If you can't settle it after you have taken this course of action, then, of course, you can write to the president about your difficulties, but you ought to supply the other brother in your complaint with a copy of your letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remember that we want to dwell together in unity. If we follow God's Word, we will; but we forget to do this some- times and so have trials and difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Problems will arise in the Bethel home just as they do anywhere else in Jehovah's organization, because we are born in sin and shaped in iniquity. But if we keep on making our minds over and follow Jehovah's admonition, there should be less trouble. Let us always be contented and happy, living to- gether as a family.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ASSIGNED DUTY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">It is left to the discretion of the overseers appointed by the president to assign the members of the family in var- ious homes and factories to their work. We do not ask individuals to select their jobs, but we feel that the proper spirit to have is that of Isaiah: &quot;Here I am! Send me.&quot; We feel, too, that if you are asked to do a job, the one asking you believes that you can do it. Even though you feel that you do not have the natural ability, try to do it with all your heart and mind and ask Jehovah's blessing on your efforts. Have in mind, too, that you may be moved from place to place, but don't think we are displeased. Perhaps</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">we haven't found the right kind of work for you to do, so we keep trying. Of course, if you are lazy and indifferent toward your privileges you will probably be told, but you will be told for your own good. Jehovah is not pleased with a sluggard. (Prov. 6:6; 13:4, AV) We should be happy to work hard and to serve God wherever we are. Remember, being in Jehovah's organization and having any work at all in that organization is an honor and a privilege.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>ALLOWANCES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Every member of the Bethel family receives a small allowance monthly; it makes no difference if he is the president or some other individual. The president of the Society determines what the allowances will be for all those working in the branches.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>CONDUCT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">A Christian should have good morals. Jehovah is dis- pleased with immoral persons and such will not inherit the kingdom of God. There are a few things that I would like to say here in this connection. I am sure you know them, but this will serve to refresh your memory. Jehovah has no pleasure in a thief, an evildoer or a busybody in other men's matters. (1 Pet. 4: 15) No one needs to use filthy language to express his thoughts. The vocabulary available in all languages is sufficient to get our ideas across without nasty, filthy words. If one has had the bad habit of using filthy language before learning the truth, it is high time for him to get such words out of his mind and make his mind over. A person can be emphatic, if necessary, without using bad language. Our speech should be positive and up- building and, if it is, we will be in harmony with the Christian organization's way of doing things. Jas. 3:10, 11; 1 Tim. 6:3-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Proper respect for persons of both sexes must always be maintained. Politeness and kindness are always ap- preciated. (1 Cor. chap. 7; Rom. 1:20-32) Men are given places of responsibility, and those placed in such positions should be respected by all. The women should always keep their proper place and recognize Jehovah's arrangement as to their position in His organization. (1 Cor. 11:3; 1 Tim. 2:11-13) Filthy habits and bodily uncleanness will not be tolerated at Bethel. All should keep hygienically clean and care for their own health. (2 Cor. 7:1) Drunkenness is con- demned by Jehovah and will not be allowed. (Prov. 23:21; 1 Cor. 6:10) It is expected that all who become members of a Bethel family have ceased any filthy and unscriptural habits that they might have engaged in prior to learning the truth If anyone needs help- along any of these lines,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 11 talk to an elder at Bethel and he will be glad to help you from the Scriptures. Jehovah's organization must remain clean; those who do not want to practice good conduct, but who want to live in the way of the old system will, when discovered, be dismissed from the family.2 Tim. 3:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wine and liquors may be used in moderation by the members of the family if any so desire. But when such beverages are brought into the home they should be used in such a way as not to stumble others.1 Pet. 4:3. Those who have dedicated themselves to Jehovah should never give anyone cause to point the finger of reproach at Jehovah's organization. Never act improperly in public or in private. What you do that is observed by others will cause them to believe that the rest of the family act the same way. While this may not be true, still an organization is judged by those that represent it. Let your actions be based on the principles of truth and righteousness. Love your neighbor as you do yourself. If you ~o this, you will conduct yourself properly toward your brothers and all people. Gal. 5:19-26; Eph 5:1518; 1 Pet. 4:24.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>CLEANLINESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">A clean person and a clean room will bring you happiness and contentment. It will contribute to good health. There is no reason for anyone to be dirty. Ample provisions are made for taking baths and keeping one's body clean. It is a good practice to bathe daily. Do not only keep yourself clean, but clean up after yourself; rinse out the washbasin after you use it. Keep things tidy in your room; remember, your roommate lives there too. Things decorative or orna- mental may be displayed in your room; however, papers, magazines, books left lying around and clothing that is not put away only detract from the appearance of the room and make more work for those cleaning your room. Also keep your desk, working tables and machinery clean at work. You will be able to use them better and the machinery will run more smoothly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>CONFIDENCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Remember that you are a member of a family and you are expected to keep confidence with the family and the organization. Many things that are said to the family by the one at the head of the Bethel table or by the one in charge of the home are for the family only. No one should communicate with brothers outside the Bethel home con- cerning new publications that may be manufactured or letters that are being printed, or send out reports about matters discussed at the Bethel table that strictly involve</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">12 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">our family. These are confidential to the family.Compare Matthew 17:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Information that the Society desires to communicate to the brothers outside the Bethel home will be given them in due time through The Watchtower, Awake!, Kingdom Min- utry or by letters mailed by the Society. Letter writing, of course, is a fine thing. Encouraging words and helpful suggestions can be given to relatives, others in the full-time service and publishers on the outside. However, we should never include confidential matters and especially not gossip in our letters; neither should we gossip within the family. Prov. 17:4; 26:2~22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remember, your mother and father, especially if they are Jehovah's witnesses, are very much interested in you. There is a natural family bond of love. They would like to hear from you once in a while. Why not write your mother and father once a week. There are many things that you can write them aboutyour experiences in the field service, your congregational meetings, experiences related to the Bethel family by travelling representatives, and personal activities, aside from the details about work that you handle at Bethel. They spent a lot of time with you and cared for you daily before you came to Bethel. They miss you. A letter will help them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Details about the individual work assigned to you as a member of the family are confidential. What you are given to do is your business. You are requested not to communicate information from your department to another department. If we wanted you to know the details of the other persons' work we would have assigned that work to you. Married couples serving in different departments should not discuss confidential details of their work when at home. If you have problems, take them up with the elder in charge. The same is true concerning roommates. Confidential Society matters received in the mail should be handled confidentially. Information to be announced generally will be presented by the one in charge of the home or the factory. If you are to know what is going on in other departments, you will be told through the proper overseer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are interested in the welfare of our brothers, but working hours are not for visiting. That is the time to work. If we find that we haven't enough to do, then we should report to the overseer in charge of where we work. When we waste time talking unnecessarily to other people, it is a waste of their time as well as ours.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>ACCIDENTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">A capable, sympathetic person should be assigned to first aid. First-aid equipment should be available to all who</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 13 may get hurt or bruised. If they need someone to help them with their wounds, then the one assigned should be told immediately. If a major accident occurs, the one in charge of first aid should get in touch immediately with the over- seer in charge of the branch or home, who will see that the injured person is cared for properly. If necessary, the overseer will call a doctor or send the injured person to a hospital. A full and accurate report on the accident should be typewritten for future reference. If there was any care- lessness on the part of the individual or on the part of the management in not guarding moving parts of the machinery, these things should be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Keep in mind that there is always danger near moving machinery. Therefore, care should always be taken by those operating machines when working or cleaning around them. It would be better to stop the machine if some adjustments need to be made. Do not use rags to clean machinery ex- cept when it is stopped and the power is off. Machine parts can be purchased, but we can't buy fingers and hands; so please be careful and do not take chances. Always be care- ful around machines in motion. Your safety is what you should be interested in as well as that of your brothers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>CARE OF THE FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Brothers brought into the family are believed to be strong and healthy and, according to their applications, there is nothing seriously wrong with them. The Society will try to keep its members healthy. We do so by providing them with clean rooms, comfortable sleeping quarters, wholesome food and good conditions under which to live and carry on their daily routine. If an individual gets sick and it is believed necessary to call a doctor, the brother in charge should not hesitate to do so. If the branch office can make arrangements with dentists or optometrists or other specialists to get re- duced rates for the care of the teeth and eyes of the family, this should be done. If the branch overseer can arrange for free treatments for members of the family, then the mem- bers of the family can be called from their work at various intervals for checkups or treatments. If it is during working hours, please notify the brother in charge of your depart- ment before going for medical attention. It is a good thing for members of the family who are not feeling well to report that to the one in charge of first aid. Maybe some advice can be given to the individual that will help him to get over a cold or other difficulty. Getting to bed early in the evening right after supper when feeling ill is better than going out. Rest and sleep are the best healers. It may be necessary to isolate a sick person and restrict visitors to 14 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">keep the ailment from spreading. Those who get sick will be given needed treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If one of the brothers in the home is a barber, arrange- ments can be made for him to cut the hair of the other brothers and sisters. A schedule should be drawn up and the brothers called according to the schedule to have their hair cut.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>ECONOMY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Remember that the money the Society spends is not furnished by us. It was contributed by those who want to see Kingdom interests advanced. We should not waste food, electricity, water, supplies or equipment. All of us should be careful and economical. When you are given machinery to operate or tools to use, you should take good care of them. Be sure to oil and clean your machines according to the schedule established by the branch overseer or the one in charge. Waste in Jehovah's organization should be at a minimum.Prov. 18:9; John 6:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All lost equipment should be reported immediately. Any- one deliberately destroying equipment will be required to pay for it. Lights should not be left on when not needed. Be sure to turn water faucets completely off. There are many ways in which you can help to avoid needless ex- penses by just being careful. Things needing repairs should be reported in writing. The Society's buildings are kept in good condition inside and out But after you report in writing the need of repairs, the responsibility is no longer yours. It becomes the responsibility of the brother in charge if you have made the written report to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Society's buildings where there are elevators, those who need to climb more than three nights of stairs or descend more than six flights of stairs are permitted to use the elevators. Those who are infirm or those over thirty- five years of age may use the elevators at any time.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>- HEATING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Radiators should be turned completely off when rooms are not occupied. If you are in the room and it gets too warm, turn the radiator off. Never have the windows open and the radiator on at the same time. When you are living or working in a room with someone else, if the room be- comes too warm or too cool it would be well to consult the other person before changing the temperature. It may be that you are underclad and could put on a sweater or a jacket, which would make the temperature just right for both of you. If it becomes too warm, the first thing to do is to turn off the heat. After this has been done, if the room still remains too warm, then you can open a window. For</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">comfort in working, a temperature between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit seems to be the best. In some countries it does not get that cool, so one just becomes accustomed to the higher temperature.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">No large expenditures or purchases of any machinery or of property or anything out of the routine needs should be made without the approval of the president of the So- ciety. Before anything may be purchased, a requisition must be written out and approved by the overseer appointed by the president or by the president himself. The approved requisition should go to the purchasing clerk, who will make out a purchase order. This order will go to the seller, and a copy should be attached to the requisition so that it can be checked with the receipt of goods and the bill of sale before payment is made. Any person who buys some- thing in the name of the Society without an approved requisi- tion will have to pay the bill himself. No one may obligate the Society to an expenditure or purchase in the name of the Society unless he has written approval from the one in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All matter being printed in the buildings of the Society be- longs to the Society. No books, magazines or any publications may be removed from the bins, skids, or presses and taken out of the building except by the permission of the overseer in charge. The Watchtower, Awake!, Kingdom Ministry, letters and other information for individuals in the family will be delivered to their rooms at the proper time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No one should operate another person's machine or change the adjustments. No one may borrow tools or move them from one department to another without asking for per- mission. Because tools or other equipment are not locked up is no reason to walk away with them. If tools are needed, they must be obtained from the overseer in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No furniture or equipment may be brought into any of the Society's homes or alterations made in your room with- out permission. Private property such as clothing may be brought into a home without permission. Radios, lounging chairs and similar items may be purchased by members of the family, but before doing so be sure you have the per- mission of the overseer in charge to bring them into the home. Junky pieces of furniture will not be allowed in the home. Installations of a permanent nature must remain in the room. Any alterations to be made in a room should be made at painting time, which is about every five years. Wall washing is done once a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the close of every day's work, desks, cases and work</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">benches should be cleared of all papers and tools, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">16 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">should be put in their proper places. Everything should be left in a tidy condition at the close of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Overalls and shop apparel are to be placed in the dressing room in the area assigned you. The dressing rooms and washrooms should be kept clean and the toilets sanitary. Brothers and sisters should put on neat, clean clothes when coming to meals or when travelling the streets to and from work. We should not appear sloppy or indifferent toward proper dress, nor should we be conspicuous by wearing overalls or dirty work clothes in the dining room or on the streets. We should wear clothing that befits our Christian life. When coming to meals we should have on the cus- tomary dress of the country. Washing up before mealtimes is essential and is expected of all.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>FIELD SERVICE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Each one of us as a member of the Bethel family wants to take part in the field service, witnessing from house to house, making return visits and conducting</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bible studies. (Matt. 24:14; Isa. 61:1, 2) Field service is a big part of our lives. We have dedicated ourselves to God to do his will; so, in order to share to the full in the privilege of being his servants we study his Word and we witness to other per- sons. The elders of the congregation with which you work will assist you to be regular in the field service. The aid they offer you is for your own spiritual welfare. One way to keep happy in Bethel service is to keep busy in the field service. We need personal association with the other pub- lishers and with interested people to keep alive spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday the regular routine of work stops so that we will have time to engage in the field service. Field service should at no time interfere with your regular assigned work in the Bethel home, office or factory. Remember, you were called to Bethel to do a special work. You should keep your Bethel service first in your life, as your work at Bethel is necessary to help others in their service. However, we will have time to engage in preaching the &quot;good news&quot; and we should make good use of that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In many instances in branch office cities members of the branch staff are appointed as elders and ministerial assistants in local congregations, but even if they are such it does not mean they can neglect their Bethel work. Being an elder or ministerial assistant in the local congregation is an added</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">privilege of service and should be considered as such.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>HOURS OF WORK</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">The reason we came to Bethel was to work, wasn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We can get the most work done if we all work together at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 17 the same time. The hours of work are from 8 a.m. until 11:55 a.m. and from 1 p.m. until 5:40 p.m. A bell will be sounded at 8 a.m. and at 1 p.m. and all should be at their work by those times. Another bell will be sounded at 11:55 a.m. and at 5:40 p.m. These bells notify the brothers to close down their machines and get ready for meals. Some countries may find it advisable to adjust the eight hours and thirty-five minutes to accommodate their local conditions. In such cases they will write to the president for a change. However, the hours of work in all countries will be eight hours and thirty-five minutes. These hours apply from Monday through Friday, and a half day of three hours and fifty-five minutes on Saturday morning. It would be wrong to waste your time during these hours. You should not engage in personal errands or go out for refreshments or carry on visiting during that time. (Prov. 13:4; 26:16) If it becomes necessary for you to leave the home or the factory for any reason during working hours, obtain permission from the overseer in charge. While you may be as- signed to prepare public talks to give on some weekends or material for other congregational meetings, these are added privileges of service to be cared for during free time. Likewise we request you not to carry on personal correspondence or to read newspapers or literature for personal study during the working hours. In the general routine of work some brothers are re- quired to work hours other than those mentioned before, and in such cases a schedule should be made by the overseer so that the brothers will be working eight hours and thirty- five minutes during a day. Of course, if a brother wishes to work longer hours than required at his assigned work, he may do so as long as it does not impair his health and if it is in the best interests of the work. It should be under- stood, though, that working extra hours at his regular work does not allow him to be away at any time during the regular working period unless special permission has been obtained. We must have permission to be absent from the Bethel home or factory during regular working hours. No one is ever given blanket permission to come and go as he pleases. Set a good example for the newcomers by being at work on time and leaving after the bell rings. Sometimes it may be requested that we put in extra time in the office or factory because of the press of work, but we hope this will not be too often. There are also a few extra duties, like dish duty, lobby or watchman duty, to which members of the family are assigned by written notice from time to time. All other hours of the day outside the scheduled ones are yours to use as you see fit, to the honor and glory of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>KEYS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">One key to the main entrance of the home will be pro vided each member of the family. No one is ever allowed to make duplicate keys. If a key is lost, report it in writing to the overseer in charge. Another key will be provided in due time after written notice of the lost key has been received, but if the second key is also lost, the overseer in charge may use his discretion as to whether the brother should have a third key. Keys may not be loaned from one member of the family to another. Your key is Private property. Should you ever find it necessary to leave Bethel, your house key must be turned in to the overseer in charge. Everyone coming into or going out of the home should see to it that the door is closed and locked, unless it is during working hours when the door is normally unlocked. If it is the custom for the door always to be locked, then every individual in the home should be careful to see that the door is kept locked. Keys for any building other than the living quarters will be given only to such persons as need them; for example, the watchman or the person who usually opens the building in the morning and closes it at night. Records will be kept of all brothers having keys and of the respective key numbers.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>IDENTIFICATION CARD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Each member of the Brooklyn Bethel family is given an identification card upon his becoming a member of the family. This is because the family is so large, and so this acts as a protection to the family. Every member of the family should carry his identification card with him and show it upon request when entering the home if he is questioned by another member of the family. All of us should be interested in protecting the home and keeping out those who do not live here. If you terminate your service at Bethel, the identification card should be turned in at the time you turn in your key to the Bethel office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>DWELLING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">When one becomes a member of the family, he should want to become fully acquainted with the general routine of the home. That is why you were given a copy of this booklet, Dwelling Together in Unity. I hope that you will carefully read each of these suggested principles for living together. As long as you are a member of this family you may keep this copy of Dwelling Together in Unity. If for some reason you find it necessary to leave the family, please turn this booklet in to the overseer in charge. We feel</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 19</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">sure that all will agree with the suggestions set out here, because they are based on the Scriptures, and by following them we will show our love for the organization and for our brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All of us would want unruly and obstinate persons dismissed from the home. (Prov. 12:7; 16:2830) Why have discord when the rest of us want to keep happy and enjoy the home? So it is best to send such ones away and let them live as they wish. We will live as Jehovah wants us to and we will show our gratitude for his undeserved kind ness in arranging for us to be here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The overseer in charge assigns each member to the room we want him to live in, and we sincerely hope that room- mates will get well acquainted and enjoy each other's good association. Remember, we all have different personalities, but since we are walking in the truth they are not so dif- ferent that we can't get along well together. Your room is your private home, so you should take care of it and you may make it as comfortable as possible. If you want to get additional furniture or hang up some pictures or cal- endars or put up drapes at the windows at your own expense always get permission first from the home overseer. If what you have in mind is within reason, and will not inter- fere with the cleaning of the room, permission will be granted. Also, you should always consult your roommate about moving in any additional pieces of furniture. Give consideration to the other person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No one should go into another's room without an invitation. Knock on the door, and if you are asked to come in, then enter; but if you receive no response, then you have no per- mission to enter the room. If you go to another person's room and you find him studying or doing some such work, it is good to inquire as to how busy he is. Maybe he wants to keep working so as to finish whatever he is doing Or, when you have visitors, if your roommate is studying or getting things ready for a meeting or for a public talk, take these things in- to consideration. You may find it advisable to go to the other person's room to carry on your conversation. The overseer in charge may visit the rooms at any time that necessity requires it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your becoming a member of the Bethel family is a blessed privilege. You should consider that Jehovah arranged for you to be here, that it was his organization that called You. Before you decide to leave Bethel it would be well to talk to one of the elders about it. Leaving the Bethel home is not a sin, and there are some good reasons for going away, but be sure these reasons are sufficiently strong. Never forget your first love for the Bethel home, and keep that love strong by engaging regularly in the field service, attending 20 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">meetings and keeping busy in your work. Learn to love your new home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you find it necessary to leave, we would appreciate your giving the overseer in charge a thirty-day notice in writing so that arrangements can be made to have some- one else come to take your place when you leave.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>MARRIAGE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">When individuals are called to Bethel it must be decided whether to select a single person or a married couple, a brother or a sister. Branch overseers make their recom- mendations to the president and get his approval before calling persons to Bethel, explaining why these ones are needed at Bethel. The work in the Bethel home requires healthy, strong persons, and usually young single persons are brought in for Bethel service. As a general rule the greater portion of the work can be best taken care of by brothers; of course, some kinds of work require sisters. As individuals remain at Bethel over a period of years, they naturally become more efficient, and the longer they are at Bethel the greater their love for it becomes. Bethel be- comes our home and we love it. As time goes on, however, the desire to marry may arise. It is a difficult thing for one who loves Bethel to decide whether he should give up his many privileges of service at Bethel for marriage, but in many instances a member of the family decides it is better for him to marry. The apostle Paul said: &quot;Let marriage be honorable among all, and . . . without defilement, for God will judge fornicators,&quot; and also that he that gives his virginity in marriage does well, but he that does not give it in marriage will do better.&quot; (Heb. 13:4; 1 Cor. 7:38) So each individual must decide for himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Any two single members of the Bethel family, both of whom have been at Bethel two years or more and who wish to get married and stay at Bethel, may make such request of the Society, and if approved by the Society, they may stay, but they must fill out new applications for Bethel, which new applications are for four or more years, beginning at the date of their marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Also, a brother or a sister who has been at Bethel for four years or longer and is interested in marriage, and who desires to bring a brother or sister into Bethel for the purpose of marriage, will have to get permission from the Society. Both of them must file applications to be at Bethel four years or longer, applicable from the time of their marriage. These applications are to be filled in and filed with the office of the president for review by the board of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">directors. The usual checkup will be made on both parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be up to the Society through its board of directors</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 21</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to make the decision as to who shall become members of the Bethel family under the above circumstances, and who shall remain in the family if they decide to get married.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the question arises in branches about bringing someone into Bethel from the outside for marriage to someone who has been at Bethel for four years or more, the application for Bethel service would first have to be presented to the branch overseer. However, before the branch overseer makes inquiry of the office of the president he would ask at least two other Bethel elders, preferably the factory and Bethel overseers, what they recommend and send their recom-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">mendaffons and his to the office of the president in writing. Each of these individuals will make his separate written recommendation on what should be done and why, whether all agree or not. What the local congregation elders think of the individual who wants to come into Bethel should be attached to the application also. A thorough review of the individual's qualifications should be sent along with the applications of both persons. It will be up to the board of directors of the Society to go over the material and decide whether the person will be called in or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a case where both members are in the Bethel family already, the brother and the sister, then the same above- mentioned overseers in the branch can make a recom- mendation to the Society as to whether they should stay or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, if other obligations arise after marriage or difficulties develop that prevent them from dwelling to- gether in unity, then the Society may have to advise on the course of action to take.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, if any member of the Bethel family who has served for the minimum time agreed wishes to marry some- one and live outside the family, we wish him Jehovah's rich blessing. His leaving, though, does not mean that he is leaving full-time special service. It may well be that some other privilege of special fulltime service can be his, like pioneering or maybe circuit work if he has the qualifications of an elder, and if his wife could join him in that work and carry on pioneer activity as a circuit overseer's wife. Perhaps Gilead could be his goal after some years of pioneer service with his wife, or maybe the special pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, when you come to Bethel we want you to stay and make it your life's work, if you can. But I know that many problems can arise in the lives of some that will cause them to leave. If your reasons are sufficiently strong in your own mind to cause you to leave Bethel, well and good; but I sincerely hope and pray that those who do leave will try to stay in the pioneer service. A person at Bethel re</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ceives good training over a period of years and this will equip him for other fulltime service. So, if one makes the request and can be used in some other special field upon leaving Bethel, it will be considered. Of course, he must meet the qualifications of having kept up with the family study of The Watchtower and the Theocratic Ministry School, kept active in the field service and kept doing his work well in the Bethel family. These are the things that will show those in positions of responsibility that he does have at least some of the qualifications that would help others in the right way. He should show a spirit or dominant attitude that is right with God's spirit at all times. He will find that the longer he is at Bethel, enjoying all of its privileges, the more he will be making his mind over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But no matter where you are, whether in Bethel, in the pioneer work, serving as a circuit overseer, in a missionary home or as a congregation publisher, we want to see you maintain your integrity and prove the Devil a liar. Just think of the joy that we can bring Jehovah! He said: &quot;Be wise, my son, and make my heart rejoice, that I may make a reply to him that is taunting me.&quot; (Prov. 27:11) So we ex- pect you to stay with Jehovah's organization because you want to share in the vindication of Jehovah's name and because you love life. Moreover, it is hoped that it will be at Bethel where you will accomplish that, now that you have come here and are one of our family.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>TELEPHONES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">The telephone is a very helpful instrument that can be used to our advantage. However, we would appreciate it if you would not use the business telephones for personal matters. You should arrange for your personal calls to be made at times other than working hours. If you do receive a telephone call during working hours, please make your conversation brief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The telephones in the office and factory are for Society business. However, if you find that you must make personal calls through them, please get permission first. You will have to pay the Society for the cost of the call. If you make any longdistance calls, you will have to ascertain the charge so that it can be paid to the Society. Strangers are not permitted to use the telephone except by permission of the one in charge. Please make your regular business con- versations brief, too, so that the wires will not be tied up, keeping other calls from coming through. If you have an inside phone system it should be remem- bered that this is to be used for business and not for visiting, during and after working hours. If, after 5:40 p.m., you want to talk to another brother in your building, then it would be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 23</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">better if you went personally to see him rather than phone and possibly disturb another brother who would have to try to locate him. You would appreciate the same consider- ation. After 9:00 p.m. the phones should not be used unless it is an emergency.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>VISITORS IN THE HOME</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Someone is appointed by the brother in charge to show visitors around the home. If you want to take someone through, you may get permission to do so; but if the one in charge believes it is best to have a regular guide take your party through, it is for him to decide. You cannot just take people around the premises of the Society anytime you want to. Please obtain permission each time. The overseer in charge is the one to decide what should be shown to visitors and he will arrange a regular route to follow during working hours. Before anyone can be invited for a meal or invited to stay overnight, permission must be obtained from the over- seer in charge. Arrangements should be made in advance. Please understand that if they are not, your request may not be granted. Visitors who are calling for just a short time will remain in the visiting room or lobby of the Bethel home until the one they are visiting is called and meets them there. Any person invited for dinner must be registered and he will be given a place to sit in the dining room with his friends in the Bethel family. Always keep in mind that we are limited in the number of guests we can have for meals because of space, cooking arrangements, pur chasing of food, etc. You should not invite visitors to meals on weekends when meals are served cafeteria style. There can be exceptions to this, but permission must be obtained, otherwise it may be necessary to limit your guest privileges for a period of time. After the meals or during the evening it will be permissible for members of the family who invite guests in to see them to take them to their rooms and to entertain them. All such guests must register &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; of the home, and at all times while in the home they should be accompanied by a member of the Bethel family. Of course, on such oc- casions nothing should occur in the rooms that would disturb other members of the family in the home. If any one is in a room alone with a member of the opposite sex who is not a close relative, they must leave the door wide open. Special arrangements can be made with the overseer in charge for you to have members of your own family who are Jehovah's witnesses stay overnight in the Bethel home. In some homes there may not be any available space, and 24 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY then, of course, we could not invite guests to stay overnight. But if there are some available vacant rooms and you have permission you may have your close relatives visit you on a weekend or during the week. When guests stay in the home they may have their meals with the family. In this way, members of the Bethel family can spend considerable time with their folks who are walking in the truth. Arrange- ments are not made to accommodate guests for more than two nights in the Bethel home, even though space is avail- able for a longer period, as it would work a burden on others of the family in cleaning the rooms, preparing meals, etc. Pioneers in good standing who are passing through a city where there is a branch office may make arrangements in advance with the overseer in charge to eat with the family there and to stay overnight if there is room. If any pioneer overdoes this, then permission would not be granted. We want you to make Bethel your home, and we want you to feel free to invite your friends who are Jehovah's witnesses to Bethel as your guests from time to time if you so desire. We feel sure that none of the members of the family will overdo this and misuse the privilege, but, if some do, then the overseer in charge has the right to decide whether restrictions should be put on those persons as to the number of individuals such ones may bring in as guests.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>WATCHMEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">In many parts of the earth we have very large buildings for the Bethel homes and factories and in such places there should be night watchmen. A checkup should be made in all parts of the building every two hours. He should check to see that the windows and doors are securely dosed and that no water is running in the toilets and sinks. The watchman can also be given other work to do, however, something that will not disturb the sleeping members of the family. In smaller homes, like regular dwellings where there are only five to ten persons or so who sleep there, there may be no need to have a night watchman. We leave this to the discretion of the overseer in charge. If there is no watchman in charge of the home, then, of course, everyone is respon- sible to see that windows and doors</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">are closed and locked when going in and out. In the evening before retiring, the home overseer or someone appointed should see to it that the main entrances are securely locked. Where night watch- men are assigned, a schedule should be made out for week- ends so that the watchman will be relieved by other mem bers of the family. This assignment for weekends will take in all the members of the family, with different ones being assigned at different times. Sisters may be put on duty</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">during the daytime and evenings, but for night watchmen always use brothers. Where there are many visitors or businessmen who come to the home, as at the headquarters of the Society, we have someone appointed to answer the door and care for the main lobby. This one should receive sufficient work to keep him busy in addition to caring for those calling.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>OTHER SUGGESTIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">All of us in the Bethel home fully appreciate that there must be an orderly arrangement and that someone must be in charge to answer questions and from time to time to make suggestions that will benefit all members of the family. When there is a branch organization, then the branch overseer is in charge. Other persons may be ap- pointed to assist the branch overseer, such as the office, factory, Bethel and home overseers. When these brothers who have positions of responsibility request you to do something or make suggestions about things that need to be done in the home, you should heed their suggestions and follow their counsel. These brothers who have been appointed and put in responsible positions are interested only in the welfare of the family and in the promotion of the Kingdom interests; and if we all work together with them we will have a happy family and all of us will dwell together in unity. From time to time it may become necessary for the overseer in charge to give some good advice to you. Per- haps you do not fully appreciate that you are disturbing other persons by your actions; and if such an occasion arises so that it is necessary for you to receive counsel, then accept it in the spirit in which it is given. It is to help you to get along better with your brothers.Gal. 6:1. Sometimes you will have problems. Coming into the Bethel home isn't going to remove all the problems from your life; it may even bring more. But as these problems arise it is well for you to talk about the difficulty to mature brothers, elders who have been in the family for many years. Maybe they can help you with it. Or, you can go to the branch overseer or the Bethel overseer and maybe he can help you. Those who live in the Bethel home in Brooklyn or at one of the farms the Society operates in the United States may always feel free to come to the president with their problems, and when the president visits branches the members of these families should feel the same way too. Those in Brooklyn Bethel or branches may always feel free to write about their problems if they think it necessary to bring them to the president's attention. I am not asking 26 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">you to write me letters I have plenty of mail; but if you feel that I can help I am certainly willing to try.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All of us want to be contented and happy, and we want you to stay at Bethel; so don't let some little, aggravating problem disturb your equilibrium and make you think, &quot;Well, now I have to go.&quot; Let's work out your problem together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are a lot of little details you are going to get ac- quainted with in Bethel life: where to put your laundry, where to keep Your clothes, how to take care of your bed on weekends, where to dispose of fruit peelings or garbage in the home, and other things. It may even be necessary to tell you how to open and shut a door, because sometimes persons like to bang doors and it isn't very considerate. But these are all little things that can be worked out be- tween you and the overseer, and from time to time it may be necessary for the overseer to announce certain regulations to keep the house activity running smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For example, about lights: We like to go to bed at a reasonable hour, and it seems that at 10:30 p.m. lights should be out. However, if your roommate is not at home and you want to read a little later, you may. But remember that you need your sleep too, and we want you to be at breakfast in the morning for the discussion of the day's text. It is good to get at least eight hours of sleep each night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">You will appreciate as time goes on that coming to breakfast is important to Bethel life. Sometimes we may find it very hard to get up in time for breakfast, but it is a good habit to start. For fifteen minutes on all working days we discuss the day's text in the morning before breakfast. Brothers and sisters are called on to comment. This arrange- ment is very helpful to our spiritual life. Give this fifteen minutes your undivided attention. It is more important than the meal. So always be down to breakfast; and it is beneficial to read the scripture and comment in the Yearbook before- hand. When you are called upon to do so, prepare a question and a comment, since we enjoy hearing you express yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Probably you came from a small congregation where you had to do the talking. Now you get into a large family where you will want to give others the chance to talk, too; but just because there are so many of us, don't be afraid to speak up. Remember, we want to know you and you want to know us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After our morning discussion is over we always have a prayer expressing our gratitude to Jehovah for his blessings and guidance on the organization. Then we go ahead with our meal. Near the conclusion of our meal we read the Yearbook or some article from The Watchtower or Awake! for five minutes. Then we have a general dismissal by means of prayer. We are grateful for Jehovah's provisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and give thanks to Him for all things. Whether we are eating or drinking, we do all things as to Jehovah.1 Cor. 10:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In different homes the times for meals may vary. At Brooklyn Bethel we have breakfast at 7 a.m., dinner at 12:15 p.m. and our evening meal at 6 p.m. On Saturday when we work one half day, and on Sunday, we have a cafeteria arrangement for the evening meal. On Saturday this is served between 5 and 6:30 p.m. Cafeteria breakfast Sundays is served between 7 and 8 a.m. Then we have extra supplies of food so that you can make some sandwiches to take to your room or out in the field service with you for your noon meal. On Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m. we have the cafeteria arrangement and you can come at any time during these two hours and enjoy a good, nourishing evening meal. If a branch office sees fit to change the hours for these meals on weekends because of local customs, the branch overseer will fix the hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If there is food remaining on the table after a meal you may take fruit, a sandwich or anything else on the table to your room for a later time. It is perfectly all right to take food with you when you leave the table; however, the dining room dishes and tableware are to be left in the dining room. Do not put any food in a dresser drawer or in a closet, and be sure the food you take is used the same day, unless you have some means of refrigeration. It is not good to have food in the room otherwise, because the bugs may think more of it than you do and start eating from it. It is hard to keep the living quarters clean and free from vermin if you have food around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I am sure that all of us will keep in mind that we do want our home to be neat and clean and tidy and that we will cooperate with the overseer in charge and with the housekeepers to keep it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Good table manners are always welcome and make the rest of us comfortable. It is good for brothers to speak with one another while at the table, but we should keep our voice at a low level so that other persons who want to talk can carry on a conversation too. However, when the one at the head of the table speaks, asking for a question, or giving information, then all should cease talking and listen to the chairman or others who may speak for the benefit of the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Included in good table manners is the passing of food. After serving yourself make certain to pass it on to the one next to you, until everyone has had the opportunity of being served. So that there will be an equal distribution of food, take only your portion, even though the dish being served may be your favorite.1 Cor. 10:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">218 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It isn't necessary to list a whole lot of do's and don'ts for brothers who love their neighbors as they do themselves. Take this example; I am sure you will appreciate it: You don't want to disturb other persons with your radio any more than you would want them to disturb you. Of course, if you have a radio or television or high fidelity system in your room you should use it just for your own benefit, not for all the neighbors; so it is good to keep the volume low, just loud enough for you and those in the room with you to enjoy it. Maybe your brother next door is preparing a talk and he cannot do it with music or other entertainment playing loud nearby. This is true of a lot of other little things; just be considerate. Peace and quiet are always appreciated by brothers living in any home.Isa. 32:17, 18.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>VACATIONS FOR BETHEL FAMILIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">All members of the Bethel family are allowed a vacation. Anyone who comes to Bethel before February 1 may have a two-week vacation (eleven and a half working days) at the end of the service year. Anyone coming after February 1 may take time equal to one working day off for each full month of Bethel service to the end of the service year. The time must be taken at one period during July, August or thereafter and cannot be split up. (Of course, if he has come from special pioneer, missionary, circuit or district work he will get his regular vacation for the year.) Members of the Bethel family who have been here from one to four years receive two weeks of vacation (eleven and a half working days); however, the time may not be taken until earned. ~o they may take the first week anytime after March 1, and they are eligible for a second week anytime during the last three months of the service year or thereafter. This two-week vacation time may be split into as many as four periods of time, including the usual convention period. They will always receive a number of days off for the yearly district assembly in addition to their two weeks of vacation for each year. The year runs from September 1 to August 31. Persons at Bethel for more than four years also get eleven and a half days of vacation a year, but may make as many splits of their earned vacation period during the year as they want. It is understood that vacations are granted only when they are earned. They can be taken a few days at a time, but must always be reported at least a week in advance to the overseer in writing, stating when the individual will be away. Even though a person has earned more vacation time than he is planning to use at one time, it shows his concern for the work being done at Bethel if he reports back to work at the time that he specified in the written vacation notice that he turned in before leaving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY 29</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Individuals in Bethel service who have served continuously for fifteen years, whether it be the pioneer, special pioneer, missionary, circuit or district work or Bethel, may have three weeks of vacation (seventeen working days) or if they are forty-five years of age or older they may have three weeks of vacation each year. Even during the service year when an individual completes his fifteenth Year of special service or reaches forty-five years of age, he may take the third week of vacation at any time following that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Persons in Bethel service who have served continuously for twenty-five years, including pioneer, special pioneer, cir- cuit or district work, missionary or Bethel, may have four weeks (twenty-three working days) of vacation, or if they are sixty-five years of age or older they may have four weeks of vacation each year. Even during the service year when an individual completes his twenty-fifth year of special service or reaches sixty-five years of age, he may take the fourth week of vacation at any time following that date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As stated above, after four years they may split their vacation time any way they wish, but the vacation time must be earned. If someone wishes to take one half day off on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Saturday as part of one's vacation or one and one half days, then that one will so report it in writing to the overseer, who will keep the records accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is understood that those entitled to two weeks of vacation may request in writing eleven and a half days working time off per year. Those with three weeks of vacation time will be allowed seventeen days of working</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">time off. Those who have four weeks of vacation time will have twenty-three days of working time off. Saturday after noon and Sunday are not considered working days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sharing Vacation Time: Married persons may not have been in the service the same length of time. One mate may have more vacation time due than the other. A married person is permitted to share his vacation time with his mate if he wishes to do so. In other words, if the man has three weeks' vacation due him and the man's wife only two weeks, he may give his wife half of the third week, and notation of this would be made by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Members of the Bethel family may accumulate vacation time if they wish to take a longer period of time at a later date. For example, if they want to save a week's vacation from one year to the next, that is agreeable, but you can- not borrow from a future period and try to use it ahead of time. The only exception to borrowing time would be an international convention arranged by the Society, where the Society arranges for the travel and notice is given to the whole family that they may borrow vacation time in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">30 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">advance. But then the matter will be definitely stated at that time. So please do not try to borrow time. Earn it .and enjoy it! Leaves of Absence for Gilead Graduates in Bethel Service: Leaves of absence are provided for some, but not for those in the forty-eight states of the continental United States, or Canada or certain persons in Europe. Each one will accumulate two weeks of leave time for each year of service after he arrived in his assignment following Gilead graduation. Such leaves of absence may be taken only after he has been in his foreign assignment for at least three years. This provision does not apply to any Gilead graduate in Bethel service who came to Gilead from the country in which he is now serving. Some of those who have been in Bethel service for a number of years will have accumulated quite a lot of leave time, but we would not want any to be away from the Bethel home for more than a total of ten weeks, whether that would be vacation time or leave time. Of course, people will not qualify for leave of absence if they take the three-week or four-week vacation each year. It seems reasonable that anyone from another country who requested the privilege of working at the Bethel home in Canada or the United States mainland would take his vacations the same as anyone else in the Bethel family, some of whom have to travel long distances to get to their home. In Europe the distances are not so great between countries, so for those there we would say that a Gilead graduate assigned to a branch in a country other than the one in which he was working when he came to Gilead does not get a leave of absence unless his place of origin is more than 2,000 miles from where he is assigned in Europe. Brothers working in small branches as part-time branch overseers will be allowed to take their leave of absence along with the other missionaries in the country. Bethel family members who are Gilead graduates do not receive allowance or bonus for the months when they are taking leave of absence. Emergency or family problems arise in the lives of some individuals. For example, there may be a death of a close relative in one's family and one may want to attend the funeral and help clear up the estate. If more than two days are required, then time in excess of the two days should be taken away from the regular vacation time. Individuals should discuss this with the overseer in charge. Therefore each branch office should have an accurate writ- ten record showing the number of working days taken as vacation time or other days off for each person, showing dates so used and any vacation time remaining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>ILLNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Persons who apply for Bethel are called only if they say they are in good health, which information is on their applications. If a new person's illness becomes chronic and the branch overseer knows it, then it would be better to send such person home during his first years at Bethel and not to keep him as a member of the Bethel family. Individuals who may become ill during their vacation time are not entitled to another vacation to replace the time that was specified in their written vacation notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If any member of the Bethel family who is here less than five years becomes ill and is ill for more than twenty working days, all of the days following the twentieth work- ing day of illness will be deducted from his vacation time. This applies only for the first five years of Bethel service. After that it no longer applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All members of the Bethel family when ill will receive their monthly allowance.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">I want you always to feel free to approach any of the overseers in charge. Don't be afraid of them; they are your brothers. Sometimes you may think: &quot;Oh, but they are too busy to talk to me&quot;; but don't feel that way about it. They are busy, yes, but never too busy to help you out. We are here to help you who have come here to help us to get the work done; so we will show you what we want you to do and we feel sure that you will put forth every effort, by Jehovah's undeserved kindness, to do it the way we show you. If you have a problem, come to us. Let's keep in mind that the overseer in charge is responsible before Jehovah and to the organization for the things that are done, so cooperate with him. If you have suggestions, we are willing to listen to them, but if after you have made your suggestion we feel we should not follow it and still think our way is better, then do it in the way the Society suggests. You will be happier in the long run. It may try your patience, but just think of the patience that God has shown toward each one of us, and then work on this Christian quality. Jas. 1:4; 5: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since those of us at Bethel are imperfect like the rest of our brothers, mistakes are going to be made and once in a while a person may violate the good principles on which the home operates. It might happen that you will be reproved; but when you are, keep in mind the counsel at Proverbs 27:5, 6: &quot;Better is a revealed reproof than a con- cealed love. The wounds inflicted by a lover are faithful, but the kisses of a hater are things to be entreated.&quot; Then again, the scripture points out: &quot;Should the righteous one</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">32 DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">strike me, it would be a loving-kindness; and should he re- prove me, it would be oil upon the head, which my head would not want to refuse.&quot;Ps. 141:5. We know that &quot;the reproofs of discipline are the way of life.&quot; (Prov. 6:23) God is going to reprove us when we do something wrong. But as we are making our minds over, studying God's Word, living in the family routine and en- joying everything that Jehovah has provided for us in this home, it will bring us great joy. If we follow Jehovah's instructions we shall be happy, just as it is set forth in Micah 6:8: &quot;He has told you, O earthling man, what is good. And what is Jehovah asking back from you but to exercise justice and to love kindness and to be modest in walking with your God?&quot; Of course, you are following this instruction, and that is why you are here. That is why Jehovah's organi- zation invited you to Bethel. You can show your love for Jehovah by serving faithfully here at Bethel. You will have a good feeling knowing that the course of action you are taking leads to eternal life in the new order. &quot;God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.&quot; (2 Tim. 1:7) It is our hope that everyone who has come to Bethel will keep in mind Jehovah's principles of truth and righteousness. Always &quot;trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding. In all your ways take notice of him, and he himself will make your paths straight. Do not become wise in your own eyes. Fear Je- hovah and turn away from bad.&quot;Prov. 3:5,7. I am very glad you came here and so are the overseers with whom you are working. Make it your home. Keep on in right living here and be trained for living forever under God's kingdom. Be assured of my love for you, and may Jehovah bless you richly. Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>
