<p><span class="font5">THE broadcasting of Judge Rutherford's lecture by</span><br><span class="font5">the National Broadcasting Company was con-</span><br><span class="font5">ceded even by our enemies to be the greatest hook-up</span><br><span class="font5">of broadcasting on earth. The response by the people</span><br><span class="font5">has been phenomenal. So great has been the demand</span><br><span class="font5">for copies thereof that we have determined to issue it in</span><br><span class="font5">the cheapest possible form so that the poor may have it.</span><br><span class="font5">It voices a declaration of independence of the peoples of</span><br><span class="font5">Christendom from that unholy alliance that has so long</span><br><span class="font5">oppressed them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We append hereto an introductory chapter setting</span><br><span class="font5">forth some of the sufferings of the common people, also</span><br><span class="font5">a concluding chapter showing the Scriptural reason for</span><br><span class="font5">the passing away of the World Powers. Both were written by Judge Rutherford. You will read this booklet</span><br><span class="font5">with great interest. You will want to keep it in your</span><br><span class="font5">homes and read it to your children.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>The Oppressed</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">T</span><span class="font6">HE common peoples of all nations have suffered</span><br><span class="font6">great oppression. Their real defenders have been</span><br><span class="font6">very few. By the common people are meant those</span><br><span class="font6">of the rank and file who labor with their hands and there-</span><br><span class="font6">by produce the wealth of the land. There was a time</span><br><span class="font6">when America was said to be an asylum for the op-</span><br><span class="font6">pressed. That day has gone! To what country could the</span><br><span class="font6">common people now flee and find protection, aid, peace,</span><br><span class="font6">freedom of speech and freedom of action? There is none</span><br><span class="font6">under the sun!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World War has furnished the common people of</span><br><span class="font6">Christendom with much food for thought, and they are</span><br><span class="font6">thinking as they have not heretofore thought. They are</span><br><span class="font6">beginning to realize that they must think and act for</span><br><span class="font6">themselves. They have been deceived for a long time by</span><br><span class="font6">those upon whom they relied. They cannot be deceived</span><br><span class="font6">always. They were told by those who represented selfish</span><br><span class="font6">interests that the Great War would make the world safe</span><br><span class="font6">for democracy. The result has been the very opposite.</span><br><span class="font6">With the ending of the World War practically all the</span><br><span class="font6">liberties of the common people have been taken away.</span><br><span class="font6">Big Business and professional politicians, aided and</span><br><span class="font6">supported by faithless clergy, have fastened the shackles</span><br><span class="font6">upon the wrists of the common people. They continue</span><br><span class="font6">to suffer and they are seeking the way of relief and</span><br><span class="font6">freedom. As an illustration of some of the things suf-</span><br><span class="font6">fered the following is here related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In June, 1914, in one of the northwest states of &quot;free&quot;</span><br><span class="font6">America, lived Jacob Christmann with his wife Martha,</span><br><span class="font6">Elsie his only daughter, and two sons, William and John</span><br><span class="font6">Christmann, twins. That was a happy family. Their</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">acreage was small but rich, and yielding to their hard</span><br><span class="font6">labor produced a sufficiency for them. Because of the</span><br><span class="font6">manipulation of the markets they found it difficult to</span><br><span class="font6">sell their produce at much profit; yet they were able to</span><br><span class="font6">get on, and they had the love and sweet companionship</span><br><span class="font6">of each other, and hence they were content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jacob Christmann was born in Germany and em-</span><br><span class="font6">igrated to &quot;free&quot; America when a mere lad. His older</span><br><span class="font6">brother, Henry Christmann, remained in Germany,</span><br><span class="font6">married there and reared several sons and daughters.</span><br><span class="font6">Martha MacDonald was born in Scotland and came to</span><br><span class="font6">America with her parents. She became the wife of</span><br><span class="font6">Jacob Christmann and the mother of the above named</span><br><span class="font6">Christmann children. Gilbert MacDonald, a brother of</span><br><span class="font6">Martha, resided in Scotland his native land and there</span><br><span class="font6">reared a family of sons and daughters, among them</span><br><span class="font6">Gilbert Jr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The three Christmann children in America from time</span><br><span class="font6">to time exchanged letters with their cousins in Germany</span><br><span class="font6">and in Scotland. For some time prior to 1914 the war</span><br><span class="font6">lords of Germany made it so burdensome for the Christmann boys that often they wrote their American cousins</span><br><span class="font6">of their purpose to come to &quot;free&quot; America to live and</span><br><span class="font6">thus escape the war and the burden of the war machine.</span><br><span class="font6">The American cousins spoke often with their parents</span><br><span class="font6">about their kinsmen across the sea, and of course there</span><br><span class="font6">was a great desire for personal acquaintance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In August, 1914, the World War began, and the</span><br><span class="font6">Christmann boys of Germany were hurried to the front</span><br><span class="font6">and, of course, that precluded their visit to America.</span><br><span class="font6">At the same time the British entered the war and</span><br><span class="font6">among those sent out to fight Germany was Gilbert MacDonald, Jr., the young Scotsman. It was therefore blood</span><br><span class="font6">relation sent out to fight blood relation in a deadly</span><br><span class="font6">combat and that without the desire or consent of either</span><br><span class="font6">one to fight the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After much agitation by subsidized American news-</span><br><span class="font6">papers and hired preachers America entered the war in</span><br><span class="font6">1917. At the instance of Big Business a conscription</span><br><span class="font6">law was quickly enacted by the American Congress.</span><br><span class="font6">Thereafter young Americans were not asked if they</span><br><span class="font6">wanted to fight but were told they must fight or take the</span><br><span class="font6">consequences, which consequences usually were imprison-</span><br><span class="font6">ment and cruel and unusual treatment at the hands of</span><br><span class="font6">the prison keepers. Among those drafted early in the</span><br><span class="font6">war by America were the Christmann twins, William</span><br><span class="font6">and John. A pall of blackness fell over the modest and</span><br><span class="font6">once happy home of the Christmann family. The two</span><br><span class="font6">boys were torn away from their parents and their only</span><br><span class="font6">sister. They were sent to war together and they tried to</span><br><span class="font6">stay together throughout the war. Upon the battle-</span><br><span class="font6">fields of France they saw much real military service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">For more than forty hours the great battle between</span><br><span class="font6">the Germans on one side and the British and their allies</span><br><span class="font6">on the other had been raging furiously. A fresh Amer-</span><br><span class="font6">ican division was sent to the front to relieve the remain-</span><br><span class="font6">ing men in the shattered lines of the allies, and in that</span><br><span class="font6">American division which went forward were the two</span><br><span class="font6">privates, William and John Christmann. A charge was</span><br><span class="font6">ordered; and the Christmann boys, together with thou-</span><br><span class="font6">sands of others, obeyed the command. William came</span><br><span class="font6">suddenly upon a German soldier lying upon the ground</span><br><span class="font6">and drew his bayonet to strike him through; but seeing</span><br><span class="font6">that the German was already mortally wounded William</span><br><span class="font6">did not strike. The dying man looked with pleading</span><br><span class="font6">into the face of William Christmann, who moved with</span><br><span class="font6">sympathy gave the German water from his own canteen.</span><br><span class="font6">The drink revived him. The wounded man then addressing William said: &quot;I am dying. Why have we</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fought? I had nothing against the French or English</span><br><span class="font6">and surely not against the Americans. I have some dear</span><br><span class="font6">cousins in America that I love much.&quot; Then William</span><br><span class="font6">inquired: &quot;Who are your American cousins?&quot; The</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">German replying in broken speech conveyed the message</span><br><span class="font6">to William by which the two men learned that they were</span><br><span class="font6">cousins, who had often communicated with each other by</span><br><span class="font6">letter. William's brother John was near by, and seeing</span><br><span class="font6">his brother with a German rushed to his side and learned</span><br><span class="font6">the real cause. At that moment a ball pierced William.</span><br><span class="font6">The two cousins, knowing that they had but a few</span><br><span class="font6">moments to live, affectionately embraced each other and</span><br><span class="font6">died in each other's arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Later the official report came to America which merely</span><br><span class="font6">read: William Christmann, killed in action. The sad</span><br><span class="font6">information was conveyed to his mother. She died from</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">a broken heart. It was afterwards learned that in that</span><br><span class="font6">same engagement Gilbert MacDonald, Jr., the Scottish</span><br><span class="font6">cousin, was also killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Christmann homestead in America was mortgaged. The family had depended upon the two sons to</span><br><span class="font6">pay the interest. The mortgage was held by a loan</span><br><span class="font6">company, financed by a few multimillionaires who pro-</span><br><span class="font6">duced nothing but required much of the produce of the</span><br><span class="font6">farm to pay their usury. The mortgage became due; and</span><br><span class="font6">no one of the Christmann family being able to pay the</span><br><span class="font6">interest or principal, it was foreclosed. Jacob Christmann and his daughter Elsie were compelled to leave</span><br><span class="font6">their home. No information had yet come as to the fate</span><br><span class="font6">of John Christmann, the other twin son. The war</span><br><span class="font6">ended and broken regiments of soldiers began to return.</span><br><span class="font6">But John was not with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jacob Christmann was a member of the Lutheran</span><br><span class="font6">church. The minister of that church denomination</span><br><span class="font6">where his membership was held had been among those</span><br><span class="font6">who preached the boys into the war and aided and</span><br><span class="font6">abetted in the enforced draft. It was difficult for Elsie</span><br><span class="font6">to understand how he could be a minister and consistent-</span><br><span class="font6">ly take that course. Elsie and her father had now found</span><br><span class="font6">a modest little house for their temporary residence. They</span><br><span class="font6">anxiously awaited some information as to John, hoping</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">that he had survived the terrible war. Many hours of</span><br><span class="font6">sad reflection were passed by her and her father. She</span><br><span class="font6">came upon him on one occasion and found him reading</span><br><span class="font6">the Bible. She plied him with a number of questions</span><br><span class="font6">amongst which were these: &quot;Does not America claim</span><br><span class="font6">to be a Christian nation? Is not Great Britain also one</span><br><span class="font6">that lays claim to being a Christian nation? Have we</span><br><span class="font6">not always understood that Germany claims to be a</span><br><span class="font6">Christian nation? Do not all these nations claim to serve</span><br><span class="font6">and follow Christ, the Prince of Peace? How can these</span><br><span class="font6">nations and the preachers in their churches claim to be</span><br><span class="font6">Christians and yet advocate war and compel the people</span><br><span class="font6">to go to war and fight and kill each other and to kill</span><br><span class="font6">their own blood relatives and that against their own</span><br><span class="font6">wish and consent?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The oppression upon this poor soul and the bitter-</span><br><span class="font6">ness that she had suffered caused her to propound these</span><br><span class="font6">questions to her father. She further said to him:</span><br><span class="font6">&quot;Father, who is responsible for this terrible war and</span><br><span class="font6">for the dreadful sorrow that has been brought upon us?</span><br><span class="font6">Can you support a church which claims to follow Christ</span><br><span class="font6">and which participates in bringing upon us such burdens</span><br><span class="font6">of sorrow?&quot; The father of course was unable to answer the question. He, too, was suffering great bitter-</span><br><span class="font6">ness of heart and was seeking consolation in the Word of</span><br><span class="font6">God. He had not found it in the church. The burdens</span><br><span class="font6">of oppression and sorrow became too great for him; and</span><br><span class="font6">shortly thereafter Jacob Christmann died; and Elsie,</span><br><span class="font6">alone, with no one to care for her, drifted away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The terrible fate that befell the once happy family of</span><br><span class="font6">Jacob Christmann has befallen thousands of other homes.</span><br><span class="font6">And what became of John Christmann? When the</span><br><span class="font6">hospitals began to give up their inmates, as the grave</span><br><span class="font6">some day will give up the dead, John was brought forth.</span><br><span class="font6">He was blind, one arm gone, and his feet so mangled</span><br><span class="font6">that he moves about only with the aid of crutches. He is</span><br><span class="font6">a helpless cripple so far as there is ability of man to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">aid him. Millions of other young men in Christendom</span><br><span class="font6">are in this same condition. They have suffered and con-</span><br><span class="font6">tinue to suffer, daily dying. Added to their bodily pain</span><br><span class="font6">is the mental anguish that this condition was forced</span><br><span class="font6">upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Did the common peoples of the nations of earth vote</span><br><span class="font6">on the question as to whether or not they should go to</span><br><span class="font6">war? No, not one of them! Did any one explain to</span><br><span class="font6">the common people the necessity for the great World</span><br><span class="font6">War of Christendom? No one! Who then is responsible</span><br><span class="font6">for the war? A few selfish and ambitious men desiring</span><br><span class="font6">to increase their power were willing to hurry millions</span><br><span class="font6">of human beings into death in order to accomplish their</span><br><span class="font6">purposes. A petty excuse was seized upon for declara-</span><br><span class="font6">tion of war, and the war began. Big Business con-</span><br><span class="font6">structed the machinery for the war and furnished the</span><br><span class="font6">initial money necessary to do so, knowing that they</span><br><span class="font6">would reap a thousand percent in return. The pro-</span><br><span class="font6">fessional politicians enacted conscription laws to make</span><br><span class="font6">the war machine work. The dishonest and faithless</span><br><span class="font6">preachers of various religious denominations, while</span><br><span class="font6">claiming to follow Christ, urged the people into war</span><br><span class="font6">and acted as war agents. Hypocritically they preached</span><br><span class="font6">war from their pulpits. In many instances they were</span><br><span class="font6">paid for so doing by the big financiers who desired the</span><br><span class="font6">war for private gain. The common people were forced</span><br><span class="font6">by them to bare their breasts to shot and shell and to</span><br><span class="font6">have their property and their lives taken away in order</span><br><span class="font6">to satisfy the wicked and selfish ambition of men. The</span><br><span class="font6">people are beginning to see these things more clearly.</span><br><span class="font6">There is reason now for the common people to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">RESULT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is the result of that World War? Everybody</span><br><span class="font6">knows that it has resulted in the destruction of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">democracy of the land and the taking away of the free-</span><br><span class="font6">dom of the people; and that it has resulted in a new</span><br><span class="font6">crop of millionaires in whose thoughts God finds no place.</span><br><span class="font6">It has also resulted in great corruption in the high</span><br><span class="font6">political offices and has proven that the clergy have de-</span><br><span class="font6">nied the name of God and Christ and that they are for-</span><br><span class="font6">saken by the Lord. It made it possible for selfish men,</span><br><span class="font6">high financiers, bootleggers, and preachers to fasten upon</span><br><span class="font6">the people a hypocritical and cruel prohibition law</span><br><span class="font6">which both the clergy and &quot;Big Business&quot; insist on en-</span><br><span class="font6">forcing against the common people while the &quot;High</span><br><span class="font6">ups&quot; openly violate it themselves. Men in high places</span><br><span class="font6">make and dispense illicitly intoxicating liquors. If one</span><br><span class="font6">of the common people is found in possession of a small</span><br><span class="font6">quantity he is severely punished. The unholy alliance</span><br><span class="font6">maintains customs officers at the border principally in</span><br><span class="font6">the United States to browbeat and insult innocent men</span><br><span class="font6">and women and to ruthlessly destroy their property,</span><br><span class="font6">abuse and humiliate them without even the semblance</span><br><span class="font6">of a cause or excuse. The war was seized upon as an</span><br><span class="font6">opportunity by the Devil and his unholy agencies to</span><br><span class="font6">fasten the shackles tighter and tighter upon the arms</span><br><span class="font6">of the people and take away their liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Democracy means a government of the people, for</span><br><span class="font6">the people, and by the people. No such government now</span><br><span class="font6">exists in what is called &quot;Christendom&quot;. On the contrary</span><br><span class="font6">in the land fraudulently called &quot;Christendom&quot; the gov-</span><br><span class="font6">ernment of the peoples is by the unholy alliance of &quot;Big</span><br><span class="font6">Business&quot; and big politicians supported by big preachers,</span><br><span class="font6">and in the interest of the unholy alliance and against</span><br><span class="font6">the interests of the common people. The oppression does</span><br><span class="font6">not stop there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Millions of money raised by oppressive taxation from</span><br><span class="font6">the common people are being expended in further prepa-</span><br><span class="font6">ration for war. The common people of no nation on</span><br><span class="font6">earth desire to fight the common people of another na-</span><br><span class="font6">tion; but the selfish ambitious men, few in number com-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">pared with the multitudes, are the ones who prepare for</span><br><span class="font6">war, compel the common people to bear the burden</span><br><span class="font6">thereof by unjust taxation and the further burden, op-</span><br><span class="font6">pression and suffering by laying down their lives upon</span><br><span class="font6">the battle-field. Is it any wonder then that the common</span><br><span class="font6">people now are beginning to ask themselves: What good</span><br><span class="font6">has Christendom brought to us? Can we ever hope or</span><br><span class="font6">expect to have any relief from our burdens brought to</span><br><span class="font6">us by or through Christendom? They are seeing and</span><br><span class="font6">seeing plainly that Christendom so-called is a fraudulent</span><br><span class="font6">name used to deceive the common people and hold them</span><br><span class="font6">in subjection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is it possible then for the common people to ever have</span><br><span class="font6">relief and freedom from any source? Yes; there is one</span><br><span class="font6">absolutely certain way and about that way the people</span><br><span class="font6">must now know. The time is at hand for the great God</span><br><span class="font6">of the universe to hear the cries of the common people</span><br><span class="font6">and to act in their behalf. It is plain from his Word and</span><br><span class="font6">from the facts before us that his due time for the peo-</span><br><span class="font6">ple's relief has arrived. It is therefore the time for him</span><br><span class="font6">to first give the people some knowledge of his purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">RADIO</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No man has ever been able to explain what radio is.</span><br><span class="font6">It is an unseen power by which the human voice is</span><br><span class="font6">carried through the air and a message given to others</span><br><span class="font6">in the far distance; but what it is man cannot say. Cer-</span><br><span class="font6">tain it is that God provided the radio because he fore-</span><br><span class="font6">tells it in his Word written by the prophet centuries ago.</span><br><span class="font6">(Job 38:35) The due time must come, in the unfold-</span><br><span class="font6">ing of his plan, for the use of the radio. That time has</span><br><span class="font6">come, and God will use it for the benefit of mankind.</span><br><span class="font6">God has repeatedly used human agencies to carry out</span><br><span class="font6">some of his purposes. It should be expected therefore</span><br><span class="font6">that God would use some human agencies to proclaim</span><br><span class="font6">to the people at this time his purposes concerning them</span><br><span class="font6">and that he would use the radio in connection therewith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those men and women who are wholly and entirely de-</span><br><span class="font6">voted to the Lord naturally would be the ones whom the</span><br><span class="font6">Lord would use as the witnesses. In his Word it is</span><br><span class="font6">written concerning such: &quot;Ye are my witnesses, that I</span><br><span class="font6">am God.&quot; (Isaiah 43:10, 12) The truth that is pro-</span><br><span class="font6">claimed is not man's truth but it belongs to God. &quot;Thy</span><br><span class="font6">Word is truth.&quot; (John 17:17) The Lord has made it</span><br><span class="font6">clear that he will not always turn a deaf ear to the cries</span><br><span class="font6">of the common people. It seems certain that his due</span><br><span class="font6">time is here to give ear to their cry.</span></p>

A religious organization is</span><br><span class="font6">composed of men and women who observe certain forms</span><br><span class="font6">and ceremonies in the acknowledgment of a supreme</span><br><span class="font6">power. The International Bible Students Association is</span><br><span class="font6">made up of a body of men and women who are Chris-</span><br><span class="font6">tians, fully consecrated to do the Lord's will. Of course</span><br><span class="font6">there are some amongst them who are not wholly devoted</span><br><span class="font6">to the Lord, while many of them are completely devoted</span><br><span class="font6">to God and his cause. These Christians have come out</span><br><span class="font6">from denominational systems because they love the Lord</span><br><span class="font6">and want to serve him. They have no selfish purpose</span><br><span class="font6">to accomplish. Knowing that the relief of the people</span><br><span class="font6">and their blessings must come from Jehovah God these</span><br><span class="font6">Christians are anxious to tell their fellow men about</span><br><span class="font6">God's gracious provision for such blessings. A real</span><br><span class="font6">Christian is one who follows Christ. The purpose of</span><br><span class="font6">Christ on earth is expressed in his own words: &quot;To this</span><br><span class="font6">end was I born, and for this cause came I into the</span><br><span class="font6">world, that I should bear witness unto the truth.&quot; (John</span><br><span class="font6">18:37) All true followers of Christ therefore must like-</span><br><span class="font6">wise be witnesses to the truth. They must tell the truth</span><br><span class="font6">in the love of the truth and for the love of their fellow</span><br><span class="font6">man. This being God's due time to have the witness</span><br><span class="font6">of the truth given all loyal Christians desire to have a</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">part in giving that witness. They want to please God</span><br><span class="font6">and they know that to please him they must do his will.</span><br><span class="font6">(Matthew 7:21) It is the will of God now that all na-</span><br><span class="font6">tions of Christendom be told about God's kingdom.</span><br><span class="font6">(Matthew 24:14) True Christians are faithfully en-</span><br><span class="font6">deavoring to obey this command of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The International Bible Students Association held its</span><br><span class="font6">annual convention for 1927 at Toronto, Canada, from</span><br><span class="font6">July 18th to the 25th. Christians came from many</span><br><span class="font6">countries to attend this convention and to participate</span><br><span class="font6">in giving the witness to Jehovah's name. A short time</span><br><span class="font6">prior thereto at a hearing before the Federal Radio</span><br><span class="font6">Commission at Washington, D. C., a condition arose</span><br><span class="font6">which led to the completion of an arrangement to broad-</span><br><span class="font6">cast an address by the president of the International</span><br><span class="font6">Bible Students Association from the Coliseum at To-</span><br><span class="font6">ronto. It came about in this manner: During a hearing</span><br><span class="font6">before the Commission the president of the National</span><br><span class="font6">Broadcasting Company, Mr. Aylesworth, was on the wit-</span><br><span class="font6">ness stand testifying in behalf of that corporation, which</span><br><span class="font6">operates three chains of radio stations in the United</span><br><span class="font6">States. He was being cross-examined by the president</span><br><span class="font6">of the International Bible Students Association. A</span><br><span class="font6">question was propounded to Mr. Aylesworth as follows:</span><br><span class="font6">&quot;Your purpose is to give to the people by radio the</span><br><span class="font6">message of the greatest financiers, the most prominent</span><br><span class="font6">statesmen, and the most renowned clergymen of the</span><br><span class="font6">world?&quot; To this Mr. Aylesworth answered in the af-</span><br><span class="font6">firmative. Another question was propounded to him:</span><br><span class="font6">&quot;If you were convinced that the great God of the universe</span><br><span class="font6">will shortly put in operation his plan for the blessing</span><br><span class="font6">of all the nations and families of the earth with peace,</span><br><span class="font6">prosperity, life and happiness, and that the great Creator</span><br><span class="font6">desired that this message be broadcast would you ar-</span><br><span class="font6">range to broadcast it?&quot; The answer was in the af-</span><br><span class="font6">firmative and led to an offer by the president of the Na-</span><br><span class="font6">tional Broadcasting Company to broadcast the address</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">of the president of the International Bible Students As-</span><br><span class="font6">sociation. The arrangement was made to broadcast from</span><br><span class="font6">Toronto, as above stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The attending facts and circumstances show conclu-</span><br><span class="font6">sively that the Lord made it possible for such a broad-</span><br><span class="font6">cast. No association nor any man could have arranged</span><br><span class="font6">it. It was the Lord who did it for his own glory. By</span><br><span class="font6">means of telephone wires fifty-three radio broadcasting</span><br><span class="font6">stations were tied together. The address was delivered at</span><br><span class="font6">the Coliseum at Toronto, transmitted by wire to radio</span><br><span class="font6">station WEAF, New York City, and relayed to other</span><br><span class="font6">stations to the number of fifty-three, reaching from</span><br><span class="font6">Maine to California, and from Canada to Mexico, and</span><br><span class="font6">including two super-power stations which easily reach</span><br><span class="font6">Europe, South Africa and Australia. In the language</span><br><span class="font6">of one of the New York dailies it was &quot;the greatest hook-</span><br><span class="font6">up in radio history&quot;. It was the means adopted to quick-</span><br><span class="font6">ly give a witness to Christendom of facts which they</span><br><span class="font6">know to be true when they hear them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">On that occasion the president of the Association</span><br><span class="font6">presented to the convention a resolution which is really</span><br><span class="font6">a message to the peoples of Christendom. His address</span><br><span class="font6">was in support of the resolution. He emphasized the</span><br><span class="font6">following points, to wit: That Jehovah is the only true</span><br><span class="font6">God; that Christ Jesus his Son is the Redeemer and</span><br><span class="font6">Savior of man and the rightful King of earth; that there</span><br><span class="font6">is a true Christianity composed of those men and wo-</span><br><span class="font6">men who faithfully represent God and Christ; that there</span><br><span class="font6">is a false, deceptive and fraudulent organization</span><br><span class="font6">called &quot;organized Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot; which</span><br><span class="font6">misrepresents God and in fact represents the Devil; that</span><br><span class="font6">God created all men of one blood to dwell upon the</span><br><span class="font6">earth and that there is no just cause or excuse for them</span><br><span class="font6">to engage in war; that the ruling factors of &quot;Christendom&quot; which in fact constitute &quot;Christendom&quot; are, to wit,</span><br><span class="font6">high financiers, professional politicians, aided and sup-</span><br><span class="font6">ported by faithless clergy; that this unholy alliance</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">produces nothing but lives upon the honest labors of</span><br><span class="font6">the common people and the common people have long</span><br><span class="font6">been oppressed by carrying such as a burden; that the</span><br><span class="font6">ruling element provokes war between nations for selfish</span><br><span class="font6">reasons and compels the common people to go to war</span><br><span class="font6">and fight and kill each other without any cause or ex-</span><br><span class="font6">cuse; that the people have long been oppressed and have</span><br><span class="font6">suffered untold misery at the hands of the rulers in Chris-</span><br><span class="font6">tendom and that without the support of the common</span><br><span class="font6">people Christendom could not stand; that the time has</span><br><span class="font6">come when the common people must forsake and for</span><br><span class="font6">ever abandon the fraudulent system of Christendom and</span><br><span class="font6">give allegiance to God and to Christ; that the kingdom</span><br><span class="font6">of heaven is at hand and that through God's kingdom</span><br><span class="font6">the people will receive their heart's desire, namely, peace,</span><br><span class="font6">prosperity, life, liberty and happiness; and that through</span><br><span class="font6">his kingdom the burdens of sorrow will be lifted from</span><br><span class="font6">the people, and they will be given joy and health,</span><br><span class="font6">strength and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So convincing and heart-cheering was the address in</span><br><span class="font6">support of the resolution that the great audience amidst</span><br><span class="font6">tremendous enthusiasm arose and unanimously adopted</span><br><span class="font6">the resolution, which resolution, together with the ad-</span><br><span class="font6">dress in support thereof, is set forth in the next chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the adoption of the resolution and the delivery</span><br><span class="font6">of that address thousands of letters and telegrams have</span><br><span class="font6">been received from every quarter of the American con-</span><br><span class="font6">tinent, requesting copies thereof. This booklet is adopted</span><br><span class="font6">as a means to get it to the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-variant:small-caps;">M</span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">R. ROBT.</span><span class="font6"> J. </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">MARTIN</span><span class="font6"> of New York City presided</span><br><span class="font6">at the meeting. In introducing Judge Rutherford</span><br><span class="font6">he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After hearing Judge Rutherford, you will desire to</span><br><span class="font6">have a copy of his lecture, that you may carefully con-</span><br><span class="font6">sider it at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">I am authorized to say, that any person in this, or in</span><br><span class="font6">the unseen radio audience, who will address a letter or</span><br><span class="font6">card to Judge Rutherford, Brooklyn, New York, re-</span><br><span class="font6">questing a copy of the lecture, will be mailed a copy,</span><br><span class="font6">free of charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among people in every walk of life, throughout the</span><br><span class="font6">civilized world, a profound interest in the stirring events</span><br><span class="font6">of the present day has been aroused by Judge Ruther-</span><br><span class="font6">ford's latest book, entitled </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance.</span><span class="font6"> For the benefit</span><br><span class="font6">of those who are in the audience here in Toronto, ar-</span><br><span class="font6">rangements have been made to provide a copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverance</span><br><span class="font6">at the conclusion of this lecture. See the ushers</span><br><span class="font6">on your way out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The thirty million volumes of Judge Rutherford's</span><br><span class="font6">books which are in the homes of the people everywhere,</span><br><span class="font6">constitute a sufficient introduction for him, both to this</span><br><span class="font6">audience and to the far-flung invisible audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is now my pleasure to ask Judge Rutherford to</span><br><span class="font6">proceed with his address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The speaker said: Mr. Chairman, my audience seen</span><br><span class="font6">and unseen: What I shall say here is in the interest of</span><br><span class="font6">the common peoples of earth, and especially in behalf of</span><br><span class="font6">those of Christendom. First, I offer the following resolu-</span><br><span class="font6">tion and then I shall speak in support of that resolution.</span><br><span class="font6">The resolution reads as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">RESOLUTION</span><br><span class="font6">TO THE PEOPLES OF CHRISTENDOM:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The International Bible Students in general conven-</span><br><span class="font6">tion assembled send greetings:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As Christians and witnesses to the name of Jehovah</span><br><span class="font6">God we deem it our privilege and duty to call your at-</span><br><span class="font6">tention to the following vital facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FIRST. That God made of one blood all peoples and</span><br><span class="font6">nations of men to dwell on the earth, and granted to all</span><br><span class="font6">peoples equal rights. There is therefore no just cause</span><br><span class="font6">or excuse for one nation to make war against another</span><br><span class="font6">nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SECOND. That the foremost nations of the earth</span><br><span class="font6">claim to be Christian nations and, taken collectively, they</span><br><span class="font6">constitute &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;organized Christianity&quot;,</span><br><span class="font6">so-called; that the men chiefly responsible for the claim</span><br><span class="font6">that these are Christian nations are the clergymen of the</span><br><span class="font6">various religious denominations, who call themselves</span><br><span class="font6">by the name of Christ but who in fact have denied him;</span><br><span class="font6">that their purpose of claiming that these nations are</span><br><span class="font6">Christian is to induce the peoples to believe that said</span><br><span class="font6">nations, although military and cruel, are the represen-</span><br><span class="font6">tatives of God and his Christ on earth; that such claim</span><br><span class="font6">is fraudulent and false and has turned the minds of</span><br><span class="font6">millions of honest people away from the true God and</span><br><span class="font6">from his Christ; that the invisible ruler of the nations</span><br><span class="font6">of &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;organized Christianity&quot;, so-called,</span><br><span class="font6">is Satan the Devil, who has fathered the scheme of form-</span><br><span class="font6">ing &quot;organized Christianity&quot; to deceive the people and to</span><br><span class="font6">keep them in subjection to himself and his agencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That the masses of the peoples of the nations are</span><br><span class="font6">entitled to self-government exercised by the people for</span><br><span class="font6">the general welfare of all; but instead of enjoying such</span><br><span class="font6">rights a small minority rules; that the money power of</span><br><span class="font6">the world has been concentrated into the hands of a few</span><br><span class="font6">men called high financiers, and these in turn have cor-</span><br><span class="font6">rupted the men who make and execute the laws of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nations, and the faithless clergy have voluntarily joined</span><br><span class="font6">forces with the high financiers and professional politi-</span><br><span class="font6">cians, and that said unholy alliance constitutes the gov-</span><br><span class="font6">erning powers that rule the peoples; that the masses of</span><br><span class="font6">the peoples acting under a misapprehension of the true</span><br><span class="font6">facts have borne up, carried, supported and maintained</span><br><span class="font6">organized Christianity; and that without the support of</span><br><span class="font6">the common people the unholy alliance constituting or-</span><br><span class="font6">ganized Christianity could not long exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THIRD. That for centuries the privileges enjoyed by</span><br><span class="font6">men have been wholly unequal and unfair. The multi-</span><br><span class="font6">tudes have produced the wealth of the world, but have</span><br><span class="font6">been unjustly deprived of the fruits of their labors. That</span><br><span class="font6">the leaders of Christendom instead of teaching the chil-</span><br><span class="font6">dren of men the doctrines of Christ, whom they claim</span><br><span class="font6">to follow, teach them to murder their fellow creatures;</span><br><span class="font6">and that now the rulers are amalgamating the common</span><br><span class="font6">people with the military, in order to make all the peo-</span><br><span class="font6">ples a part of and subject to their great war machine;</span><br><span class="font6">that by unjust laws the common people, contrary to their</span><br><span class="font6">own wishes, have been compelled to go to war against</span><br><span class="font6">each other, resulting in great sorrow and suffering, mul-</span><br><span class="font6">titudes of broken hearts and millions of untimely graves;</span><br><span class="font6">that &quot;organized Christianity&quot; has turned a deaf ear to</span><br><span class="font6">the petitions and entreaties of the people for relief, and</span><br><span class="font6">now the cries of the oppressed people have entered into</span><br><span class="font6">the ears of Jehovah God, and his time is at hand to give</span><br><span class="font6">the peoples deliverance and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FOURTH. That Jehovah is the only true God, the</span><br><span class="font6">Friend and Benefactor of the peoples. He has now set</span><br><span class="font6">his beloved Son Christ Jesus upon his throne, and bids</span><br><span class="font6">all the peoples of earth to hear and to obey him who</span><br><span class="font6">is earth's rightful King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">FIFTH. That the kings and rulers of the earth, to</span><br><span class="font6">wit: those constituting the said unholy alliance have</span><br><span class="font6">been duly notified that God has set his King upon his</span><br><span class="font6">throne and that his kingdom is at hand; but they refuse</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">to understand or to take heed, and they walk on in dark-</span><br><span class="font6">ness. Therefore God has decreed and declared that there</span><br><span class="font6">shall come upon the world a time of tribulation such as</span><br><span class="font6">never was known; and that during that trouble &quot;Chris-</span><br><span class="font6">tendom&quot; or &quot;organized Christianity&quot;, so-called, and all</span><br><span class="font6">of Satan's organization shall be destroyed; and that</span><br><span class="font6">Christ Jesus, the righteous King, will assume complete</span><br><span class="font6">authority and control and will bless the peoples of the</span><br><span class="font6">earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SIXTH. That it must be now apparent to all thought-</span><br><span class="font6">ful peoples that relief, comfort and blessings so much</span><br><span class="font6">desired by them can never come from the unrighteous</span><br><span class="font6">system of &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;organized Christianity&quot;,</span><br><span class="font6">and that there is no reason to give further support to</span><br><span class="font6">that hypocritical and oppressive system. In this hour</span><br><span class="font6">of perplexity Jehovah God bids the peoples to abandon</span><br><span class="font6">and for ever forsake &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;organized Chris-</span><br><span class="font6">tianity&quot; and to turn completely away from it, because</span><br><span class="font6">it is the Devil's organization, and to give it no support</span><br><span class="font6">whatsoever; and that the peoples give their heart's devo-</span><br><span class="font6">tion and allegiance wholly to Jehovah God and to his</span><br><span class="font6">King and kingdom, and receive full freedom and the</span><br><span class="font6">blessings God has in store for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">SEVENTH. For four thousand years the cherished</span><br><span class="font6">desire of Jews has been God's Messianic kingdom. For</span><br><span class="font6">nineteen centuries that kingdom has been the hope of</span><br><span class="font6">real Christians. It is now at hand. True to his prom-</span><br><span class="font6">ise God by and through the reign of Christ will lift the</span><br><span class="font6">burdens of the peoples, free them from war, fraud and</span><br><span class="font6">oppression, from sickness, suffering and death, and give</span><br><span class="font6">to them a righteous government and the blessings of</span><br><span class="font6">everlasting peace, prosperity, life, and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Upon the reading of the Resolution the following</span><br><span class="font6">speech was made in support thereof, which was heard by</span><br><span class="font6">15,000 in the Coliseum and broadcast throughout the</span><br><span class="font6">country. The speaker said:</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Freedom for the Peoples</span></h4>
<p><span class="font16">G</span><span class="font6">OD made of one blood all nations of men to dwell</span><br><span class="font6">upon the earth and gave to them equal rights.</span><br><span class="font6">Foreknowing the evil influence that would be</span><br><span class="font6">exercised over all governments of men God foretold that</span><br><span class="font6">a small minority would rule and oppress the great ma-</span><br><span class="font6">jority; that during that period of oppression and suffer-</span><br><span class="font6">ing the peoples would desire freedom and a righteous</span><br><span class="font6">government administered for the general welfare of all;</span><br><span class="font6">that they would be disappointed and suffer; that the</span><br><span class="font6">cries of the peoples would ascend unto God and in his</span><br><span class="font6">due time he would hear them; that he would deliver the</span><br><span class="font6">peoples from the oppressor into full freedom and give</span><br><span class="font6">to them a government of righteousness under which they</span><br><span class="font6">shall enjoy peace, prosperity, and the blessings of life.</span><br><span class="font6">Therefore he caused his prophets to write concerning the</span><br><span class="font6">present time these words: that &quot;the Lord</span><br><span class="font6">hath</span><br><span class="font6">prepared his throne for judgment; and he shall judge</span><br><span class="font6">the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment</span><br><span class="font6">to the people in uprightness. The Lord also will be a</span><br><span class="font6">refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble&quot;</span><br><span class="font6">(Psalm 9:7-9); and &quot;a king shall reign in righteous-</span><br><span class="font6">ness, and princes shall rule in judgment&quot;. Isaiah 32: 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only by the Lord's arrangement can freedom come to</span><br><span class="font6">the peoples. God's due time has now come when the</span><br><span class="font6">peoples of earth must know the truth concerning the</span><br><span class="font6">cause of suffering and the remedy for relief. All true</span><br><span class="font6">Christians are doing their part to tell these facts to the</span><br><span class="font6">peoples that God's name might be glorified and that</span><br><span class="font6">the peoples might know that their freedom is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;CHRISTENDOM&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foremost nations of the world jointly call them-</span><br><span class="font6">selves &quot;Christendom&quot;. The rulers by this term claim</span><br><span class="font6">that they are Christians, having and exercising faith in</span><br><span class="font6">God and in Christ, and that their combined govern-</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">21</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ments constitute &quot;organized Christianity&quot;. The claim</span><br><span class="font6">is not only untrue, but it is fraudulent and hypocritical.</span><br><span class="font6">By such false and hypocritical claim the multitudes of</span><br><span class="font6">peoples have long been held in bondage and have been</span><br><span class="font6">deprived of their just rights and privileges. God's due</span><br><span class="font6">time has come for &quot;organized Christianity&quot;, so-called,</span><br><span class="font6">to be placed before the people in the proper light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is a true Christianity composed of faithful men</span><br><span class="font6">and women who unselfishly follow in the footsteps of</span><br><span class="font6">Christ. There is an organized system called &quot;Christian-</span><br><span class="font6">ity&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot;, which is false and is the instru-</span><br><span class="font6">ment of oppression wielded by the hand of the Devil.</span><br><span class="font6">Jehovah through Christ established true Christianity on</span><br><span class="font6">the earth, and in the days of the apostles it progressed.</span><br><span class="font6">A few ambitious men, influenced and directed by Satan,</span><br><span class="font6">defiled true Christianity; and their fraudulent course</span><br><span class="font6">has made Christianity, as it is generally understood, a</span><br><span class="font6">stench in the nostrils of honest men. This exact condi-</span><br><span class="font6">tion God foretold through his prophet Jeremiah (2:20)</span><br><span class="font6">who wrote concerning professed Christianity: &quot;Yet I</span><br><span class="font6">had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; how</span><br><span class="font6">then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a</span><br><span class="font6">strange vine unto me?&quot; -Jeremiah 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Organized Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot; today is</span><br><span class="font6">Satan's organization fraudulently parading under the</span><br><span class="font6">name of Christ. Early in the history of man the Devil</span><br><span class="font6">caused men to call themselves by the name of the Lord</span><br><span class="font6">and to thereby bring reproach upon God. That same</span><br><span class="font6">Devil has caused ambitious and selfish men to organize</span><br><span class="font6">and carry on what is now called &quot;organized Christian-</span><br><span class="font6">ity&quot;. The purpose is to deceive the peoples, turn them</span><br><span class="font6">away from the true God, and to keep them in subjection</span><br><span class="font6">to a selfish and unrighteous system of government, of</span><br><span class="font6">which Satan is the invisible overlord. (2 Corinthians 4:</span><br><span class="font6">3, 4) A government that oppresses the multitudes of the</span><br><span class="font6">common people and shows special favors to the wealthy,</span><br><span class="font6">is an unrighteous government and therefore an ungodly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">nation. Such could not in truth be called Christ's king-</span><br><span class="font6">dom or Christendom. It is therefore apparent that when</span><br><span class="font6">the name of Christ is given to an unrighteous and op-</span><br><span class="font6">pressive government that name is fraudulently so used</span><br><span class="font6">and for a wrongful purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">WHO RULES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The kings and presidents of the nations are not in fact</span><br><span class="font6">the rulers. They are ordinary men filling their re-</span><br><span class="font6">spective places and are mere symbols of rulership. The</span><br><span class="font6">ruling power behind the seat of authority that shapes the</span><br><span class="font6">course of the nations of &quot;Christendom&quot; is Satan the</span><br><span class="font6">Devil. He is the opponent of God and the enemy and</span><br><span class="font6">oppressor of men. Satan's visible instruments are those</span><br><span class="font6">selfish men who combine and form a system of govern-</span><br><span class="font6">ment which rules and controls the peoples. The three</span><br><span class="font6">classes of men that make up these ruling powers are,</span><br><span class="font6">to wit, high financiers, called 'big business&quot;; profession-</span><br><span class="font6">al politicians, called &quot;statesmen&quot;; and the orthodox</span><br><span class="font6">clergy, called &quot;religious leaders&quot;, who manufacture and</span><br><span class="font6">dispense religion. These three classes in combination</span><br><span class="font6">constitute the small minority that rules. Disregarding</span><br><span class="font6">the obligations laid upon them the selfish men composing</span><br><span class="font6">the ruling minority have lived wantonly and recklessly</span><br><span class="font6">for their own pleasure and at the expense of the mul-</span><br><span class="font6">titudes. For a long time the peoples have borne them up</span><br><span class="font6">and supported them and thereby endured great suffer-</span><br><span class="font6">ing and sorrow. And now I submit the testimony of</span><br><span class="font6">their own witness which proves beyond a doubt that</span><br><span class="font6">&quot;organized Christianity&quot;, so-called, is a fraud and de-</span><br><span class="font6">ception, a great system of oppression, and a menace to</span><br><span class="font6">the general welfare of the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">HIGH FINANCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The multitudes, in the sweat of their faces, produce</span><br><span class="font6">the wealth of the world. High financiers are few in</span><br><span class="font6">number but great in power. They produce no wealth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">but obtain it through fraud and deceit practised upon</span><br><span class="font6">the peoples, and then use it for their own wicked plea-</span><br><span class="font6">sure and to oppress the multitudes and to keep them</span><br><span class="font6">under control. High finance fixes the price at which the</span><br><span class="font6">producer must sell his products to the distributer, and</span><br><span class="font6">also fixes an exorbitant price which the consumer must</span><br><span class="font6">pay to the distributer. High finance has established</span><br><span class="font6">chain stores all over Christendom, and the producer must</span><br><span class="font6">sell to these stores at a ridiculously low price or not</span><br><span class="font6">sell at all, and the stores in turn sell to the consumer</span><br><span class="font6">at exorbitantly high prices, which the consumer must</span><br><span class="font6">pay or starve. The producer gets but little, the consumer</span><br><span class="font6">pays much, and the high financiers that produce noth-</span><br><span class="font6">ing reap enormous and unreasonable profits. The re-</span><br><span class="font6">sult is that the small merchant is pushed to the wall,</span><br><span class="font6">and the chain stores do the business, and the peoples</span><br><span class="font6">pay the bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The financial record in the United States Treasury's</span><br><span class="font6">office discloses that in one year (1919) seventeen woolen</span><br><span class="font6">mills made a clear profit of 100 percent on their capital</span><br><span class="font6">stock; that corporations operating canning factories that</span><br><span class="font6">can the fruit and vegetables produced by the hard labor</span><br><span class="font6">of others in one year made a profit of 35 percent; that</span><br><span class="font6">clothing stores made a profit in one year of 98 per-</span><br><span class="font6">cent; that the aluminum trust with a capital of only</span><br><span class="font6">$20,000.00 in one year (1923) made a profit of 1000</span><br><span class="font6">percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The wealth of America is constantly on the increase,</span><br><span class="font6">but today in that land there are 524 banks less in num-</span><br><span class="font6">ber than there were six years ago. The large ones are</span><br><span class="font6">swallowing up the smaller ones. Big Finance is taking</span><br><span class="font6">possession of all. Kirby Page is authority for the state-</span><br><span class="font6">ment that 20,000 men control practically every bank,</span><br><span class="font6">trust company, and business enterprise in America.</span><br><span class="font6">From Samuel Untermeyer, the distinguished American</span><br><span class="font6">lawyer who for a long while represented Big Business,</span><br><span class="font6">I quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There has been greater concentration of the Money Power</span><br><span class="font5">in the past five or ten years ... than in the preceding fifty</span><br><span class="font5">years. The process of absorption is likely to continue until</span><br><span class="font5">a few groups absolutely dominate the financial situation of</span><br><span class="font5">the country. ... It has come to pass that less than a dozen</span><br><span class="font5">men in the City of New York are for all practical purposes</span><br><span class="font5">in control of the direction of at least seventy-five percent of</span><br><span class="font5">the deposits of the leading trust companies and banks in the</span><br><span class="font5">city and of allied institutions in various parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Federal Trade Commission in America in 1922</span><br><span class="font5">reported that six corporations controlled then one-third</span><br><span class="font5">of the American water power; eight corporations con-</span><br><span class="font5">trolled more than three-fourths of the anthracite coal</span><br><span class="font5">fields; and two corporations controlled the great portion</span><br><span class="font5">of the iron-ore reserve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These heartless corporations profit in the lives of</span><br><span class="font5">human beings. To them the life of man is nothing except</span><br><span class="font5">to be used for their selfish purpose. Recently it was dis-</span><br><span class="font5">closed that forty percent of the milk sold in New York</span><br><span class="font5">City is adulterated and that with the connivance of the</span><br><span class="font5">Public Board of Health. It is then sold at a large profit</span><br><span class="font5">to the poor, and the babes and the sick and the afflicted</span><br><span class="font5">suffer by reason thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These facts and figures I am giving as they relate to</span><br><span class="font5">America. Other nations of &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;organized</span><br><span class="font5">Christianity&quot; are equally as bad, and many of them</span><br><span class="font5">much worse. In every nation of &quot;Christendom&quot; the mi-</span><br><span class="font5">nority is favored and the great majority are oppressed</span><br><span class="font5">and suffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">STATESMEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The so-called statesmen of the nations are those who</span><br><span class="font5">hold the offices and feed at the public trough upon the</span><br><span class="font5">fat of the land, and of course produce nothing. Their</span><br><span class="font5">jobs depend upon obedience to high finance. In fact</span><br><span class="font5">high finance is the bulwark of &quot;organized Christianity&quot;,</span><br><span class="font5">so-called, and its power and influence have corrupted the</span><br><span class="font5">politicians of every nation. The politicians are the men</span><br><span class="font5">that make and enforce the laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before the last American Congress a bill was pending</span><br><span class="font6">to build a great dam at Boulder Canyon, in the Colorado</span><br><span class="font6">River, for the purpose of reclaiming millions of acres of</span><br><span class="font6">arid lands and to produce electric power for the benefit of</span><br><span class="font6">the public. Josiah T. Newcomb, solicitor for Big Busi-</span><br><span class="font6">ness that opposed the bill, declared:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I represent an investment of nine billion dollars and we</span><br><span class="font5">do not propose to let the government enter into the power</span><br><span class="font5">business at Boulder. The bill has no chance to pass. It</span><br><span class="font5">will not pass as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It did not pass. More than 120 million Americans</span><br><span class="font6">cannot reclaim the arid lands of the desert and produce</span><br><span class="font6">electric power for their own use without the consent of</span><br><span class="font6">a few heartless men who are known as &quot;Big Business&quot;.</span><br><span class="font6">This gang of highwaymen is a part of &quot;organized</span><br><span class="font6">Christianity&quot;, so-called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The corrupting hand of Big Business has been laid</span><br><span class="font6">upon men in high political positions and corrupted</span><br><span class="font6">every department of every government of &quot;Christendom&quot;. Senator Reed, of the United States Senate,</span><br><span class="font6">recently declared in a public address: &quot;The time has</span><br><span class="font6">come when the people should rise up and drive out the</span><br><span class="font6">leprosy of corruption which has spread through the na-</span><br><span class="font6">tion's capital.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The peoples go through a form of election supposedly</span><br><span class="font6">to select their public servants. But most of these politi-</span><br><span class="font6">cal statesmen are elected and controlled by the defiling influence of &quot;Big Business&quot;. From Mr. Justice Ford,</span><br><span class="font6">long in public life and who speaks with authority, I</span><br><span class="font6">quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In my experience I have found the public service cor-</span><br><span class="font5">porations, the street railroad, the telephone, the lighting</span><br><span class="font5">companies in particular, to be the most prolific source of</span><br><span class="font5">political corruption in the state. They are more directly</span><br><span class="font5">dependent upon governmental favors than any others, and</span><br><span class="font5">indeed the profits of their business flow from the special</span><br><span class="font5">privileges which they procure and hold from the govern-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ment, both state and municipal. In my day at Albany these</span><br><span class="font5">corporations plied their nefarious business of corrupting</span><br><span class="font5">the people's representatives so openly that a blind deaf-mute</span><br><span class="font5">could learn what was going on. Not that legal evidence</span><br><span class="font5">could be found against them. They were too shrewd for</span><br><span class="font5">that. But every public man there was morally certain as</span><br><span class="font5">to what was going on, and in private conversation it was</span><br><span class="font5">freely talked about. These public service corporations</span><br><span class="font5">pollute the very fountains of public virtue; they debauch</span><br><span class="font5">our public servants; they subsidize party organizations for</span><br><span class="font5">their own purposes. All the powers of government are</span><br><span class="font5">subverted to their base ends; and government of the peo-</span><br><span class="font5">ple, by the people, for the people, is made a mockery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even the courts are corrupted by Big Business. When</span><br><span class="font5">Big Business is pitted against the common people the</span><br><span class="font5">people have no show in the courts. The words of Mr.</span><br><span class="font5">Untermeyer are pertinent on this point:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nowhere in our social fabric is the discrimination be-</span><br><span class="font5">tween the rich and the poor so emphasized to the average</span><br><span class="font5">citizen as at the bar of justice. Nowhere should it be less.</span><br><span class="font5">... Money secures the ablest and most adroit counsel.</span><br><span class="font5">... Evidence can be gathered from every source. The poor</span><br><span class="font5">must be content to forego all these advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When &quot;Big Business&quot; desires to increase its holdings,</span><br><span class="font5">and war seems to be advantageous to its selfish interests,</span><br><span class="font5">it does not hesitate to provoke war between the peoples</span><br><span class="font5">of different nations. At the bidding of &quot;Big Finance&quot;</span><br><span class="font5">the politicians enact the necessary conscription laws</span><br><span class="font5">which compel the common people from all parts of</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;Christendom&quot; to kill each other while the representatives</span><br><span class="font5">of &quot;Big Business&quot; and their allies hide in their holes.</span><br><span class="font5">When the war is over, millions of the common people</span><br><span class="font5">sleep in the dust of the earth; and within the brief</span><br><span class="font5">period of blood and carnage there has been born another</span><br><span class="font5">crop of millionaires, and then there follows greater law-</span><br><span class="font5">lessness amongst the politicians than ever before. Upon</span><br><span class="font5">this point a member of the United States Senate, Mr.</span><br><span class="font5">Norris, is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The millions of our youth who went into that orgy of</span><br><span class="font5">murder were promised a new and better order of things.</span><br><span class="font5">Here, ten years later, they can see special privilege and the</span><br><span class="font5">power of money more securely enthroned than ever in the</span><br><span class="font5">seats of the mighty. For the thousands of our young men</span><br><span class="font5">killed, for our billions spent, for the countless millions of</span><br><span class="font5">heartaches, we have what? We have political corruption</span><br><span class="font5">such as was never dreamed of before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These conscienceless politicians defiled by Big Busi-</span><br><span class="font6">ness and the oppressors of the people constitute a part</span><br><span class="font6">of &quot;organized Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot;, so called.</span><br><span class="font6">that rule and control the peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">THE CLERGY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Who are the responsible ones for naming the harsh,</span><br><span class="font6">cruel and paternalistic governments &quot;Christendom&quot; or</span><br><span class="font6">&quot;organized Christianity&quot;? I answer: The clergy of the</span><br><span class="font6">various denominations. Ambitious for the approval and</span><br><span class="font6">plaudits of men and with a desire to live in ease and</span><br><span class="font6">comfort they have joined affinity with Big Business</span><br><span class="font6">and professional politicians. The clergy pose before the</span><br><span class="font6">peoples as representatives of God and of his Christ and</span><br><span class="font6">hypocritically induce the peoples to believe that they</span><br><span class="font6">are Christians, and at the same time go exactly contrary</span><br><span class="font6">to the Word of God. Jesus declared that Satan the Devil</span><br><span class="font6">is the prince or ruler of this world and that he is the</span><br><span class="font6">opponent of God. (John 14:30) Again in 2 Corinthians</span><br><span class="font6">4:3,4 it is written that Satan is the god of this evil</span><br><span class="font6">world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The world means organized forms of government</span><br><span class="font6">under the supervision of the invisible overlord, Satan</span><br><span class="font6">the Devil. In God's Word it is written (James 4:4)</span><br><span class="font6">that he who is a friend of the world is the enemy of</span><br><span class="font6">God. The clergy have voluntarily become a part of the</span><br><span class="font6">world and friends thereof and therefore the enemies of</span><br><span class="font6">God and of Christ and the enemies and oppressors of</span><br><span class="font6">the common peoples. They call themselves and their</span><span class="font5">allies, &quot;Big Business&quot; and professional politicians, &quot;or-</span><br><span class="font5">ganized Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christendom,&quot; and have the</span><br><span class="font5">effrontery to claim that these rule by divine right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In God's Word true religion is defined in these words:</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,</span><br><span class="font5">and to keep himself unspotted from the world.&quot; Con-</span><br><span class="font5">trary to this plain statement of the Word of God the</span><br><span class="font5">clergy not only fail to comfort the widows and orphans</span><br><span class="font5">but they advocate war, preach men into the trenches to</span><br><span class="font5">die, and thereby make millions of widows and more mil-</span><br><span class="font5">lions fatherless children. Instead of keeping themselves</span><br><span class="font5">unspotted from the world they are literally spotted all</span><br><span class="font5">over by the world because they are a part of it. In the</span><br><span class="font5">recent World War their church edifices were recruiting</span><br><span class="font5">stations, and almost every clergyman advocated the shed-</span><br><span class="font5">ding of human blood. For this reason God, through his</span><br><span class="font5">prophet, says of and concerning them now: &quot;For in thy</span><br><span class="font5">skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor inno-</span><br><span class="font5">cents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon</span><br><span class="font5">all these.&quot; (Jeremiah 2:34) What class of men wear</span><br><span class="font5">skirts except the preachers or clergy? They are the</span><br><span class="font5">guilty ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Upon this point I submit the following indisputable</span><br><span class="font5">facts: Admiral Fiske during the World War said: &quot;The</span><br><span class="font5">Christian religion is at this moment being made to exert</span><br><span class="font5">a powerful influence, not toward peace but toward war.&quot;</span><br><span class="font5">Secretary of War Lane said: &quot;The War could not have</span><br><span class="font5">been won without the churches.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ, whose name these clergymen have fraudulent-</span><br><span class="font5">ly assumed and by which they have named their &quot;or-</span><br><span class="font5">ganized Christianity&quot;, said: &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot;</span><br><span class="font5">But the clergymen are the most ardent advocates of war</span><br><span class="font5">and the most vehement and vindictive in their expres-</span><br><span class="font5">sions against their fellow men. Before America entered</span><br><span class="font5">the World War an election for mayor in the city of</span><br><span class="font5">New York was being held. One candidate was opposed</span><br><span class="font5">to America entering the war. The distinguished clergy-</span><span class="font6">man, Dr. Van Dyke, on that occasion said: &quot;I'd hang</span><br><span class="font6">everyone. whether or not he be a candidate for mayor,</span><br><span class="font6">who lifts his voice against America entering the war.&quot;</span><br><span class="font6">And this is a sample of the dispensers of religion from</span><br><span class="font6">&quot;organized Christianity&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. Chas. Ganster from his American pulpit &quot;ad-</span><br><span class="font6">vocated the organization of an association to murder</span><br><span class="font6">those persons who do not stand up when the Star</span><br><span class="font6">Spangled Banner is played&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The clergymen of Germany told the people that they</span><br><span class="font6">represented the same God and the same Christ that the</span><br><span class="font6">clergymen of England and America represented. Al-</span><br><span class="font6">though Christ is the Prince of Peace. and declares</span><br><span class="font6">against killing, the clergymen of Germany urged their</span><br><span class="font6">people to kill in the most fiendish manner the common</span><br><span class="font6">people of the allied armies of Britain. Likewise the</span><br><span class="font6">clergymen of Britain and her allies urged the killing of</span><br><span class="font6">the German people and their allies, and the clergymen</span><br><span class="font6">of both sides tried to induce the people to believe that</span><br><span class="font6">they are Christians. In proof that the clergymen are a</span><br><span class="font6">part of the world and the allies of &quot;Big Business&quot; that</span><br><span class="font6">makes war I read the testimony of the Rev. George</span><br><span class="font6">Parkin Atwater, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The complete representative of the American Church in</span><br><span class="font5">France is the United States Army overseas. Yes, an army,</span><br><span class="font5">with its cannon and rifles and machine guns. and its in-</span><br><span class="font5">struments of destruction. The Church militant, sent. mor-</span><br><span class="font5">ally equipped, strengthened and encouraged. approved and</span><br><span class="font5">blessed, by the Church at home. The army today is the</span><br><span class="font5">Church in action, transforming the will of the Church into</span><br><span class="font5">deeds, expressing the moral judgment of the Church in</span><br><span class="font5">smashing blows. Its worship has its vigil in the trenches.</span><br><span class="font5">and its fasts and feasts: its prayers are in acts. and its</span><br><span class="font5">choir is the crash of cannon and the thrilling ripple of ma-</span><br><span class="font5">chine guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Dr. Newell Dwight Hillis, pastor of Plymouth Church,</span><br><span class="font6">Brooklyn, was one of the most vehement advocates of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America entering the World War. Did he act upon the</span><br><span class="font5">authority of Christ? No; not Hillis. The American</span><br><span class="font5">Bankers Association commissioned him as a missionary</span><br><span class="font5">to Europe. He did the bidding of that heartless and</span><br><span class="font5">cruel financial association. He prepared the sermons</span><br><span class="font5">which hundreds of thousands of other pastors through-</span><br><span class="font5">out America delivered, advocating war, urging the young</span><br><span class="font5">men into the trenches and the people to buy bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Dr. Hillis was not content with urging men into the</span><br><span class="font5">jaws of death by which he earned and drew his pay</span><br><span class="font5">from the American Bankers Association, but went to</span><br><span class="font5">the extreme in expressing his malice. When the war had</span><br><span class="font5">ended, instead of visiting the widows and the fatherless</span><br><span class="font5">and bringing them comfort, as Christ had commanded,</span><br><span class="font5">Hillis still breathing vengeance of blood against an un-</span><br><span class="font5">fortunate and helpless people wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Society has organized itself against the rattlesnake and</span><br><span class="font5">the yellow fever. Shepherds have entered into a con-</span><br><span class="font5">spiracy to exterminate the wolves. The Boards of Health</span><br><span class="font5">are planning to wipe out typhoid, cholera and the black</span><br><span class="font5">plague. Not otherwise, lovers of their fellow man have</span><br><span class="font5">finally become perfectly hopeless with reference to the Ger-</span><br><span class="font5">man people. They have no more relation to the civilization</span><br><span class="font5">of 1918 than an orang-outang, a gorilla, a Judas, a hyena, a</span><br><span class="font5">thumbscrew, or a scalping knife in the hands of a savage.</span><br><span class="font5">These brutes must be cast out of society.... There will</span><br><span class="font5">shortly be held a meeting of surgeons in this country. A</span><br><span class="font5">copy of the preliminary call lies before me. The plan to be</span><br><span class="font5">discussed is based upon the Indiana State law. That law</span><br><span class="font5">authorizes a State Board of Surgeons to use upon the</span><br><span class="font5">person of confirmed criminals and hopeless Idiots the new</span><br><span class="font5">painless method of sterilizing the men. These surgeons are</span><br><span class="font5">preparing to advocate the calling of a world conference to</span><br><span class="font5">consider the sterilization of 10,000,000 German soldiers and</span><br><span class="font5">the segregation of their women, that when this generation</span><br><span class="font5">of Germans goes, civilized cities, states and faces may be</span><br><span class="font5">rid of this awful cancer that must be cut clean out of the</span><br><span class="font5">body of society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No general, no man in the army, nor any war lord</span><br><span class="font6">ever gave utterance to such diabolical and wicked words</span><br><span class="font6">as those written by Hillis. These clergymen are the ones</span><br><span class="font6">who, with pious faces and sanctimonious words, tell the</span><br><span class="font6">peoples that their organized system of oppression and</span><br><span class="font6">murder represents Christ on earth and therefore con-</span><br><span class="font6">stitutes &quot;organized Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot;.</span><br><span class="font6">They have been defaming the name of God and of Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A few ultra-selfish men constitute &quot;Big Business&quot;, and</span><br><span class="font6">they control the commerce of the world. They do it by</span><br><span class="font6">the power of money unjustly wrung from the hands of</span><br><span class="font6">the multitudes of toilers. They control the elections be-</span><br><span class="font6">cause the politicians elected to office enact and enforce</span><br><span class="font6">such laws as they want. They own and control the pub-</span><br><span class="font6">lic press and publish only what they desire the peoples</span><br><span class="font6">to read. This lecture I am now giving will not be pub-</span><br><span class="font6">lished by them because they do not want the peoples to</span><br><span class="font6">hear it. The radio, which God has brought to light for</span><br><span class="font6">the benefit of the peoples, the same selfish interest is now</span><br><span class="font6">seeking to control. The same power controls the clergy</span><br><span class="font6">and uses them for selfish purposes. In time of war they</span><br><span class="font6">use the clergy as recruiting officers to hurry men into</span><br><span class="font6">the jaws of death. This is the unholy alliance that</span><br><span class="font6">hypocritically calls itself by the name of Christ and has</span><br><span class="font6">induced the peoples to believe that it is the political</span><br><span class="font6">expression of God's kingdom on earth. On the contrary</span><br><span class="font6">the Scriptures declare this unholy alliance to be a part</span><br><span class="font6">of Babylon and of the Devil's organization. All nations</span><br><span class="font6">have been made blind drunk by its false representations</span><br><span class="font6">and teachings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the unholy alliance is pursuing a systematic</span><br><span class="font6">campaign to amalgamate the common people of all</span><br><span class="font6">Christendom into great military organizations. The false</span><br><span class="font6">slogan of the World War was that it would &quot;make the</span><br><span class="font6">world safe for Democracy&quot;. Every sane man knows that</span><br><span class="font6">it destroyed democracy. &quot;Big Business&quot; and its allies</span><br><span class="font6">now hope to hold the common people in subjection by</span><br><span class="font6">making them a part of the harsh and cruel war machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hopeless</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Succeeding in this the Devil, in his ghoulish glee, and</span><br><span class="font5">to the reproach of God and Christ, would say: &quot;This</span><br><span class="font5">is Christendom or organized Christianity.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BURDEN BEARERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The unholy alliance called &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;or-</span><br><span class="font5">ganized Christianity&quot; for its support and maintenance</span><br><span class="font5">depends upon the multitudes of the common peoples. It</span><br><span class="font5">holds up the peoples and robs them of their just rights.</span><br><span class="font5">and the fruits of their honest labors, Without the con-</span><br><span class="font5">sent of the multitudes of peoples the poor are forced to</span><br><span class="font5">fight and to kill their fellow man without a just cause</span><br><span class="font5">or excuse. This &quot;organized Christianity&quot;, fraudulently</span><br><span class="font5">so-called, has caused the common peoples to bear great</span><br><span class="font5">burdens of unjust taxation in order that the few might</span><br><span class="font5">live wantonly and recklessly. It has caused the peoples</span><br><span class="font5">to bear the burdens of war that a few might gratify</span><br><span class="font5">their selfish desires. The multitudes of suffering ones,</span><br><span class="font5">with bent bodies and broken hearts, have gone into un-</span><br><span class="font5">timely graves. Those not supporting the unholy alliance</span><br><span class="font5">are told by the clergy that to them death is but the</span><br><span class="font5">opening of the gates of a burning hell wherein their</span><br><span class="font5">torture will never end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">HOPELESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The great desire of the peoples is for peace and pros-</span><br><span class="font5">perity and life in a state of happiness. It is now ap-</span><br><span class="font5">parent that there is no hope of the peoples' realizing</span><br><span class="font5">their desires by anything that &quot;organized Christianity&quot;</span><br><span class="font5">can give them. &quot;Organized Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christen-</span><br><span class="font5">dom&quot;, instead of being the friend and benefactor of the</span><br><span class="font5">multitudes, is the enemy and oppressor of the common</span><br><span class="font5">peoples. With great pomp and glory that unholy system</span><br><span class="font5">rides upon the backs of the peoples, Without the sup-</span><br><span class="font5">port of the common peoples that wicked system called</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;Christendom&quot; could not survive. When the peoples</span><br><span class="font5">withdraw their support therefrom, &quot;organized Christian-</span></p><img src="1927_fp_E_files/1927_fp_E-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:41pt;height:52pt;">
<p><span class="font6">ity&quot;, which is a part of Babylon or the Devil's organization,</span><br><span class="font6">will fall like a great millstone into the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">GOD THE PEOPLES' FRIEND</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is one true and almighty God. Jehovah of Hosts</span><br><span class="font6">is his name. He is the Friend and Benefactor of man.</span><br><span class="font6">Through his Christ and his kingdom of righteousness</span><br><span class="font6">he will grant to the honest peoples of earth their heart's</span><br><span class="font6">desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God created the first man perfect. Because man vio-</span><br><span class="font6">lated God's law he was sentenced to death. Thereafter</span><br><span class="font6">his children were born; hence they were born sinners and</span><br><span class="font6">imperfect and without the right to life. (Romans 5:12;</span><br><span class="font6">Psalm 51:5) God in his loving kindness promised to</span><br><span class="font6">produce a &quot;seed&quot; through which all the nations of the</span><br><span class="font6">earth shall be blessed. (Genesis 22:18-22) Then he</span><br><span class="font6">made it clear that Christ is that promised &quot;seed&quot; and</span><br><span class="font6">that there is no other name whereby men can be saved.</span><br><span class="font6">-Galatians 3:16-19; Acts 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God so loved the world of mankind that he sent his</span><br><span class="font6">beloved Son to earth and permitted him to die that man</span><br><span class="font6">might have an opportunity to live. (John 3:16) Jesus</span><br><span class="font6">Christ died for all men and all men must know that fact</span><br><span class="font6">in God's due time.-Hebrews 2:9; 1 Timothy 2:3-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christ means the Anointed One of God, the Messiah,</span><br><span class="font6">the One appointed by Jehovah through whom the prom-</span><br><span class="font6">ised blessings must come to the people. For the purpose</span><br><span class="font6">of deceiving the peoples and turning their minds away</span><br><span class="font6">from God and his gracious provision for their blessing,</span><br><span class="font6">Satan the Devil organized the false and wicked system</span><br><span class="font6">made up of &quot;Big Business&quot;, professional politicians, and</span><br><span class="font6">faithless preachers, and calls it by the name of &quot;organized</span><br><span class="font6">Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot;. That wicked system</span><br><span class="font6">now controls and for a long time has controlled and op-</span><br><span class="font6">pressed the common peoples of the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By his Word God discloses that he would not interfere</span><br><span class="font6">with Satan's nefarious work until the end of the world,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God the Peoples' Friend</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">at which time Christ Jesus, his beloved Son and earth's</span><br><span class="font5">rightful King, should come into possession of the af-</span><br><span class="font5">fairs of man and rule and bless the peoples of the earth.</span><br><span class="font5">That world ended with 1914, and according to the Lord's</span><br><span class="font5">prophecy was marked by the World War, famine, pes-</span><br><span class="font5">tilence. revolutions, return of the Jews to Palestine, and</span><br><span class="font5">by general distress and perplexity now existing on earth.</span><br><span class="font5">(Matthew 24:3-22; Luke 21:10-26) A period of time</span><br><span class="font5">elapses from the beginning of sorrows, which marks the</span><br><span class="font5">end of the world. until the final end thereof, during</span><br><span class="font5">which the message of the kingdom must be proclaimed</span><br><span class="font5">to the peoples. Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now God has set his Son Christ upon his throne, as</span><br><span class="font5">foretold by his prophet in the Second Psalm, and bids</span><br><span class="font5">all the nations and peoples of earth to hear and obey</span><br><span class="font5">him. The old world has ended and God's kingdom is at</span><br><span class="font5">hand. The rulers of the earth were duly served with</span><br><span class="font5">notice of this fact a year ago. The unholy alliance has</span><br><span class="font5">received due notice thereof. But instead of heeding</span><br><span class="font5">the message from the Word of God the rulers of the</span><br><span class="font5">world. to wit. those constituting the unholy alliance,</span><br><span class="font5">walk on in darkness and continue to oppress the peoples.</span><br><span class="font5">The doom of &quot;organized Christianity&quot; or Babylon is</span><br><span class="font5">sealed! The groans and cries of the peoples oppressed</span><br><span class="font5">by that wicked system have ascended up to the God of</span><br><span class="font5">heaven. To the oppressors composing that evil system</span><br><span class="font5">the great Jehovah now says: &quot;Go to now, ye rich men,</span><br><span class="font5">weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon</span><br><span class="font5">you. Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are</span><br><span class="font5">motheaten. Your gold and silver is cankered; and the</span><br><span class="font5">rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall</span><br><span class="font5">eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure</span><br><span class="font5">together for the last days. Behold, the hire of the la-</span><br><span class="font5">borers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you</span><br><span class="font5">kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which</span><br><span class="font5">have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of</span><br><span class="font5">Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and</span></p><img src="1927_fp_E_files/1927_fp_E-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:17pt;height:31pt;">
<p><span class="font6">been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a</span><br><span class="font6">day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the</span><br><span class="font6">just; and he doth not resist you.&quot; -James 5:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The day of God's vengeance is at hand; and he will</span><br><span class="font6">punish that wicked system calling itself &quot;organized</span><br><span class="font6">Christianity&quot;, because it has oppressed the common</span><br><span class="font6">peoples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A city is a symbol of an organization. The unholy</span><br><span class="font6">organization called &quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;organized Chris-</span><br><span class="font6">tianity&quot; in the Scriptures is called a &quot;city&quot;. To that</span><br><span class="font6">wicked city God now says: &quot;For, lo, I begin to bring</span><br><span class="font6">evil on the city which is called by my name, and should</span><br><span class="font6">ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished:</span><br><span class="font6">for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of</span><br><span class="font6">the earth, saith the Lord of hosts. A noise shall</span><br><span class="font6">come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a</span><br><span class="font6">controversy with the nations; he will plead with all</span><br><span class="font6">flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword,</span><br><span class="font6">saith the Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold,</span><br><span class="font6">evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great</span><br><span class="font6">whirlwind [of trouble] shall be raised up from the</span><br><span class="font6">coasts of the earth. And the slain of the Lord shall be at</span><br><span class="font6">that day from one end of the earth even unto the other</span><br><span class="font6">end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither</span><br><span class="font6">gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the</span><br><span class="font6">ground. Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow your-</span><br><span class="font6">selves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the</span><br><span class="font6">days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are ac-</span><br><span class="font6">complished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. And</span><br><span class="font6">the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the prin-</span><br><span class="font6">cipal of the flock to escape.&quot; Jeremiah 25: 29, 31-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The World War stopped in 1918 in order that notice</span><br><span class="font6">might be given to the peoples of earth concerning the</span><br><span class="font6">name of Jehovah God and his purposes toward men.</span><br><span class="font6">That witness has been in progress during the past eight</span><br><span class="font6">years. Notice has been served upon the world powers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">and now notice is being served upon all the common peo-</span><br><span class="font5">ples. Jesus declared that when this witness is done, and</span><br><span class="font5">because the ruling powers will not heed the same, there</span><br><span class="font5">shall come upon the world the greatest time of trouble</span><br><span class="font5">ever known and it shall be the last. Matthew 24:14,</span><br><span class="font5">21. 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Millions of honest people who are now held in subjection to &quot;organized Christianity&quot;, but who are meek</span><br><span class="font5">and willing to be taught, are asking, What shall we do?</span><br><span class="font5">To such Jehovah now says: &quot;Seek ye the Lord, all ye</span><br><span class="font5">meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment:</span><br><span class="font5">seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be</span><br><span class="font5">hid in the day of the Lord's anger.&quot; Zephaniah 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Word of God and the physical facts prove that</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;organized Christianity&quot; or &quot;Christendom&quot; is a failure.</span><br><span class="font5">She is even worse than that. She is a menace to peace</span><br><span class="font5">and prosperity. She is an instrument of Satan the Devil.</span><br><span class="font5">Abandon her and flee from her as rats flee from a</span><br><span class="font5">sinking ship. She is sinking into oblivion never again</span><br><span class="font5">to rise. She is going down in a time of trouble such as</span><br><span class="font5">never before was known. To the people the Lord now</span><br><span class="font5">says therefore: &quot;Come out of her, my people, that ye</span><br><span class="font5">be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of</span><br><span class="font5">her plagues.&quot;-Revelation 18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">THE BLESSINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ruins of Satan's false system cleared away, there</span><br><span class="font5">shall arise a new heaven and new earth wherein dwells</span><br><span class="font5">righteousness, according to God's promise. (2 Peter</span><br><span class="font5">3:13) That righteous government shall rest upon the</span><br><span class="font5">shoulder of Christ Jesus, the Prince of Peace. His</span><br><span class="font5">name shall be called by the people Wonderful Counsellor,</span><br><span class="font5">because he will guide them in the right way; he shall</span><br><span class="font5">be called the Everlasting Father because he will give</span><br><span class="font5">life to the peoples. And of his peace and blessings there</span><br><span class="font5">shall be no end. Isaiah 9:6, 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">38           </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom for the Peoples</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">WARS TO CEASE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The curse that war has laid upon the peoples will then</span><br><span class="font6">be lifted for ever. Never again shall there be war be-</span><br><span class="font6">tween the peoples of the nations. Under the reign of the</span><br><span class="font6">righteous Messiah the peoples of the nations shall beat</span><br><span class="font6">their instruments of war into farming implements and</span><br><span class="font6">nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither</span><br><span class="font6">shall they learn war any more. Isaiah 2:2-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A lion is a symbol of the Devil, and a ravenous beast</span><br><span class="font6">is a symbol of the Devil's organization on earth, made</span><br><span class="font6">up of the cruel &quot;Big Business&quot;, big politicians, and big</span><br><span class="font6">preachers. God, through his prophet, promises that in</span><br><span class="font6">the kingdom of Messiah there shall be no lion nor</span><br><span class="font6">ravenous beast there, because the Devil will not be per-</span><br><span class="font6">mitted to operate. He will have no cruel financiers, nor</span><br><span class="font6">professional politicians, nor any hypocritical preachers</span><br><span class="font6">to do his bidding. The people shall dwell together in</span><br><span class="font6">safety and follow that which is right. Isaiah 35:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The poor will no longer be oppressed. In the courts</span><br><span class="font6">they will have fair and equitable consideration, because</span><br><span class="font6">it is written that &quot;with righteousness shall he judge the</span><br><span class="font6">poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth&quot;.</span><br><span class="font6">-Isaiah 11:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Under the righteous reign of Messiah no cruel cor-</span><br><span class="font6">poration can own the houses in which the people dwell,</span><br><span class="font6">or compel them to pay exorbitant rents. The people</span><br><span class="font6">shall build their own houses and live in them and plant</span><br><span class="font6">their own vineyards and eat the fruit thereof, and no</span><br><span class="font6">one shall make them afraid. Micah 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now the poor cry for bread and the rulers give them</span><br><span class="font6">a stone; they cry for a fish and the clergy give them a</span><br><span class="font6">fiery serpent. Under the righteous reign of Messiah there</span><br><span class="font6">shall be a great feast of fat things spread for all the</span><br><span class="font6">people and they shall eat and rejoice. No hypocritical</span><br><span class="font6">prohibition preachers will be permitted then to operate</span><br><span class="font6">with bootleggers and take away from the people the</span><span class="font5">proper use of wine while they themselves use it unlawfully. Isaiah 25:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Under the righteous reign of Messiah clergymen will</span><br><span class="font5">no more be permitted to frighten the people and keep</span><br><span class="font5">them in ignorance of the truth. Then the knowledge of</span><br><span class="font5">the glory of the Lord shall fill the whole earth as the</span><br><span class="font5">waters now fill the sea, and every man will know the</span><br><span class="font5">Lord and his righteous way from the least to the great-</span><br><span class="font5">est, and that knowledge will be free, Habakkuk 2:14;</span><br><span class="font5">Jeremiah 31:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that righteous government here on earth no more</span><br><span class="font5">can men called doctors practise on the people and hide</span><br><span class="font5">their mistakes in the graveyard, because then the Lord</span><br><span class="font5">will lead the people in the right way and bring unto them</span><br><span class="font5">peace and health and cure them of all their ailments</span><br><span class="font5">until no more shall any man say, &quot;I am sick.&quot; Jeremiah 33:6; Isaiah 33:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It shall then be if a man who has been wicked shall</span><br><span class="font5">turn away from his wickedness and do right and obey the</span><br><span class="font5">Lord he shall live and shall never die. (Ezekiel 18:27,</span><br><span class="font5">28) That is the time of which Jesus spoke when he</span><br><span class="font5">said: &quot;If a man keep my saying, he shall never see</span><br><span class="font5">death&quot; (John 8:51); &quot;Whosoever liveth, and believeth</span><br><span class="font5">in me shall never die.&quot; John 11:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In that time old men shall return to the days of their</span><br><span class="font5">youth, and their flesh shall become fresher than that of</span><br><span class="font5">a child. (Job 33:25) Then God will restore to perfection of body and mind all the obedient ones on the</span><br><span class="font5">earth until the earth is filled with a happy, joyful and</span><br><span class="font5">vigorous people. Acts 3:19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Seeing that God has in store these marvelous blessings</span><br><span class="font5">for the people through the kingdom of Christ it is easy</span><br><span class="font5">to see why the Devil has organized a false system called</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;Christendom&quot; or &quot;organized Christianity&quot;, and by</span><br><span class="font5">which system hypocritically he deceives the people and</span><br><span class="font5">turns their minds away from God's provision for their</span><br><span class="font5">blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God's kingdom of righteousness is at hand. The evi-</span><br><span class="font6">dence shows that the day of restitution has come in</span><br><span class="font6">which the obedient ones of mankind shall be granted</span><br><span class="font6">full freedom and be restored to the perfection of body</span><br><span class="font6">enjoyed in Eden. Therefore with confidence it can now</span><br><span class="font6">be stated that millions of people now on the earth will</span><br><span class="font6">never die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people desire peace, freedom, prosperity, life and</span><br><span class="font6">happiness. All thinking persons must now see these can</span><br><span class="font6">come only from God's kingdom through Christ. They</span><br><span class="font6">can never be realized by or through the false system</span><br><span class="font6">called &quot;organized Christianity&quot;. The hypocritical and</span><br><span class="font6">evil course of &quot;Christendom&quot; is an insult to God and to</span><br><span class="font6">Christ. It is the deceiver and oppressor of the people.</span><br><span class="font6">It is completely under the control of Satan the Devil.</span><br><span class="font6">It depends for its support and maintenance upon the</span><br><span class="font6">multitudes of peoples, while at the same time it continues to defraud and oppress the people. Let the multitudes of peoples completely and entirely withdraw all</span><br><span class="font6">support morally, financially and otherwise from &quot;Chris-</span><br><span class="font6">tendom&quot; or &quot;organized Christianity&quot;, so-called. Let</span><br><span class="font6">them give their heart's devotion and allegiance entirely</span><br><span class="font6">to God and to Christ, the Prince of Peace, who is now</span><br><span class="font6">earth's rightful King. Let them dwell together in peace</span><br><span class="font6">and do good to each other and be ready to receive the</span><br><span class="font6">blessings which God has in reservation for those who</span><br><span class="font6">love and obey him. The day of complete freedom is at</span><br><span class="font6">hand!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The peoples should therefore for ever abandon and</span><br><span class="font6">forsake &quot;organized Christianity&quot; called &quot;Christendom&quot;</span><br><span class="font6">and turn their hearts and minds and their allegiance</span><br><span class="font6">wholly to God and his Christ for the following reasons,</span><br><span class="font6">to wit:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">(1) Because &quot;Christendom&quot; is the Devil's organization</span><br><span class="font6">operated by him to keep the people in subjection.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(2) Because it is an instrument of oppression which</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">has been used to make the burdens of men grievous to be</span><br><span class="font5">borne.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(3) Because it is false, hypocritical, and wicked, and</span><br><span class="font5">against the interests of the multitudes of the peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(4) Because it holds out absolutely no hope for the</span><br><span class="font5">betterment of the peoples.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(5) Because God's time has come when that evil and</span><br><span class="font5">hypocritical system shall be destroyed in the greatest</span><br><span class="font5">time of trouble the world has ever known.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(6) Because God commands all the peoples who love</span><br><span class="font5">him to flee from that unrighteous system of so-called</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;organized Christianity&quot; and thereby escape the dire</span><br><span class="font5">calamities that shortly shall befall her,</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(7) Because God has set his anointed King, Christ</span><br><span class="font5">Jesus the Messiah, upon his throne, and bids all the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">peoples of earth to hear and obey him; and those who</span><br><span class="font5">so do shall receive and for ever enjoy the blessings of</span><br><span class="font5">complete freedom, everlasting peace, prosperity, life,</span><br><span class="font5">liberty and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And now, Mr. Chairman, based upon these assigned</span><br><span class="font5">reasons, I move the adoption of this resolution and I</span><br><span class="font5">ask my audience, both seen and unseen, when the vote</span><br><span class="font5">is taken that those who are in favor arise and express</span><br><span class="font5">themselves by crying out, Aye.

Those</span><br><span class="font5">in favor of the adoption of the resolution arise and say,</span><br><span class="font5">Aye.</span></p><img src="1927_fp_E_files/1927_fp_E-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:377pt;height:572pt;">

<h4><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark9"></a>&quot;The Hook-up&quot;</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">From </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font5"> published at Toronto, Monday</span><br><span class="font5">July 25th, 1927, the following is quoted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">One of the greatest events of the age has passed into</span><br><span class="font5">history. Judge Rutherford's address, at Toronto, marked</span><br><span class="font5">the end of the old way and the coming in of the new.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ten years ago the Bible Students anticipated that by</span><br><span class="font5">the end of 1925 the gospel would be broadcast from some one</span><br><span class="font5">station to all the rest of the world. They did not miss it by</span><br><span class="font5">very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ten weeks ago there were no signs that Judge Rutherford</span><br><span class="font5">would have the whole world listening to him from the</span><br><span class="font5">Coliseum platform, on July 24th. But events move rapidly</span><br><span class="font5">now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nothing could more plainly demonstrate the hand of</span><br><span class="font5">God than the wonderful way in which this seemingly im-</span><br><span class="font5">possible thing was brought about. All things are easy for</span><br><span class="font5">God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is less than six weeks ago that Judge Rutherford and</span><br><span class="font5">his colleagues were at Washington, setting forth to the</span><br><span class="font5">Radio Commission their just rights to a high wave length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reasons were given why WBBR, Judge Rutherford's</span><br><span class="font5">station on Staten Island, should have part of the time of</span><br><span class="font5">WJZ. It seemed like a hopeless mission, but God saw</span><br><span class="font5">otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">WJZ is on the National Broadcasting Company's circuit.</span><br><span class="font5">Its president was at the hearing. Naturally he wanted to</span><br><span class="font5">retain all his time, but Judge Rutherford interested him.</span><br><span class="font5">President Merlin Hall Aylesworth, of the National Broadcasting Company, desired that Judge Rutherford should</span><br><span class="font5">make use of his circuit; and a date was fixed, July 24th,</span><br><span class="font5">yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So it came about that when Judge Rutherford stepped</span><br><span class="font5">out on the platform yesterday he stepped out to speak from</span><br><span class="font5">all the stations which go to make up the National Broadcasting circuit, in addition to his own chain of stations.</span><br><span class="font5">These include many of the most important stations in</span><br><span class="font5">the United States, and with them the Red, Blue and Pacific</span><br><span class="font5">networks, as they are called, reaching clear across the con-</span><br><span class="font5">tinent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">43</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But he spoke from more than these, because many other</span><br><span class="font5">of the most prominent broadcasting studios, including sev-</span><br><span class="font5">eral in Canada, concluded also to send out the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">So it came to pass that Judge Rutherford, standing in</span><br><span class="font5">Toronto, talked from a line of stations reaching from</span><br><span class="font5">Toronto, through Saskatoon and Edmonton to Vancouver</span><br><span class="font5">on the Pacific coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Standing in Toronto he was broadcasting simultaneously</span><br><span class="font5">from Boston, Worcester, Springfield, Hartford, Providence</span><br><span class="font5">and other stations all over New England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Standing in Toronto his voice went out from the greatest</span><br><span class="font5">studios in New York, Schenectady, Buffalo, Rochester, Washington, Pittsburgh and others in the Middle Atlantic States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though here in Canada he broadcast from Cincinnati, St.</span><br><span class="font5">Louis, Chicago, Minneapolis, Davenport, Batavia, Louisville,</span><br><span class="font5">and many other stations in the Middle Western States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without leaving the Coliseum his voice rang out from</span><br><span class="font5">stations in Charlotte, Memphis, Nashville, Jacksonville, Dal-</span><br><span class="font5">las, and from stations in many other cities all over the</span><br><span class="font5">Southern States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though his voice went into but one microphone here yet</span><br><span class="font5">it entered other microphones with equal power in Des</span><br><span class="font5">Moines, Omaha, Denver, San Antonio, Oakland and Spokane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Originally cast from Toronto, Judge Rutherford's voice</span><br><span class="font5">went on and on until it was amplified millions of times and</span><br><span class="font5">was rebroadcast from the great studios in England and</span><br><span class="font5">Australia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The vast audience at Toronto was as nothing. True, the</span><br><span class="font5">great Coliseum was filled an hour ahead of time and thousands turned away; but all could hear, in or out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All over the world the scene in Toronto was duplicated.</span><br><span class="font5">Bible Students and their friends and the public were listen-</span><br><span class="font5">ing in halls, auditoriums and private homes, catching every</span><br><span class="font5">word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How many millions heard Judge Rutherford's wonderful</span><br><span class="font5">discourse Sunday afternoon there will never be any way of</span><br><span class="font5">finding out while we are on this side of the veil.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the</span><br><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff</span><br><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried</span><br><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">them away, that no place was found for them: and</span><br><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the stone that smote the image became a great</span><br><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mountain, and filled the whole earth.&quot;</span><br><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">-Daniel 2:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font5">EHOVAH through his Word reveals that Armageddon is</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;the battle of the great day of God Almighty&quot;. The in-</span><br><span class="font5">ference to be drawn from the name used is that in that</span><br><span class="font5">great day the Creator of heaven and earth will exercise</span><br><span class="font5">almighty power in battle against his enemy. If then we are</span><br><span class="font5">correct in the conclusion that the battle of Armageddon will</span><br><span class="font5">be fought by Satan and his forces on the one side, and Je-</span><br><span class="font5">hovah of hosts on the other side, then it is of greatest in-</span><br><span class="font5">terest and importance to the Christians now on earth to</span><br><span class="font5">have a mental vision of both organizations. It will also be</span><br><span class="font5">of great importance for the Christians to go forward in</span><br><span class="font5">harmony with God's organization and to faithfully perform</span><br><span class="font5">the duties God has laid upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It seems quite certain that we are approaching the great-</span><br><span class="font5">est crisis of all time and that in the conflict of Armageddon</span><br><span class="font5">the powers of evil shall fall, never again to secure a solid</span><br><span class="font5">footing on the earth. That fact alone should thrill the soul</span><br><span class="font5">of every lover of righteousness. It will mean the vindica-</span><br><span class="font5">tion of God's holy name, the triumph of his Christ, the de-</span><br><span class="font5">liverance of the people from oppression, and the opening</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">of the plain highway by which the people may fully return</span><br><span class="font5">unto God. Truly we are entering into a grand and awful</span><br><span class="font5">time. To be living now is sublime!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is profitable at this time that we take a mental vision</span><br><span class="font5">of the history of the nations or world powers found recorded</span><br><span class="font5">in the Word of God, and such part of profane history relating thereto as is in full harmony with the Word of God.</span><br><span class="font5">Undoubtedly God caused the record thereof to be made in</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">his Word for the benefit of the Christians on earth at this</span><br><span class="font5">time. The understanding of the same in harmony with</span><br><span class="font5">God's will is therefore meat in due season to strengthen all</span><br><span class="font5">those who are striving to do the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">DEFINITIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Power, as used herein, means a potentate or authority ex-</span><br><span class="font5">ercising jurisdiction and power over others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">World, as herein used, means mankind organized into</span><br><span class="font5">forms of government acting under the supervision and influence or control of an invisible overlord, potentate or</span><br><span class="font5">authority. There is both a visible and an invisible part of</span><br><span class="font5">the world. The invisible part of the organization is termed</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;heaven&quot;. The visible part thereof is called &quot;earth&quot;, and</span><br><span class="font5">the authority of the visible part thereof is exercised by</span><br><span class="font5">men. In the Scriptures the earthly part is symbolized by a</span><br><span class="font5">beast, because a wild and ferocious beast fitly represents</span><br><span class="font5">earthly governments or powers.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">A world power therefore is defined as an organization on</span><br><span class="font5">earth of men into forms of government, which government</span><br><span class="font5">possesses and exercises supreme jurisdiction, power, and the</span><br><span class="font5">controlling influence over various powers or nations, and</span><br><span class="font5">which is under the supervision of the invisible overlord,</span><br><span class="font5">Satan the Devil. World powers have been permitted by Je-</span><br><span class="font5">hovah in order to put men to the test and to teach them les-</span><br><span class="font5">sons which they could not otherwise learn. Many nations have</span><br><span class="font5">arisen and quickly fallen again, but world powers have been</span><br><span class="font5">limited in number and have existed until God's due time</span><br><span class="font5">for such to fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God permitted man to follow his own devices in organiz-</span><br><span class="font5">ing governments. He placed before man righteousness and</span><br><span class="font5">truth and then permitted him to choose good or to go in</span><br><span class="font5">the way of evil and unrighteousness. Man changed the</span><br><span class="font5">truth into lies, reproached God and worshiped the creature</span><br><span class="font5">rather than the Creator. (Romans 1:25) Men were induced</span><br><span class="font5">to take this wrongful course by reason of the evil influence</span><br><span class="font5">exercised over them by Satan the enemy. By fraud and</span><br><span class="font5">deceit Satan turned the mind of man away from God. The</span><br><span class="font5">Devil induced some to worship him, and others he induced</span><br><span class="font5">to worship any object except Jehovah. By this means Satan</span><br><span class="font5">became the god or invisible ruler over men and has in-</span><br><span class="font5">fluenced and controlled men's organization of governments</span><br><span class="font5">or powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Devil's organization therefore consists of himself and</span><br><span class="font5">the evil angels that he drew away from the paths of</span><br><span class="font5">rectitude, and of men under his influence organized into</span><br><span class="font5">earthly systems and governments. The majority of men</span><br><span class="font5">have not cared to retain God in their knowledge and there-</span><br><span class="font5">fore God permitted them to go in the way of evil and to do</span><br><span class="font5">those things which are unrighteous. As the knowledge of</span><br><span class="font5">men increased they have turned that knowledge into selfish</span><br><span class="font5">and wrongful channels. Satan, seizing upon the opportunity,</span><br><span class="font5">has builded a mighty organization on earth. In the latter</span><br><span class="font5">days, due to the great goodness of God, knowledge has</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">increased; but this knowledge has been used among men</span><br><span class="font5">under the influence of Satan to strengthen his organization.</span><br><span class="font5">The commerce of the earth, the political machinery of earth,</span><br><span class="font5">and the organized religion of earth, are all under the control of Satan. He has united these into one mighty or-</span><br><span class="font5">ganization, which organization is cruel and oppressive. He</span><br><span class="font5">stands opposed to God and everything that represents God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Throughout the ages only those who have been faithful to</span><br><span class="font5">God have stood aloof from the Devil's organization and re-</span><br><span class="font5">fused to yield thereto. Many of these have suffered martyr-</span><br><span class="font5">dom, and over them Satan's organization apparently has</span><br><span class="font5">triumphed. Many others for a time have stood in opposition</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">to Satan's organization, but under his subtle influence have</span><br><span class="font5">fallen into his snares. Today upon earth there is but a</span><br><span class="font5">remnant that is true and faithful to God. Against these</span><br><span class="font5">Satan and his organization now make desperate assault</span><br><span class="font5">with the determination of destroying them because they</span><br><span class="font5">keep the commandments of God and have the witness that</span><br><span class="font5">they are the Lord's.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">GOD'S ORGANIZATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God's organization is unknown to all except a few. It</span><br><span class="font5">consists of Jesus Christ, his beloved Son and great High</span><br><span class="font5">Priest, and a host of true and holy angels, and the mem-</span><br><span class="font5">bers of the body of Christ in glory, and of those anointed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ones on earth who are yet faithful and true to the Lord.</span><br><span class="font5">Over all of these is the great eternal Jehovah God. The fact</span><br><span class="font5">that one of his names is Jehovah of hosts means that he</span><br><span class="font5">has a mighty army of holy angels that delight to render</span><br><span class="font5">complete obedience unto him. These not only carry out his</span><br><span class="font5">purposes in general, but under his direction furnish pro-</span><br><span class="font5">tection for the faithful ones on earth. God's representatives</span><br><span class="font5">on earth are small in number and meager in power. In</span><br><span class="font5">themselves they have no strength. These faithful ones</span><br><span class="font5">have entered into the secret place of the Most High; and</span><br><span class="font5">dwelling there in the shadow of the Almighty God, they</span><br><span class="font5">are safe while the battle rages. With confidence and with</span><br><span class="font5">a complete sense of security they can perform and do per-</span><br><span class="font5">form their duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">DIVINE RULES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It appears that God has fixed rules of procedure concern-</span><br><span class="font5">ing world powers: (1) He manifests toward such his own</span><br><span class="font5">goodness that the people thereof, and particularly the rulers,</span><br><span class="font5">may see evidences of his righteousness in contrast with</span><br><span class="font5">the wickedness of the evil one; (2) he serves notice upon</span><br><span class="font5">them of his purposes to punish their evil course; (3) he</span><br><span class="font5">magnifies his own name by a manifestation of his supreme</span><br><span class="font5">power that all may know that there is no Almighty God be-</span><br><span class="font5">sides him and from him alone proceed all things that are</span><br><span class="font5">good and righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It also appears that another fixed rule of God is that</span><br><span class="font5">where there is greater knowledge, or opportunity to obtain</span><br><span class="font5">the same, there is greater responsibility resting upon those</span><br><span class="font5">who do know or who might know. Having in mind these</span><br><span class="font5">fixed rules will enable us to more fully appreciate what</span><br><span class="font5">are the present duties of the remnant and what Armageddon may mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BEGINNING OF WORLD POWERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nebuchadnezzar succeeded his father upon the throne of</span><br><span class="font5">Babylon, a nation that had existed for many years. In the</span><br><span class="font5">second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar he had a dream,</span><br><span class="font5">Daniel the Hebrew was brought before the king and gave</span><br><span class="font5">the interpretation of his dream. In that interpretation Daniel the prophet of God specified four kingdoms or world</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">powers. (Daniel 2:36-40) From the description given, how-</span><br><span class="font5">ever, and from other facts that appear in the sacred record</span><br><span class="font5">it is manifest that these four are not all the world powers</span><br><span class="font5">revealed by the Scriptures and that Babylon was not the</span><br><span class="font5">beginning of world powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Gentile Times began under the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. When Daniel stood before that potentate to give</span><br><span class="font5">interpretation of his dream he said: &quot;God ... maketh</span><br><span class="font5">known what shall be in the latter days.&quot; Those words would</span><br><span class="font5">indicate that God would reveal to his people in the latter</span><br><span class="font5">days a better understanding of Nebuchadnezzar's dream</span><br><span class="font5">and of its interpretation, which was in fact a prophecy.</span><br><span class="font5">God's purpose in making the dream and its interpretation</span><br><span class="font5">appear so prominently in the Bible must be of greater sig-</span><br><span class="font5">nificance merely than to record an historical fact to be</span><br><span class="font5">thereafter remembered by the people. It now appears that</span><br><span class="font5">the primary purpose of the record concerning that world</span><br><span class="font5">power was and is that God thereby serves notice on the</span><br><span class="font5">ruling factors of the world that he is the only true God,</span><br><span class="font5">that his name shall be magnified notwithstanding the en-</span><br><span class="font5">emy, and in his own due time he will demonstrate this to</span><br><span class="font5">all creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">EGYPT</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is an indisputable fact that long prior to the existence</span><br><span class="font5">of Babylon as a world power there were two other great</span><br><span class="font5">world powers. The first was Egypt. God permitted Joseph</span><br><span class="font5">to be sold into Egypt, and then to be elevated to a position</span><br><span class="font5">of great power and authority in that government. There</span><br><span class="font5">was a divine purpose in this. It was through Joseph that</span><br><span class="font5">God gave Egypt evidence of his own goodness. That nation</span><br><span class="font5">was the predominant world power then. That nation received many blessings from God, ministered to it and its</span><br><span class="font5">people through the hand of Joseph, the servant of God.</span><br><span class="font5">(Genesis 41) The rulers of Egypt learned of God and</span><br><span class="font5">his goodness. Joseph died; and another king arose who was</span><br><span class="font5">against God and forgot the favors that the empire had received from Jehovah. (Exodus 1:8) God's chosen people</span><br><span class="font5">were then domiciled in Egypt. They were being persecuted</span><br><span class="font5">and oppressed by the rulers. Their cries came up before</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah. God then went to Egypt to make for himself</span><br><span class="font5">a name. (2 Samuel 7:23) He did this by sending his ser-</span><br><span class="font5">vants, Moses and Aaron, into Egypt. He told Moses in</span><br><span class="font5">advance what he intended to do. (Exodus 3:20) Through</span><br><span class="font5">Moses God served notice on Pharaoh that he is the Almighty</span><br><span class="font5">God and of his purpose to deliver his people. After full</span><br><span class="font5">and fair warning God slew all the firstborn of Egypt, delivered his own people, and then destroyed the army of</span><br><span class="font5">that great world power. Thus he gave a demonstration of</span><br><span class="font5">his power that he is God, that his name might not be for-</span><br><span class="font5">gotten for the good of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Egypt was the first world power, and what came to pass</span><br><span class="font5">concerning it foreshadowed what shall happen to the last</span><br><span class="font5">of Satan's world powers. Moses, who served as deliverer,</span><br><span class="font5">foreshadowed Christ, the great Deliverer. The overthrow</span><br><span class="font5">of Egypt foreshadowed the time when God through Christ</span><br><span class="font5">would dash to pieces Satan's organization in the latter days.</span><br><span class="font5">From that time forward Egypt as a world power became</span><br><span class="font5">typical of other world powers that should follow. Students</span><br><span class="font5">of Scripture have long recognized Egypt as a type and its</span><br><span class="font5">king as the representative of the Devil and a part of the</span><br><span class="font5">Devil's organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">ASSYRIA</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Later and next in order Assyria arose as a dominant world</span><br><span class="font5">power. That nation was the dominating organization of</span><br><span class="font5">Satan on earth. God recognized Assyria as a world power</span><br><span class="font5">and specifically showed his goodness to that nation by send-</span><br><span class="font5">ing Jonah his prophet to them to give them warning. And</span><br><span class="font5">that world power recognized Jehovah as their God and</span><br><span class="font5">acknowledged him as such. (Jonah 3:6-9) Because of their</span><br><span class="font5">knowledge of God the rulers of Assyria were responsible.</span><br><span class="font5">Not only did the rulers of Assyria forget God and worship</span><br><span class="font5">Satan and his angels, but openly defied the Almighty and</span><br><span class="font5">brought reproach upon his name. (2 Kings 18:22; 19:10-</span><br><span class="font5">13) Then God manifested his power against the empire</span><br><span class="font5">of Assyria and demonstrated that he is the Almighty God.</span><br><span class="font5">Assyria fell and ceased to be a world power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BABYLON</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The next world power that appeared on the scene was</span><br><span class="font5">Babylon. It existed as a nation long prior thereto. Early</span><br><span class="font5">in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Babylon became a world</span><br><span class="font5">power or dominant national organization of Satan. Be-</span><br><span class="font5">cause of the unfaithfulness of the nation of Israel, which</span><br><span class="font5">formed the typical kingdom of God, that nation was over-</span><br><span class="font5">thrown and God even permitted Nebuchadnezzar to become</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;a king of kings&quot; or dominant world power to be used for</span><br><span class="font5">his own purposes. By the dream of Nebuchadnezzar and</span><br><span class="font5">the interpretation thereof by Daniel God brought notice to</span><br><span class="font5">that ruler that Jehovah is the only true God; and Nebuchadnezzar recognized that fact when he said to Daniel: &quot;Of</span><br><span class="font5">a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods and a Lord</span><br><span class="font5">of kings.&quot; (Daniel 2:47) Later Nebuchadnezzar was</span><br><span class="font5">forced to undergo certain ordeals by which he was com-</span><br><span class="font5">pelled to acknowledge the supremacy of Jehovah. (Daniel</span><br><span class="font5">4:25-37) The goodness of God was made manifest to</span><br><span class="font5">Babylon. Later that nation forgot God and persecuted his</span><br><span class="font5">people and fell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream which</span><br><span class="font5">God gave to him through the Prophet Daniel Jehovah was</span><br><span class="font5">serving notice upon Babylon, and upon all the nations that</span><br><span class="font5">followed, that he is the great and only true God and that in</span><br><span class="font5">his due time he will destroy all powers that oppose him</span><br><span class="font5">even as he had destroyed Egypt; and that he will do so</span><br><span class="font5">through his righteous kingdom; and that his kingdom shall</span><br><span class="font5">stand for ever for the blessing of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The facts therefore show that Babylon was the third</span><br><span class="font5">world power in the order in which they actually came into</span><br><span class="font5">existence. The Lord through Daniel did not say that Neb-</span><br><span class="font5">uchadnezzar was the head of the first world power. He</span><br><span class="font5">described an image, which Nebuchadnezzar saw, the head</span><br><span class="font5">of which was gold; and then said to the king: &quot;Thou art</span><br><span class="font5">this head of gold.&quot; He then stated that after Babylon</span><br><span class="font5">there should follow a second, third, and fourth kingdom or</span><br><span class="font5">world power. It clearly therefore appears that such in the</span><br><span class="font5">order named were numbered from Nebuchadnezzar forward.</span><br><span class="font5">The second was the Medo-Persian kingdom, the third Greece,</span><br><span class="font5">and Rome is recognized as the fourth. Counting Egypt as</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the first world power, which indeed it was, then Rome was</span><br><span class="font5">the sixth from Egypt but the fourth from Nebuchadnezzar.</span><br><span class="font5">The four world powers mentioned by Daniel covered the</span><br><span class="font5">time or interregnum between the overthrow of the typical</span><br><span class="font5">kingdom of God and the coming of the real kingdom, to wit,</span><br><span class="font5">Christ Jesus, who came and declared, &quot;The kingdom of</span><br><span class="font5">heaven is at hand.&quot; He is the one &quot;whose right it is&quot; to</span><br><span class="font5">reign. (Ezekiel 21:24-27) He was crucified during the</span><br><span class="font5">time that Rome was the dominant power of earth, the fourth</span><br><span class="font5">in the order named by Daniel. Daniel the prophet did not</span><br><span class="font5">then disclose the world powers that preceded Nebuchadnez-</span><br><span class="font5">zar, nor those that should follow Rome and that should</span><br><span class="font5">exist until the establishment of God's kingdom under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">OTHER WORLD POWERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While Daniel specifically named only four world powers</span><br><span class="font5">yet his prophetic description shows there were to be more.</span><br><span class="font5">The image which he described to Nebuchadnezzar had legs</span><br><span class="font5">of iron which represented the fourth world power or</span><br><span class="font5">kingdom named by Daniel and which is recognized by all</span><br><span class="font5">as Rome. Iron represents a cruel military power that breaks</span><br><span class="font5">to pieces and subdues all others. The military history of</span><br><span class="font5">Rome fully meets this description.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The image had feet and toes, which are no part of the</span><br><span class="font5">legs any more than the thighs are parts of the legs. The</span><br><span class="font5">two feet had ten toes; and while the toes grow out of the</span><br><span class="font5">feet, yet they are separate from the feet and are described</span><br><span class="font5">separately. The description therefore shows that the feet</span><br><span class="font5">represent a great world power to follow Rome, and then</span><br><span class="font5">later another would arise which is represented by the toes</span><br><span class="font5">growing out from the feet and forming a part thereof. The</span><br><span class="font5">prophet's description is: &quot;And whereas thou sawest the</span><br><span class="font5">feet and toes, part of the potters' clay, and part of iron,</span><br><span class="font5">the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of</span><br><span class="font5">the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron</span><br><span class="font5">mixed with miry clay. And as the toes of the feet were</span><br><span class="font5">part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be</span><br><span class="font5">partly strong, and partly broken. And whereas thou sawest</span><br><span class="font5">iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves</span><br><span class="font5">with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.&quot;-Daniel</span><br><span class="font5">2:41-43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then in the forty-fourth verse follows the prophet's state-</span><br><span class="font5">ment that God will set up his kingdom and will completely</span><br><span class="font5">destroy all these world powers and that then God's kingdom</span><br><span class="font5">shall stand for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The time of the fulfilment of this prophecy, which is the</span><br><span class="font5">time of the complete fall and destruction of world powers,</span><br><span class="font5">is indicated by the words of the prophet: &quot;They shall</span><br><span class="font5">mingle themselves with the seed of men.&quot; Otherwise stated,</span><br><span class="font5">at that time there shall be an effort to ally the two things</span><br><span class="font5">represented by the iron and the clay. Iron symbolizes mil-</span><br><span class="font5">itary power, while clay symbolically represents the democ-</span><br><span class="font5">racy or common peoples of the earth; and the mingling of</span><br><span class="font5">the two represents an effort to unite all the peoples and</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">nations, including the democracy or rank and file, into one</span><br><span class="font5">great military camp or war machine, and therefore corre-</span><br><span class="font5">sponds with the statement concerning Satan's gathering to-</span><br><span class="font5">gether all his forces for the great battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In 1799 Rome fell and ceased to be a world power. At that</span><br><span class="font5">time Napoleon was desperately attempting to establish a</span><br><span class="font5">universal world power which would completely ignore Jehovah God and push him out of the minds of men. He</span><br><span class="font5">was following Voltaire's theory of evolution, which is an-</span><br><span class="font5">other evidence he was acting under the direction of the</span><br><span class="font5">Devil. It is manifest that the Lord God interfered to pre-</span><br><span class="font5">vent him in establishing such a universal power. At the</span><br><span class="font5">great naval battle of Trafalgar and in the land engagement</span><br><span class="font5">of Waterloo the forces of Napoleon were defeated and his</span><br><span class="font5">power broken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the</span><br><span class="font5">British Empire, which is the seventh and without doubt</span><br><span class="font5">the greatest world power that has ever existed. Peculiar</span><br><span class="font5">to that world power is this, that the chief part of its</span><br><span class="font5">political body is the House of Lords, consisting of the lords</span><br><span class="font5">spiritual and the lords temporal. The Archbishop of Can-</span><br><span class="font5">terbury is first peer of the realm and therefore next to the</span><br><span class="font5">king. The bishops and other ecclesiastics are large owners</span><br><span class="font5">of the lands and mines. The empire claims to represent</span><br><span class="font5">Christ on earth, and at the same time it is the greatest mil-</span><br><span class="font5">itary power that the world has ever produced. It fully meets</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the description of the two horned beast that has the ap-</span><br><span class="font5">pearance of a lamb because it is diplomatic, pious in ap-</span><br><span class="font5">pearance, sanctimonious, and that speaks like the Devil.</span><br><span class="font5">(Revelation 13:11) Its dominion encircles the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America is really a part of the British Empire because</span><br><span class="font5">both countries are controlled by the same money power, and</span><br><span class="font5">that is the power that is responsible for the military and</span><br><span class="font5">the political machinery. The British Empire or world power,</span><br><span class="font5">together with her colonies and allies, is represented by</span><br><span class="font5">the feet in the image described by Daniel. The iron repre-</span><br><span class="font5">sents her great military strength, while at the same time the</span><br><span class="font5">clay represents the democracy or common people of the</span><br><span class="font5">empire, all of which she counts as a part of her great mil-</span><br><span class="font5">itary system. The battle cry during the War of Britain and</span><br><span class="font5">her allies was: &quot;Let us use the military to make the world</span><br><span class="font5">safe for Democracy.&quot; Such is a mixing of iron with miry</span><br><span class="font5">clay. It was and is a subtle attempt to amalgamate the</span><br><span class="font5">military with the common people. The scheme will deceive</span><br><span class="font5">the people for a time but not for long, because God through</span><br><span class="font5">his prophet so states.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The ten toes of Daniel's image symbolically represent all</span><br><span class="font5">the rulers of &quot;Christendom&quot;. These have united to form a</span><br><span class="font5">League of Nations which is the eighth beast and which</span><br><span class="font5">comes from nowhere and goes into perdition. It is the final</span><br><span class="font5">desperate attempt of Satan to make all the peoples of</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;Christendom&quot; stand together as a great and warlike body</span><br><span class="font5">preparatory for the great battle of God Almighty, and</span><br><span class="font5">which the enemy expects to launch against the Lord God</span><br><span class="font5">and against his Anointed. The British Empire is therefore</span><br><span class="font5">the seventh world power; and the League of Nations, which</span><br><span class="font5">is combined &quot;Christendom&quot;, including of course the British</span><br><span class="font5">Empire, which is the real life-giver to the League, is the</span><br><span class="font5">eighth; and both the seventh and the eighth function at one</span><br><span class="font5">and the same time, and both seem destined for the same</span><br><span class="font5">fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British Empire is the strongest and most powerful</span><br><span class="font5">nation on the earth. She is the greatest world power that</span><br><span class="font5">has ever existed. Her dominion extends from east to west</span><br><span class="font5">and north to south, and reaches almost every part of the</span><br><span class="font5">earth. Because of her strength she is weak. It is her</span><br><span class="font5">numerous colonies that make her strong as an empire; and</span><br><span class="font5">as long as those colonies remain entirely loyal her strength</span><br><span class="font5">continues. If a break should start with one it might easily</span><br><span class="font5">extend to all others, and the empire would quickly go down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The British Empire claims to be the most liberal on earth</span><br><span class="font5">with regard to freedom of speech. That claim is probably</span><br><span class="font5">true. The English have learned that it is a good policy to</span><br><span class="font5">let the people vent their feelings by giving expression in</span><br><span class="font5">words. At the same time she is the strongest military</span><br><span class="font5">power on earth. Her effort is to draw the common people</span><br><span class="font5">into her military organization. Her financial power works</span><br><span class="font5">the political and ecclesiastical elements for all they are</span><br><span class="font5">worth, and these in turn impress upon the people the great</span><br><span class="font5">necessity of the military strength of the nation. There is</span><br><span class="font5">a constant burden of taxation laid upon the people to</span><br><span class="font5">further the preparations for war. While America is separate</span><br><span class="font5">and independent from Britain, yet she is more dependent</span><br><span class="font5">than many of her citizens think. The commerce of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">British and American nations is closely allied, and therein</span><br><span class="font5">lie the strength and power of each. Should Britain fall</span><br><span class="font5">America could not long continue her commercial enterprises.</span><br><span class="font5">Her markets in Europe would fall. She would also be great-</span><br><span class="font5">ly menaced by Japan and China. Commerce therefore</span><br><span class="font5">holds the two great nations of Britain and America in close</span><br><span class="font5">alliance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">America is likewise pursuing the same policy concerning</span><br><span class="font5">war preparations. This is induced by the commercial ele-</span><br><span class="font5">ment or Big Finance. When one of America's sons, little</span><br><span class="font5">known, flew across the Atlantic that marvelous feat accomplished by him was seized upon by &quot;Big Business&quot; to</span><br><span class="font5">boost war preparations. Great sums of money were spent</span><br><span class="font5">apparently to honor this young man. That was not done</span><br><span class="font5">because the spenders had any love for the young man. They</span><br><span class="font5">love no one but self. Millions were spent to enthuse the</span><br><span class="font5">common people concerning war and to draw them into the</span><br><span class="font5">war arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Other nations are doing the same thing. All &quot;Christendom&quot;, which really forms the League of Nations, is talking</span><br><span class="font5">about disarmament but at the same time increasing that</span><br><span class="font5">armament. There are more armed men in Europe today</span><br><span class="font5">than there were in 1914. Every possible effort is being put</span><br><span class="font5">forth to make soldiers of the common people. What is now</span><br><span class="font5">flow. Likewise he demonstrated his power against the other</span><br><span class="font5">world powers, including Rome, and for the same purpose.</span><br><span class="font5">Now in the time of the enlightenment of the nations of earth</span><br><span class="font5">so-called &quot;Christendom&quot; has disregarded the name of the</span><br><span class="font5">Lord God and has pushed it aside and hypocritically used</span><br><span class="font5">his name as no other power ever did. &quot;Christendom&quot; is</span><br><span class="font5">the very, zenith of the Devil's organization. God declares</span><br><span class="font5">his purpose that such organization shall fall amidst the</span><br><span class="font5">greatest time of trouble ever known, and that such will be</span><br><span class="font5">the last. Matthew 24:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SERVING NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In keeping with the fixed divine rule, before dashing</span><br><span class="font5">&quot;Christendom&quot; to pieces Jehovah will have it duly served</span><br><span class="font5">with notice of his purpose. Acting under his fixed rule he</span><br><span class="font5">sent Moses and Aaron to serve notice upon Egypt. He sent</span><br><span class="font5">Jonah to serve notice upon Assyria. Through his prophets</span><br><span class="font5">he served notice on Babylon, Medo-Persia, and Greece. He</span><br><span class="font5">served notice upon Rome through Jesus and his apostles.</span><br><span class="font5">Now shall God perform his great and terrible act in a</span><br><span class="font5">corner without due notice being given to the world power</span><br><span class="font5">of &quot;Christendom&quot;? No; he declares that notice must be</span><br><span class="font5">served upon her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">WITNESSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who then will God have to serve notice upon Christendom? Keep in mind that the issue now is, Who is God?</span><br><span class="font5">To the faithful anointed ones who delight to follow in the</span><br><span class="font5">footsteps of Jesus at this time God says, &quot;Ye are my wit-</span><br><span class="font5">nesses, that I am God.&quot; (Isaiah 43:10, 12) God commands</span><br><span class="font5">his people to go and give this witness, and says to give it</span><br><span class="font5">until the battle is on and until Satan's organization shall</span><br><span class="font5">fall never to rise again. If you are one of the anointed ones</span><br><span class="font5">and love the Lord, you will delight to have a part in obey-</span><br><span class="font5">ing his commandments and will participate in giving the</span><br><span class="font5">witness. Others will not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The events that have come to pass since 1914 have been</span><br><span class="font5">brought sharply to the attention of Christians. These events</span><br><span class="font5">constitute the good news to the faithful and to all who love</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Witnesses</span></h3>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">righteousness. The Lord tells the faithful who love him to</span><br><span class="font5">go and give this witness to the peoples and nations of</span><br><span class="font5">earth. Undoubtedly the World War ceased that the witness</span><br><span class="font5">might be given; and when it is given, it may be expected</span><br><span class="font5">that the battle of Armageddon will follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Last year there was sent to the ruling powers of the world</span><br><span class="font5">due notice that God had set his King upon his throne and</span><br><span class="font5">that the kingdom of heaven is at hand. As was expected,</span><br><span class="font5">they have ignored and spurned that notice, and gnawed their</span><br><span class="font5">tongues. Now notice must be given to the people that go to</span><br><span class="font5">make up Christendom. Those who love the Lord God and</span><br><span class="font5">who have opportunity to give this witness will regard such</span><br><span class="font5">as the greatest privilege that has ever come to them. With</span><br><span class="font5">joy and with boldness let each and every one who is anointed</span><br><span class="font5">prove his love for God by availing himself of every oppor-</span><br><span class="font5">tunity to testify that Jehovah is God, that Christ is King,</span><br><span class="font5">and that the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span></p>
