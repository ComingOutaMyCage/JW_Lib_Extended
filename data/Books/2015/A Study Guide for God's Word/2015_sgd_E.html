<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font42" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Principles of Bible Translation</span></h1>
<p><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible was originally written in ancient Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. Today it is available in whole or in part in about 2,600 languages. The vast majority of people who read the Bible do not understand the original languages and therefore must rely on a translation. What principles should guide how the Bible is translated, and how did these govern the rendering of the </span><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Some might conclude that a strict, word-for-word, interlinear-style translation would enable the reader to get closest to what was expressed in the original languages. However, that is not always the case. Consider a few of the reasons:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> No two languages are exactly alike in grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure. A professor of Hebrew, S. R. Driver, wrote that languages “differ not only in grammar and roots, but also ... in the manner in which ideas are built up into a sentence.” Different languages require quite different thought patterns. “Consequently,” continues Professor Driver, “the forms taken by the sentence in different languages are not the same.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> No modern language exactly mirrors the vocabulary and grammar of Biblical Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek, so a word-for-word translation of the Bible could be unclear or at times could even convey the wrong meaning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> The meaning of a word or an expression may vary depending on the context in which it is used.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">A translator may be able to mirror the literal rendering of the original language in some passages, but this must be done very carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Here are some examples of how word-for-word translation can be misunderstood:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Scriptures use the expressions “sleep” and “fall asleep” to refer both to physical sleep and to the sleep of death. (Matthew 28:13; Acts 7:60) When these expressions are used in contexts that refer to death, Bible translators can use such wording as “fall asleep in death,” which helps the modern reader avoid confusion.—1 Corinthians 7:39; 1 Thessalonians 4:13; 2 Peter 3:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> The apostle Paul used an expression found at Ephesians 4:14 that can be literally translated “in the playing of dice of men.” This ancient idiom alludes to the practice of cheating others when using dice. In most languages, a literal renderi ng of this allusion makes little sense. Translating this expression as “the trickery of men” is a clearer way to convey the meaning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> At Romans 12:11, a Greek expression is used that literally means “to the spirit boiling.” This wording does not convey the intended meaning in English, so it is rendered “aglow with the spirit” in this translation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> During his famous Sermon on the Mount, Jesus used an expression that is often translated “Blessed are the poor in spi rit.” (Matthew 5:3, </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">King James Version</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">) But in many languages, a literal rendering of this expression is obscure. In some cases, a strictly literal translation could imply that “the poor in spi rit” are mentally unbalanced or lacking in vital ity and determination. However, Jesus was here teach i ng people that their happiness depended, not on satisfying their physical needs, but on recognizing their need for God’s guidance. (Luke 6:20) Thus, such renderings as “those conscious of their spiritual need” or “those who know their need for God” convey more accurately the meaning of the original expression.—Mat-thew 5:3; </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The New Testament in Modern English.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">MATTHEW 5:3</span></p>
<p><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;">Litera l English: “the poor in spirit”</span></p>
<p><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;">Idea: “those conscious of their spiritual need”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> In many contexts, the Hebrew word translated “jealousy” corresponds to the common meaning of the Engl ish word, namely, to feel anger over the apparent unfaithfulness of a close associate or to envy others for their possessions. (Proverbs 6:34; Isaiah 11:13) However, the same Hebrew word also has a positive connotation. For example, it may be used of the “zeal,” or protective ardor, that Jehovah shows for his servants or of his “requiring excl usive devotion.” (Exodus 34: 14; 2 Kings 19:31; Ezekiel 5:13; Zechariah 8:2) It may also be used of the “zeal” that his faithful servants have for God and his worsh i p or of their ‘tolerating no rivalry’ toward him. —Psalm 69:9; 119:139; Numbers 25:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Hebrew expression that usually refers to the human hand has a wide va riety of meanings. Depending on the context, this word may be rendered “authority,” “generosity,” or “power.” (2 Samuel 8:3; 1 Kings 10:13; Proverbs 18:21) In fact, this particular word is translated over 40 different ways in the English edition of the </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<div style="border-bottom:solid;">
<p><span class="font24">V</span></p>
<p><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;">The Hebrew word </span><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">yadh</span><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;"> is usually rendered “hand,” but depending on the context, this word may be rendered “authority,” “generosity,” “power,” and many other ways</span></p>
</div><br clear="all"></li></ul>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">In view of these factors, Bible translation involves more than simply rendering an original-language word with the same term each time it occu rs. A translator must use good judgment in order to select words in the target language that best represent the ideas of the original-language text. In addition, there is a need to structu re the sentences in a way that conforms to the rules of grammar of the target language, making the text easy to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">At the same time, extremes in rewording the text must be avoided. A translator who liberally paraphrases the Bible accordi ng to how he interprets the overall idea could distort the meaning of the text. How so? The translator may erroneously insert his opinion of what the original text means or may omit important details contai ned in the original text. So while paraphrases of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible may be easy to read, their very freeness at times may prevent the reader from getting the true message of the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Doctri nal bias can easi ly color a translator’s work. For example, Matthew 7:13 says: “Spacious is the road leading off into destruction.” Some translators, perhaps affected by doctrinal bias, have used the term “hell” rather than what the Greek term really means, namely, “destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">A Bi ble translator must also consider that the Bible was written using the common, everyday language of average people, such as farmers, shepherds, and fishermen. (Nehemiah 8:8, 12; Acts 4:13) Therefore, a good translation of the Bible makes the message it contains understandable to sincere people, regardless of their background. Clear, common, readily understood expressions are preferred over terms that are rarely used by the average person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Quite a number of Bible translators have taken the unjustifiable liberty of omitting God’s name, Jehovah, from modern translations even though that name is found in ancient Bible manuscripts. (See Appendix A4.) Many translations replace the name with a title, such as “Lord,” and some even obscure the fact that God has a name. For example, in some translations, Jesus’ prayer recorded at John 17:26 reads: “I made you known to them,” and at John 17:6, “I have revealed you to those whom you gave me.” However, a faithful rendering of Jesus’ prayer reads: “I have made </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">your name</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> known to them,” and “I have made </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">your name</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> manifest to the men whom you gave me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">As stated in the foreword to the original English edition of the </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation:</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> “We offer no paraphrase of the Scriptures. Our endeavor all through has been to give as literal a translation as possible, where the modern Engl ish idiom allows and where a literal rendition does not for any clumsiness hide the thought.” Thus, the New World Bible Translation Committee has endeavored to strike a balance between using words and phrasing that mirror the original and, at the same time, avoiding wording that reads awkwardly or hides the intended thought. As a result, the Bible can be read with ease and the reader can have full confidence that its inspired message has been transmitted faithfully.—1 Thessalonians 2:13.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font42" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Features of This Revision</span></h1>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> was released in English in 1950, and the complete </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> was published in 1961. Since then, tens of millions of readers in well over 100 languages have benefited from this accurate yet readable rendering of the Holy Scriptures from the original languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Over the past half centu ry, however, languages have changed. The cu rrent New World Bible Translation Committee recognized the need to respond to those changes in order to touch the heart of today’s reader. For this reason, a number of style and vocabulary changes have been made in this revision, with the following objectives in mind:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use of modern, understandable language. For example, the expression “long-suffering” can be misunderstood to mean “someone who suffers for a long time.” However, the intended idea is that of deliberate restrai nt, which is better expressed by the term “patience.” (Galatians 5:22) The now obsolete meaning of “dumb” was replaced with “speechless.” (Matthew 9:32, 33) The term “harlot” was changed to “prostitute.” (Genesis 38:15) In this revision, “fornication” is usually rendered as “sexual immorality”; “loose conduct” as “brazen conduct”; and “revelries” as “wild parties.” (Galatians 5:19-21) The expression “time indefinite” was replaced with such terms as “forever,” “lasting,” “everlasting,” or “long ago,” to convey the intended meaning in each context.—Genesis 3:22; Exodus 31: 16; Psalm 90:2; Ecclesiastes 1:4; Micah 5:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The term “seed” in ancient Hebrew and Greek could refer to plant seed as well as to human offspring, or descendants, or to semen. Because it is no longer common in English to use the term “seed” when referring to humans, it was replaced with expressions that convey the intended idea according to the context. (Genesis 1:11; 22:17; 48:4; Matthew 22:24; John 8:37) In most cases, the term “offspring” is now used when referring to the Edenic promise, found at Genesis 3:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The English verb “impale” was used in previous versions of this Bible in connection with the execution of Jesus. While this term could refer to the way that Jesus was nailed to the torture stake, it is more often used in reference to the ancient method of execution by running a sharp stake through the body and fixing the victim on it. Since Jesus was not impaled </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> the torture stake, this revision uses such expressions as “executed on a stake” and “nailed to the stake” with regard to the manner in which Jesus was fastened to the torture stake.—Matthew 20:19; 27:31, 35.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Biblical expressions clarified. Some terms used in previous editions of the English </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> often needed to be explained in order to be properly understood. For example, the Hebrew term “Sheol” and the Greek term “Hades” are used in the Bible to refer to the common grave of mankind. Those terms are unknown to many, and “Hades” has a dual meaning as a resu lt of its usage in Greek mythology. Therefore, both terms were replaced with what was meant by the Bible writers, “the Grave.” The terms “Sheol” and “Hades” are now given in footnotes.—Psalm 16:10; Acts 2:27.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">In past editions, the Hebrew word </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ne'phesh</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the Greek word </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">psyche'</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> were consistently rendered “soul.” In view of the many misconceptions regarding the meaning of the word “soul,” this approach helped the reader to see how the inspired Bible writers used these original-language terms. Depending on the context, those words may refer (1) to a person, (2) to the life of a person, (3) to living creatures, (4) to the desires and appetite ofa person or, in some cases, (5) even to dead individuals. However, since such use of the word “soul” is not common in English, the decision was made to render these original-language words according to their intended meaning, usually with a footnote that reads “Or ‘soul.’” (See, for example, Genesis 1:20; 2:7; Leviticus 19:28; Psalm 3:2; Proverbs 16:26; Matthew 6:25.) However, in some poetic or well-known contexts, the word “soul” was retained in the main text, along with a footnote referring to the Glossary or showing another possible rendering.—Deuterono-my 6:5; Psalm 131:2; Proverbs 2:10; Matthew 22:37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Similarly, the word “kidney” was retained when it refers to the literal organ. However, when it is used figuratively in such verses as Psalm 7:9 and 26:2 and Revelation 2:23, the intended idea of “deepest emotions” or “innermost thoughts” is conveyed in the main text, and the literal idea is given in a footnote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Like its Hebrew and Greek equivalents, the English expression “heart” has both a literal and a figurative meaning, so it was usually retained in the main text. However, in a few contexts where the sense was not clear, a more explicit rendering was used. For example, in the book of Proverbs, “in want of heart” now reads “lacking good sense,” and the literal idea is given in a footnote. Other expressions, for instance, “fat,” “flesh,” and “horn,” were handled similarly, according to the context. (Genesis 45:18; Ecclesiastes 5:6; Job 16: 15) Some of these expressions are discussed in the “Glossary of Bible Terms.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Enhanced readability. In previous editions of the English </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> auxiliary expressions were used to indicate whether the Hebrew verb is in the imperfect or the perfect state. For example, the continuous action often expressed by imperfect verbs was indicated by means of the expressions “proceeded to,” “went on to,” “came to be,” and so forth. The emphasis often conveyed by the Hebrew perfect verb was denoted by the added expressions “certainly,” “must,” “actually,” and similar ones. As a result, these terms were used thousands of times in the text. In this revision, auxiliary terms were retained in certain contexts by using such expressions as “kept,” “keep on,” and “used to” when there was a valid reason to express continuous action. (Genesis 3:9; 34:1; Proverbs 2:4) However, they were omitted to enhance readability when the auxiliary expressions were not critical for conveying the original meaning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Conveying the correct idea of words involving gender. Hebrew and Greek nouns indicate male or fema le gender, and in Greek, also neuter. At times, though, reflecti ng the gender of the original-language term may obscure the intended meaning. In both Hebrew and Greek, plural nouns are generally masculine, not only when referring exclusively to males but also when referring to both males and females. For example, though the expression “the sons of Israel” may refer to the 12 sons of Jacob, it more often refers to the entire nation of Israel, both men and women. (Genesis 46:5; Exodus 35:29) So in the revision, this phrase was often rendered “Israelites” to show that it refers to the enti re nation. Similarly, the expression “fatherless boy” was rendered “fatherless child” or “orphan” to show that it may refer to a boy or a girl. On the other hand, since the Bible uses the male gender in reference to God and to his Son, as well as to various angels and demons, there is no basis for usi ng genderless terms as is done in some modern translations.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">All adjustments in the Bible text were made prayerfully, carefully, and with deep respect for the fine work of the original New World Bible Translation Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Other features of this revision:</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">This Bible edition contains a limited number of footnotes. The footnotes general ly fall into the following categories:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">“Or” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternative ways the text could be rendered from</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek that would give the same overall idea.—Genesis 1:2, footnote on “active force”; Joshua 1:8, “undertone.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">“Or possibly” Alternative ways the text could be rendered that would convey a valid yet different overall idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">—Genesis 21:6, “laugh with me”; Zechariah 14:21, “Canaanite.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">“Lit.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A word-for-word translation from the Hebrew,</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Aramaic, or Greek or the basic meaning of an original-language expression.—Genesis 30:22, “pregnant”; Exodus 32:9, “obsti nate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Meaning and Meaning of names (Genesis 3:17, “Adam”; Exodus background 15:23, “Marah”); details about weights and mea-information su res (Genesis 6: 15, “cubits”); the antecedent of</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">a pronoun (Genesis 38:5, “He”); helpful information in the Appendix and the Glossary.—Genesis 37:35, “Grave”; Matthew 5:22, “Gehenna.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The front section, entitled “An Introduction to God’s Word,” contains an outline of basic teachi ngs found in the Bible. Immediately following the Bible text is the “Table of the Books of the Bible,” the “Bible Words Index,” and the “Glossary of Bible Terms.” The Glossary helps the reader understand selected expressions according to their Bible-specific usage. Appendix A contains the following sections: “Principles of Bible Translation,” “Featu res of This Revision,” “How the Bible Came to Us,” “The Divine Name in the Hebrew Scriptures,” “The Divine Name in the Christian Greek Scri ptu res,” “Chart: Prophets and Kings of Judah and of Israel,” and “Main Events of Jesus’ Earthly Life.” Appendix B contains maps, charts, and other information useful to diligent Bible students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">In the main text of the Bible, each book features an outline of its chapter contents, along with the related verses, giving the reader an overview of the entire book. The center column of each page contains the most relevant marginal references from previous editions, pointing to related Bible verses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font22">“The word of our God endures forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">— Isaiah 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">That statement is true, even though no original Bible manuscript of the Hebrew and Aramaic Scriptures<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> <a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark15">2</a></sup>&nbsp;or of the Christian Greek Scriptures has survived to our day. Therefore, how can we be so certain that the contents of the Bible we have today truly reflect the original inspired writings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">COPYISTS PRESERVE GOD’S WORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Regarding the Hebrew Scriptures, part of the answer lies in an ancient tradition that was established by God, who said that the text should be copied.<sup><a href="#bookmark15">2</a></sup> For example, Jehovah instructed the kings of Israel to make their own copies of the written Law. (Deuteronomy 17:18) Additionally, God made the Levites responsible for preserving the Law and teaching it to the people. (Deuteronomy 31:26; Nehemiah 8:7) After the exile of the Jews to Babylon, a class of copyists, or scribes (Sopherim), developed. (Ezra 7:6, footnotes) Over time, those scribes made numerous copies of the 39 books of the Hebrew Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Through the centuries, scribes meticulously copied these books. During the Middle Ages, a group of Jewish scribes known as the Masoretes carried on that tradition. The oldest complete Masoretic manuscript is the Leningrad Codex, which dates from 1008/1009 C.E. However, in the middle of the 20th century, some 220 Biblical manuscripts or fragments were discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Those Biblical manuscripts were more than a thousand years older than the Leningrad Codex. A comparison of the Dead Sea Scrolls with the Leningrad Codex confirms a vita l point: While the Dead Sea Scrolls conta i n some variations in wording, none of those variations affect the message itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">What about the 27 books of the Christian Greek Scriptures? Those books were first penned by some of the apostles of Jesus Christ and by a few other early disciples. Following the tradition of the Jewish scribes, ea rly Christians made copies of those books. (Colossians 4:16) Despite attempts by Roman Emperor Diocletian and others to destroy all early Christian literature, thousands of ancient fragments and manuscripts have been preserved until our day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian writings were also translated into other languages. Early translations of the Bible include those in such ancient languages as Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopic,</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Georgian, Latin, and Syriac. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">ESTABLISHING THE HEBREW AND GREEK TEXTS FOR TRANSLATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Not all copies of ancient Bible manuscripts contain identical wordi ng. How, then, can we know what the original text contained? The situation could be likened to that of a teacher who asks 100 students to copy a chapter of a book. Even if the original chapter was later lost, a comparison of the 100 copies would still reveal the original text. While each student might make some errors, it is highly unlikely that all the students would make exactly the same ones. Similarly, when scholars compare the thousands of fragments and copies of ancient Bible books available to them, they can detect copyist error and determine the original wordi ng.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">How confident can we be that the thoughts contained inthe original Bi ble texts have been accurately transmitted to us? Com-menti ng on the text of the Hebrew Scriptures, scholar William H. Green stated: “It may be safely said that no other work of antiquity has been so accurately transmitted.” Regarding the Christian Greek Scriptures, or so-ca lled New Testament, Bible scholar F. F. Bruce wrote: “The evidence for our New Testament writings is ever so much greater than the evidence for many writings of classical authors, the authenticity of which no one dreams of</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Chapter 40 of Isaiah’s book in the Dead Sea Scrolls (dated from 125 to 100 B.C.E.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">When compared with Hebrew manuscripts from about a thousand years later, only minor differences were found, mostly in spelling </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">questioning.” He also said: “If the New Testament were a collection of secular writings, their authenticity would generally be regarded as beyond all doubt.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Hebrew Text: The </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1953 -1960) was based on </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Biblia Hebraica,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Rudolf Kittel. Since that time, updated editions of the Hebrew text, namely, </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Biblia Hebraica Quinta, </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">have included recent research based on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other ancient manuscripts. These scholarly works reproduce the Leningrad Codex in the main text along with footnotes that conta in comparative wording from other sources, including the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Greek </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sep-tuagint,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Aramaic Targums, the Latin </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vulgate,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the Syriac </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peshitta.</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Both </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Biblia Hebrai-ca Quinta</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> were consulted when preparing the present revision of the </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Greek Text: In the late 19th century, scholars B. F. Westcott and F.J.A. Hort compared existing Bible manuscripts and fragments as they prepared the Greek master text that they felt most closely reflected the original writings. In the mid-20th centu ry, the New World Bible Translation Committee used that master text as the basis for its translation. Other ea rly papyri, thought to date back to the second and third centu ries C.E., were also used. Since then, more papyri have become available. In addition, master texts such as those by Nestle and Aland and by the United Bible Societies reflect recent scholarly studies. Some of the findings of this research were incorporated into this present revision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Based on those master texts, it is evident that some verses of the Christian Greek Scriptu res found in older translations, such as the </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">King James Version,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> were actual ly additions made by later copyists and were never part of the inspired Scriptures. However, because the verse division general ly accepted in Bible translations was already established in the 16th century, the omission of these verses now creates gaps in the verse numbering in most Bibles. The verses are Matthew 17:21; 18:11; 23:14; Mark 7: 16; 9: 44, 46; 11:26; 15:28; Luke 17:36; 23:17; John 5:4; Acts 8:37; 15: 34; 24:7; 28:29; and Romans 16:24. In this revised ed ition, those omitted verses are indicated by a footnote at the location of the omission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Regarding the long conclusion for Mark 16 (verses 9-20), the short conclusion for Mark 16, and the wording found at</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">John 7:53-8:11, it is evident that none of these verses were included in the original manuscripts. Therefore, those spurious texts have not been included in this revision.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Some other wording has been adjusted to incorporate what scholars generally accept as the most authentic reflection of the original writings. For instance, according to some manuscripts, Matthew 7:13 reads: “Go in through the narrow gate because broad </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">is the gate</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> and spacious is the road leading off into destruction.” In previous editions of the </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> “is the gate” was not included in the text. However, further study of the manuscript evidence led to the conclusion that “is the gate” was in the original text. So it was included in this present edition. There are a number of similar refinements. However, these adjustments are minor, and none of them change the basic message of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* </span><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;">Further details on why these verses are viewed as spurious can be found in the footnotes of the </span><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation ofthe Holy Scriptures—With References, </span><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;">published in 1984.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font42" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>The Divine Name in the Hebrew Scriptures</span></h1>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The divine name, represented by the four Hebrew consonants niH’, appears nearly 7,000 times in the Hebrew Scriptures. This translation renders those four letters, known as the Tetragram-maton, “Jehovah.” That name is by farthe mostfrequently occurring name in the Bible. While the inspired writers refer to God by many titles and descriptive terms, such as “Almighty,” “Most High,” and “Lord,” the Tetragrammaton is the only personal name they use to identify God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God himself directed Bible writers to use his name. For example, he inspired the prophet Joel to write: “Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.” (Joel 2:32) And God caused one psalmist to write: “May people know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High overall the earth.” (Psalm 83: 18) In fact, the divine name appears some 700 times in the book of Psalms alone—a book of poetic writi ngs that were to be sung and recited by God’s people. Why, then, is God’s name missing from many Bible translations? Why does this translation use the form “Jehovah”? And what does the divine</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">name, Jehovah, mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Why is the name missing from many Bible translations? The reasons vary. Some feel that Almighty God does not need a unique name to identify him. Others appear to have been influenced by the Jewish tradition of avoiding the use of the name, perhaps out of fear of desecrating it. Still others believe that since no one can be sure of the exact pronunciation of God’s name, it is better just to use a title, such as “Lord” or “God.” Such objections, however, lack merit for the following reasons:</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Translators who remove the name out of deference to Jewish tradition fail to recognize a key fact. While some Jewish scri bes refused to pronounce the name, they did not remove it from their copies of the Bible. Ancient scrolls found in Qum-ran, near the Dead Sea, contai n the name in many places. Some Bible translators hint that the divine name appeared in the original text by substituting the title “LORD” in capital letters. But the question remains, Why have these translators felt free to substitute or remove God’s name from the Bible when they acknowledge that it is found in the Bible text thousands of times? Who do they believe gave them authority to make such a change? Only they can say.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Those who say that the divine name should not be used because it is not known exactly how to pronounce it will nevertheless freely use the name Jesus. However, Jesus’ first-century disciples said his name quite differently from the way most Christians do today. To Jewish Christians, the name Jesus was probably pronounced </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ye</span><span class="font19" style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">shu'a'.</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> And the title “Christ” was </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ma^shi'ach,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> or “Messiah.” Greek-speaking Christians called him </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I-e-sous' Khrrstos',</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Latin-speaking Christians </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">le'sus Chri'stus.</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Under inspiration, the Greek translation of his name was recorded in the Bible, showing that first-century Christians followed the sensible course of using the form of the name common in their language. Similarly, the New World Bible Translation Comm ittee feels that it is reasonable to use the form “Jehovah,” even though that rendering is not exactly the way the divine name would have been pronounced in ancient Hebrew.</span></p></li></ul>

In English, the four letters of the Tetragrammaton (HW’) are represented by the consonants YHWH. As was true of all written words in ancient Hebrew, the Tetragrammaton contained no vowels. When ancient Hebrew was in everyday use, readers easily provided the appropriate vowels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">About a thousand years after the Hebrew Scriptures were completed, Jewish scholars developed a system of pronunciation points, or signs, by which to indicate what vowels to use when reading Hebrew. By that time, though, many Jews had the</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">superstitious idea that it was wrong to say God’s personal name out loud, so they used substitute expressions. Thus, it seems that when they copied the Tetragrammaton, they combined the vowels for the </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">substitute expressions</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> with the four consonants representing the divine name. Therefore, the manuscripts with those vowel points do not help in determining how the name was originally pronounced in Hebrew. Some feel that the name was pronounced “Yahweh,” whereas others suggest different possibilities. A Dead Sea Scroll containing a portion of Leviticus in Greek transliterates the divine name </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Iao.</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Besides that form, early Greek writers also suggest the pronunciations </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">lae, babe',</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">baou^e'.</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> However, there is no reason to be dogmatic. We simply do not know how God’s ancient servants pronounced this name in Hebrew. (Genesis 13:4; Exodus 3:15) What we do know is that God used his name repeatedly in communication with his people, that they addressed him by that name, and that they used it freely in speaking with others.—Exodus 6:2; 1 Kings 8:23; Psalm 99:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Why, then, does this translation use the form “Jehovah”? Because that form of the divine name has a long history in the English language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The first rendering of God’s personal name in an English Bible appeared in 1530 in William Tyndale’s translation of the Pentateuch. He used the form “Iehouah.” Over time, the English language changed, and the spelling of the divine name was modernized. For example, in 1612, Henry Ainsworth used the form “Iehovah” throughout his translation of the book of Psalms. Then, in 1639, when that work was revised and printed with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Pentateuch, the form “Jehovah” was used. In 1901, the translators who produced the </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Standard Version</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Bible used the form “Jehovah” where the divine name appeared in the Hebrew text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Explaining why he used “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh” in his 1911 work </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Studies in the Psalms,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> respected Bible scholar Joseph Bryant Rotherham said that he wanted to employ a “form of the name more familiar (while perfectly acceptable) to the general Bible-reading public.” In 1930 scholar A. F. Kirkpatrick made a similar poi nt regarding the use of the form “Jehovah.” He said: “Modern grammarians argue that it ought to be read </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yahveh</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Yahaveh;</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> but JEHOVAH seems firmly rooted in the English language, and the really important point is not the exact pronunciation, but the recognition that it is a Proper Name, not merely an appellative title like ‘Lord.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the meaning of the name Jehovah? In Hebrew, the name Jehovah comes from a verb that means “to become,” and a number of scholars feel that it refleets the causative form of that Hebrew -------------- verb. Thus, the understanding of the New World Bible Translation Committee is that God’s name means “He Causes to Become.” Scholars hold varying views, so we cannot be dogmatic about this meaning. However, this definition well fits Jehovah’s role as the Creator of all things and the Fulfiller of his purpose. He not only caused the physical universe and intelligent beings to exist, but as events unfold, he conti nues to cause his will and purpose to be realized.</span></p>

<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore, the meaning of the name Jehovah is not limited to the related verb found at Exodus 3:14, which reads: “I Will Become What I Choose to Become” or, “I Will Prove to Be What I Will Prove to Be.” In the strictest sense, those words do not fully define God’s name. Rather, they reveal an aspect of God’s persona lity, showi ng that he becomes what is needed in each circumstance to fulfill his purpose. So while the name Jehovah may include this idea, it is not limited to what he himself chooses to become. It also includes what he causes to happen with regard to his creation and the accomplishment of his purpose.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font42" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>The Divine Name in the Christian Greek Scriptures</span></h1>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible scholars acknowledge that God’s personal name, as represented by the Tetragrammaton (HIH’), appears almost 7,000 times in the original text of the Hebrew Scriptures. However, many feel that it did not appear in the original text of the Christian Greek Scriptures. For this reason, most modern English Bibles do not use the name Jehovah when translating the so-called New Testament. Even when translating quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures in which the Tetragrammaton appears, most translators use “Lord” rather than God’s personal name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> does not follow this common practice. It uses the name Jehovah a total of 237 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures. In deciding to do this, the translators took into consideration two important factors: (1) The Greek manuscripts we possess today are not the originals. Of the thousands of copies in existence today, most were made at least two centuries after the originals were composed. (2) By that time, those copying the manuscripts either replaced the Tetragrammaton with </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ky'ri-os,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Greek word for “Lord,” or they copied from manuscripts where this had already been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">The New World Bible Translation Committee determined that there is compelling evidence that the Tetragrammaton did appear in the original Greek manuscripts. The decision was based on the following evidence:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Copies of the Hebrew Scriptures used in the days of Jesus and his apostles contained the Tetragrammaton throughout the text. In the past, few people disputed that conclusion. Now that copies of the Hebrew Scriptures dating back to the first century have been discovered near Qumran, the point has been proved beyond any doubt.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the days of Jesus and his apostles, the Tetragrammaton also appeared in Greek translations of the Hebrew Scriptures. For centuries, scholars thought that the Tetragramma-ton was absent from manuscripts of the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Scriptures. Then, in the mid-20th centu ry, some very old fragments of the Greek Septu-agint version that existed in Jesus’ day were brought to the attention of scholars. Those fragments contain the personal name of God, written in Hebrew characters. So in Jesus’ day, copies of the Scriptures in Greek did contain the divine name. However, by the fourth century C.E., major manuscripts of the Greek </span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Septuagint,</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> such as the Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus, did not contain the divine name in the books from Genesis through Malachi (where it had been in earlier manuscripts). Hence, it is not su rprising that in texts preserved from that time period, the divine name is not found in the so-called New Testament, or Greek Scriptu re portion of the Bible.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Christian Greek Scriptures themselves report that Jesus often referred to God’s name and made it known to oth-</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">ers. (John 17:6, 11, 12, 26) Jesus plainly stated: “I have come in the name of my Father.” He also stressed that his works were done in his “Father’s name.”—John 5:43; 10:25.</span></p>

<p><span class="font38" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus plainly stated: “I have come in the name of my Father.” He also stressed that his works were done in his “Father’s name”</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Since the Christian Greek Scriptures were an inspired addition to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures, the sudden disappearance of Jehovah’s name from the text would seem inconsistent. About the middle of the first centu ry C.E., the disciple James said to the elders in Jerusalem: “Symeon has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.” (Acts 15:14) It would not be logical for James to make such a statement if no one in the first century knew or used God’s name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> The divine name appears in its abbreviated form in the Christian Greek Scriptures. At Revelation 19:1, 3, 4, 6, the divine name is embedded in the word “Hallelujah.” This comes from a Hebrew expression that literally means “Praise Jah.” “Jah” is a contraction of the name Jehovah. Many names used in the Christian Greek Scriptu res were derived from the divine name. In fact, reference works explain that Jesus’ own name means “Jehovah Is Salvation.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font22">•</span><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;"> Early Jewish writings indicate that Jewish Christians used the divine name in their writings. The Tosefta, a written collection of oral laws that was completed by about 300 C.E., says with</span></p>

Wand, Bishop of London (1946). In addition, in a Spanish translation in the early 20th century, translator Pablo Besson used “Jehova” at Luke 2:15 and Jude 14, and nearly 100 footnotes in his translation suggest the divine name as a likely rendering. Long before those translations, Hebrew versions of the Christian Greek Scriptures from the 16th century onward used the Tetragrammaton in many passages. In the German language alone, at least 11 versions </span><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;">use “Jehovah” (or the transliteration of the Hebrew “Yahweh”) in the Christian Greek Scriptures, while four translators add the name in parentheses after “Lord.” More than 70 German translations use the divine name in footnotes or commentaries.</span></p>

(See the list on pages 1742 and 1743.) The translators of these editions decided to use the divine name for reasons similar to those stated above. Some of these translations of the Christian Greek Scriptures have appeared recently, such as the Rotu-man Bible (1999), which uses “Jihova” 51 times in 48 verses, and the Batak (Toba) version (1989) from Indonesia, which uses “Jahowa” 110 times.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font41" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>The Message of the Bible</span></h1>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God has the right to rule. His method of ruling is best. His purpose for the earth and for mankind will be fulfilled.</span></p><img src="2015_sgd_E_files/2015_sgd_E-31.jpg" alt="" style="width:611pt;height:125pt;">
<table border="1">
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">After 4026 </span><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C.E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">“The serpent” questions Jehovah’s right to rule and his way of ruling. Jehovah promises to raise upan “offspring,” or a “seed,” who will eventually crush the serpent, Satan. (Genesis 3: 1-5,15, footnote) However, Jehovah allows time for humans to rule themselves under the serpent’s influence.</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">1943 </span><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C.E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah tells Abraham that the promised “offspring” will be one of his descendants. —Genesis 22:18.</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">After 1070 </span><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C.E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah assures King David and later his son Solomon that the promised “offspring” would come through their family line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">—2 Samuel 7:12, 16; 1 Kings 9:3-5;</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Isaiah 9:6, 7.</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah identifies Jesus as the promised “offspring” who is the Heir to David’s throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">—Galatians 3:16; Luke1:31-33;</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">3:21, 22.</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:middle;">
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">33 </span><span class="font36" style="font-weight:bold;">C.E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">The serpent, Satan, briefly cripples the promised “offspring” by having Jesus killed. Jehovah raises Jesus to life in heaven and accepts the value of Jesus’ perfect life, thus providing the basis to forgive sins and to give Adam’s descendants everlasting life. —Genesis 3:15; Acts 2:32-36;</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Corinthians 15: 21, 22.</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus hurls the serpent, Satan, to the earth, confining him there for a short time.—Revelation 12:7-9, 12.</span></p></td><td style="vertical-align:top;">
<p><span class="font37" style="font-weight:bold;">Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus imprisons Satan for 1,000 years and then destroys him, symbolically crushing his head. Jehovah’s original purpose for the earth and for mankind is fulfilled, his name is cleared of reproach, and his way of ruling is vindi-cated.—Revelation 20:1-3, 10; 21:3, 4.</span></p></td></tr>
