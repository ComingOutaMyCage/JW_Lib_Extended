<p><span class="font1">Satan said, in effect, that no man could be put on earth who would maintain integrity to Jehovah if he, Satan, was allowed to put the man to the test. The integrity of all of God’s servants in heaven and on earth was called into question. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">4. Could the issue of sovereignty have been settled in Eden? Why? [O-1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it-2 1011 par. 6; rs428</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">par. 3]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No, the question is not one of might or of raw strength; it is primarily a moral issue. God’s allowing time to pass permits all creatures with free will the opportunity to demonstrate where they personally stand on these vital matters. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">5. What does it mean to have “the mind of Christ”? [S-1; 1 Cor. 2:16; w07 8/1 4 par. 4]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">To have “the mind of Christ” is to know the pattern of his thinking, to think as he does, to know what he might do in a particular situation, and to imitate his example.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">6. How can we get to know “the mind of Christ”? [S-1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w07 8/1 4]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">We must regularly fill our minds with the understanding of Jesus’ life and example through a regular study of the Scriptures, particularly the Gospel accounts, along with Bible study aids.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">7. At Cedar Point, Ohio, in 1919, Brother Rutherford explained that “a Christian’s mission on earth”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">is what? [H-2; jv 77]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To proclaim the message of the Lord’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">8. How has Isaiah 60:17 been progressively fulfilled, and who should be credited for this? [O-4; w02 7/1 16-17 pars. 7-11]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s Witnesses have experienced improvements in their organizational arrangements throughout the last days. Jehovah is behind these progressive changes.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">9. Why is it especially important for us to be submissive to theocratic organization today? [O-5;</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1 Pet. 5:8; Rev. 12:12b; w94 7/1 24 par. 3]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Satan knows that his time is short, and he is focusing his anger on Jehovah’s servants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our willing submission to Jehovah’s sovereignty brings us peace and happiness now and a wonderful hope for the future.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">10. What does it mean to seek God’s righteousness? [S-6; Matt. 6:33; it-2 810 par. 5]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">It means to conform to God’s will and to God’s standard of right and wrong in conduct. A person must continually make his mind over so that every facet of his life is in accord with God’s righteousness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">11. In our modern times, the first conventions were held in connection with what annual observance? [H-7; jv254]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The Memorial</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">12. When was the great crowd clearly identified? [H-5; jv 166-167]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">1935</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">13. Why and how should the first step of Matthew 18:15-17 be applied? [O-9; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;od 147 par. 2-148</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">par. 2]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When there is solid evidence that someone in the congregation has committed a serious sin, such as those involving financial or property matters, against you personally, try to resolve the matter between just the two of you without involving anyone else. If the person does not initially admit the wrong and ask forgiveness, it may be good to consider approaching him again later. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">14. What is involved in taking the second step of Matthew 18? [O-9; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;od 149 par. 1]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">If you are not able to gain your brother by ‘laying bare his fault between you and him alone,’ then you may take along one or two others and speak with your brother again. Those you take with you should also have the objective of gaining your brother. Preferably, they would be witnesses of the alleged wrongdoing. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">15. When only is this matter reported to the overseers of the congregation? What procedure is then followed? [O-9; od 149 pars. 2-3]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">If you are convinced that your brother has committed a serious sin against you and you have evidence to prove it and the matter has not been resolved after repeated efforts—when you spoke with him alone and when you went to him with one or two others—and you feel that you cannot let it pass, then you should report the matter to the overseers of the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If upon investigation it becomes evident to the shepherds of the flock that the brother has indeed committed a serious sin against you and yet is unwilling to repent and try to make reasonable and appropriate amends, it may become necessary for the overseers to expel the unrepentant wrongdoer. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">16. What is the difference between goodness and righteousness? [S-14; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w85 10/1 26; w75 477</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">pars. 3-6; it2 809]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A righteous man fulfills proper obligations and is just, impartial, honest, upright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The good man shows benevolence, going beyond what justice requires. He shows consideration and a desire to help and benefit others.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">17. Why did C. T. Russell withdraw his support from the magazine Herald of the Morning? [H-13; jv718 par. 6]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Russell withdrew all support from Herald of the Morning because of Barbour’s attitude toward the ransom. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">18. Briefly explain the phrase “gather all things together again in the Christ,” found at Ephesians 1:10. [A-1; wt 186 par. 6]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">This is God’s “administration” that centers on Jesus Christ. Through him, humans are brought into an approved condition before God. A limited number of them have the prospect of being in heaven. A far greater number will live on earth forever.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">19. What is the key to being a person of godly principle? [A-5; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w97 10/15 29 par. 2]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The key to being a person of godly principle is really to know Jehovah, his likes, his dislikes, and his purposes. We must apply these living principles and allow them to govern our lives.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">20. Explain what is meant by “shadow” and “reality” at Colossians 2:16, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17. [A-4; it-2 905 par. 3;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">1131 par. 6]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Law gave an ideal of the general shape or design of the reality. Jesus put the things foreshadowed by the Law into the realm of actual truth by undeserved kindness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">21. Who arranges for the appointment of qualified elders to serve as traveling overseers? [O-13; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;od</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">46 par. 1]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Governing Body</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">22. What Scriptural command highlights the need to share fully in the return visit work? [F-6; Matt. 10:11; 28:19, 20; od 97 par. 1]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Matthew 28:19, 20: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">23. In what two outstanding ways did Jesus bear witness to the truth? [F-1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John 18:37;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">jv20 pars. 2-3]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First, Jesus preached the truth to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Second, Jesus lived in such a way as to fulfill God’s truth, including all the things prophesied about him. He thus confirmed and guaranteed the truth of Jehovah’s prophetic word.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">24. What can be done to follow up on interest while street witnessing? [F-4; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;km 9/96 4 pars. 12-13]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Obtain the person’s name, address, and telephone number. Ask if there is some way that you may continue the conversation at another time. If the person lives in the territory of another congregation, pass the information along to the brothers there. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">25. In what way was Barnabas a fine example in accepting theocratic adjustments? [F-12; Acts 13:13-16; w92 9/1 11 par. 8]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Under the influence of Jehovah’s spirit, Paul played a major part in the conversion of Sergius Paulus. (Acts 13:8-12) Also, from this time onward, it appears that Paul took the lead. Instead of viewing this change as a personal affront, Barnabas likely lived up to the meaning of his name, “Son of Comfort,” and loyally supported Paul throughout the missionary journey.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">26. What is the secret to a successful marriage? [F-13; &nbsp;&nbsp;w112/1 9 pars. 5-6; g7/08 9 pars. 5-6]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The secret is love for God and willingness to apply the counsel contained in his Word, the Bible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">27. State the circumstances that prevailed when God issued his command prohibiting the misuse of blood. [A-8; Gen. 9:3-6; w04 6/15 14-15 pars. 5-6]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">After the Flood, mankind started anew with just eight souls.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">28. How important was God’s command to “love your fellow as yourself”? [A-9; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lev. 19:18;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Matt. 22:37-40; it-2 219, bottom left]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus indicated that this was the second greatest commandment in the Law.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">29. Describe the emblems used at the Memorial. Explain the expressions “this means my body” and “this means my blood.” [M-5; Matt. 26:26-28; w08 4/1 27 par. 6-28 par. 2;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">w04 3/15 5 pars. 2-3; w85 2/15 19, box]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus used the unleavened bread and red wine as symbols. The unleavened bread meant, or represented, his sinless body that would be sacrificed. The red wine signified his blood that would be poured out “in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">30. How do Christian women demonstrate their regard for headship in Jehovah’s arrangement, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">in what sense do they do this “because of the angels”? [O-15; 1 Cor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11:3, 5, 10, ftn.; lv211-212]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The angels are interested in seeing that divine authority is recognized throughout Jehovah’s organization, in heaven and on earth. They also benefit from the examples of imperfect humans in this regard. After all, the angels too have to be submissive to Jehovah’s arrangement—a test that more than a few angels failed in times past. Now the angels may see instances when a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Christian woman is more experienced, more knowledgeable, and more intelligent than a baptized male in the congregation; yet, she readily shows her submission to his authority.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">31. What basic Scriptural principle should be followed at all receptions and social gatherings? [O-18; Rom. 13:11-14; 1 Cor. 10:31-33]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">1 Corinthians 10:31-33: “Therefore, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory. Keep from becoming causes for stumbling to Jews as well as Greeks and to the congregation of God, even as I am pleasing all people in all things, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, in order that they might get saved.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">32. How does the Governing Body give direction for the preaching work today just as was done in the first century? [O-21; od 17 pars. 1-2]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">From Pentecost 33 C.E. onward, the faithful apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ took the lead in providing direction for the newly founded Christian congregation. (Acts 4:33, 35, 37; 5:18, 29) By about the year 49 C.E., this governing body had been enlarged to include more than Jesus’ apostles. When the circumcision issue was decided, that body included “the apostles and older men in Jerusalem.” (Acts 15:1, 2) It was their responsibility to consider matters a ffcting Christians everywhere. They sent out letters and decrees, all of which strengthened the congregations and made it possible for the disciples to remain united in thought and action. The congregations followed the direction of the governing body, and as a result, received Jehovah’s blessing and prospered.—Acts 8:1, 14, 15; 15:22-31; 16:4, 5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">33. What does it take to be a skillful counselor? [O-22; 1 Pet. 3:8; w95 11/15 23 pars. 4-8]</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">Note to instructor: This outline is the first in a series designed to help the students to have a better understanding of the reasons for Jehovah’s laws and the loving and wise principles behind them.

<p><span class="font1">Introduction: Obedience to divine laws is not popular today. For many, deferring to an invisible higher authority seems pointless. We live in an era of blurred boundaries between right and wrong and of huge so-called gray areas, resulting in moral decay. Since so many today are second-guessing the value of Jehovah’s laws, we need to fortify our conviction that all divine standards are for our benefit. In the discussion that follows, we will note that the fundamental regulations in Jehovah’s Word reveal that his laws are much more than just a list of cold, legalistic statutes. They form the basis for a balanced, productive life with all aspects of conduct being affected for good. In brief, all forms of divine law are edifying, ethical, and instructive.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“an administration” for the purpose of unifying his loyal subjects.

<p><span class="font1">Law was both “a shadow” and “a tutor” with a very specific objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before we consider</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">specific elements of that Law, it would be to our benefit to lay a foundation for appreciating the principles behind those laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will learn what the Law teaches us about Jehovah’s thinking on</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“The life prospects of people depend on their attitude toward Jehovah God and his Kingdom by Christ Jesus. The message of God’s Kingdom is thrilling, and it points to the only dependable hope for humankind. It is a message that transforms lives. We want everyone to hear it. We realize that only a minority will receive it appreciatively, but we know that people at least need to hear it if they are to make an informed choice. Yet not everyone is willing to listen, and we do not try to force them. But with discernment it is often possible to turn potential conversation stoppers into opportunities for further discussion. Here are examples of what some experienced Witnesses have used in their efforts to search out deserving ones. (Matt. 10:11) Our recommendation is not that you memorize any of these replies but that you get the idea in mind, put it in your own words and express it in a manner that conveys your genuine interest in the person to whom you are speaking. As you do so, you can have confidence that those whose hearts are rightly disposed will listen and respond appreciatively to what Jehovah is doing to draw them to his loving provisions for life.—John 6:44; Acts 16:14.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">“Know What Your Objectives Are: First, by being warm and friendly, do your best to put the householder at ease. Show that you are interested in him as a person, without being unduly familiar. Next, remind him of any question you raised on the previous visit. Listen carefully to his opinion, and express sincere appreciation for his comments. Then, show why the Bible’s viewpoint is practical. . . .

<p><span class="font1">“Use the Telephone to Find and Develop Interest: A pioneer sister uses the telephone to reach people living in high-security buildings. She also makes return visits in the same way. On the initial call, she says: ‘I know you don’t know me. I am making a special effort to contact people in your area to share a thought from the Bible. If you have a moment, I would like to read the promise found at . . .’ After reading the scripture, she says: ‘Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could see that time come? I have enjoyed reading this to you. If you have enjoyed it too, I would like to call again and discuss another scripture.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“On the return phone call, she reminds the householder of their previous conversation and says she would like to read from the Bible what conditions will be like when wickedness is done away with. Then she has a brief Bible discussion with the householder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of many</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">telephone conversations, 35 people have invited her to their home and seven home Bible studies have been started!

<p><span class="font1">We must refuse to allow our mind to dwell on things that are obscene, shameful, or base, and we should not discuss such things in unnecessary conversation.

<p><span class="font1">Note to the speaker: This outline should serve as a general guide for your discussion. Do not feel that you must cover every point or scripture in the outline. You may decide how much of this material you are able to develop and adapt it to the class within the allotted time</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">PRAYER—A UNIQUE PRIVILEGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the most precious privileges we enjoy is talking to our heavenly Father in prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fact that we can at any time and in any place address God and be heard is most comforting</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God’s Word urges us to “persevere in prayer” (Ro 12:12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From Jesus’ numerous prayers, we perceive that he felt the need to maintain communication with his Father during his earthly life course (Heb 5:7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even though he possessed miraculous powers, prayer was a prominent part of his life</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus always looked to his Father in heaven for wisdom and strength, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he sought out</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">quiet places to meditate and commune with Jehovah (Mr 1:35)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He did not treat prayer in a casual way, and he was never too busy to pray</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He taught his disciples to pray and explained to them why God would answer their prayers (Lu 11:2-4, 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In imitation of Christ, strive to be men and women of prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a loving Father, Jehovah wants us to talk to him regularly because it is good for us</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We build our trust in Jehovah, and we develop deep affection for him</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The more we learn to rely on Jehovah, the closer he will draw to us (Jas 4:8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Paul wrote to the Corinthian congregation concerning his experience in serving God, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">said: “When I am weak, then I am powerful” (2Co 12:10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What did Paul mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He meant that the power of God can make up for our human weaknesses, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided we</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">turn to Jehovah for strength (Php 4:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To have confidence like that of Paul, elders must appreciate the importance of ‘praying incessantly’—relying wholly on Jehovah for strength to accomplish the work he has given them to do (1Th 5:17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MAKE TIME TO PRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since prayer is part of our worship, spiritual men and women must make time to pray</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Setting aside some private time each day for personal prayer might be challenging but is well worth the effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Benefits of prayer are innumerable</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prayer is healthful in that it enriches the mind and fortifies the heart; it enables us to receive “power beyond what is normal” (2Co 4:7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Through prayer, we can ask Jehovah for help to analyze our motives and guard against self-deception; this will help us to see our heart as he sees it (1Sa 16:7; Pr 17:3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When alone with Jehovah in prayer, we can take an honest look at ourselves and see the type of person we truly are inside (Ps 139:1-4; Heb 4:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In prayer, we acknowledge our dependence on God for everything; humility is developed, and confidence and trust in Jehovah’s arrangement for salvation are nurtured</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only does prayer build appreciation for what is good and right but it also creates the right climate in which those qualities grow</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prayer exposes wrong desires before they have time to become solidly entrenched</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The right things to do are often the most difficult, but prayer will give us the strength to do them</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In view of the importance of prayer, ask yourself: ‘Do I take time to prepare my prayers?’ (Ps 141:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah commanded Moses to have sacred incense prepared for use at the tabernacle</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The divine formula had to be carefully prepared using a fourfold aromatic mixture</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The burning of sweet-smelling incense symbolized acceptable prayers offered up by</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s servants (Ex 30:34-38; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w99 1/15 10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We learn that Jehovah does not just tolerate our prayers but finds pleasure in them</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What a wonderful gift prayer is! Day and night, in any language, we can speak to God and tell him what is in our heart and on our mind!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cold, mechanical prayer is of little value; rather, “pour out your heart” to God (Ps 62:8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Friendship grows as we talk with others at length; therefore, why not work on increasing the length of your private prayers to Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Supplications to God should be part of our spiritual routine; such prayers are especially intense and earnest (Php 4:6; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g97 5/22 19 par. 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are no concerns or thoughts too trivial for our heavenly Father ( &nbsp;&nbsp;w97 7/1 27 par. 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah acts on prayers, proving that he is the “Hearer of prayer” (Ps 65:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Questions for meditation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do I find myself so overwhelmed by circumstances that I overlook the need to pray?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do I find myself too busy to pray?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Are my prayers similar to a short postcard that I would send to an acquaintance out of duty, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">are my prayers like a long letter that I would send to a close friend?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make it your aim to be men and women of prayer in spite of busy schedules, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since there is an</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ever-present danger of neglecting prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“DO NOT BRING US INTO TEMPTATION”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We must take seriously Jesus’ words found at Luke 11:4: “Do not bring us into temptation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus told his disciples: “Keep on the watch and pray continually, that you may not enter into temptation” (Mt 26:41)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unprepared, the disciples entered into temptation (Mt 26:45; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w72 528 par. 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the help of prayer, we can resist temptations of the sinful flesh</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We can ask Jehovah not to allow us to succumb when tempted or pressured to disobey him</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your stalwart example has a positive effect on the flock [Refer to life story of Karl &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klein, w84</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10/1 28]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Revelation 3:10 mentions “the hour of test”; today, pressures from human sources and from invisible demon sources have become intense</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A great temptation is for a person to yield to worldly pressures and attractions and to become a part of this present wicked system of things</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Temptations are from the Devil, our sinful flesh, and the weaknesses of others, but our loving Father can guide us, so that we are not overwhelmed ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w90 5/15 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By holding fast to our decision to worship Jehovah and by giving our full &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support to his</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Kingdom and the preaching work, we can be kept from falling during this period of testing (w03 5/15 18 par. 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Note how prayer strengthened Stanley Jones, who was imprisoned in China for seven years: “When I was first in prison I could fervently pray to Jehovah God. But when there is no stimulus from other brothers, as time goes by there is a tendency, I found, to feel that prayer was repetitious and therefore not so effective. The tendency may be to neglect it. This can happen over a period of many years. But here was a scripture saying: ‘Persevere in prayer; keep on, your prayers are effective and they can strengthen you.’ And they did. They kept me going when I felt down” (Ro 12:12; w65 763)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah answered Brother Jones’ prayers by strengthening him to endure his tribulation; prayer will help us keep spiritually strong even if we are not under bitter persecution</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">PRAY TO MAKE RIGHT DECISIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are constantly called on to exercise wisdom in making right decisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Take to heart the counsel found at James 1:5, &nbsp;6 [Read]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is beneficial to talk to Jehovah when you are confronted with problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be specific about what the problem is and why you need his help on this matter</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Speak with him on what you have done to try to solve it; this will help you to see if you can do more</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Holy spirit may help you better understand the scriptures that you are considering and bring to mind those you may have overlooked</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prayer helps you to stop and think when making decisions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember, Jesus spent the whole night in prayer before choosing the apostles (Lu 6:12, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If elders are about to make recommendations or to approve appointments, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prayer can aid</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">them in seeing that their selections are not tainted with personal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;favoritism or partiality</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fewer mistakes would be made if men in positions of responsibility would spend more time with Jehovah in prayer before reaching their conclusions</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As elders make congregation matters a subject of prayer, it shows their earnest desire to render judgment with righteousness (Jer 11:20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Daily you face decisions that affect you, your family, your brothers, and your relationship with God</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is appropriate to seek Jehovah’s direction, asking that ‘God’s will take place’ (Mt 6:10; 26:42)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At times, your work may be demanding; your physical strength may run out; your mental powers might become exhausted; and serious problems may need to be solved</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is especially the time to lean on Almighty God for help, direction, wisdom, and strength</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2Ch 20:12)</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">and his ears are</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Be confident that “the eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous ones, toward their cry for help” (Ps 34:15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When we learn what pleases Jehovah, we must then act decisively and with confidence</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When confronted with situations that put our faith to the test, we should never be too busy to pray</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is comforting to know that Jehovah helps us in many ways with problems that tend to weigh us down</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are invited to throw our burdens and anxieties upon him, with the assurance that he cares for us (Ps 55:22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remain confident in the power of prayer to help us make right decisions and stay faithful</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“CARRY ON PRAYER”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make it a daily habit to turn to Jehovah in prayer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This includes “every form” (confession of our sins, petition for forgiveness, request for guidance, thanksgiving for blessings, praises from the heart) and “on every occasion” (publicly, privately, personally, spontaneously) (Eph 6:18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In doing so, we gain “intimacy with Jehovah” (Ps 25:14; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g90 5/8 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do not forget to pray in behalf of others, for God’s Word stresses the power of intercessory prayer (Jas 5:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brothers, take the lead in regular family prayer, which will help keep God first in the family</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">May we never allow our prayers to deteriorate into mere routine or formality</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our relationship with Jehovah should be safeguarded and nurtured, for without good communication, even close acquaintances can gradually become strangers</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Allow the precious privilege of prayer to help you fulfill your assigned duties and maintain your joy while doing so</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When your physical strength runs out and your mental powers are exhausted, then especially lean on Jehovah for help, direction, wisdom, and strength</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be careful not to get caught in a whirlwind of activity and lose your appreciation for communing with God</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be determined to “persevere in prayer,” for by doing so, you will never allow the spiritual bridge of true friendship with Jehovah God to collapse</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">TO BE COVERED IN 45 MINUTES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Outline is similar to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">E: L-1</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">T: S-13</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Note to the speaker: This outline should serve as a general guide for your discussion. Do not feel that you must cover every point or scripture in the outline.

<p><span class="font1">WHAT IS GODLY FEAR?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">People everywhere long for freedom from fear—fear of violence, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear of unemployment, and fear of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">serious illness; why, then, are we discussing how to cultivate fear?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fear, like other strong emotions, can be a positive force</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It has its place in the life of a Christian</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God’s servants are repeatedly urged to fear Jehovah ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w07 3/1 25-26 pars. 2-3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Jehovah your God you should fear, and him you should serve” (De 6:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man” (Ec 12:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Fear God and give him glory” (Re 14:6, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Elders wisely cultivate godly fear and encourage the flock to do the same [Read Job 28:28]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What is godly fear?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fear of God is a profound respect and honor for the Creator, a wholesome dread of displeasing him</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This fear of incurring his displeasure is a result of cultivating appreciation for his loving-kindness and goodness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Realization that God is the Supreme Judge and the Almighty, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who has the power to destroy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">those who disobey him, also helps us to cultivate godly fear ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it-1 818)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WHY GODLY FEAR IS ESSENTIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear helps us to have a balanced relationship with our Creator</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rather than fostering a sentimental view of Jehovah’s forgiveness, we are protected by godly fear, which helps us resist developing an unwholesome attitude</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear gives us the courage to say no to temptation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Moses said no to opportunities to indulge in “the temporary enjoyment of sin” in Egypt (Heb 11:24-26)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Samuel refused to abuse his authority by accepting bribes (1Sa 12:3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus himself firmly said no to all &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrongdoing—right down to the last moments of his life when</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">soldiers offered him “wine drugged with myrrh” (Mr 15:23; Mt 4:1-10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Apostles boldly answered no when ordered to stop preaching (Ac 5:27-29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Questions for meditation:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do I avoid secret sins, known only to Jehovah and me?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do I work to weed out qualities that Jehovah hates?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Am I conquering fear of man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Small acts of disloyalty indicate moral weakness and should not be excused but should be viewed with serious concern</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In handling teaching parts, brothers encourage the proper fear of Jehovah God as something essential to those who would serve him; this profound fear of Jehovah is “the beginning of wisdom” (Ps 111:10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wisdom is the ability to use knowledge successfully</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A person who fears Jehovah will use knowledge in a right way</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear will act as a guide and move him to act wisely, helping him to make proper decisions in life ( g70 6/22 27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wholesome fear is defined at Proverbs 8:13 [Read]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A Bible lexicon describes “the hating of bad” as “an emotional attitude toward persons and things which are opposed, detested, despised and with which one wishes to have no contact or relationship” ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w01 12/1 19 par. 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear includes an inner aversion or disgust toward all that is bad in Jehovah’s eyes (Ps 97:10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It impels us to ‘turn away’ from bad, just as we would back away from the edge of a cliff when our instinctive fear sounds the alarm (Pr 16:6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah himself feels disgust toward badness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Idols are often described in the Scriptures as “dungy” (De 29:17; Eze 6:9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our natural aversion to dung, or excrement, helps us to understand God’s feeling of disgust toward anything that displeases him ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w01 12/1 20, ftn)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A person motivated by godly fear does not stop at simply knowing what Jehovah says is good and bad</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such a person loves what Jehovah loves and hates what Jehovah hates</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a result, he acts in harmony with God’s standards</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such godly fear becomes a powerful motivating force to help a person achieve what he may not be able to do in his own strength</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear strengthens a person to avoid doing something he would regret for the rest of his life</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear fortifies us against a broad range of wrongdoing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">GODLY FEAR—SOMETHING TO BE LEARNED</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An appealing invitation to learn the fear of Jehovah is extended to us in Psalm 34, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a psalm of David</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">David foreshadowed Jesus Christ (A prophecy that the apostle John specifically applied to Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is recorded in verse 20 of this psalm) (Joh 19:36)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In our day, Jesus is the one who extends an invitation like that found at Psalm 34:11: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Come, you</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sons, listen to me; the fear of Jehovah is what I shall teach you”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This clearly shows that godly fear is something that can be learned ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w95 3/15 12 par. 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear does not come automatically</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus teaches us to fear Jehovah by helping us understand the personality of our heavenly Father;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus’ own example reveals how God thinks and how He deals with others</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus Christ knows the importance of godly fear [Read Hebrews 5:7]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Isaiah 11:2, 3 foretold: “Upon him [Jesus Christ] the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, . . . and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Encourage others to learn to find enjoyment in the fear of Jehovah, just as Jesus does</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus enjoys seeing others fear Jehovah; fear of Jehovah is nothing unpleasant—it is positive, constructive, and healthy (Ps 19:9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As we gradually grow in divine wisdom and knowledge, we come to “understand the fear of Jehovah” because we see the good results it produces in our life and we treasure our relationship with Jehovah (Pr 2:5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah encourages us to fear him because he knows that this quality will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protect us (De 5:29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">DEVELOP A HEART THAT FEARS JEHOVAH</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What does Psalm 86:11 teach us about godly fear? [Read]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The psalmist is not asking simply for an intellectual grasp of fear of God; he mentions his heart</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cultivating godly fear involves the figurative heart, which requires special attention because it is the inner person as manifest in all our activities of life and includes our thoughts, our attitudes, our desires, our motivations, our goals ( w12 4/15 13-17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A person’s heart may be divided and can be treacherous (Ps 12:2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It may motivate us to share in wholesome activities—going to congregation meetings and out in the field ministry—but may also love aspects of the world’s way of life</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This may hold us back from being truly whole-souled</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How has Jehovah implanted godly fear in our hearts? (Jer 32:40)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the operation of his spirit and through his inspired Word</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By what he has done in the past, by his dealings with his servants now in fulfillment of his prophetic Word, and by prophecies of things to come, Jehovah provides a sound basis for all of us to develop godly fear ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w95 1/15 26 par. 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brothers: Be alert to use Bible accounts to help congregation develop a proper fear of God and trust in organizational direction</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As in Joshua’s day, courage and strong reliance on Jehovah are required to follow theocratic order; we need such to cover our territory repeatedly with the Kingdom message (Jos 6:3-5; w86 12/15 19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Psalm 66:5 states: “Come, you people, and see the activities of God. His dealing with the sons of men is fear-inspiring”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Properly viewed, these acts of God implant in our hearts fear of Jehovah, a profound reverence</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">BENEFITS OF CULTIVATING GODLY FEAR</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When we acknowledge Jehovah’s wonderful works, we think deeply about and pay rapt attention to what he has done for us</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This produces in us a wholesome fear, one that is powerfully motivating, one that has a profound effect on our personality and the way we use our life (Ps 139:1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w93 10/1 15 par. 18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Love for Jehovah will move us to want to do the things that are pleasing to him, to show our appreciation for the countless expressions of his love and undeserved kindness</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As you continue to demonstrate godly fear, you set a powerful example for the congregations you serve</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Take to heart Malachi 3:16 [Read]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be determined to think on Jehovah’s name and serve him with godly fear; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A wholesome fear of the Creator works to our benefit</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You preserve a clean conscience</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You find contentment and satisfaction in doing what is right</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Godly fear moves us to live today so that we will not be ashamed of tomorrow</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">May we take to heart the conclusion reached by wise King Solomon: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Fear the true God [have</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">profound reverence, respect, and honor for Jehovah, a wholesome dread of displeasing him] and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man” (Ec 12:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">TO BE COVERED IN 30 MINUTES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Outline is similar to:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">E: L-2</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">T: S-10</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Note to the speaker: This outline should serve as a general guide for your discussion. Do not feel that you must cover every point or scripture in the outline. You may decide how much of this material you are able to develop and adapt it to the class within the allotted time</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">BE SELECTIVE IN YOUR CHOICE OF READING AND RESEARCH MATERIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wise King Solomon made it clear that we should be selective in our reading and why [Read Ecclesiastes 12:10-12]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“To the making of many books there is no end” ( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g05 5/22 20-21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Make the reading of the 66 books of the Bible and the research on those books from our Christian publications your main reading</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of all books, only God’s Word will show us the way in which we should walk (Isa 30:21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When you prepare for your talks or your Bible studies, always rely on God’s Word as your authority ( be 255 par. 3; 256 par. 5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the past eight weeks, you have spent many hours each day in research and study of the sentences that “have been given from one shepherd”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah, the “one shepherd,” put these sentences together</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our response to this instruction reveals what comes first to us</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That is because “the word of God is alive” (Heb 4:12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HOW “THE WORDS OF THE WISE ONES ARE LIKE OXGOADS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Oxgoads prod and direct the ox</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When we have serious questions or problems to consider, such as when you brothers are dealing with judicial matters or problems of unity in your congregation or on your body of elders, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">words of wise ones steer you toward the right conclusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Do not lean on your own judgment or past experience (Ps 37:3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we find that we are getting tired or losing our zeal for or interest in the work, we may need oxgoads to motivate us</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brother Knorr would tell traveling brothers at Kingdom Ministry School that when they started to look forward to Sunday night rather than Tuesday afternoon, they were in trouble</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is the same for us as Christian couples</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we begin to look forward to downtime rather than to caring for our assignments, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we are in trouble (1Pe 5:2, &nbsp;&nbsp;3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You may one day find that you or your mate do not have the same enthusiasm for the ministry that you had in the past, that the interest in the territory is not there, or that a lack of joy in the preaching work has caused you to lose zeal for the ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let the oxgoads, “the words of the wise ones,” prod you into greater activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Just like nails driven in are those indulging in collections of sentences”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Any object made of wood, such as a table or chair, can get unsteady after time and with use</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nails driven in can be used to stabilize an object</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When we find ourselves getting unsteady spiritually, a little wobbly, we can stabilize our spirituality by the use of “collections of sentences”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wise ones indulge, or find unrestrained delight, in considering “collections of sentences” that reflect the wisdom of Jehovah (Ps 37:4; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w12 3/15 9, box)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You took great pleasure in, or indulged in, the Word of God during the past eight weeks</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You will soon be in your preaching assignment; if you want to find the same joy and pleasure that you have experienced during the past two months, continue to do what you did here; indulge yourself in the collections of sentences given from the one Shepherd</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The key to your stability and effectiveness is applying what you hear</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Continue to . . . be readjusted” by God’s Word (2Co 13:9, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Oral Review</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">1. How does a conductor thoroughly prepare for the Watchtower Study, and why is this vital? [M-3; Rom. 12:7, 8; Eph. 3:17-19; ks10 2:24-25]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The Watchtower is the principal means by which the faithful and discreet slave dispenses spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A conductor who does the following will enable the congregation to receive the most benefit from the lesson:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">■ Concentrates on the theme and main points, and highlights the practical value of the lesson rather than focusing on details. Since much research has been done in producing the lesson, he avoids bringing into the discussion extensive outside theocratic or secular material from personal research.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Highlights artwork and teaching boxes in the lesson.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Focuses on the Bible. Encourages the audience to comment on the scriptures in the lesson. Has the designated scriptures read and commented on. However, the paragraphs should be read uninterrupted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Considers the review questions with the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Keeps concluding remarks under one and a half minutes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ Limits the study to no more than 60 minutes, excluding the songs and closing prayer.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2. Why should the conductor’s introduction to the study be brief? What should it accomplish, and how can this be done effectively? [M-3; ks10 2:25]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">A brief introduction will enable the congregation to receive the most benefit from the lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The well-prepared opening remarks should be from one to one and a half minutes. The conductor highlights the theme and theme scripture, and tries to stimulate interest in the lesson. He may do this by calling attention to the subheadings, by mentioning the review questions, or by raising two or three rhetorical questions answered by the lesson. He demonstrates warmth and enthusiasm.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3. Why should the conductor not introduce additional research material? [M-3; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ks10 2:25]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Since much research has been done in producing the lesson, the conductor should avoid bringing into the discussion extensive outside theocratic or secular material from personal research.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">4. Why and how should the conductor draw attention to the pictures or illustrations that may be in the article? [M-3; be249 par. 4]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Study material in The Watchtower usually includes visual aids in the form of artwork that can be used by the conductor to emphasize important points. This is also true of publications used at the Congregation Bible Study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">5. What can be done if the comments given do not answer the printed question or if an answer is incorrect? [M-3; w03 9/1 22 par. 4]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The one conducting should avoid embarrassing the person who gave the answer. Comments, even when incorrect, often contain elements of truth. By tactfully picking up on something that may be correct, by rephrasing the question, or by asking an additional one, the one conducting can set matters straight without undue awkwardness.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">6. Who rightly partake of the Memorial emblems? [M-5; Rom. 8:16, 17; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w04 3/15 5 par. 4-6 par. 5]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Spiritual Israel</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">7. Describe the emblems used. Explain the expressions “this means my body” and “this means</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">my blood.” [M-5; w08 4/1 27 par. 6-28 par. 2; &nbsp;&nbsp;w04 3/15 5 pars. 2-3; w03 2/15 15 pars. 13-18;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">w85 2/15 19 box]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jesus used the red wine and unleavened bread as symbols. The unleavened bread meant, or represented, his sinless body that would be sacrificed. The red wine signified his blood that would be poured out “in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">8. What can be done if one of the anointed cannot attend the Memorial because of illness? [M-5; w93 2/1 31]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Elders of the local congregation will arrange for one of them to take some of the bread and wine to the sick one, to discuss appropriate Bible texts on the subject, and to serve the emblems.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">9. Will the Memorial always be observed? [M-5; 1 Cor. 11:26; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w04 3/15 7 par. 1]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">No. The observance of the Memorial will continue until Jesus’ arrival to receive his anointed followers into heaven by a resurrection to spirit life during his “presence.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The Christian congregation was formed at Pentecost 33 C.E. The new covenant went into operation, and the Law covenant was abolished. The nation of Israel rejected God’s Son; Israel was now rejected by God himself. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The stars are grouped into galaxies and move in relation to one another, even though the characteristics of the individual stars differ. The planets move with precision timing, in assigned orbits. The electrons found in every atom of every element also have orbits. And the structure of all matter follows mathematical patterns that are so consistent that it was possible for scientists to predict the existence of certain elements before they actually discovered them. All of this gives evidence of extraordinary organization. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">7. By what visible means is Christ’s headship represented in the local congregations? [O-3; Acts 20:17, 18, 28; Heb. 13:7, 17; 1 Pet. 5:2, 3; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it-1 499 par. 2] [1]</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">Satan slandered God’s sovereignty, as well as God’s servants as to their integrity to that sovereignty. He said, in effect, that no man could be put on earth who would maintain integrity to Jehovah’s sovereignty if he, Satan, was allowed to put him to the test. The integrity of all of God’s servants in heaven and on earth was called into question. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<p><span class="font1">par. 3] [2]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No. The question is not one of might, of raw strength; it is primarily a moral issue. God’s allowance of time permitted all creatures with free will the opportunity to demonstrate where they personally stand on these vital matters. (Substance is sufficient.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">If on investigation it becomes evident to the shepherds of the flock that the brother has indeed committed a serious sin against you and yet has been unwilling to repent and try to make reasonable and appropriate amends, it may become necessary for the overseers to expel the unrepentant wrongdoer.

They may be assigned to handle microphones, to operate sound equipment, to look after the platform, or perhaps to help the elders in other ways. There is much work to be done in maintaining the Kingdom Hall and keeping it clean, so spiritually progressive youths are often called on to assist in caring for these responsibilities.

(Acts 4:33, 35, 37; 5:18, 29) By about the year 49 C.E., this governing body had been enlarged to include more than Jesus’ apostles. When the circumcision issue was decided, that body included “the apostles and older men in Jerusalem.” (Acts 15:1, 2) It was their responsibility to consider matters affecting Christians everywhere. They sent out letters and decrees, all of which strengthened the congregations and made it possible for the disciples to remain united in thought and action. The congregations followed the direction of the governing body, and as a result, received Jehovah’s blessing and prospered.—Acts 8:1, 14, 15; 15:22-31; 16:4, 5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">pars. 23-28]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The news “out of the north” that enrages the king of the north must originate with Jehovah. Gog organizes his all-out assault because of the prosperity of the Israel of God, who, along with the great crowd of other sheep, are no longer part of his world.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">2. Does the king of the south cause the king of the north to “come all the way to his end”? [T-30;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Dan. 11:44, 45; dp281-285 pars. 23-28]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The final campaign of the king of the north is not directed against the king of the south. Therefore, the king of the north does not come to his end at the hands of his great rival. At the battle of Armageddon, all earthly kings are to be removed by God’s Kingdom, and this evidently is what happens to the king of the north.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3. At Mark 4:1-9, 14-20, what is the seed? What do the different types of soil represent? Explain. Who is the sower, and why does he not have control over the results of this sowing? Why is faithfulness on the part of the sower not measured by the results of his work? What is the responsibility of those who hear the word? [T-31; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w08 7/15 12-14 pars. 4-12; it-1 1178 pars. 6-7]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The seed is the Kingdom message found in God’s Word. The different types of soil represent people with differing heart conditions. The sower represents God’s fellow workers, those who proclaim the Kingdom good news. Even where a sower may not see a lot of increase as a result of his work, he has not necessarily been less diligent or faithful than others. To a large extent, results depend on the heart condition of the hearer. Whether they resemble fine soil or not is up to them. Indeed, a person’s heart condition can change for good or for bad.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The dragnet represents the Kingdom-preaching work. Millions of symbolic fish from the sea of humanity have been attracted to Jehovah’s congregation in modern times. After the fish are ‘hauled up onto the beach,’ only “the fine ones” are gathered into vessels, which represent Christian congregations. The unsuitable fish, or those who decide not to serve Jehovah, are thrown away. The separating referred to in the illustration of the dragnet occurs during “the conclusion of the system of things.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">5. Referring to Matthew 24:15, 16, explain the first-century and modern-day fulfillments of the following: [T-32]</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">a. “The disgusting thing that causes desolation” [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w99 5/1 14-16 pars. 4,7-13]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The first fulfillment involved the Roman assault on Jerusalem and its temple in 66 C.E. In 1919 “the disgusting thing” appeared. In time, the League of Nations gave way to the United Nations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. “Standing in a holy place” [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w99 5/1 15 par. 6; 16-18 pars. 13-17]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In 66 C.E. the Romans began to undermine the wall of the temple area. What had long been disgusting to the Jews now stood in a holy place. When the scarlet-colored wild beast attacks the religious harlot, “the disgusting thing” will be standing in a menacing way in Christendom’s so-called holy place. So desolation will begin on faithless Christendom, which portrays itself as holy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">c. “Begin fleeing to the mountains” [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w99 5/1 18-20 pars. 18-24]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">By leaving Judea and fleeing to the mountains across the Jordan, the first-century Christians showed that they were no part of the Jewish system, politically or religiously. For us the flight Jesus spoke of will not be in a geographic sense. Christians will have to continue to maintain a clear distinction between themselves and false religious organizations. There may be tests ahead as to how we view material things.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Although sin is sin, and in any case could justly make the guilty person worthy of sin’s wages, death, the Scriptures show that God views mankind’s wrongdoing as varying in degrees of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since sin is an affront to God’s own person, he is not indifferent to it; as its gravity increases, his indignation and wrath are understandably increased. His wrath, however, is not solely due to the involvement of his own person but is likewise stirred by the injury and injustice done to humans and particularly to his faithful servants.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Therefore, the king of the north does not come to his end at the hands of his great rival. At the battle of Armageddon, all earthly kings are to be removed by God’s Kingdom, and this evidently is what happens to the king of the north.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">23. At Mark 4:1-9, 14-20, what is the seed? What do the different types of soil represent? Explain. Who is the sower, and why does he not have control over the results of his sowing? Why is faithfulness on the part of the sower not measured by the results of his work? What is the responsibility of those who hear the word? [T-31; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w08 7/15 12-14 pars. 4-12; it-1 1178 pars. 6-7]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The seed is the Kingdom message found in God’s Word. The different types of soil represent people with differing heart conditions. The sower represents God’s fellow workers, those who proclaim the Kingdom good news. Even where a sower may not see a lot of increase as a result of his work, he has not necessarily been less diligent or faithful than others. To a large extent, results depend on the heart condition of the hearer. Whether the hearer resembles fine soil or not is up to him. Indeed, a person’s heart condition can change for good or for bad.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">24. What is represented by the dragnet, and whom has this dragnet attracted? What is represented by the separating of the fine fish from the unsuitable ones, and when does this separating take place? [T-31; Matt. 13:47-50; w08 7/15 20-21 pars. 15-19]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The dragnet represents the Kingdom-preaching work. Millions of symbolic fish from the sea of humanity have been attracted to Jehovah’s congregation in modern times. After the fish are ‘hauled up onto the beach,’ only “the fine ones” are gathered into vessels, which represent Christian congregations. The unsuitable fish, or those who decide not to serve Jehovah, are thrown away. The separating referred to in the illustration of the dragnet occurs during “the conclusion of the system of things.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">25. Referring to Matthew 24:15, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16, explain the first-century and modern-day fulfillments of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">following: [T-32]</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">a. “the disgusting thing that causes desolation” [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w99 5/1 14-16 pars. 4,7-13]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The first fulfillment involved the Roman assault on Jerusalem and its temple in 66 C.E. In 1919 “the disgusting thing” appeared. In time, the League of Nations gave way to the United Nations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">b. “standing in a holy place” [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w99 5/1 15 par. 6; 16-18 pars. 13-17]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">In 66 C.E. the Romans began to undermine the wall of the temple area. What had long been disgusting to the Jews now stood in a place that they still considered holy. When the scarlet-colored wild beast attacks the religious harlot, “the disgusting thing” will be standing in a menacing way in Christendom’s so-called holy place. So desolation will begin on faithless Christendom, which portrays itself as holy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">c. “begin fleeing to the mountains” [ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w99 5/1 18-20 pars. 18-24]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">By leaving Judea and fleeing to the mountains across the Jordan, the first-century Christians showed that they were no part of the Jewish system, politically or religiously. For us the flight Jesus spoke of will not be in a geographic sense. Christians will have to continue to maintain a clear distinction between themselves and false religious organizations. There may be tests ahead as to how we view material things.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">26. What is meant by “this generation” at Matthew 24:34? [T-32; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w10 4/15 10-11 pars. 13-14;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">w08 2/15 23-25 pars. 10-15, box]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“This generation” is made up of two groups of anointed ones: (1) those of the anointed who saw the sign in 1914 and concluded from it that the Lord was “near at the doors” (Matt. 24:33) and (2) others who were anointed after 1914 but were contemporaries of the first group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Anointed ones who died before October 1914 or who were anointed after the last of the first group finished its earthly course are not part of “this generation.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">27. Why are all sins not of equal seriousness? [T-34; &nbsp;&nbsp;it-2 968 par. 4]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Although sin is sin, and in any case could justly make the guilty person worthy of sin’s wages, death, the Scriptures show that God views mankind’s wrongdoing as varying in degrees of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since sin is an affront to God’s own person, he is not indifferent to it; as its gravity increases, his indignation and wrath are understandably increased. His wrath, however, is not solely due to the involvement of his own person but is likewise stirred by the injury and injustice done to humans and particularly to his faithful servants.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">28. What is immortality? [T-35; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it-1 1189 par. 7]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">The basic meaning of immortality is “deathlessness,” and refers to the quality of life that is enjoyed, its endlessness and indestructibility.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">29. What is incorruption? [T-35; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it-1 1189 par. 7]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Incorruption refers to that which cannot decay or be corrupted, that which is imperishable.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">30. What is the “better resurrection”? In what sense is it better? [T-36; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heb. 11:35; w05 5/1 17</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">par. 20; it-2 785 par. 6]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If we die faithful before Jehovah brings an end to this wicked system, we have the sure hope of “a better resurrection,” better in the sense that it is one with everlasting life in view.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">31. What is meant by “the twelve tribes of Israel” at Matthew 19:28? [T-37; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w08 1/15 30 par. 1]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">“The twelve tribes of Israel,” whom those on the heavenly thrones judge, evidently represent the world of mankind.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">32. How can we follow Paul’s example to keep “stretching forward”? [T-38; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phil. 3:13-16; be 77</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">Congregations or individuals should not use logos or names of the organization’s legal entities, or variations thereof, on their Kingdom Halls, signs, letterhead, personal objects, and so forth. Such use of the organization’s logos may cause confusion for public officials, publishers, and others about the legal affiliation of the congregation with the organization’s legal entities. Similarly, written correspondence could be misinterpreted as being approved or sent from the world headquarters or the branch office.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">3. What is the purpose of the Public Meeting? [TP-12; Luke 8:18; Acts 18:4; 19:9, 10; 1 Thess. 5:21; od 62 par. 3-63 par. 2]</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">4. How can newcomers be made to feel welcome? [TP-12; km 2/94 1 par. 3]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Arrive at the hall as early as possible to greet your brothers and sisters as well as any interested ones. (Heb. 10:24) If a newcomer is attending for the first time, he may not know what to expect. Explain that our meetings begin with song and prayer, and tell him how the meeting will be conducted. If appropriate, invite him to sit with you so that you can share your Bible and songbook with him. Invite him to discuss with you any questions he may have once the meeting has been concluded.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">5. What type of illustrations are effective? What type should not be used? How may experiences be used, but what should be avoided? [TP-12; be 240-243; km 9/02 8 pars. 1-4]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Similes, metaphors, hyperbole, examples, experiences. When illustrations are chosen carefully, much of their meaning is self-evident. Avoid those that would unnecessarily embarrass anyone in your audience or that would draw attention to a controversial subject that is not at issue. Use only experiences that have been verified. Whatever illustration or example you use, it ought to accomplish some definite objective.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">6. In what ways is the word “congregation” used in the Bible? What is the basic meaning? [TP-13; it-1 496 pars. 2-3]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">A group of people gathered together for a particular purpose or activity. The Hebrew word usually rendered “congregation” in the New World Translation is qa^hal ,which is from a root meaning “call together; congregate.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Christian Greek Scriptures, the Greek word rendered “congregation” is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ek^kle^si a, from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">which the English word “ecclesia” is derived. Ek^kle^si acomes from two Greek words, ek, meaning “out” and kade o, meaning “call.” Hence, it pertains to a group of people called out or called together, either officially or unofficially.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">7. When may foreign-language instruction for publishers be warranted, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and how is this arranged?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Who makes this determination? [TP-13; km 11/09 5 par. 9]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When you are assisting those who speak another language, it is best to encourage them to begin attending a congregation in their own language if it is reasonably possible for them to do so. However, when that is not possible, some publishers may decide to learn the other language and thus be able to give better assistance to the interested ones. If there is no nearby congregation, the branch office may determine that because of the sizable immigrant or indigenous community, a language class is warranted. Should this be the case, the branch office may inform nearby congregations of the existing need and arrange for an announcement concerning a language class. Those applying to attend the language course should have the goal of switching over to the group or congregation to assist with developing that language field.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">8. Describe the duties of those serving as attendants at circuit assemblies and special</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">Their responsibilities include greeting newcomers and making them feel welcome, helping latecomers to find seats, recording attendance figures, and giving necessary attention to proper heating and ventilation of the hall. Maintaining order during the meetings is essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All adults should be counted. And how old should children be in order to be counted? A definite age has not been set. Rather, if the attendant believes that a child is benefiting and learning from the meeting, even to a limited extent, he should be counted. So, while young children may not pay the very best attention all through the meeting, if they nonetheless benefit and learn something, they should be counted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At assemblies, if people are able to hear the program and are benefiting to some extent from it, they should be counted, even though not seated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">9. Whose responsibility is it to arrange for a circuit business meeting, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what will this meeting</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">include? [TP-14; od 130-131; S-330 1:14]</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The assembly overseer will preside at these meetings. When meeting together in connection with an assembly, the circuit elders decide what should be done with the funds that the circuit has at its disposal. Decisions need to be made regarding the assembly operating expenses, the purchase of circuit equipment, and the expenses incurred by the traveling overseers while serving the circuit. Consideration may be given to making donations to the worldwide work, the Kingdom Hall Fund, a local Assembly Hall, or some other important need.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">12. How can you contribute to the purpose of conventions and the joy they bring? [TP-16; Deut. 31:12; od 74-75]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">By attending large conventions, we receive spiritual refreshment and are strengthened to do Jehovah’s will. Many people have learned about the good news because of the publicity given to these large gatherings of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s Witnesses consider district conventions to be of particular importance in promoting spiritual growth and in reviewing progress in fulfilling the Christian commission to preach the good news.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">13. Why does the effectiveness of the program depend greatly on the quality of those assigned as speakers? Explain. What qualifications in addition to speaking and teaching ability must they meet? [TP-17; Phil. 3:15-17; 1 Tim. 3:13; 4:12; Titus 1:9]</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Philippians 3:15-17: “Let us, then, as many of us as are mature, be of this mental attitude; and if you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God will reveal the above attitude to you. At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine. Unitedly become imitators of me, brothers, and keep your eye on those who are walking in a way that accords with the example you have in us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1 Timothy 3:13: “For the men who minister in a fine manner are acquiring for themselves a fine standing and great freeness of speech in the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Titus 1:9: “[An overseer must be] holding firmly to the faithful word as respects his art of teaching, that he may be able both to exhort by the teaching that is healthful and to reprove those who contradict.”</span></p>
