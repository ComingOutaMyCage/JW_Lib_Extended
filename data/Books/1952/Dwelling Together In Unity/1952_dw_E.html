<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>DWELLING TOGETHER IN UNITY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">C</span><span class="font1">OMING into one of the Society’s homes, whether it be a Bethel home, a missionary home, a branch office or Gilead, will mean a change for you in your life—a big change. But we at Bethel want to make that change as easy as possible for you. Friendship showing love, or dwelling together at unity with our brothers and sisters, is the aim of every one of us living here in these abodes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now, how can this best be done? Let’s start at the beginning. When you came into the truth, you did begin to make your mind over. You started to fill your mind with new ideas. You got these new ideas from reading God’s Word, the Bible, and you enjoyed them. These new truths thrilled you. Now you knew the right thing to do. You accommodated yourself to new ways of living. You quit being fashioned after this old system of things and you found out that, by making your mind over, a pleasant, happy, new way of living was yours. You heard and believed the truth and it was wonderful. Now your desire is to live in the new world. You are working to that end, so you are going to keep on taking in knowledge of Jehovah and his Son, because you know this means everlasting life.—Rom. 12:1, 2; John 17:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So coming to Bethel will be a new experience too, a new way of living and a pleasant one. But we will admit right from the start that it isn’t like living at home with father and mother, but still it is the best place on earth to be living right now. In many places throughout the world our Bethel homes are big, our families large, larger in numbers than your natural family, but we are still one family and we dwell together at unity. In some places the Bethel families are small and it is easy for us all to get acquainted with one another. But the point is this: We want you to feel at home when you come to Bethel. We want you to succeed. Always remember that your brothers were living here before you came and they have been getting along together and have done so for many years. Bethel homes have been in operation a long time and the occupants have content-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ment with their godliness. (1 Tim. 6:6-8) Yes, we have gotten into certain routines and habits, but they are good habits because they are based on the Lord’s Word and we get lots of work done. We like it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now you are a newcomer and certainly you don’t expect every one of us here to change our ways of living and rearrange them to accommodate each newcomer in the home. You’re like a baby here. You’re new in our family and we all love you and we want to get acquainted with you. We expect you want to get acquainted and accustomed to us, too. We want you to like Bethel as we do. So let’s get acquainted right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bethel in Brooklyn is a large home and hundreds of people live here. In big places like this most of us when we see you think you are one of the many visitors that come in every day. We think you have some friend who is looking after you; so, not wanting to intrude into somebody’s business, we go right ahead with our busy routine of life. That is our mistake. We didn’t know that you were a new arrival. So won’t you please introduce yourself to us as you meet us at different places in the home? We are scattered all around in the home and factory and office and radio station here in the Brooklyn Bethel. In other Bethel homes the family is not quite as scattered, because it is smaller. But, believe us, we want to know you. Sometimes, though, we are so busy with our routine at the home, factory or office, or with the field service and Bible studies that we find ourselves with barely enough time to say hello. So stop us and say, “Hello, I am the new arrival”; and we will learn your name, tell you ours and get acquainted. Please won’t you get acquainted with us right from the start and help us to meet you? You are a part of our Bethel family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now for a little bit about us. We are quite a family. We live at Bethel and in missionary homes. We work in an office, do housework, print magazines and books, cook very good meals and study our Bibles. Some of us work on farms, all of us go to school. And with all of this, we are full-time ministers. We have a lot of preaching to do. We like our </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study. We go to our service meetings and enjoy them, and we want you to get the full benefit of these meetings with us. We want you to enjoy your place in this big organization. We want you to do your part, and we want to help you do it When you know us as a busy, active family, you are going to be happy in our Bethel home. So be sure to get acquainted right from the start, the first day and the first week; let us know you are here. Thanks a lot!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah has blessed his organization, as you well know. It certainly has grown rapidly in the last few years. Many new Bethel homes have been set up at the various branch locations and new missionary homes have been established in various parts of the world. We feel sure that Jehovah is pleased with the praises we are bringing to him and we take great joy in carrying on true worship. Everyone who works in a Bethel home, a branch office or a missionary home shows his keen interest in the world-wide witness work. He made a big forward step. He has a unique privilege of service above that of many other publishers because he is in service full time and can serve all his fellow workers in the country where he serves, helping supply them with the things they need. We need you; that is why you were called. You will learn a lot and the more years you spend at Bethel the better servant you will be. Did we hear you say, “Here am I; send me&quot;?—Isa. 6:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So you are important. No, not that we are high-minded, feeling superior to someone else, but just important in the organization as a working part of it. In the same way as the eye is important to the body, and as the ear would not say to the hand, “I have no need of you.” We need you and that is why we called you to Bethel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s witnesses have land, buildings, furnishings, machinery, household equipment, linen, food—oh, just everything that goes to make up part of the equipment that is committed into our care. We who have made expression of wanting to live in the Bethel home or in a missionary home and who have been called to such a place certainly feel a responsibility and we feel that the Lord has directed our steps. So in these various dwelling places we want to use the property and equipment in the best way to praise Jehovah. We all look after it and hold it in trust for Jehovah and his theocratic organization. Let’s call these trusts some of our Kingdom interests.—Matt. 25:21-23, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As you know, the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society is a Pennsylvania corporation, while the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., is a New York State corporation. The International Bible Students Association is a British corporation, and we have throughout the world a number of other corporations that are used by Jehovah’s witnesses. The president of the abovenamed three corporations has general supervision and control over all the business interests of the Society and is very much interested in the welfare of all those in Bethel and missionary homes. He wants to see the work move along well in all of the branch offices and missionary homes and on the farms and all other places that come under the direct supervision of the president’s office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So that all of us may dwell together in unity in these homes, it is necessary to set out some instructions that will help us all to get along better together. (Prov. 15:22, 23; 19:2) All of us know that everyone who becomes a member of one of these many families has dedicated himself to the Lord, and, according to his application, has told us that he has symbolized his dedication by water immersion. (Ps. 40:8; Heb. 10:7; Matt. 3:13, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> From what you have told us we know that you are in full accord with the Society’s teachings and that you accept the Bible as the word of God. (John 8:32; 17:17; 18:37, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> We know, too, that the truth is advancing more and more as we approach the perfect day; so it is necessary for us to keep on studying. An understanding of God’s Word and of his principles of truth and righteousness is more to be desired than fine gold.—Ps. 19:7-11, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reason we have come to the Bethel home or taken our assignment in a missionary home is that we love Jehovah God above everything else. Loving him with all our heart, mind, soul and strength would certainly mean that we can love our brothers. In fact, that is what Jesus said: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Mark 12:29-31, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> If we keep these two commandments, loving God first and our neighbors as we do ourselves, we certainly won’t have any difficulty getting along with our brothers and sisters in the home where we are living. In fact, if we would carry out all the principles of truth and righteousness that God sets forth in his Word, we would not need this little booklet of counsel which sets out some helpful advice as to how we can get along together in unity. But we make mistakes, and so that we shall all understand one another and what we may expect from one another, the Society publishes this little instrument. If we really love our neighbor as we do ourselves—and certainly we do love ourselves, because we are always looking after ourselves—we shall get on just fine with everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So now that you are a member of the family, let’s see what you can expect of us as the organization moves along and, at the same time, what we may expect of you in order to make our life happy and contented here in our daily service to Jehovah.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>ORGANIZATION</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">First of all, we should appreciate that Jehovah God is theocratic. We recognize him as supreme and we have full faith that he is directing his organization through his Son Christ Jesus. We should realize that organization instructions come from the head down and not from the bottom up. We who are young and new in these homes certainly want to find our right place in the organization and be contented. We should have confidence in the Lord’s organization that Jehovah places the members in the body or organization as it pleases him. As ministers we should be delighted to do whatever is required. Some of us act in the capacity of branch servants, as teachers, as missionaries or special servants, and in numerous other assignments, but every one of us is a publisher of Jehovah’s kingdom. —1 Cor. 12:18, 28, 29, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font1"> Ex. 18:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our brothers who are in charge of various departments of work have had experience in those departments and can help you and teach you much if you are willing to learn. After you have mastered the work the way you have been taught and can do it excellently, then it will be time enough if you have suggestions for improvement to talk to those in charge about such improvements as you think will help all concerned. It is good to first follow the training given. You learn quicker that way. (Matt. 13:12, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> We believe that everyone in the Bethel home is working to advance the interests of the Kingdom. We will keep on believing that unless someone proves otherwise. ‘By their fruits you will know them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We feel confident that the Lord will keep his organization clean and will take out all those who offend or cause iniquity or who assume the attitude of a boss that is trying to lord it over the brothers. It is good to extend mercy and to be patient with such persons for a while. Maybe they will change their course of action when given some reproof and counsel. But if they do not have God’s spirit they just can’t last. All in the Lord’s organization must be diligent workers. Those who are placed in positions of responsibility should be the best examples to all their fellow workers in word and in deed.—1 Pet. 5:1-3, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The president of the Society appoints all servants and has the privilege and responsibility of making any changes in appointment that he sees fit. The president of the Society appoints the Bethel servant who looks after the interests of the Bethel home, the office servant in charge of the office management, the factory servant who looks after general production and the shipping of factory production, the farm servant who looks after the farm and home in connection therewith, and the branch servant who is in charge of the work in general in the various countries. In some instances these servants may hold more than one position. For example, the branch servant may be the office servant as well. Other appointments of service over divisions of work are usually made by the branch servant, but he should make recommendations to the president before any selections are made of servants to look after certain divisions of work. Thus if it becomes necessary to appoint someone to look after the pressroom as an assistant to the branch servant, or if someone is to be put in charge of the kitchen and will have jurisdiction over other persons, or if someone is to be appointed to look after the service desk with considerable responsibility in connection with the handling of company matters, or if someone is to be appointed to do the translating of the Society’s publications into another language, such appointments should always be brought to the attention of the president for final approval. Maybe the president has someone else in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every member of the Bethel family or missionary home, no matter where he is located in the Lord’s organization, should feel perfectly free to register any complaints if he is mistreated by another individual. These complaints may be registered with the branch servant in charge or directly to the president, but I would like to say now that whenever possible such differences should be settled privately between the brothers involved. It will save you a lot of heartaches and bring you great happiness if you can gain your brother without calling in others. (Matt. 5:21-24; Luke 17:3,4, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> If you have difficulties with your brother it is always best to go to him first before you bring someone else in. Don’t gossip about your trouble. Handle it yourself or, if you must, go to an older brother if you can’t straighten it out. Don’t carry bitterness in your heart. (Eph. 4:31, 32, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> If you can’t settle the difficulties between yourselves, then always follow the advice of Matthew 18:15-17, NW. If you can’t settle it after you have taken this course of action, then, of course, you can write to the president about your difficulties, but you ought to supply the other brother in your complaint with a copy of your letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember that we want to dwell together in unity. If we follow the Lord’s Word, we will; but we forget to do this sometimes and so have trials and difficulties. Things will occur in the Bethel home just as they do anywhere else in the Lord’s organization, because we are born in sin and shaped in iniquity. But if we keep on making our minds over and follow the Lord’s admonition, there should be less trouble. Let us always be contented and happy, living together as a family.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>ASSIGNED DUTY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">It is left to the discretion of the servants appointed by the president to assign the members of the family in the various homes and factories to work. We don’t ask individuals to pick their jobs, but we feel that the proper spirit to have is that of Isaiah: “Here am I; send me.” We feel, too, that if you are asked to do a job, the one asking you believes you can do it. Even though you feel you do not have the natural ability, try to do it with all your heart and ask the Lord’s blessing on your efforts; maybe you can. Have in mind, too, you may be moved from place to place, but don’t think we are displeased. Maybe we haven’t found the right kind of work for you to do, so we keep trying. Of course, if you are lazy and indifferent toward your privileges you will probably be told, but you<sup>-</sup>will be told for your own good. Jehovah is not pleased with a sluggard. We should be happy to work hard and to serve the Lord wherever we are. Remember, being in the Lord’s organization and having any work at all in that organization is an honor.—Judg. 7:21.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>ALLOWANCES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Every member of the Bethel family receives a small allowance monthly. It makes no difference if he is the president or some other individual. The president of the Society determines what the allowances will be for all those working in the branches. He also determines what allowance should be given missionaries working in the missionary homes.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>CONDUCT</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">A Christian should have good morals. Jehovah is displeased with immoral persons and such will not inherit the kingdom of God. There are a few things here I would like to say in this connection. I am sure you know them, but this will serve to refresh your memory. Jehovah has no pleasure in a thief, an evildoer, or a busybody in other men’s matters. (1 Pet. 4:15) No one needs to use filthy language to express ideas. The vocabulary available in all languages is sufficient to get our ideas across without nasty, filthy words. If one has had the bad habit of using filthy language before coming into the truth, it is high time for him to get it out of his mind by making his mind over. A person can be emphatic if necessary without using bad language.—Jas. 3:10,11; 1 Tim. 6:3-5, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Proper respect for both sexes must always be maintained. Politeness and kindness are always appreciated. (1 Corinthians 7; Rom. 1:21-32, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> Men are given places of responsibility, and those placed in such positions should be respected. The women should always keep their proper place and recognize Jehovah’s arrangement as to their position in the Lord’s organization. (Gen. 3:16; 1 Cor. 11:3; 1 Tim. 2:11-13, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> Filthy habits, like smoking and uncleanliness, will not be tolerated. All should keep clean and care for their health. (Rev. 22:11; 2 Cor. 7:1, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> Drunkenness is condemned of the Lord and will not be allowed. (Prov. 23:21; 1 Cor. 6:10, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> It is expected of all who become members of a Bethel family that any filthy habits that they might have engaged in or any unscriptural practices will cease. The Lord’s organization must remain clean, and those who do not want to practice good conduct but who want to live in the way of the old world will be dismissed from the family.—2 Tim. 3:1-7, NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wine and liquors may be used in moderation by the members of the family if any so desire. However, you must follow the Scriptural admonition set forth in 1 Timothy 5:23, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span><span class="font1"> When such beverages are brought into the home they may be used only in individuals’ own rooms.—1 Pet. 4:3, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font1"> Prov. 25:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those who have dedicated themselves to the Lord should never give anyone cause to point the Anger of reproach at the Lord’s organization. Never act improperly in public or in private. What you do that is observed by others will cause them to believe that the rest of the family act the same way. While this would not be true, still an organization is judged by those that represent it. So let your actions be based on the principles of truth and righteousness. Love your neighbor as you do yourself. If you do this, very likely you will conduct yourself properly toward your brother.—Gal. 5:19-26; Eph. 5:15-18; 1 Pet. 4:2-4, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>CLEANLINESS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">A clean person and a clean room will bring you happiness and contentment. It will improve your health. There is no reason for anyone to be dirty. Ample provisions are made for taking baths and keeping one’s body clean. Not only keep yourself clean, but clean up after yourself, rinse out the wash basin after you use it. Keep things tidy in your room; remember, your roommate lives there too. Keep your desk, working tables and machinery clean. You will be able to use them better and the machinery will run better.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>CONFIDENCE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Remember that you are a member of a family and you are expected to keep confidence with the organization. Things that are said to the family by the one in charge of the home are for the family only. No one should communicate with brothers outside the Bethel home concerning any publications that may be manufactured or send out reports that may be made at the Bethel table that are confidential to the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The information the Society desires to communicate to the brothers outside the Bethel home will be given them through </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake!</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Informant </span><span class="font1">or by letters mailed by the Society. Letter writing, of course, is not forbidden. Encouraging words and helpful suggestions can be given to missionaries and publishers on the outside. Gossip in letters should be avoided. Do not become an information channel for those outside the family. Do not be a gossip within the family.—Prov. 17:4; 26:20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Remember, your mother and father, especially when in the truth, are very much interested in you. There is a natural bond of love. They would like to hear from you once in a while. There are many things that you can write them about—your experiences in the field service, your service meetings and personal activities outside of regular routine work in the organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The individual work assigned to you as a member of the family is a confidential matter. What you are given to do is your business, not someone else’s. There is no need for you to communicate information in your department to another department. It is a waste of time. If we wanted you to do the other person’s work we would have put you at that desk. Married couples serving in different departments need not discuss their work when at home. If you have problems, take them up with the branch servant. The same is true concerning roommates. Confidential matters received in the mail should be handled confidentially. Information to be announced generally will be presented by the one in charge of the home. If you are to know what is going on in other departments, you will be told through the proper authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We should all be so busy at our own work that we shall not have time to bother with another person’s work. If we find that we haven’t enough to do, then we should report to the servant in charge. When you waste your time talking unnecessarily to other people, it is also a waste of their time.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>ACCIDENTS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">A capable, sympathetic brother should be assigned to first aid. First-aid equipment should be available to all who may get hurt or bruised. If they need someone to help them with their wounds, then the one assigned should be told immediately. If a major accident occurs, the one in charge of first aid should get in touch immediately with the family doctor or the hospital and report the matter at once to the servant in charge of the branch or home. A full and accurate report on the accident should be typewritten for future reference. If there was any carelessness on the part of the individual or on the part of the management in not guarding moving parts of machinery, these things should be corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Keep in mind .that there is always danger near moving machinery. Therefore care should always be taken by those operating machines when working or cleaning around them. It would be better to stop the machine if some adjustment needs to be made. Do not use rags to clean machinery except when it is stopped and the power is off. Machine parts can be purchased, but we can’t buy fingers and hands; so please be careful and do not take chances.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>CARE OF THE FAMILY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Brothers brought into the family are believed to be strong and healthy and, according to their applications, there is nothing seriously wrong with them. The Society wall try to keep its members healthy and clean. We do so by providing them with clean rooms, comfortable sleeping quarters, good food and good conditions under which to live and carry on their daily routine. If an individual gets sick and it is believed necessary to call a doctor, do not hesitate. If the branch office can make arrangements with dentists or optometrists or other specialists to get reduced rates for the care of the teeth and eyes of the family, it should be done. All expenses for dental work, eyeglasses, or any other special treatment needed by any member of the family will be borne by the one being treated. If the branch servant for the home can arrange for free special treatments for members of the family, then the members of the family can be called from their work at various intervals for checkups or treatments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those who get sick should be given proper treatment and they may not be visited by members of the family except on the advice and with the consent of the doctor in charge. It is a good thing for members of the family who are not feeling well to report it to the servant in charge. Maybe some advice can be given to the individual that will help him get over a cold or other difficulty. Whenever possible a sick person should be isolated so that no one else will get the same ailment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If one of the brothers in the home is a barber, arrangements can be made for him to cut the hair of the other brothers. A schedule should be drawn up and the brothers called according to the schedule to have their hair cut.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>ECONOMY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Remember that the money the Society spends is not furnished by you. It was donated by brothers who want to see Kingdom interests advanced. We should not waste food, electricity, water, supplies or equipment. All of us should be careful and economical. When you are given machinery to operate or tools to use, you should take good care of them. Be sure to oil and clean your machines according to the schedule established by the branch servant or the one in charge. Waste in the Lord’s organization should be at a minimum. There should be much less waste in the Lord’s organization than in the Devil’s organization.—Prov. 18:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All lost equipment should be reported immediately. Anyone destroying equipment deliberately will be required to pay for it. Lights should not be left burning when not needed. Be sure to turn water spigots completely off. There are many ways in which you can help avoid needless expenses by just being careful. Things needing repairs should be reported in writing. The Society’s buildings should be kept in good condition inside and out. After you report in writing the need of repairs, the responsibility is no longer yours. It becomes the responsibility of the branch servant if you have made the report to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Society’s buildings where there are elevators, those who need to climb only two flights of stairs to get to their rooms should not use the elevators. But where it is necessary to walk up three or more flights to get to your room, it is permissible to use the elevator if you wish. Of course, those who are infirm may use the elevators at any time.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">No large expenditures or purchases of any machinery or of property or anything out of the routine needs should be made without the approval of the president of the Society. Before anything may be purchased a requisition must be written out and approved by the servant appointed by the president or by the president himself. The requisition should go to the purchasing clerk, who will make out a purchase order. This order will go to the seller, and a copy should be attached to the requisition so that it can be checked with the receipt of goods and the bill of sale before payment is made. Any person who buys something in the name of the Society without an approved requisition will have to pay the bill himself. No one may obligate the Society to an expenditure unless he has written approval from the one in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All property in the buildings of the Society belongs to the Society. No books, magazines or any publications may be removed from the bins, skids, or presses and taken out of the building except by the permission of the servant in charge. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, Awake! Informant,</span><span class="font1"> letters and other information for individuals in the family will be delivered to their rooms at the proper time. No one should operate another person’s machine or change the adjustments. No one may borrow tools or move them from one department to another without asking for permission. Because tools or other equipment are not locked up is no reason to walk away with them. If tools are needed, they must be obtained from the servant in charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No furniture or equipment may be brought into any of the Society’s homes or alterations made in your room without permission. Private property like clothing may be brought into a home without permission. Radios and lounging chairs may be purchased by members of the family, but before doing so be sure you have permission to bring them into the home. Junky pieces of furniture will not be allowed in the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the close of every day’s work, desks, cases and work benches should be cleared of all papers and tools, which should be put in their proper places. Everything should be left in a tidy condition at the close of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Overalls and shop apparel are to be placed in the dressing room in the place assigned to you. The dressing rooms and washrooms should be kept clean and the toilets sanitary. Brothers and sisters should put on neat, clean clothes when coming to meals or when traveling the streets to and from work. You should not appear sloppy or indifferent toward proper dress, nor should you be conspicuous by wearing overalls or dirty work shirts in the dining room or on the streets. When coming to meals you should have on the customary dress of the country, not old work clothes. Washing up before mealtimes is essential and is expected of all.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>FIELD SERVICE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Each one of us as a member of the Bethel family wants to take part in the field service, witnessing from house to house, making back-calls and conducting Bible studies. (Matt. 24:14, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW;</span><span class="font1"> Isa. 61:1,2) Field service is a big part of our lives. We have dedicated ourselves to God to be his ministers; so in order to share to the full the privilege of being his ministers, we study his Word and we witness from door to door. The company servant of the company with which you work may find it necessary from time to time to invite you in the field work if you are not regular in the service, due to your own neglect. The aid he offers you is for your own spiritual welfare. One way to keep happy in the Bethel home is to keep busy in the field. You need that personal association with the other publishers and with people of good will to keep alive spiritually.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every Saturday afternoon and Sunday the regular routine of work stops so that you will have the time to engage in the field service. On the first and fourth Saturday of each witnessing period the Bethel home closes down so that everyone will have the opportunity to get out in the field during that period. Some, of course, will have to be assigned to provide meals. The arrangement for meals on Saturdays when the home is closed will be the same as on Sunday. A watchman is assigned to take care of any calls and to look after the house in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Field service should at no time interfere with your regular assigned service in the Bethel home, office or factory. Remember you were called to Bethel to do a special work. You should make your Bethel service first in your life, as your work at Bethel is necessary to help others stay in the service. However, you will have time to engage in preaching the gospel and you should make good use of that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It may be advisable in some places that members of the branch staff be appointed as servants in the local company, but even if they are servants it does not mean that they can neglect their Bethel work. Being a servant in the company is an added privilege and should be considered as such.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>HEATING</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Radiators should be turned completely off when rooms are not occupied. If you are in the room and it gets too warm, turn the radiator off. Never have the windows open and the radiator on at the same time. When living or working in a room with someone else, if the room becomes too warm or too cool it would be well to consult the other person first before changing the temperature. It may be you are underclad and could put on a sweater or jacket which would make the temperature just right for both of you. If it becomes too warm, the first thing to do is to turn off the heat. After this has been done, if the room still remains too warm, then you can open a window. For comfort in working a temperature of between 68 and 72 degrees seems to be the best. In some countries it does not get that cool, so one just becomes accustomed to the higher temperature.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>HOURS OF WORK</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">The reason we came to Bethel was to work, wasn’t it? We can get the most work done if we all work together and at the same time. The hours of work are from 8 a.m. until 12 noon and from 1 p.m. until 5:45. A bell will be sounded at 8 a.m. and at 1 p.m., and all should be at their work by that time. Another bell will be sounded at 11:55 a.m. and at 5:40 p.m. These bells notify the brothers to close down their machines and get ready for meals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some countries may find it advisable to adjust these hours to accommodate their local conditions. In such cases they will write to the president for a change. However, the hours of work in all countries will be eight hours and thirty-five minutes. These hours apply from Monday through Friday, and a half day on Saturday morning. It would be wrong to waste your time during these hours. You should not engage in personal errands or go out for refreshments or carry on visiting. (Prov. 13:4; 26:16) If it becomes necessary for you to leave the home for any reason, obtain permission from the servant in charge. While you may be assigned to give public talks on some week ends or to prepare, material for service meetings, these are added privileges of service to do in the evening. Likewise we request you not to carry on personal correspondence or read newspapers or literature for personal study during the working hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the general routine of work brothers are required to work hours other than those mentioned before, and in such cases a schedule should be made by the servant so that the brothers will be putting in eight hours and thirty-five minutes during a day. Of course, if a brother wishes to work longer hours than required at his assigned work, he may do so as long as it does not impair his health and if it is in the best interests of the work. It should be understood, though, that working extra hours at his regular work does not allow him to be away at any time during the regular working period unless special permission has been obtained. To be absent from the Bethel home during regular working hours you must have permission. No one is ever given blanket permission to come and go as he pleases. Set a good example for the newcomers by being at work on time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All other hours of the day outside the scheduled ones are yours to use as you see fit, to the honor and glory of the Lord. Sometimes we may request you to put in extra time in the office or factory because of the press of work, but we hope this will not be too often. Your evenings should be used for study, attending meetings, or for field service or relaxation as you find it necessary.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>KEYS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">One key to the main entrance of the Bethel home will be provided each member of the Bethel family. No one is ever allowed to make duplicate keys. If your key is lost, report it to the servant in charge. Another key will be given you, but if that key also is lost, the servant can use his discretion as to whether you should have a third key without waiting a year or not. Keys may not be loaned from one member of the family to another. Your key is your private property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Everyone coming in or out of the home should see to it that the door is closed and locked unless it is during working hours when the door is normally unlocked. If it is the custom for the door always to be locked, then every individual in the home should be careful to see that the door is kept locked. Keys for any building other than the living quarters will be given only to such persons as need them; for example, the watchman or the person who usually opens the building and closes it at night. Records will be kept of all brothers having keys and of the number of the keys.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">When you become a member of the family, of course, you want to become fully acquainted with the general routine of the home. That is why you were given a copy of this booklet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dwelling Together in Unity.</span><span class="font1"> I hope that you carefully read all of these suggested principles for living together. As long as you are a member of this family you may keep this copy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dwelling Together in Unity.</span><span class="font1"> If for some reason you find it necessary to leave the family, please turn this booklet in to the servant in charge. We feel sure that you will agree with all the suggestions set out here, because they are based on the Scriptures and, by following them, you will show your love for the organization and for your brothers. You, like the rest of us, would want unruly and obstreperous persons dismissed from the home. (Prov. 12:7; 16:28-30) Why have discord when the rest of us want to keep happy and enjoy the Bethel home? So it is best to send such ones away and let them live as they wish. We will live as Jehovah wants us to and we will show our gratitude for his undeserved kindness in arranging for us to be here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The servant in charge assigns each member to the room we want him to live in, and we sincerely hope that you will get well acquainted with your roommate and try to get along with him. Remember, we all have different personalities, but since we are in the truth they are not so different that we can’t get along well together. Your room is your private home. Take care of it. Make it as comfortable as you want to. If you want to get additional furniture or hang up some pictures or calendars or put up drapes at the windows, always first get permission from the servant. If what you have in mind is within reason, I am sure you will get permission to do the things to your room that will please you. However, you should consult your roommate about moving in any additional pieces of furniture. Always give consideration to the other person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No one should go into another’s room without an invitation. Knock on the door, and if you are asked to come in, then enter; but if you receive no response, then you have no permission to enter the room. If you go to another person’s room and you find him studying or doing some such work it is good to inquire as to how busy he is. Maybe he wants to keep working so as to finish whatever he is doing. Or, when you have visitors, if your roommate is studying or getting things ready for a service meeting or for a week-end public talk, take these things into consideration. You may find it advisable to go to the other person’s room to carry on your conversation. The servant in charge may visit the rooms at any time that necessity requires it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your becoming a member of the Bethel family is a blessed privilege. You should consider that the Lord arranged for you to be here, that it was he who called you. Having this in mind, would it not be well, then, to let the call for you to leave come from the same source? One should not withdraw himself from the home or from the service that has been granted him unless it is manifestly the will of the Lord. Before leaving Bethel it would be well to talk to a mature brother about your problem. Leaving the Bethel home is not a sin, and there are some good reasons for going away, but be sure these reasons are sufficiently strong. Never forget your first love for the Bethel home, and keep that love strong by engaging regularly in the field service, attending the studies and keeping busy in your work. Learn to love your new home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If you find it necessary to leave, we would appreciate your giving the servant in charge a 30-day notice so that arrangements can be made to have someone else come to take your place when you leave.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>MARRIAGE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">When individuals are called to Bethel it must be decided whether to select a single person or a married couple, a brother or a sister. Branch servants make their recommendations to the president and get his approval before calling persons to Bethel. Due to the fact that the work in the Bethel home requires healthy, strong persons, usually young single persons are brought in for Bethel service. As a general rule the greater portion of the work can be best taken care of by brothers; of course, some kinds of work require sisters. As individuals remain at Bethel over a period of years they naturally become more efficient, and the longer they are at Bethel the greater their love for it becomes. Bethel becomes our home and we love it. As time goes on, however, the problem of marriage may arise. It is a difficult thing for one who loves Bethel to decide whether he should give up his many privileges of service at Bethel for marriage, but in many instances a member of the family decides it is better for him to marry. Paul told Timothy: “Some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances . . . forbidding to marry.” (1 Tim. 4:1-5, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font1"> We at Bethel know that marriage should be honorable among all and that he that marries does well, but he that does not marry does better.—Heb. 13:4; 1 Cor. 7:38, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So if any member of the Bethel family wishes to marry someone outside the family, we wish him the Lord’s blessing; but we just can’t bring all wives into Bethel. His leaving, then, will present a problem as to continuing in full-time service. It may be, though, that some other privilege of full-time service can be his, like pioneering or maybe circuit servant work if he has the qualifications and if his wife could join him in that work and carry on pioneer activity as a circuit servant’s wife does. Maybe Gilead could be his goal after some years of pioneering with his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, when you come to Bethel we want you to stay and make it your home for life, if you can. But I know some problems may arise in the lives of some that will cause them to leave; I can hope not too many. If their reasons are sufficiently strong in their own minds to cause them to leave Bethel, well and good; but I sincerely hope and pray that those who do leave will try to stay in the full-time service. A person at Bethel receives good training here over a period of years and this will equip him for full-time service if he is a diligent worker. So if he makes the request and we can use him in some other field upon leaving Bethel, it will be considered. Of course, he must meet the qualifications of having kept up with the family study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and the theocratic ministry school, kept active in the field service and kept doing his work right in the Bethel family. These are the things that will show those in positions of responsibility that he does have these certain qualifications that would help others in the right way. He should show a spirit and mental disposition that is right with God’s spirit at all times. He will find that the longer he is at Bethel, enjoying all of its privileges, the more he will be making his mind over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But no matter where you are, whether in Bethel, in the pioneer work, serving as a circuit servant, in a missionary home or as a company publisher, I want to see you maintain your integrity and prove the Devil a liar. Just think of the joy you can bring Jehovah! He said: “My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.” (Prov. 27:11) So we expect you to stay with the Lord’s organization because you love life, and you want to share in the vindication of Jehovah’s name. Moreover, we hope it will be here at Bethel, the branch office or missionary home where you will accomplish that, now that you have come and are now one of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One might ask: “Now how would it be if a brother in the family wishes to marry a sister in the family at some future time?” Well, if both of them have been members of the family for ten years or more, then they could obtain permission from the president of the Society to remain as members of the family if that is their wish. They would both continue in Bethel service where assigned. If any brother and sister request an exception to the above rule, the president has the right to decide whether they may stay or not, even though they don’t meet the ten-year qualification. Those meeting the ten-year qualification will have the privilege of remaining if they request to stay at Bethel. So if in the interests of the work the president of the Society wishes to make an exception to the above rule on behalf of individuals who want to get married and who have not been in the home for ten years or more, he has that privilege and responsibility. But if both individuals have been in the home for ten years or more, undoubtedly they will get permission to remain if that is their wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the case of missionaries not married who finish school and are sent out in foreign service and who have served for two years as single missionaries, if they believe after that time it is better for them to get married and select another missionary as a partner they may write to the president of the Society, requesting that they be assigned as a married couple in some missionary home. It seems that a single missionary going forth from Gilead knows two years in advance what he or she wants to do and such a one should serve at least that long single in the interests of the Kingdom and in view of the training received. If missionaries who marry prefer to engage in the special pioneer work in the country where they reside for a period of time, that can be arranged. I am very desirous that those who have been trained for missionary service stay in their missionary assignments in order to get the work done that they have been trained to do, and so these provisions are made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, if other obligations arise after marriage or difficulties develop which will not allow for dwelling together in unity, then the president of the Society may have to advise on the course of action to take.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>STUDIES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">As far as we are concerned, we know that a Christian must keep on taking in spiritual food. This is true with regard to our family just as much as it is for any other family in the truth. As a family we have our own weekly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study. Every member of the family should set aside this evening for study with the family. Nothing should ever interfere with it. Feeding on the things the Lord provides on his table is essential to gain life; don’t neglect this study. This study of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> is exclusively for the family and no outsiders are invited to attend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> study is followed by the course in theocratic ministry. All brothers who are members of the family should be enrolled and all should take part in this meeting too. Once in a while brothers come to Bethel and think it isn’t too important to attend; but we hope you realize that everything in the Lord’s organization is important and necessary. So come to both meetings; make comments; don’t be bashful. Feel at home. You will probably find it is a little difficult to get up in front of the Bethel family to give your first talks. But all of us went through that ordeal and lived; it will do you good. You may feel that everyone is so experienced and has been here so many years that you should not even try. That is the wrong idea. We want you to be experienced, too. Every baby grows up as time passes, and we want you to grow up and be a mature brother in our family. So you need this training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These meetings will equip you for field service and will aid you greatly in preparing talks that you may be giving sometime as a representative of the Society. Then there are the service meetings, which none of us should miss, and we have the area Bible studies and company </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> studies, as well as the theocratic ministry course under the supervision of the local company. It certainly does not hurt to attend these also. The more knowledge you take in in your youth, the happier you will be when you become of more mature years. I can tell you from experience that what you learn when you are young you will be very grateful for later on. I know right study will work to your advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">You should arrange for some time during the week to study privately. You should read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> as soon as you can after you get them in your room. Read the new publications and keep abreast of the things the Society knows to be important for the blessing of all of Jehovah’s witnesses. Usually all Bethel homes have a study room or library, and this is provided for the use of the family. There is no need to have your own concordances and old files of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower </span><span class="font1">in your room unless you want to, because these should be kept by the Bethel home in a place convenient for all the brothers. Also a good dictionary should be on hand in every Bethel home and available to the members of the family so that they can always improve their language and their use of words in giving talks. The branch office should mark on the front of all its library books that they are the property of the branch. Someone should be appointed to look after the library so that it will always be in tidy condition.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>TELEPHONES</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">The telephone is an instrument that can be overused. We would appreciate it if you would not use the office telephones for personal matters. If you happen to be a company servant or if someone just wants to call you during working hours, you will be called to the telephone, but please make your conversation brief. If you can arrange for your personal calls to be made at other hours it will be better and time will be saved. The telephones in the office and factory are strictly for Society business, and if you make personal calls through them please get permission first. You will have to pay to the Society the cost of the call. If you make any long-distance calls, you will have to ascertain the charge so that it can be paid in to the Society. Strangers are not permitted to use the telephones except by permission of the one in charge. Please make your regular business conversations brief, too, and get to the point of the matter when using the telephone so that the wires will not be tied up and keep other calls from coming through.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>VISITORS IN THE HOME</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Someone is appointed by the brother in charge to show visitors around the home. If you want to take someone through, you may get permission to do so; but if the one in charge believes it is best to have a regular guide take you and your party through, it is for him to decide. You can’t just take people around the premises of the Society anytime you want to. Please obtain permission every time. The servant in charge is the one to decide what should be shown to visitors and he will arrange a regular route to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before anyone can be invited for a meal or invited to stay overnight, permission must be obtained from the Bethel servant. Arrangements should be made in advance. Visitors who are calling for just a short time will remain in the visiting room or lobby of the Bethel home until the one they are visiting is called and meets them there. All persons invited for dinner must be registered and the guests will be given a place to sit in the dining room with their friends in the Bethel family. Always keep in mind that we are limited in the number of guests we can have for meals, because of space, cooking arrangements, purchasing of food, etc. You should not invite visitors to meals on week ends when meals are served cafeteria style. There can be exceptions to this, but permission must be obtained. This is due to the fact that the regular cooks are not on duty and in many cases not as many cooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It will be permissible for members of the family who invite guests in to see them to take them to their rooms and to entertain them after meals or during the evening. All such guests must register in and out of the home. Of course, on such occasions nothing should occur in the rooms that would disturb other members of the family in the home. But we want you to feel this is your home and your room is your home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Special arrangements can be made with the Bethel servant for you to have members of your own family in the truth to stay overnight in the Bethel home. In some homes there may not be any available space, and then, of course, we could not invite guests to stay overnight. But if there are some available vacant rooms and you have permission you may have your mother or father, sister or brother visit you on a week end or during the week. When guests stay in the home they may have their meals with the family. In this way, members of the Bethel family can spend considerable time with their folks who are in the truth. Arrangements cannot be made to accommodate guests for more than two nights in the Bethel home even though space is available for a longer period, as it would work a burden on others of the family in cleaning the rooms, preparing meals, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to missionary homes, when parents or relatives travel great distances to see their children who are living in one of these homes they can obtain special permission from the president of the Society to stay over a longer period of time. Under such circumstances the visiting persons would have to take a share in the work and share a part of the expense, at least to cover the food costs. However, if there are no vacant rooms, other members of the family should not be made uncomfortable to accommodate guests. The circumstances would control. If there is no room, then, of course, no invitations would be given for visitors to stay overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pioneers in good standing who are passing through a city where there is a branch office may make arrangements with the servant in charge to have a few meals there and to stay overnight if room permits. If any pioneer overdoes this, then permission would not be granted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We want you to make Bethel your home, and we want you to feel free to invite your friends in the truth to Bethel as your guests from time to time if you so desire. It certainly should not be a weekly arrangement. We feel sure that none of the members of the family will overdo this and misuse the privilege, but if some do, then the servant in charge has the right to decide whether or not restrictions should be put on that person as to the number of persons such ones may bring in as guests.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>WATCHMAN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">In many parts of the earth we have very large buildings for the Bethel homes and factories and in such places there should be a night watchman. A checkup should be made in all parts of the building every two hours. He should check to see that the windows and doors are securely closed and that no water is running in the toilets and sinks. The watchman can be given other work to do in the office, something that will not disturb the sleeping members of the family. In smaller homes, like regular dwellings where there are only five to ten persons or so who sleep there, there is no need to have a night watchman. We leave this to the discretion of the servant in charge. If there is no watchman in charge of the home, then, of course, everyone is responsible to see that windows and doors are closed and locked when going in and out. In the evening before retiring the home servant or someone appointed should see to it that the main entrances are securely locked. Where night watchmen are assigned, a schedule should be made out for week ends so that the watchman will be relieved by other members of the family. This assignment for week ends will take in all the members of the family, with different ones being assigned at different times. Sisters may be put on duty during the daytime and evenings, but for night watchmen always use brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where there are many visitors or businessmen who come to the home, as at the headquarters of the Society, we have someone appointed to answer the door and care for the main lobby. This one should receive sufficient work to keep him busy in addition to caring for those calling.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>OTHER SUGGESTIONS</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">All of us in the Bethel home fully appreciate that there must be an orderly arrangement and that someone must be in charge to answer questions and to make suggestions from time to time that will benefit all members of the family. When there is a branch organization, then the branch servant is in charge. Other persons may be appointed to assist the branch servant, such as the office servant, factory servant, Bethel servant and home servant. When these brothers who have positions of responsibility request you to do something or make suggestions about things that need to be done in the home, we should heed their suggestions and follow their counsel. I am sure these brothers who have been appointed and put in responsible positions are interested only in the welfare of the family and in the promotion of the Kingdom interests; and if we can all work together with them we shall have a happy family and all of us will dwell together in unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From time to time it may become necessary for the servant in charge to give some good advice to you. Perhaps you do not fully appreciate that you are disturbing other persons by your actions; and if such an occasion arises so that it is necessary for you to receive counsel, then accept it in the spirit in which it is given. It is to help you get along better with your brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sometimes you will have problems. Coming into the Bethel home isn’t going to remove all the problems from your life; it may even bring on more. But as these problems arise it is well for you to talk about the difficulty to mature brothers who have been in the family for many years. Maybe they can help you with it. Or, you can go to the branch servant or Bethel servant and maybe he can help you. Those who are at the Bethel home in Brooklyn or at Gilead school or one of the farms the Society operates in the United States may always feel free to come to the president with their problems, and when the president visits branches or missionary homes the members of these families should feel the same way too. Those in branch and missionary homes may always feel free to write about their problems if they feel it necessary to bring them to my attention. I am not asking you to write me letters—I have plenty of mail; but if you feel I can help I am certainly willing to try.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All of us want to be contented and happy, and we want you to stay at Bethel; so don’t let some little, antagonizing problem disturb your equilibrium and make you think, “Well, now, I have to go.” I don’t think your problem is that great. Let’s work it out together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are a lot of little details you are going to get acquainted with in Bethel life: where to put your laundry, where to keep your clothes, how to take care of your bed on week ends, where to dispose of fruit peelings or garbage in the home, and other things. It may even be necessary to tell you how to open and shut a door, because sometimes persons like to bang the doors and it isn’t very considerate when other persons are sleeping. But these are all little things that can be worked out between you and the servant, and from time to time it may be necessary for the servant to announce certain regulations to keep the house activity running smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For example, about lights: We like to go to bed at a reasonable hour, and it seems that at 10:30 p.m. lights should be out. However, if your roommate is not at home and you want to read a little later, you may. But remember that you need your sleep too, and we want you to be at breakfast in the morning for the discussion of the daily text. It is good to get at least eight hours sleep a night. You will appreciate as time goes on that coming to breakfast is important to Bethel life. Sometimes we may find it very hard to get up, but it is a good habit to start. For fifteen minutes on all working days we discuss the daily text in the morning before breakfast. Questions are asked and brothers are called on to comment. Others may volunteer comments after that This arrangement is very helpful to our spiritual life. It is more important than the breakfast we are going to eat just after. So be down to breakfast; read the comment in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yearbook</span><span class="font1"> beforehand and prepare a question and a comment. We like to hear you express yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Probably you came from a small company where you had to do the talking. Now you get into a large family where you will want to give others the chance to talk, too; but just because there are so many of us don’t be afraid to speak up. Remember we want to know you and you want to know us. After our morning discussion is over we always have a prayer expressing our gratitude to the Lord for his blessings and guidance on the organization. Then we go ahead with our meal. All our meals are closed with prayer, too. We are grateful for Jehovah’s provisions and give thanks to the Lord for all things. Whether we are eating or drinking, we do all things as to the Lord.—1 Cor. 10:31, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In different homes the times for meals may vary. At Brooklyn Bethel we have breakfast at 7 a.m., dinner at 12:15 p.m., and our evening meal is at 6 p.m. On week ends when we have all day Saturday off and on Sunday we have a cafeteria arrangement. Breakfast is served between 7 and 8 a.m. Then we have extra supplies of food so that you can make some sandwiches to take to your room or out in the field service with you. This will tide you over to the evening meal. Then from 4 to 6 p.m. on these days when we have no regular noon meal we have a cafeteria arrangement. You can come at any time from four to six and you will find food to satisfy your hunger. On the Saturdays when we work in the morning we have breakfast at 7 a.m. and dinner at 12:15 p.m., as usual, and then a cafeteria supper from 5 to 6:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sometimes you may not feel like eating something that is served at the table at the time it is served; but if you want to, you may take fruit or a sandwich or something else to your room if you feel you would like to eat it the same day, maybe in the evening before you go to bed. It is perfectly all right to take something with you when you leave the table. Just put it on a plate in your room. Do not put any food in a dresser drawer or in a closet, and be sure the food you take is used the same day. It is not good to have food in the room otherwise, because sometimes the bugs think more of it than you do and start eating it. It is hard to keep the living quarters clean and free from vermin if you have food around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am sure all of us will keep in mind that we do want our house to be neat and clean and tidy and that we will co-operate with the servant in charge and with the housekeepers to keep it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Good table manners are always nice and make the rest of us comfortable. We have no objection to your talking at the table to those nearby, keeping your voice on a low level so that other persons who want to talk can carry on a conversation too. However, when the one at the head of the table speaks, asking for a question, or giving information, then all should cease talking and listen to the chairman or others who may speak for the benefit of the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It isn’t necessary to list a whole lot of do’s and don’t’s for brothers who love their neighbors as they do themselves. Take this example; I am sure you will appreciate it: You don’t want to disturb other persons with your radio any more than you would want them to disturb you. Of course, if you have a radio in your room, you will run it just for your own benefit, not for all the neighbors; so it is good to tune it low, just loud enough for you and those in the room with you to enjoy it. Maybe your brother next door is preparing a talk and he cannot do it with music or other entertainment playing on your radio. And so it is with a lot of other little things. Just be considerate. Peace and quiet are always appreciated by brothers living in any home.—Isa. 32:17,18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Now I do want you to always feel free to approach any of the servants in charge. Don’t be afraid of them; they are your brothers. Sometimes you may think: “Oh, they are too busy to talk to me”; but don’t feel that way about it. They are busy, yes, but never too busy to help you out. We are here to help you and you have come here to help us get our work done; so we will show you what we want you to do and we feel sure you will put forth every effort, by the Lord’s undeserved kindness, to do it the way we show you. If you have a problem, you come to us. Let's keep in mind that the servant in charge is responsible before the Lord and to the organization for the things that are done, so co-operate with him. If you have suggestions, we are willing to listen to them; but if after you have made your suggestions we feel our way is better, then do it the way you are told. You will be happier in the long run. It may try your patience, but just think of the patience God has shown with the Devil’s organization in allowing it to exist this long. “Let endurance have its work complete.”—Jas. 1:4, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of course, I hope this doesn’t happen to you, but it usually does in everybody’s life at some time when we make a mistake or get off on the wrong track. We take things into our own hands once in a while and violate the good principles on which the home operates. So it might happen that you will be reproved; but when you are keep in mind the scriptures at Proverbs 27:5,6: &quot;Open rebuke is better than secret love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.” Then again, the scripture points out: “Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head.”—Ps. 141:5.-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We know that reproof and instruction are the ways to life. God is going to reprove us when we do something wrong. But as we go ahead making our minds over, studying the Lord’s Word, living in the family routine and enjoying everything the Lord has provided for us in this home, it will bring us great joy. If we follow the Lord’s instructions we shall be happy, just as it is set forth in Micah 6:8: “He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font1"> require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?&quot; Of course, you are following this instruction, and that is why you are here. That is why the Lord led you to the Bethel home or to a missionary home.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font1">You will show your love to Jehovah by serving in this place. You must have a good feeling knowing that the course of action you are taking is going to lead to life eternal in the new world. “God gave us not a spirit of cowardice, but that of power and of love and of soundness of mind.” (2 Tim. 1:7, NW) It is my hope that every one of you who has come to Bethel or who lives in a missionary home will keep in mind Jehovah’s principles of truth and righteousness and always “trust in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord</span><span class="font1"> with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lord,</span><span class="font1"> and depart from evil”.—Prov. 3:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am very glad you came to this place and so are the servants with whom you are working. Make it your home. Keep on in right living here and be trained for living in the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Be assured of my love for you, and may Jehovah bless you richly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your brother and fellow servant,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">, President</span></p>
