<p><span class="font5">The material in this Kingdom Ministry School Textbook (ks81) has been prepared for use in training and benefiting Christian overseers. In keeping with our objective it retains the title of the previous two textbooks, “Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock.” —Acts 20:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The 1981-1982 Kingdom Ministry School Course for overseers will include a lecture at the beginning of each day. As was true with the two previous courses, the program covers 15 hours of training and instruction. Following is the 1981-1982 schedule.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">TO THE STUDENT: The information that is found in this textbook has been prepared under the direction of the Governing Body. The course provides a basis for Scriptural discussion of material that deals with features of God’s law and its administration, judicial matters and a review of the ministry, with special emphasis on the role of overseers who are expected to take the lead. It is strongly recommended that each overseer carefully read over the assigned portion for each day and be prepared to share in classroom discussions. The instructors will analyze with the class the examples provided for them by the Society and which are called for on specific points. Where it is possible, instructors will see that the textbooks are made available ahead of time. While some of the material in this course is of a serious nature and may seem weighty, do not be unduly anxious or apprehensive. Remember, we are all interested in helping one another, to the end that we may ‘hold firmly to the faithful word’ and show genuine concern for the flock by setting a good example.—Titus 1:9; 1 Pet. 5:2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TO THE INSTRUCTORS: It has been found practical for two instructors to conduct each school for elders. Wherever possible, arrangements should be made for this to be done. Both instructors will be present during each of the class sessions. As a rule, instructors will alternate as classroom chairman, each conducting the classroom sessions as indicated on page 132. They will share in giving the concluding talks for the final half-hour of the special school. When the school is conducted on the weekend, fifteen-minute recesses are suggested during the mid-morning and mid-afternoon sessions of each day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are a few portions in Unit 8(c) that will allow ' for some in the class to appear before the group to explain, discuss or demonstrate certain points that are called for in this unit of instruction. Advance notice of such assignments will be given out by the instructor to some of the students so that they can be properly prepared and have something practical and meaningful to present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The scheduling of the school sessions can be somewhat flexible where this appears necessary. In most cases where a weekend is set aside for the school program, eight hours of instruction will be featured on Saturday and seven hours on Sunday. The Saturday-morning session would run from 8 to 12, and following a one-hour break for the noon meal, the afternoon session will resume at 1 and run until 5:30 p.m. On Sunday the morning session could begin at 8:15 and run to 12 noon. After a one-hour noon break the afternoon session would resume at 1 and conclude at 4:45 p.m. Where the school is conducted during the five evenings of a week, the course could be divided so that there would be about three hours of classroom training and instruction each evening. It will be up to the branch office in each country to schedule school sessions in harmony with what may be the most convenient and best for the brothers according to local circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This Kingdom Ministry School Textbook (&amp;sBl), together with previous issues (/?s77 and hs79), are provided SOLELY for the use of traveling overseers and congregation elders, and are not to be given or loaned out to other persons, including family members. New elders will receive a copy of this latest textbook from the circuit overseer. Elders who are deleted for any reason should turn in their copies of these textbooks to the current chairman of the local body of elders, who will, in turn, pass them on to the circuit overseer.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has an earthly organization to accomplish his work, an organization that appreciates the importance of his name and in every way seeks to honor it. Some have said, all that is necessary is for each Christian to enter a personal relationship with God and then seek to maintain such in faithfulness. Such view is contrary to Biblical historical facts. Jehovah brings together his chosen ones as an organized people, as in the case of natural Israel, directed by an appointed leadership to administer God’s will. (Ex. 19:5, 6) Ancient Israel served as a pattern indicating that the worldwide brotherhood of Jehovah’s Christian witnesses in these last days would also be an organized, God-governed people. (Heb. 10:1) It requires an orderly arrangement to gather the “great crowd” from the four corners of the earth, so that they may declare unitedly: “Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.”—Rev. 7:9, 10; Isa. 11:10.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>WORLDWIDE ASSOCIATION, GOD-GOVERNED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Today Jehovah’s Witnesses are a distinct people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Gathered from all nations, yet unified as one flock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Form an international association of brothers. (1 Pet. 2:17; 5:9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have learned to speak in one language of truth, calling on the name of Jehovah,, recognizing his authority and way of doing things. (Zeph. 3:9, 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christian congregation of anointed ones on earth operate as “God’s household” with a “great crowd” of helpers. (1 Tim. 3:15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Members of a household serve together as an organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Over past 100 years a global association of more than 43,000 congregations has developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Local congregations not under democratic control but God-governed, theocratic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All congregations under one </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">administration</span><span class="font5"> directed by Christ Jesus. (Heb. 3:6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Administration” translates Greek word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">oikonomia </span><span class="font5">(Eph. 1:10), which basically means “household (organizational) management” of affairs. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> October 15, 1974, pages 616, 617.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Congregations receive guidance from Jehovah through Christ Jesus, his appointed Administrator. (Heb. 1:1, 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Jehovah’s Chief Servant, he brings about justice. (Matt. 12:18)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>AS A HOLY PEOPLE, MUST BE GUIDED BY GOD-GIVEN STANDARDS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Those of the household, as well as all those who work closely with it, must be “holy.” (Eph. 2:19; 1 Pet. 1:14-16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Holiness” includes cleanness, purity, separateness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Involves also love of justice and mercy. (Ps. 33:5; Jas. 2:13; 3:17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As Statute-Giver, Jehovah sets righteous standards and delegates authority to enforce them. (Isa. 33:22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His laws are stated in our guidebook, the Bible. (2 Tim. 3:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why must we recognize this form of theocratic governance? (Isa. 2:3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Administration of laws entrusted to His anointed king. (Isa. 32:1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Enthroned since 1914, ruling ‘in midst of enemies.’ (Ps. 110:2; Dan. 7:14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Invisible control exercised from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Uses earthly visible agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evidenced by over two million subjects submitting to Christ’s kingship. (Phil. 2:9-11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such invisible administration requires visible representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Visible anointed remnant entrusted with all Master’s belongings. (Luke 12:42-44) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Steward” class faithful in dispensing “food.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Overseers serve as earthly representatives, under direction of the “steward” class. (Isa. 32:1, 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Theocratic control requires recognition of this orderly arrangement. (Zech. 8:23)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Are we assured guidance until the ‘conclusion of the system of things’? (Matt. 28:20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">GOVERNING IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">REQUIRES OBSERVANCE OF JEHOVAH’S LAWS AND PRINCIPLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Laws</span><span class="font5"> are defined as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">rules</span><span class="font5"> of conduct. Necessary for order. (Gal. 6:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A God of order. (1 Cor. 14:33) God’s laws are perfect. (Ps. 19:7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Laws</span><span class="font5"> are based on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">principles</span><span class="font5"> that are made </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">enforceable </span><span class="font5">by an organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Principles</span><span class="font5"> are settled guidelines for conduct based on fundamental truths. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 1, 1952, page 407; September 1, 1957, page 524.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Example of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">principles</span><span class="font5"> based on fundamental truth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fundamental truth: Jehovah God is the Sovereign Lord of heaven and earth. (Acts 4:24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Principles based on the above fact, truth:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We owe Jehovah full obedience in everything. (Jer. 7:23; 1 Sam. 15:22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where there is a conflict, we must obey God as Ruler rather than men. (Acts 5:29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Observation: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Principles</span><span class="font5"> are eternal, while </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">rules</span><span class="font5"> may apply to limited times or conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Need laws, judicial decisions and instructions from Jehovah through various levels of household (organizational) management. (Gen. 9:1-7)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Human overseers must be careful that their instructions do not violate God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Should imitate Jesus. (John 5:30; 12:49)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Otherwise, lawlessness prevails. (Matt. 24:12)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span><span class="font5"> is the administration of what is right in a fair and impartial way. (Lev. 19:15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah manifests </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice</span><span class="font5"> in all his dealings. (Deut. 32:4; Heb. 2:2-4) ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span><span class="font5"> is illustrated by a plummet line, which must be fully adhered to, without variation. (Amos 7:7, 8; Zech. 4:10)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span><span class="font5"> involves more than deciding right or wrong; it is balanced with mercy where warranted. (Ezek. 33:14-16) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Decisions of elders must reflect </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice.</span><span class="font5"> (Isa. 32:1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mercy</span><span class="font5"> is not only the withholding of punishment when justly due, but also an expression of kind consideration or pity that brings relief to those who are disadvantaged, in need of help, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">{ad</span><span class="font5"> p. 1139)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mercy</span><span class="font5"> needed to temper </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mercy</span><span class="font5"> brings relief when circumstances allow for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mercy</span><span class="font5"> also involves giving needed correction and discipline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mercy</span><span class="font5"> takes into consideration motives, provocation, willingness to confess, temptation, mental and emotional condition, past conduct, present attitude, etc., of the offender. Must guard against automatic or “letter of the law” application; there are some areas not specifically defined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Applying Christian law in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">justice</span><span class="font5"> and with </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">mercy</span><span class="font5"> requires:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. Decisions that are fair, equal to the need.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. Allowance for mercy when circumstances are extenuating.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Enforcing with impartiality laws that carry sanctions. (Deut. 1:16, 17) Punishment applied should fit the violations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. . Getting all the facts before making a decision. (Prov. 18:13)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. Avoiding becoming involved in personal disputes. (Prov. 26:17)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">6. Expelling (by disfellowshipment) those who flout God’s household law and contaminate the congregation. (1 Cor. 5:9, 10; Titus 3:10)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">7. Making clear to disfellowshipped ones that, upon displaying works befitting repentance, turning around, reinstatement can be applied for. (2 Cor. 2:6-8)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Every case is different and must be judged on its own merits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some persons have wrong tendencies and may just need direction as to the right way to go or how they should correct their course. (Mark 6:34)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>FOREGOING EMPHASIZES NEED</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>FOR A RIGHTEOUS JUDICIARY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Elders need to be trained to become righteous judges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How is this accomplished?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Use directions provided by the Society. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom. Ministry School Textbook,</span><span class="font5"> 1977, Unit 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Be sure all decisions are solidly based on the Scriptures. [Example: Elders wisely make a practice of carefully reviewing Units 4 (a) and (b) in the /?s77 and Units 9 (a) and (b) in fe81 and the scriptures cited before handling any judicial matter. They have found that when they rely on their memory of the past review of this material, they overlook important points. They know that the lives of their brothers are precious, so they cannot afford to be careless.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elders serving on a judicial committee should be discerning and trustworthy men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The body of judges need to be consistent, firm, loving. Work interdependently as a body. (1 Cor. 12:21-25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They should listen to fellow members on judicial committee, benefit from one another’s mature thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s spirit can direct any one of the elders to make a valuable contribution to the thinking of the judicial body. (Eccl. 4:9; Prov. 27:17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When questions arise, they should not be hasty in deciding. Do research in the Society’s publications. Then, only if necessary, write the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah and Jesus deal impartially and justly with all. Elders serving as a body of judges should imitate their example. (John 5:30; 8:28; Lev. 19:15)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s people today are not under the control of the body of law known as the Mosaic law of ancient Israel. (Col. 2:13, 14) Paul showed that since there has been a change in the priesthood from Aaron to that of Jesus Christ in the manner of Melchizedek, Christians are under a new legal arrangement of control. (Heb. 5:4-6; 7:12) Some rules of conduct found in the old law of Moses have been restated under the law of the Christ and are enforceable upon Christians. (Acts 15:19-21) Other rules of conduct from the law of Mdses with their underlying principles, though not enforceable in the Christian congregation, are nevertheless useful to Christians as they walk in the way of holiness. (Jas. 2:8,. 9) It is well for elders to consider some of these guidelines that are intended to protect the Christian congregation and keep it clean in Jehovah’s sight.—Eph. 5:25-27.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>LAW OF THE CHRISTIAN CONGREGATION</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Christians are not under the Mosaic law, but under “the law of the Christ.” (Gal. 6:2; 1 Cor. 9:21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consists of a body of rules for Christian conduct. (Gal. 6:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This “law of the Christ” embraces the whole scope of a Christian’s life and work and focuses attention on:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">144</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. Our relationship to Jehovah.-(Matt. 4:10; 22:37; 1 John 5:3)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. Faith in Jesus Christ and submission to him. (Col. 1:18; 1 John 3:23)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Our relationship with fellow Christians. (John 13:34, 35; 1 John 3:16-18)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">4. Our obligations toward unbelievers. (Matt. 24:14; Gal. 6:10; 1 Pet. 2:13, 14)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Law of the Christian system of things involves the heart. (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 10:16) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>GUIDELINES FOR PROPER CHRISTIAN</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE WITH MERCY</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">(1)</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Gambling</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why should Christians avoid gambling in all of its various forms? (See Isaiah 65:11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What view do Christians take of such traits as greediness and covetousness, generally manifested by gamblers? (See Romans 13:9, 10; 1 Corinthians 6:9, 10; Colossians 3:5.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such persons who do not respond to counsel and help could be disfellowshipped from the Christian congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additional bad results from gambling and association with gamblers give true Christians further reasons for avoiding it. (1 Cor. 15:33; w72 pp. 593, 594; w80 9/1 pp. 29, 30) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why must one guard against the view that petty gambling solely for entertainment is harmless? (See Galatians 6:7, 8.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a business concern gives out prizes to customers by drawing out names from their customer list, it may not be wrong to receive such prize, if no money has to be paid for participation. But other factors need to be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The language used in advertising the contest, or the kind of sponsors, may involve elements with which a Christian would not want to be identified, for personal reasons, or for fear of stumbling others. (Rom. 14:21; 1 Cor. 10:31-33; g75 7/8 p. 28)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider example.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(2)</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Activities Illegal According to Caesar’s Law</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">God’s Word counsels all Christians to be law-abiding. (Matt. 22:21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What must one do when human laws conflict with or prohibit what God commands or when they require things that God forbids? (See Acts 4:19, 20; 5:29-32.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why be careful when making purchases from someone engaged in an illegal business, or if such a person seeks to employ your services, or if you personally see opportunities to engage in business or practices prohibited by Caesar’s law? (See Romans 13:1-7; Titus 3:1; 1 Peter 2:13, 14.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How does the above Scriptural counsel protect a Christian and serve as a guide for his conscience?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the elders learn of illegal activity or of some serious crime on the part of a congregation member, the law on ecclesiastical privilege in many countries does not require elders to report the offender or the offense to the secular authorities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In cases involving the breaking of God’s law, elders must give consideration to the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Would one approaching baptism who was guilty of illegal activities </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font5"> coming to a knowledge of the truth be required to settle these things with the authorities prior to baptism? Why not? (See Philemon 15-18.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Neither would a thief be required to make restitution to all from whom he stole </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font5"> baptism, although, </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">in some cases</span>, his conscience may move him to do so. (See Luke 19:8.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The blood of Jesus Christ covers the sins of such new ones. They may get baptized. (Isa. 1:18; 1 Tim. 2:5, 6; 1 John 1:7)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(3)</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Legal Matters Involving Secular Courts</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">While all legal cases between brothers should be brought to the attention of the elders (1 Cor. 6:1-8), there are legal matters over which the congregation does not have authority. These can be taken to secular court for judgment, such as: .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">a. Issuing a divorce decree when Scriptural basis exists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">b. Obtaining insurance compensation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">c. Being listed, among creditors in bankruptcy procedures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">d. Foreclosing liens.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">e. Probating wills.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">However, 1 Corinthians 6:1-8 covers a wide range of domestic and personal disputes that should be settled by the congregation elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here note some examples:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">a. If a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">worldly creditor</span><span class="font5"> sues a brother who is not guilty of wrongdoing, it might be necessary for the brother, for his own protection, to file a countersuit even if it might include other spiritual brothers in the action.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">b. If a dedicated person takes legal action against another dedicated person, it would not be a violation of 1 Corinthians 6:1-8 for the one being sued to defend himself, or to counter-sue. (This is true whether the matter was first taken before the elders or not.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">c. If a person is injured in an automobile owned by a spiritual brother, it might be necessary to sue the brother in order to obtain insurance compensation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">If the brother is not insured, the injured brother may share responsibility for his own injuries. To sue under such circumstances could possibly violate the spirit of what is counseled at 1 Corinthians 6:1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In exceptional cases each individual must make his own decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There may be other ■ circumstances where the congregation would need ho take action. (See w73 11/15 pp. 703, 704; w77 3/1 pp. 146-148.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(4)</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Neutrality</span><span class="font5"> (John 17:16).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s Witnesses are neutral with regard to' the political and military affairs of the nations, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(ms </span><span class="font5">“Neutrality”)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">They do not interfere with what others do as to voting in political elections, running for or campaigning for political offices, joining the military, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since true dedicated Christians are “no part of the world,” if one pursues a course in violation of his Christian neutrality, he disassociates himself from the neutral Christian congregation. (John 15:19; 17:14-16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It would be a kindness for the elders to talk to one who they know is thinking about taking such a course, since his plans may have been made in ignorance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the individual pursues, this course regardless, of the ■ proffered help, he thereby disassociates himself, and his card would be removed from the file of active associates. , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An announcement is usually made that the individual has withdrawn from the congregation, and the person can be told orally about his position. Persons in the congregation that might be visited by the disassociated person can be informed orally, and the individual treated as one disfellowshipped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If a government requests temporary use of Kingdom Halls or equipment, in times of emergency, it would not be a violation of neutrality to comply. In some lands, all individuals are required to build roads or work in the field. Where this is not a form of military service, but is viewed as a tax, there would be no objection, as long as the work itself is not in violation of Bible principles. (Matt. 5:41; 22:21)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(5)</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Self-Defense</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">By following balanced Bible counsel, Christians can usually avoid getting into situations that might involve physical acts of self-defense. (Prov. 15:1; 17:14; 26:17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If assaulted, a Christian could ward off blows, or even escape from the attacker by temporarily incapacitating him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A Christian woman threatened with rape should resist by screaming and physically resisting. (Deut. 22:23-27; 1 Cor. 6:18) Other details are given in w68 6/1 pp. 345-350; g73 4/22 pp. 16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not in harmony with the spirit of John 13:35 or Isaiah 2:4 for a Christian to learn karate, judo or other martial arts. (g75 12/8 pp. 28, 29)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brother would be disqualified as an elder or ministerial servant, if he took up the study of and practiced these violent measures. One publicly advocating such could be handled in line with 2 Thessalonians 3:13-15, or in accord with the judgment of the local elders. (See w81 7/1 pp. 30, 31 on professional boxing where it is shown that if one continues in such course he would be excluded from the congregation.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(6)</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"> Sexual Conduct</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">While the Christian congregation is not in a position to direct individuals as to all sexual matters concerning the marriage bed, individuals can, however, be advised that in their intimate relations, as in all other aspects of Christian life, they need to display kindness, love and concern for each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Each one should have a hatred for all perverted practices, including homosexuality, bestiality, oral sex and the like. (Lev. 18:22, 23; Ps. 97:10; Amos 5:15; Rom. 12:9; Eph. 5:3, 10-12; Col. 3:5, 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Persons should be urged to act in such a way as to leave them with a clean conscience, and the marriage bed undefiled. (Heb. 13:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Summary</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For our protection and spiritual security it is essential to be obedient to “the law of the Christ.” Only in this manner can those who desire to be guided by Jehovah’s word of truth walk unitedly and harmoniously in the path of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This makes it incumbent upon us to lay aside personal or preconceived ideas of what is right and wrong, and wholeheartedly accept Jehovah’s directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this way we are kept separate from the world </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font5"> can prove ourselves loyal to the Sovereign Lord Jehovah and his king Christ Jesus.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Fulfilling and Glorifying Our Ministry (Rom. 11:13)</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Serving as a minister </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(diakonos)</span><span class="font5"> of God is an honorable and dignified assignment. In the Christian Greek Scriptures the noun </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">diakonos</span><span class="font5"> is used in three different ways or senses: (1) Serving in a secular sense such as a household servant; (2) in a congregational sense such as a ministerial servant; and (3) in a broad sense referring to anyone who performs sacred service to God. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diakonos </span><span class="font5">is translated “minister” in several languages. All active, dedicated servants of God, whether of the anointed or of. the “other sheep,” male or female, may lay claim to being ministers. As such they , serve as ambassadors or envoys of the Kingdom government. Paul was speaking of this lofty service when he wrote: “I glorify my ministry </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[diakonia]”</span><span class="font5"> (Rom. 11:13) The Word “glorify” includes such meanings as </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“honor,” “make much of,” “take pride in,” “magnify,” “lay great stress on”</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“prize.”</span><span class="font5"> This helps us to have the right evaluation of our assignments as God’s dedicated ministers.—See w81 3/15, pp. 14-29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Overseers charged to “pay attention ... to all the flock.” Subject under discussion was Paul’s house-to-house ministry, how he bore “thorough witness” and was thus “clean from the blood of all men.” It was within this context that he spoke at Acts 20:28. (Note Acts 20:20, 24, 26.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christ set example for elders in fully accomplishing ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Preaching was his principal work. (Matt. 4:17) This is what he trained his followers to do. (Luke 8:1; 9:1, 2; 10:1, 8, 9) Undershepherds, yoked to Jesus, should have same goal. (Matt. 11:29, 30; John 18:37) (See English </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> of July 1, 1976, pages 410, 411.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What other responsibilities make this a problem for some elders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have two elders, assigned in advance, explain how taking the lead in the field ministry and still spending time with their families sets a good example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Name some advantages of making shepherding calls after field service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Give examples of how shepherding calls can be made while caring for other responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Have a group of elders relate before the class the good results of their being observed working consistently with the publishers in the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How is the congregation affected when elders and/or their wives are able to pioneer or occasionally auxiliary pioneer? (2 Cor. 9:2b)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Second Timothy 4:2 includes counsel to elders on handling problems in a congregation; even under such circumstances, what is not to be neglected according to verse 5?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to Hebrews 13:7, whose is the faith to be imitated? (Phil. 3:17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For whose blood do overseers show concern when they take the lead in the field ministry?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Discussion between two elders on the need to help others keep active in glorifying Jehovah and in the ministry. (4 min.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Include the following points: (1) Good personal example in field ministry (1 Tim. 4:12b); (2) should meet requirements outlined by Jesus at Luke 12:48b; (3) should remember faith dead without works .(Jas. 2:14-26; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cj, </span><span class="font5">p. 82, par. 1); (4) in association with brothers and sisters, speak positively, not negatively, about the field ministry and its value;</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>KEEPING PROPER PERSPECTIVE</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>OF WORK TO BE DONE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Elders need proper attitude toward the work and the results obtained, if they are to help others keep active.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus gave us proper view regarding our attitude. (Matt. 10:12-14) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Apostle Paul also outlined the need to do what we are commissioned to do, namely, planting and watering, or, stated another way, preaching and teaching. (1 Cor. 3:6, 7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Evident, .when it comes to results, it is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">God</span><span class="font5"> that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">brings growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This attitude vital if we are to be successful. Otherwise, tend to become downhearted, equating success with number who accept the “good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How do we know this is right attitude? Consider results in Noah’s day, in Sodom and Gomorrah, from Jeremiah’s preaching. Faithfulness in doing as commanded meant success, though tangible results few. (Matt. 7:13, 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider this modern-day example and whether those a part of it are successful: In one Moslem country after 32 years. of preaching and teaching, growth has been from 23 Kingdom proclaimers to 188, an average of five new ones each year. Some missionaries there for 20 and more years helped perhaps 10 or so; others there seven to nine years helped no one take a stand for truth. Successful? Yes! The </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">growth lies with Jehovah,</span><span class="font5"> who reads hearts. Does not ask us to do the impossible, only to sound warning, preach and teach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Apostle Paul spoke of himself as a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">‘public servant</span><span class="font5"> of Christ Jesus, engaging in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">holy work of the good news of God.’</span><span class="font5"> (Rom. 15:16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That is our work. We are public servants, engaging in holy work of the good news of God. To be successful we need to carry on this work and encourage others to do so also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By recommending ourselves as God’s ministers we reap benefits and blessings now and in trying times ahead. (2 Cor. 6:3, 4; 1 Pet. 3:15)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>WHAT LIES AHEAD</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Generally, our field activity performed in face of mounting problems. (Rev. 12:12) Will continue to need holy spirit to keep on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Difficult days ahead. Some of the generation of 1914 will see the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“year of goodwill</span><span class="font5"> on the part of Jehovah” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">end;</span><span class="font5"> then the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“day of vengeance</span><span class="font5"> on the part of our God” </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">will be upon us.</span><span class="font5"> (Isa. 61:1, 2; Matt. 24:34; Rom. 9:28; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ks</span><span class="font5"> p. 140)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What does this mean? </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Even after the despoiling of Babylon the Great,</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah’s servants must </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">steadfastly carry on</span><span class="font5"> with proclamation, not of “goodwill” but of “vengeance.” (w81 3/15 p. .23, par. 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now is the time for elders to “carry on as men.” (1 Cor. 16:13,14)</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Handling Cases of Wrongdoing</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">Wrongdoing dates from man’s rebellion in Eden. We have Jehovah’s example of prompt action in handling the case. (Gen. 3:8-19) How are cases of wrongdoing handled today? Appointed elders serve as qualified judges:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">(a) To keep out spirit of the world. (1 Cor. 2:12;' Eph. 2:1, 2)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">(b) To readjust or reprove wrongdoers. (Titus 1:9)</span></p></li>
<li>

<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>PROBLEMS THAT ARISE IN HANDLING CASES OF WRONGDOING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">What is Scriptural view on reporting serious wrongdoing? (Lev. 5:1; Prov. 28:13; 29:24; compare 1 Corinthians 1:11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not every case of wrongdoing requires a judicial committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Example: A highly respected elder and a sister in the congregation failed to put in writing a business transaction. Each later charged the other with lying, slander and fraud. The body of elders wanted to convoke a judicial committee to act against the sister, siding with their fellow elder. The matter was handled in line with Matthew 18:15, 16 with the help . of a traveling overseer who provided counsel not to get involved prematurely. Judicial committee never had to come into picture.]</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">163 </span><span class="font5">Judicial committee not automatically formed even when one is accused of serious sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What should be done if there is only one witness to a serious sin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Witness should confront the accused to encourage him to confess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If there is no response, one or two elders can discuss the matter with the individual. If he denies it, leave matter in Jehovah’s hands. (1 Tim. 5:19, 24, 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If there is another witness to the same type of sin on the part of the accused person, this would be basis to convoke a judicial committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why is it important to let the accused FACE his accusers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Reasonable for accused to know source of charge. Accusers should be willing to assume their responsibility, as was the case in Israel. (Deut. 17:6, 7; 19:16-21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why would witnesses not need to be present for the entire hearing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No need for them to hear details and testimony that does not affect them. However, witnesses to the wrongdoing should be present later if it becomes necessary to reprove the accused “before all onlookers.” (1 Tim. 5:20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Elders should be quick to listen, but slow to commit themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wait until you have heard all the facts before reaching conclusions and making decisions. (Prov. 18:13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Defer making a decision if not sure of Bible’s direction and the Society’s counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">[Example: Elders directed brother who had been legally divorced before baptism that he was free to remarry even though he had not committed adultery, nor had proof of his former wife’s committing adultery. Do you see any problem here? (Matt. 19:9)] ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>CLARIFICATIONS IN HANDLING CASES OF WRONGDOING</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">If there is question about the mental state' of a baptized individual who commits some deed for which he might be disfellowshipped, a judicial committee should consider the facts of the case. Weigh the evidence and extent of mental incompetence and then decide whether some announcement should be made or whether disfellowshipping should occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Though there may be a basis for showing more than ordinary consideration and patience, the elders must protect the cleanness and spiritual well-being of the congregation. (1 Thess. 5:14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of unbaptized persons, regularly associating with congregation, who unrepentantly continue in wrongdoing despite ■ all efforts to help them, an announcement can be made that the congregation should avoid associating with such persons. (1 Cor. 15:33) They would be treated as disfellowshipped persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">165 When an appeal committee reverses the decision of the original judicial committee, the matter should be referred to the Branch Office for review. Both the original committee’s letter- regarding its decision to disfellowship and the appeal committee’s reasons for reversing that decision should be submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The appeal committee should not inform the disfellowshipped person of its decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The final decision, as approved by the Branch Office, . will be transmitted to the parties involved by the original judicial committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, when the decision of the appeal committee is to uphold the disfellowshipping, the letter from the original committee telling of its decision to disfellowship as well as the appeal committee’s letter upholding the decision should come to the Branch Office together, so that the records of the Branch Office will be complete. In such a case there is no need to wait to hear from the Branch Office before the decision of the two committees is revealed to the wrongdoer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While there should be no hasty action in reinstating individuals, consideration should be given to a plea for reinstatement when repentance is definitely shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When could a reinstated brother be recommended for responsibility?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Circumstances of each case govern length of time that should elapse before a recommendation could be made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Good judgment required on the part of the elders. Determine the standing of the individual with the congregation after he has had ample time to prove himself. (Compare Acts 16:1, 2.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Carefully consider possible effect if individual were to be appointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Would it be a cause for stumbling among the brothers? (2 Cor. 6:3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In cases of scandal, he might never be able to live down his wrongdoing sufficiently so as to qualify.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>PROGRESSING IN UPHOLDING JEHOVAH’S RIGHTEOUSNESS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">We are surrounded with increasing wrongdoing. Such can infiltrate and have bad effect on Christian congregation. (2 Tim. 3:1-5, 13; Jude 3, 4, 11-13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Brothers need to tighten up in holding to Jehovah’s righteous standards regarding the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Causing Division:</span><span class="font5"> Deliberate action disturbing unity of congregation or undermining confidence of brothers in Jehovah’s arrangement. May involve or lead to apostasy. (Rom. 16:17, 18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Apostasy:</span><span class="font5"> A “standing away from,” “a falling away, defection,” “rebellion, abandonment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Action taken against true worship of Jehovah or his established order among his dedicated people. (Jer. 17:13; 23:15; 28:15, 16; compare 2 Thessalonians 2:9, 10.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■ Apostates: Persons stubbornly holding to and speaking about or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">deliberately spreading</span><span class="font5"> teachings contrary to Bible truth as taught by Jehovah’s Witnesses, or who join another religious organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Outcome of such a course could be very serious. (2 Pet. 2:1-3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How should apostates be viewed? (See Titus 3:10, 11; 1 John 2:19.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those with sincere doubts should be helped, dealt with mercifully. (Jude 22, 23; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">August 1, 1980, pages 21, 22.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Conduct with Opposite Sex:</span><span class="font5"> Should never bring reproach upon Jehovah or the Christian congregation. (1 Pet. 2:11, 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sexual misconduct would include: (1) Touching sexual parts or caressing breasts. Calls for strong counsel, warning and needed help. (2) </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Pomeia, </span><span class="font5">involving misuse of another’s genitals. Requires judicial action. (w73, pp. 574-576)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Courting or dating when one party is not Scriptur-ally free to marry is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Strong counsel should be given, and, if ignored, individuals should be marked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Could lead to denial of special privileges in the congregation if repeated warnings and reproofs not heeded by those involved. (2 Thess. 3:14, 15; w68, pp. 255, 256; w80 8/1, pp. 30, .31; w81 9/1, PP- 19-21)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Divorce and Related Matters:</span><span class="font5"> The Scriptures urge married persons to remain together as “one flesh.” (Gen. 2:22-24; Matt. 19:4-6; 1 Cor. 7:10-16)</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark49"><span class="font5">Many marital problems can be resolved by following principle of Matthew 18:15.</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">What divorce concession did the law of Moses allow?</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark50"><span class="font5">The husband, not the wife, had power to divorce on broad grounds of “something indecent.” (Deut. 24:1) ,</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">What about divorce for Christians? ■</span></p>
<p><a href="#bookmark51"><span class="font5">Only for “fornication,” or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">porneia.</span><span class="font5"> (Matt. 5:32; 19:9).</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">So Jesus tightened up marriage for Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Equal power of divorce for wife. (Mark 10:11, 12) Sex relations outside marriage union: Marriage bond not automatically broken in God’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Innocent mate can forgive. (1 Cor. 13:4-8; Hos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' 3:1-3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While elders should be informed one way or the other, it is up to innocent mate to decide on whether to divorce or not. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The innocent mate should be informed that resuming sexual relations would indicate forgiveness and cancel Scriptural ground for divorce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Forgiven adultery could not later be used as a basis for divorce, but unrevealed instances of adultery, if later brought to light, could be so used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A divorce freeing a Christian for remarriage should be obtained by innocent mate if possible, or by guilty mate with innocent mate’s consent; both now free to remarry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the guilty one unilaterally obtains a divorce, does this of itself free that one to remarry?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">No; if he does, it is an </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">adulterous marriage. </span><span class="font5">(Luke 16:18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Calls for congregation action in addition to any already taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, this frees the innocent mate to remarry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all cases of adulterous marriages in the future, even after reinstatement, it will be a rare case if one is recommended to serve in an official position in the congregation—at least until the death or remarriage of the first mate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In any event, a considerable number of years should have passed. (1 Tim. 3:2, 12; w80 9/15, p. 31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Where there is evidence of conspiracy between individuals to put away their mates and marry each other, considerable time should elapse before any request for reinstatement is even entertained. (w79 11/15, pp. 31, 32)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A divorced couple having sex relations with each other commit fornication. (Heb. 13:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Marriage:</span><span class="font5"> Of divine origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Engagement is a serious commitment and normally a personal matter. (Matt. 5:37)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, breaking an engagement may require inquiry if the one concerned has an organizational</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">' position of responsibility. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">June 15, 1975, pages 382-384.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">. Marrying an unbeliever: This would result in disqualification from all special privileges for the time being.. If the parent is an elder, ministerial servant or pioneer and allows the marriage, this raises questions regarding his qualifications. (1 Tim. 3:2, 4, 5, 12, 13)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Use of Kingdom Halls: Would not be used for marriages of unbelievers, non-baptized Christians or the reenactment of marriages such as on occasions of anniversaries. (w74, p. 276; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">km-</span><span class="font5"> 1/77, p. 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In each case, the body of elders will decide when the Kingdom Hall can be used for a wedding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wedding vows: See May 1, 1974, issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> page 275.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These vows, or a modification of them according to the local law, should be used, and not privately chosen and worded vows.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>TREATMENT OF DISFELLOWSHIPPED AND DISASSOCIATED PERSONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Members of the Christian congregation should avoid contact and have no spiritual association with disfellowshipped and disassociated persons. (1 Cor. 5:11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We need to be especially cautious about contact with disfellowshipped persons who have apostatized and those who continue practicing their immoral conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">171 </span><span class="font5">These can affect the congregation like gangrene. (2 Tim. 2:16-18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whereas disfellowshipping is an action taken by a judicial committee against unrepentant wrongdoers, disassociation is an action taken by an individual who has decided that he no longer desires to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. (1 John 2:19)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A person would be viewed as one who has disassociated himself when he advises the congregation, usually in writing, that he no longer desires to be recognized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Or, if the individual takes a course contrary to the neutral position of the Christian congregation, then the congregation is compelled to view him as one who has chosen to separate from us. (Isa. 2:4; John 15:17-19; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry School Textbook,</span><span class="font5"> 1977, pp. 61, 62.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Those who disassociate themselves should be viewed and treated the same as disfellowshipped persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A brief announcement should be made to the congregation that this individual is, by his chosen course, no longer desirous of being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the Branch Office should be notified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If one who disassociates himself wants to return to the congregation, he must request a hearing for reinstatement just like one who has been disfellowshipped.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Judging with Righteous Judgment</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">It is important to judge impartially and with righteous judgment. (1 Pet. 1:17; John 7:24) Individual overseers and elders making up judicial committees are called upon to counsel, correct, reprove and take disfellowshipping action where necessary. By following principles and laws set out in God’s Word they judge for Jehovah and he is with them in the matter of judgment.—2 Chron. 19:6.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>JEHOVAH MAKES PROVISION</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>TO CORRECT HIS PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Why is correction needed? (Prov. 14:12; Jer. 10:23, 24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a loving heavenly Father, He provides correction and discipline whenever needed. (Heb. 12:4-6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Human instrumentalities among the various agencies used to correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Israel, prophets and kings spoke in name of Jehovah and in accord with his Word. (1 Sam. 15:22, 23; 2 Sam. 23:2; Jer. 2:1, 20, 29-31)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Overseers used in early Christian congregation and modern-day visible organization. (Titus 1:5; Heb. 13:17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God’s Word is basis for giving needed correction. (2 Tim. 3:14-17)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If authoritative Scriptural counsel and admonition are ignored and individuals persist in walking disorderly or in course not yet serious enough for judicial action, such may be “marked.” (2 Thess. 3:14, 15)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">173</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What are some situations where such ‘marking’ would be appropriate? (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 1, 1981, pages 19-21, pars. 12-21.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">First step leading back to God. (Rom. 2:4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In handling cases of wrongdoing, why should elders be careful in deciding whether someone is repentant? (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 1, 1981, pages 24-26, paragraphs 13-19 and'24.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Seeming repentance in relation to repeated sin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does one’s pattern of life really give evidence of ‘producing fruit that befits repentance’? (Matt. 3:8) If gross sin extended over period of time, would be questionable whether wrongdoer belongs in God’s congregation.

<p><span class="font5">1. Upholds Jehovah’s name and standard of righteousness. (Acts 15:14; 1 Pet. 1:14-16; compare Isaiah 52:5.)</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">2. Protects purity of congregation. (1 Cor. 5:1-5; 2 Cor. 7:11)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Can affect wrongdoer, jolting him to his senses.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Implications of disassociation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What does God’s Word say about those who renounce way of truth, either by written notice or by actions? (1 John 2:19; Rev. 19:17-21; Isa. 2:4; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 15, 1981, page 23, paragraphs 14-16.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How should disfellowshipped and disassociated ones be treated?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What Scriptural and historical guidelines do we have? (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 15, 1981, pages 22, 23, paragraphs 9-12.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Explain the full import of Paul’s words at 1 Corinthians 5:11-13. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 15, 1981, page 24, paragraphs 18-20.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What about speaking to or associating with disfellow-shipped or disassociated person? (2 John 9-11; see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 15, 1981, pages 24, 25, paragraphs 21-24.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Consider example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If someone asks about being restored to God’s favor or gives evidence of repentance and desires to be reinstated, who initiates action? (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">September 15, 1981, page 25, paragraph 24.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How might problems result where relatives are concerned?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">How do Jesus’ words at Matthew 10:34-38 have a bearing on this matter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What special problems may arise in relation to family and social gatherings? (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 15, 1981, page 30, paragraphs 22-24.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How are funerals involved, and what governs arrangements that might be made? (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower, </span><span class="font5">September 15, 1981, page 31, paragraph 26.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What tests do these matters bring on all involved? (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 15, 1981, page 31, paragraphs 27, 28.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bible speaks of reproving “with severity, that they may be healthy in the faith.” (Titus 1:13) When? How?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remember, administering reproof is not just making a decision or even announcing it; rather, it requires convicting, convincing the wrongdoer of the error of his way, so that he stops doing all that is bad and establishes himself as a practicer of good. This includes helping him to see how lesser sins led to serious deflection from Jehovah’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some wrongdoers have gone so far into a practice of sin that it may be difficult for them to show sufficient fruitage of repentance to justify allowing them to remain in the congregation. (Consider Paul’s command concerning the man at Corinth, 1 Corinthians 5:3-5, 13.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Deciding the case. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the person is guilty of gross, serious sins, such as those listed in /?s77, pages 57-59, and he is unrepentant, he must be disfellowshipped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If, although guilty of such a sin, he has truly repented and is producing fruitage of repentance, thus no longer posing a threat to the cleanness of the congregation or bringing it into public disrepute, then he should be reproved rather than disfellowshipped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of reproof, there may be good reasons why an announcement of the reproof should be made to the congregation. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> December 1, 1976, page 734; September 1, 1981, pages 26, 27, paragraphs 27-29.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In almost all cases of reproof, restrictions should be imposed. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Organization,</span><span class="font5"> page 167; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Service,</span><span class="font5"> March 1975, page 4; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> September 1, 1981, page 27, paragraph 29.)</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>APPEAL HEARINGS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Consider reasons for appeal, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(ks</span><span class="font5"> 1/80 p. 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the disfellowshipped person believes a serious error in judgment was committed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">He should make known in writing his reason for requesting an appeal, doing so within one week from the time he was notified of the committee’s decision and addressing it to the body of elders of the congregation which took the action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Does he deny that he is guilty of committing a disfellowshipping offense?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If he admits guilt on a disfellowshipping charge, does he claim that at the time of the hearing he was repentant? If he does, had he produced “works that befit repentance” to a sufficient degree so as to offset the sin(s) committed, thus establishing that he was no longer a threat to the cleanness of the congregation? (Acts 26:20)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When an appeal is heard, it is necessary to rehear all the evidence relevant to the case, including that which was presented originally and any new evidence now available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wherever possible, the judicial committee that heard the original case should be present at the appeal hearing(s) and should furnish the appeal committee whatever written records they have on the first hearing(s).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If they believe that earlier testimony is being changed, they can so state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The appeal committee may also wish to question them </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">privately</span><span class="font5"> as to their reasons for reaching the conclusion they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Was there an error in judgment or was decision of original committee basically sound according to evidence, factors available and attitude of accused at their hearing(s)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Major goals are to ascertain whether there was a Scriptural basis for the original action taken and whether the individual was repentant at the time the action was taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the appeal committee determines that really it was a “matter of judgment” and there was a basis for the action taken, although it might have been decided another way, they would likely decide to leave the decision as it is, trusting the judgment of the committee that was on the scene when the case was first heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It may be found that there is no valid basis for the disfellowshipping on the ground the initial committee used, but there is another ground for taking action to disfellowship, so that there is no reason to rescind the disfellowshipping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the appeal committee decides to reverse the disfellowshipping, they should first refer their decision to the Branch Office for review, supplying reasons for their decision and giving a copy to- the original judicial committee. If, for some reason, the original committee does not concur with the appeal committee, they should submit their observations as well as their original letter outlining their disfellowshipping decision along with the letter from the appeal committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The disfellowshipped party should not be given, at this time, any intimation of the decision to rescind the disfellowshipping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the Branch Office has approved which decision applies, the original judicial committee will be advised and will inform the parties involved accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Examples and problems:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. A youth disfellowshipped for drug abuse appeals because he has ‘the right to do so’ and desires another committee to hear the case. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ks</span><span class="font5"> 1/80, p. 4.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">2. A sister, appealing her disfellowshipping, admitted she celebrated a religious holiday with her relatives but claims to have been reached by the counsel given during the hearings. She states that she will never again become involved in the sin and has informed her relatives of her decision.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. This man lied about his sins and tried to cover them over by bringing accusations against others, until finally the necessary witnesses were found. After being informed of the decision to disfellowship, he came to his senses, corrected the problems (sins), producing fruitage of repentance, and on this basis appealed.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">(See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Ministry School Textbook,</span><span class="font5"> 1977, pp. 63, 64; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Organization,</span><span class="font5"> pp. 176-178; </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> March 1, 1977, page 152.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In hearing pleas for reinstatement, elders need to be balanced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is not just a matter of accepting a person back simply because of his request and the passing of some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Before making a decision the elders must determine whether the wrongdoer is truly repentant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider the overall pattern, whether the person is repentant over wrongdoing of which he really was guilty and for which clear evidence existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Generally, the elders of the congregation that originally disfellowshipped the person will consider the plea and decide whether there are grounds for reinstatement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Consider example.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Much is involved in judging with righteous judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By following Scriptural principles and procedures outlined, elders will be able to discharge their responsibility to Jehovah and toward the flock. (2 Tim. 4:1, 2)</span></p>
