<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">1. Frame Rate</span><span class="font9">: Choosing a frame rate will vary depending on the subject matter of the video. The choice whether to shoot 24p (23.98) or 30p (29.97) will be left to the discretion of the DP (Director of Photography) working closely with the Director’s preference. From time to time, a video or sequence may be part of a larger group of segments. On these occasions, you may be asked to film at a certain frame rate to match other video footage. When this occurs, the required frame rate will be specified on the Video Assignment Form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">2. Aspect Ratio/Resolution</span><span class="font9">: Generally speaking, it is preferred all videos be shot with a 16x9 aspect ratio at 1080p. If a project comes up where a DP feels there would be specific benefits to shooting at a different aspect ratio or resolution, this should be approved by Production Oversight at WHQ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">3. Codec</span><span class="font9">: If ProRes 422 is not possible, do not convert to ProRes. Rather, please send highest quality bitrate *.mov or *.mp4 file, and we will convert locally. This saves time from downloading a large file unnecessarily.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a><a name="bookmark26"></a>B. WRITING THE SCRIPT</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. The medium of the project’s release (i.e., JWB, VOD, jw.org) will affect how you write the story, especially what you include in the beginning of the video. JW.org videos are stand-alone videos, with a simple explanatory caption. Because of that, the video should tell the whole story. Most VOD projects are the same. But for JWB segments, the anchor’s introduction (or lead) is </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">an integral part of the story </span><span class="font9">and not aredundant comment or a summary of the contents of the video. Instead, it is very similar to what is described in Study 20 of the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">be</span><span class="font9"> book, “Scriptures Effectively Introduced.” The intro arouses interest in the video that the audience is about to see. However, since a video is much longer than most scriptures, a television anchor will also try to briefly answer </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">some</span><span class="font9"> basic questions, in his lead - who, what, when, where, why and how - in his lead. This means that certain basic data about the event or the individual should be left out of the video so that the video can focus more on the events that make up the story and the application of these. This will also help limit some redundancy between the anchor’s comments and what is stated in the video. With that in mind, please communicate with the Story Team what you have left out from the final video edit for the benefit of the anchor.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Also, the first draft of a video will many times contain some redundancy or aspects that do not necessarily add to the lessons that are being highlighted. Many stories can thus be abbreviated with a clear application intact. We recommend that the editor and director create a written transcript and review the selected interviews and narration from a writing aspect first before editing the video. Look for what sections, sentences, or words can be deleted and yet maintain the integrity of the story. Although a comment may be very important in the eyes of the interviewee, it may not be necessary for the overall benefit of our worldwide brotherhood.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">C. INTERVIEWS </span><span class="font9">(Please see information i</span><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font9">n Appendix</span></a><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font9"> B and </span></a><span class="font9">C)</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. If your video assignment includes interviews, ensure that you are thorough and explore, </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">at the very least</span><span class="font9">, the following questions about each subject brought up: Who? What? When? Where? Why? How? 2. The eye line of the person being interviewed should be just off camera (right or left), but it should be clear that the interviewee is not looking into the camera. If you are shooting more than one interview in the same place, try to alternate where you place the interviewee in the frame, from left to right. (Please refer t</span><a href="#bookmark22"><span class="font9">o </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Appendix C</span></a><span class="font9"> on page 26.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. The interviewee’s comments should be understood without hearing or knowing the question that was asked. The interviewer should not be included in any way, whether visually or in the audio recording.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. If you are used to interviewing for our written publications, do your utmost to resist the temptation of acknowledging the interviewee’s comments while he or she is still speaking, since that would be included in the recording. Also, remember that sometimes the best way to encourage an interviewee to elaborate on a subject is by simply remaining quiet, as opposed to posing a follow-up question. In addition, to draw out an individual’s deepest thoughts on a subject, try not only to cover the mere facts about an event, but ask questions such as: “What went through your mind when that happened?” “What was your reaction when you heard that?” You could also try asking, “Why did you decide to do that?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. Please revie</span><a href="#bookmark21"><span class="font9">w </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Appendix B</span></a><span class="font9"> on page 21.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. If footage will be captured portraying a Biblical or historical (including modern-day) scene, Audio/Video would like to provide you with the approved images from the organization’s archives or the WHQ Art Department to ensure the most accurate portrayal possible, especially as it relates to sets, props, and wardrobe. There is a desire to keep to the standard look set by the Art Department. Therefore, please contact</span><a href="mailto:inboxavsstory@jw.org"><span class="font9">t </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">AV Story</span></a><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">,</span><span class="font9"> and they will work with the Research Team for these materials.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a><a name="bookmark30"></a>E. KEEPING IT CURRENT</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Any methodsthatcan be used to keep the footage and video current should be taken. For example, avoid certain pieces of literature that are older or outdated. You may be aware of certain publications being replaced in your language. Avoid showing the year-for example, on the daily text-if the publication has a yearly release. Additionally, certain hair and dress styles, while still appropriate, can be perceived as trendy. Making an effort to keep the choices of dress and grooming more classic will help keep a video current.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a><a name="bookmark32"></a>F. SET BUILDING</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. If it is decided to build a set, please avoid the tendency to leave walls bare. Blank walls do not look good on camera nor do they appear realistic. Also, avoid making the set appear “too perfect,” which conveys that it was built and painted yesterday.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a><a name="bookmark34"></a>G. DIALOGUE</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. If the one interviewed speaks English with a thick accent and English is not his native tongue, it is preferred that the interview be recorded in his native tongue. If he only speaks </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">English</span><span class="font9"> but has an accent that may be difficult to understand, please assist him in speaking clearly with proper enunciation and add subtitles to all deliveries, even prior to Teaching Committee review. This will enable both the Story Team and the Teaching Committee to clearly understand what is being said.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. When selecting English voice-overs for those speaking in another language, bear in mind that the clear enunciation of the English language is most important. For all deliveries, both proxy and final, persons with clear English diction should be selected. Please do not subtitle non-English speech. Those selected for voice-over recording should not have an accent that makes it difficult to comprehend what is being said. Also, an individual’s seniority should not be a determining factor when selecting someone to record. For the deliveries prior to Teaching Committee review, it may be most practical and time efficient to record someone who lives nearby the audio recording facility. Following the Teaching Committee’s review and comments, the selected persons for the final English voice-over recordings should be used.</span></p></li></ul>

<li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Thumbnails are pictures used on the jw.org and JW Broadcasting websites to display each clip. When clicking the thumbnail, the user will be taken to the video. We request your assistance in providing photos for this purpose. This should be done for all videos, with the exception of JW Broadcasting postcards (see section IV.B).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">Please provide the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">•</span><span class="font7"> Arrange the thumbnails as Option_A (your preferred one) and Option_B.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">•</span><span class="font7"> The theme of the shot should represent the overall message of the story.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">•</span><span class="font7"> The images can be taken with a sti ll camera or high-quality frames can be extracted from video footage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">•</span><span class="font7"> Avoid video frames that capture a person mid-sentence or mid-word.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">•</span><span class="font7"> Make sure that there is nothing in the shot that would need to be bl urred (e.g., advertisements, signs, or other copyrighted items).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">•</span><span class="font7"> The i mage should have </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">sufficient</span><span class="font7"> headroom. Medi um shots are better than close-ups. When submitting your two images, a medi um shot, a ful l-length shot, and a wide shot would be preferred so as to provide a variety of options.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">2. Thumbnails should not have the individual placed too far left, so as to avoid covering the head of the individual, as seen in the examples provided. Also, a slight dark gradient is typically applied to the left. Keep this in mind when framing your pictures.</span></p><img src="20170721_vpg_E_files/20170721_vpg_E-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:351pt;height:121pt;"><img src="20170721_vpg_E_files/20170721_vpg_E-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:351pt;height:126pt;"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. The photos you provide will also be used for smaller thumbnails, such as the ones below. However, please note that all cropping of photos will be done by Audio/Video. The examples shown here are only to give you an idea of the final use of the photos you propose.</span></p><img src="20170721_vpg_E_files/20170721_vpg_E-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:557pt;height:124pt;"></li></ul>

<p><span class="font9">The standard of dress and grooming in our videos should reflect well on our organization and Jehovah God. Our publications, including videos, are often used to gauge what is or is not acceptable. A good guideline for any publisher depicted in our videos is found on page 3 of the brochure Dress and Grooming for Visitors Touring Bethel (</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dgb</span><span class="font9">). For example, the following should be avoided in your video:</span></p><img src="20170721_vpg_E_files/20170721_vpg_E-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:469pt;height:135pt;">
<p><span class="font9">Although focusing on Bethel, the illustrations in the </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">dgb</span><span class="font9"> brochure reflect our universal Christian standards. While dress at a social gathering will differ from that at a Kingdom Hall or in the ministry, the principles apply no matter where we are.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">5.</span><span class="font7"> The first shot of the video should not be less than three seconds . Otherwise, it could appear as a stray shot.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">6.</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;"> Audio should not start at 0 frames</span><span class="font7">. Audio should not start earlier than 0.5 seconds into the clip and no later</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">7.</span><span class="font7"> The video should not end on a freeze frame immediately after the last words are spoken or when music ends,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">whichever is perceived as the natural end of your segment. Thus, leave a long shot at the end that s tarts no later than 1.5 seconds before last words/music ends and continues for at least 6 seconds after last words/music ends.</span><span class="font5">[1] </span><span class="font7">This long shot mentioned above should be </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">one continuous shot</span><span class="font9">—</span><span class="font7">no cuts or dissolves.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font17">8.</span><span class="font7"> Using slow motion so as to extend the last shot of the video is approved only if it fits artistical ly with the rest of the video. However, try to avoid that solution to the extent possible. Instead, it’s best to carefully plan the concl uding shot in preproduction or to capture multiple options.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">9.</span><span class="font7"> It is preferred that shots be no shorter than two seconds. If the shot would requi re a lower third, make sure it’s no shorter than three seconds so as to allow sufficient ti me for the audience to read the text. The shot would need to be long enough in durati on for the OST to be displayed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">10.</span><span class="font7"> Any relevant text (either OST or text on-camera) has to be displayed long enough for a slower-than-average reader to finish reading it. For example, the text “Application for Regular Pioneer Servi ce” would most likely take three or four seconds to read, assuming that the text is displayed in a way that draws the viewer’s attention to it immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">11.</span><span class="font7"> If any graphics are used (animation, charts, graphs, etc.) do not burn text into cl ip, since such text wil l li kely need to be translated. Provide a clean cl ip without text.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">12.</span><span class="font7"> If displaying a quote from a scripture onscreen, there should be no narration on top of that OST unless the narrator is reading the full scri pture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">13.</span><span class="font7"> If a shot involves a pan, ti lt, focus pull, or the li ke and the end of such transition reveals something new— such as a person, an event, or a sign—at least two seconds should be al lowed for the viewer to comprehend what is seen after the transition finishes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">14.</span><span class="font7"> If in the edit ti meline two separate interviewees are right after each other and placed si mi larly in frame (e.g., both left in frame), cover the cut with B-roll .</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font17">15.</span><span class="font7"> There is no need to include the jw.org logo, the JW Broadcasting logo, or other credits at the end. Al l credits are added later in the process.

If the video is selected as one of the highlights of that month’s JW Broadcasting program, you may be requested to provide footage that can be used in the beginning of the program when the anchor highlights three segments. Ifyou receive such arequest, please provide 15 raw shots (that is not simply extracted from the final edit, but the raw footage) that are five seconds or longer in duration. Each clip needs to be usable in full, and thus the five seconds should not include any technical or visual preproduction or mistakes. The clips should be ones used in some form in the final edit.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. If asked to put together a “postcard” to conclude a JW Broadcasting program, please provide us with a total of approximately 20 video clips showing the brothers and sisters in the requested area or congregation. We would like an assortment of various greetings and activities. Some may be waving, others smiling, while others are busy doing theocratic activities with a smile.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. We appreciate shots where the brothers are waving or smiling while looking at the camera. However, please also capture them busy working or socializing without addressing the camera waving and smiling. This provides options. Please include the young ones as well.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Also, keep in mind that the video will be narrated by an anchor in the studio. Therefore, it is appreciated if we can clearly hear the group of brothers and sisters say hello in their native tongue, but there will be no opportunity to convey messages due to the voice-over narration. No raw clip should be shorter than six seconds of usable footage. Make sure to get good quality audio at all times. Ensure that no audio of the videographer or director is recorded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Additionally, we would like to include in the anchor’s comments interesting details specifically about that congregation and the region in general. What is their territory like? What challenges do they face and how are they overcome? Please include the number of publishers, pioneers, servants, and elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">5. When providing comments to be used by the anchor, please inquire about the theme of the hour program where the postcard will be featured to perhaps tie in the comments on how the brothers and sisters in that specific region are applying the monthly program theme.</span></p></li>

Examples of videos in this category are </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Act Wisely When Bullied</span><span class="font9"> and </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Keep Improving Your Family </span><span class="font9">Worship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.2. Let facial expressions tell the story as much as possible without being over the top. Realistic acting is needed. Auditions should focus more on the visual communication and not so much on the verbal. Music is one of the most powerful tools in this video. It can stand alone at times for a few seconds to carry the emotional story. Do not be afraid of using strong pauses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.3. Please choose the wording of the voice-over carefully. The person chosen to do the voiceover would need to be someone who can grasp and convey the emotional state in the video. Hearing the mental thoughts and feelings, by means of a voice-over allows us to say things that we may not normally get away with, which is very similar to a soliloquy at an assembly or convention. The voice-over does not need to narrate everything happening onscreen. Instead, the narration should be taking the lead since it is the individual’s </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">thought process</span><span class="font9"> we are interested in. For example, if the narration says, “I had been smoking for 40 years,” it is not </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">always</span><span class="font9"> necessary to show it on-screen. The more sensitive the subject, the better it is to rely on the narration as your communication tool as opposed to the visuals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.4. Please show at least one Scriptural text briefly—no more than two. Unless the narrator is also reading the scripture, do not add narration when the scripture text is shown on-screen. Make sure there is sufficient time for reading the scripture, since this is one of the main points of the video.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.5. No dialogue is heard; only the voice-over.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.6. Reenact </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font9"> Bible scene which highlights the main teaching point. Be creative and accurate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.7. While the creative and artistic look is important, the clear and simple teaching should stand out more than the visuals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.8. Generally, no script is needed for approval since the voice-over can generally be rerecorded easily if adjustments are needed. AVS Story Team will notify you if a script is required for approval.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.9. Stay as close to the treatment as possible. Anything omitted or adjusted should be approved by AVS Story Team prior to execution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.10. We would like to diversify the ethnicity as much as possible, so please check with AVS Story Team on which ethnicities are currently being underexposed or overexposed. If you are filming this in a foreign branch, we appreciate the variety you are bringing to the program. We want to avoid being “U.S.-centric” or always using Caucasian people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.11. Avoid as much as possible “Americanizing” the videos by using large homes, expensive gadgets, etc. We want it to be international, so as to unite our brotherhood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.12. Information on how the recording could be organized, including a sample schedule and crew size, can be provided at the project kickoff meeting. Additional sample videos that have been finished can also be provided.</span></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>2. Teachings That Benefit</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.1. This three-minute-or-less video is made up of B-roll, areenactment, coupled with a narrator (third person) explaining briefly how to apply one specific Bible principle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.2. The tone of the narrator should reflect the mildness, compassion, kindness, and love that would reflect the attitude and speech of Jesus. The narration should not be redundant with the visuals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.3. The simple, clear teaching should stand out more than the visuals or the characters. This series is cinematic in nature and driven by clear teaching, powerful visuals, and music that will emphasize the mood of the situation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.4. Since no script is used, facial expressions and realistic acting are important aspects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.5. An example of this series is </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Love and Respect Unites Families</span><span class="font9">.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">D. REPORTS</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>1. Special Witnessing Initiatives</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.1. Style: This series is a documentary combining a narrated story, observational B-roll footage, and a documentary interview. Tell the story of the special initiative from the viewpoint of both a Witness involved in the initiative and a person or family who benefited by the initiative. In most cases, the main benefit would be finding the truth. If the story can be carried by interviews only (as opposed to both narration </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font9"> interviews), that is also fine. The important key is that the story is equally understandable.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.2. Artistic treatment: Use subtle visual metaphors and contrast to establish and develop the transition from conflict to resolution. Initially, use limited camera movement and more contrast in lighting during conflict shots without it being overly dark or dramatic. Transition to shots that are more evenly balanced as the story is brought to resolution.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.3. Connection to audience: Combine the above visual effects with shots that establish the joy, satisfaction, and fulfillment that come to the Witness and householder as aresult of the initiative. Use everyday-life shots of those involved to help establish a connection with the viewer. The objective is to show that areal-life Witness can consciously adapt their circumstances to reach out to do more in the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.4. Cast: The series should include those that carry out the initiative, those that organize it at the branch, and those that have already benefited. It is preferred that those that have benefitted are baptized. In some cases, positive comments from appreciative nonWitnesses or authorities are OK to use, but the focus should be on those that have taken a stand for Jehovah as aresult of the initiative. When interviewing responsible brothers from the branch, they should be joyful in their interview and not overly serious. Since it is a documentary, it is preferred that Witnesses </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">not be used</span><span class="font9"> to portray those who are interested. Instead, try to capture real events using interested persons that do not mind expressing appreciation or being captured. Of course, for those that agree and would be recognizable, a model release is needed. In all cases, discernment is of the utmost importance. However, if it is necessary to use a Witness to portray an interested person, the Witness should be unrecognizable.</span></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>2. Bethel Videos</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.1. Initially, these are made for branches for use in tours or training. However, there are times these are requested for another medium or purpose, and adjustments are usually necessary for various reasons:</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font19">•</span><span class="font9"> Redundancy of content due to other, similar videos already released.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">•</span><span class="font9"> Allows the branch to continue showing the video locally, knowing that it would still have new information that was not released publicly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font19">•</span><span class="font9"> Legalities may require that certain footage not be used for a broader audience.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>3. Spiritual Programs</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3.1. As time progresses, there will be more and more spiritual programs released. These will no doubt include dedications of RTOs, Assembly Halls and branches. This series also include branch reports from time to time. Avoid including large sections of talks by members of the Governing Body or their helpers to keep their outlines from needing continuous updating.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3.2. Due to the repetitive nature of some of these programs, it is requested that the videos be angled to highlight the local environment. What needs are currently there? What challenges were on this particular project? What comments did the speaker make that applied to the circumstances or environment of the event? What did the local friends do to support the event? Giving the video a local flavor, including showing the surrounding scenery, will allow these videos to not be overly redundant and will allow the culture and people of the area to be beautified and highlighted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3.3. Try not to include too much information—similar to squeezing in too many scriptures into a five-minute talk.</span></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>4. Construction Projects</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4.1. Look for fresh angles. Avoid repeating what others have done.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4.2. While we appreciate occasionally seeing B-roll of workers smiling and waving, a balanced variety of seeing our brothers and sisters working, associating, smiling, and waving is desired.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">E. INTERVIEWS</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>1. Life Story</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.1. This series focuses on the life lessons of an individual. It is driven by comments made by an individual in an interview setting. Practical application for the viewer is important. The series can be used to relate a theocratic career, life lessons and specific events or difficulties that were overcome. A narrator is not used. Old photos or video footage are recommended when covering past events.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.2. If possible, try to record the interview with two cameras so as to provide the editor with options that reduce visual redundancy. Alternate shots can also be used to add emphasis during key phrases. This series is shot with a less cinematic style than a “Truth Transforms Lives” video. Instead, life stories can look more like ENG (Electronic News Gathering), which is less dramatic. In all cases, please verify the historical accuracy when making reference to dates, other individuals, or places.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.3. Reenactments of past events are not needed. Instead, a lot of the B-roll would focus on the individual’s environment today. This could include their day-to-day life and theocratic assignments, such as preaching, giving talks, encouraging others, studying or preparing for meetings, leisure moments, or Bethel work. If married, it is advisable to show them spending time with their mate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.4. While music is desired, it typically is not needed throughout the entire video, known as “wall-to-wall music.” It will be needed in the beginning and end as well as in selected spots to highlight a key moment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">1.5. An example of this series is </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">James Dyson: Jehovah is Kind and Merciful</span><span class="font9">.</span></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>2. Truth Transforms Lives</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.1. Interviews coupled with B-roll footage drive this series. There is no narration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.2. The story should center on a Scriptural truth, and a Bible principle should be the motivating factor in the change. While details such as conduct of others, meeting atte ndance, or having a good Bible study conductor may be contributing factors for the transformation, this series should highlight what Bible truth led them to change their previous course or habits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.3. The footage is dramatic and cinematic and requires reenactments of past events. Music is used to carry the story from beginning to end. We only show occasional pictures of the past by filming framed pictures in passing. Plenty of B-roll of their current lifestyle and surroundings should be used.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2.4. An example of a video in this series is </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Burt Mann: I Have Finally Become Something</span><span class="font9"> or Forest </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">James: A Medicine Man Encouraged Me to Read the Bible</span><span class="font9">.</span></p></li></ul></li><li>
<p><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>3. Meet Fellow Believers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;">
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3.1. This short video of about 1.5 minutes is meant to attract attention briefly to an individual’s current place in Jehovah’s organization and how he feels about it. It should be positive, upbeat, and cinematic in nature. It should not be used to draw attention to an individual, but to the results of the choices they have made. Choosing ones with a strong spiritual routine and a humble disposition is key.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>F. MUSIC VIDEOS</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">1. Music videos are typically put together after the music audio track has been completed. Therefore, the visuals are recorded without any audio recording needed during the video shoot since the music is the only audio needed in this series.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">2. This is a cinematic segment with a powerful, emotional appeal. The visuals should assist in telling the story or helping the viewer to draw appropriate conclusions. Random B-roll will not motivate the heart, whereas carefully selected clips to match the lyrics can.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">3. Care should be taken that nothing is confusing about the message or actions of those in the video. The application should be very clear, and the visuals need to be understandable even if one is not paying special attention to the lyrics.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">4. Limit the substories to a maximum of three, but two may be sufficient. As the stories individually develop, make sure that the main characters do not look remotely alike so as not to confuse who they are. When possible, limit the amount of drastic changing of clothes so as not to be confusing. Ensure that a one-time viewer will easily be able to tell the substories apart.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark73"></a><a name="bookmark74"></a>APPENDIX A</span></h3>
<h2><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Film Documentation Standards</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Goal</span><span class="font9">: To create a standard that film teams around the world can follow when working on projects for Watchtower. We would like the documentation to be thorough enough to cover our legal liabilities and the organization’s reputation, yet simple enough that crews anywhere can apply the standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Watchtower produces films as a nonprofit organization, made up of all volunteers, for ed ucational purposes. The nature of our films in itself limits the legal liability we are subject to. However, in an effort to be “cautious as serpents,” we are careful about who or what we show in our films and how we acquire the footage. We also make it a point to never give the impression that the organization is endorsing a particular product or company. We do not want to create an unnecessary stumbling block for anyone. In addition, any footage that is acquired from a non-Watchtower film team, whether purchased or donated, must include arecord of where the footage came from, how it was acquired or purchased, and for what specific purpose(s) it can be used. The standards discussed below apply to both short and long format videos including, but not limited to interviews, reenactments, training programs, animations, convention talks, etc. This is not required for ‘electronic news gathering’ type videos since we will only seek to get a model release from those who are featured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Documentation Requirements</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">For the most up-to-date information on Documentation Requirements and release forms, please go to the following website: ppd.bethel.jw.org</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Model Release:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This form is used to obtain permission from an individual who is featured in a video publication.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 1:</span><span class="font9"> A person is being interviewed on camera. The individual being interviewed is required to sign a model release.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 2:</span><span class="font9"> A person is being interviewed on camera. The interview is conducted on a city street and several individuals walk by in the background during filming. Due to the fact that we are not staging the individuals or making them the primary focus of our shot, no model release would be needed for people who walk by in the background.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 3:</span><span class="font9"> A group of individuals are invited to a Kingdom Hall to be primary characters or extras in areenactment. Any person who appears on camera should sign arelease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 4:</span><span class="font9"> When filming a convention, we take a wide shot of the audience. No model releases are needed for the wide shot. However, if we zoom in to feature a couple singing or a small group of people waving, we would ask each of those individuals to sign a model release. Any shot where we </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">stage</span><span class="font9"> any groups or individuals would also require a signed model release from each participant. However, for people who walk by in the background, due to the fact that we are not staging them or making them the primary focus of our shot, no model release is necessary.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9">NOTE: The latest copy of our model release (1/2016) may also serve as arelease for a minor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Location Release:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This form is used when obtaining permission to film footage at any state or federally owned facility, business, or private residence. Before filming in a public location, it is important to check if there are any regulations governing film crews in that area. If a film permit is acquired, this can be used as documentation in lieu of a location release.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Intellectual Property Release:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This form is used to secure </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">ownership rights</span><span class="font9"> for produced media. Special full-time servants do not need to sign arelease. All other commuters, remote volunteers, temporary workers, etc., working with AVS need to sign a new release annually.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Nonexclusive License:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This form is used to obtain permission to feature a privately produced work of art. A nonexclusive release is needed for any professionally created photos, paintings, sculptures, etc. This is helpful when an artist or owner is willing to let us</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page | </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18 </span><span class="font9">use a piece of their work but wants to retain the ownership rights. This release must be signed by the creator of the artwork, not the individual who purchased it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 1:</span><span class="font9"> You are staging a shot/scene at a private residence. There is professional artwork throughout the room. Nonexclusive releases must be obtained from the creator of the artwork.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 2:</span><span class="font9"> You are staging shot/scene at a private residence. A family photo taken by an amateur (friend or family member) or an AVS crew member is in the shot. No nonexclusive license is necessary in this case.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 3:</span><span class="font9"> You are staging a shot/scene at a private residence. In the background, out of focus there is a picture that a professional photographer shot. If the photo is not clearly recognizable, no nonexclusive license would be necessary. However, if you are not certain if it will be recognizable, it may be best to remove it from the shot if possible.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark81"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>Object Release:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This form is used to obtain permission to feature a privately owned </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">rare or unique object.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 1:</span><span class="font9"> You would not need one for filming someone’s Honda Accord, but you would be wise to consider it if the scene featured a rare Bentley in the driveway.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 2:</span><span class="font9"> You would not need it for the average ranch horse, but you would be wise to consider it if you were filming a prize winning race horse.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Logos Guidelines:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As much as possible, please avoid all logos. If it is clearly seen and is in the foreground of a shot, it must be blurred. If corporate logos are out of focus but still clearly recognizable, we will likely have to further blur them. Logos that can be seen when video is paused can be considered on a case-by-case basis. Thus, it is best to setup shots in a way that avoid logos whenever possible.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 1</span><span class="font9">: If you are staging an interview in an office and the brand name of a computer or other devise is clearly in the shot, you should adjust the shot to avoid the logo or disguise/hide the logo.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 2</span><span class="font9">: You are filming a scene of two people talking in front of a car. You should adjust positioning so the car emblem is not visible. It is also not appropriate to show actual license plates since that could be tracked back to a person.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 3</span><span class="font9">: You are filming a scene of two people walking through a parking lot. The camera and cast are moving. While still trying not to highlight the car emblems, you should not worry about repositioning every car so as not to see any logos.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Example 4</span><span class="font9">: You are filming a wide shot of a construction site. In the background, you see a crane moving an object that has a small logo on the side of it. It is not possible to reposition the camera to avoid this and a frame by frame blurring of the logo in motion is too much work. In this case, it would be acceptable to show the logo.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Records Retention Policy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Hard copies of all release forms should be kept by the teams until a project is released. Electronic copies of all the records should be stored in the individual project folders on the server at headquarters. This will be the case for all projects including those assigned by Dispatch to other branches. Dispatch should verify that the branch has submitted all documentation electronically when the first delivery video is sent in. A scene by scene verification is not required. A simple checklist that the branch fills out will suffice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Questions that arise later for the branches should be directed back through Dispatch to the branch. If a team does not agree with arequest from Dispatch, they should bring their concern to the attention of Production oversight. Production oversight and Office oversight will collaborate to make a final determination of what will be required for documentation. Branches should still send the digital copies of their documentation, no matter what language it is in, to Dispatch to be stored in the project folder on the server at headquarters. Hard copies can be shredded after a program is released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The electronic documentation folder for each film should be kept indefinitely and is not subject to the AVS Department’s general seven year record retention policy.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark91"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark92"></a>Audio/Video Interview Guidelines</span></h1>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">When filming an interview, certain statements made by the interviewee will need to be corroborated with references. The interviewer plays a crucial role in collecting copies of these references and verifying that what is said is factual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Below we will outline what kind of statements are facts and what sources can be used so that you have a better understanding of what to keep in mind while handling an interview.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark93"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>What kind of statements or images need references?</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark95"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Any statement that contains specific facts that can be independently verified. They include:</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Geographic names</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Personal names</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Gender of anyone described (names can be deceiving)</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Titles</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Dates</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Statistics (including theocratic statistics—dates, numbers, years, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Common names of plants and animals with corresponding Latin names</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Words not found in Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark97"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Visual/Image Facts may include:</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Style of clothing (e.g., a military uniform)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o &nbsp;</span><span class="font9">Personal appearance</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o &nbsp;</span><span class="font9">Geographic locations</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o &nbsp;</span><span class="font9">Various images--historic images of people, places or objects</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Stars/Sky—relating to time of year and location</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark99"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>What kind of source can we use as areference?</span></h4>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">- The Bible</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">- Insight book or other Watchtower publications</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">These can only be used for our history, life stories or doctrine</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">- For a Witnesses theocratic history, we will need branch records to verify, number of years in full time service, date of baptism, years married, and other like items</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">- A copy of a driver’s license can be used to verify date of birth</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">- For secular sources we need a source that is the most up-to-date, reputable, and authoritative source available</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">This is especially true for anything that touches on science, medicine, law or archaeology. Look for sources from experts in the field with the most current information and thoughts</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ </span><span class="font9">Examples of expert sources:</span></p>
<p><span class="font19">• </span><span class="font9">Universities, academics, specialists, peer-reviewed journals</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">Prepare for the interview:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Do as much research as possible</span><span class="font9">. If you are going to interview, say, a cardiologist about heart attacks, read up on the subject and make sure you understand terms such as “cardiac arrest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Once you understand your topic thoroughly, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">prepare a list of questions to ask</span><span class="font9">. This will help you remember all the points you want to cover.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark101"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>During the interview:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">As the interviewee answers, give him time to reply and listen carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If a statement is made that you do not understand, make sure you ask questions so that you understand exactly what he means. If you don’t, chances are the audience will not either. If a statement is made that is vague, ask him to clarify what was said. If it concerns a technical matter, such as science or legal matters, you may want to record a detailed statement and a simplified statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If the interviewee states a fact, feel free to ask, “How do you know that?” This will help us to find the best source for the information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If you are hearing a story that is second or third-hand, trace it back to its origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Make sure statements that are made can be clearly understood as being fact or opinion.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Give yourself options:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">If the interviewee says something you definitely want to use, but </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">you are not sure it can be verified</span><span class="font9">, have him say it in two different ways. Record him stating it with all of the details. Then record him stating it in more general terms that don’t need to be verified.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Example:</span></h5>
<h6><a name="bookmark107"></a><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Everything stated below would have to be verified. If you are unable to provide sources to corroborate this statement, it would have to be cut from the interview.</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">“When I was 26 years old, I was involved with a notorious hippie group called the Fierce Pandas. We were protesting the Vietnam War on the corner of Haight and Ashbury in San Francisco on April 16, 1967, when we were all arrested and imprisoned for three years in San Quentin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">However</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">, it could be said as follows in a way that nothing in this sentence would need to be verified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“When I was in my 20s, I was arrested for my involvement in protesting the Vietnam War in San Francisco.”</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark109"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Interviewees need to avoid being dogmatic with their statements.</span></h4>
<h5><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>For example:</span></h5>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>

<h6><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>lacks.”</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">While these statements are true, they need to be restated in a less dogmatic way. It can be made into a statement of personal opinion or a conclusion they arrived at based on what they learned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Video Interview: &quot;Esther Lozano—Life Story&quot;</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark142"></a>00:00:00 - 00:01:33 Esther Lozano</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Well, everybody here calls me Honey, but my name is Esther Lozano. And I was born in Fresno, California, in 1919.* I was baptized in 1935,* and I thoroughly enjoyed my service to Jehovah. I became a special pioneer, and then they called me to Gilead. I was in the fourth class of Gilead that was in 1944.* When I left my assignment as a special, I didn’t even know how was to study, but this was beautiful how Gilead prepared us for what was in the future. Right after Gilead we went to Brooklyn Bethel for two years—Esther Lopez and I—then I was sent to Mexico.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">I came in 1947, and I’m still here, so that makes more than 68 years I’ve been in Mexico. * When I arrived, there were 7 Bethelites, and there were 22 missionaries. We all lived right at the branch;* it was a branch—missionary home. The progress in Mexico really is because of the families been united. And then when you get the husband and wife together, then the whole family comes to the truth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">- We can verify the following items by means of the branch service record for Esther Lozano, and some items by means of her printed life story that appeared in earlier publications:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Birth place and year</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">Baptism date</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">When she became a special pioneer</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">When she went to Gilead (What class and graduation date)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">That she went to Brooklyn Bethel and for how long</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">When she was sent to Mexico</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">How long she has been in Mexico</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">- We asked the branch that oversees Mexico to confirm:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font17">o </span><span class="font9">That in 1947 there were 7 Bethelites and 22 missionaries who lived at the branch</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The above interview is a good example of one where the interviewer would also want to have Esther restate some facts in general terms in case she doesn’t remember events clearly or the information cannot be verified. For example, in this instance, we were not able to verify that there were 7 Bethelites and 22 missionaries living at the branch in Mexico in</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Page | </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">25</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">1947. There were no records for this. In the end, we had to take her word for it. If she would have used words like “about” or “approximately” this statement would have been better.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark143"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark144"></a>Interviewee’s personal opinion or conclusion on a matter:</span></h4>
<p><span class="font9">Occasionally, certain statements cannot be corroborated because they are in fact the interviewee’s personal opinion or conclusion on a matter.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark145"></a><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark146"></a>Writing for Our Publications</span><span class="font9"> states:</span></h6>
<p><span class="font9">“Ensure the accuracy of statements made in video interviews, even when these are made by experts in their field. For example, a Witness scientist might state that a certain scientific fact “proves” some conclusion. However, if the logic cannot be supported by other authoritative sources, the person being interviewed should be encouraged to express the conclusion as being his or her opinion rather than as being a widely accepted scientific fact.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">How then can one’s personal opinion be conveyed? See the examples below. Notice how the person’s point of view is worded.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! Interview: “A Biochemist Explains Her Faith”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">But you were convinced that the system of progra mmed cel l death was designed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Yes. The complexity of the whole process is mind-boggling, yet its elegance displays exceptional wisdom. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">I believe</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> it's the wisdom of God. I use powerful microscopes to study the many complex mechanisms that regulate the process. Some mechanisms can trigger the destruction process within seconds if need be.* The cells participate in their own self-destruction.* The process is so well-designed that it's absolutely aweinspiring.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">“What if the Lutheran church had acted the way that the Witnesses had acted? What if the Catholics had? </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">In my opinion, </span><span class="font7">the whole history would have been very different.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">What convinced you, a former atheist, to believe in a Creator? </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Music itself did. Almost everybody appreciates music, and in a way that no animal can. Music can express joy, confidence, tenderness, and almost every other emotion. We naturally move to the rhythms in music. But is music necessary for our survival? Does it play a role in the “survival of the fittest,” as evolutionists teach? </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">I think not. In my view, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">it's unreasonable to conclude that the human brain, with its ability to create and appreciate music like that of Mozart and Beethoven, is the product of evolution. A</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">far more reasonable explanation is that our brain is the product of a wise and loving Creator.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">“I thought about</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> engineers trying to imitate the marvelous mechanisms found in living things, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">and I came to the conclusion </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">that life must have been designed by God.

But the complexity of the human knee makes it difficult to duplicate.* Moreover, compared with our knee, artificial products have arelatively short life span. Even with improved materials at their disposal, those designers are pleased if their products last 20 years.* Our knee, of course, is made of living cells that are constantly renewed</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">. To me, the knee testifies,</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> not to the blind processes of evolution, but to the wisdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Awake! Interview: “A Mathematician Explains His Faith”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">“Why would a system of reproduction in which one organism simply divides into two—and has done this very well for who knows how long—develop into a system in which two things combine to form one?* The mechanisms required to take half the genetic information from the male and half from the female and combine them are immensely complex, presenting a huge problem to evolutionary biologists.* </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">In my view,</span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;"> gender-based reproduction points unequivocally to the mind of God.</span></p>

<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">General:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> When possible, film interviews as a two camera setup. It is recommended that the cameras recording the CU and MS be within 45° of each other with the close-up angle closer to the eye line of the interviewer. Camera angles should not be so profiled that only one eye is visible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> If only one Sony FS7 is available, it is recommend to record UHD (3840x2160 resolution) to provide an option for a close-up through a digital crop. </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Note: </span><span class="font24" style="font-style:italic;">sharp focus will be very important in this workflow.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> Please use a well-constructed chair with four legs and a solid back, which provides a stable and comfortable spot for the interviewee. Avoid using office chairs that swivel or have wheels, since it is difficult to get the subject to stay in one spot, thus creating a distraction and a lack of continuity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> While the interviewee should be comfortable, encourage them to sit up straight and avoid slouching or leaning heavily to one side.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> Whenever possible, avoid distracting items in the background. Examples include: exit signs, fire extinguishers, electrical outlets, cables and cords. The background should be clean and orderly so that focus can stay on the person that is speaking.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">Framing:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> Try to place the subject in the frame using the rule of thirds, with the nose room pointing in the direction of the interviewer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> Have the interviewer and interviewee placed at the same height as the camera to avoid having the interviewee looking up or down, or the camera shooting up or down on the interviewee.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> Avoid leaving excessive headroom in the frame. See examples. A slight “haircut” is often required on the close-up.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> The interviewer should not appear in frame.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font20">•</span><span class="font24"> The interviewee should </span><span class="font24" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font24">have their body facing the camera and their face looking toward interviewer. This looks very odd and is distracting. See example.</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font21">Quality of Light:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Hard vs. Soft Key</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The quality of light that lands on a subject can drastically change how they appear and can also affect how the viewer feels about them. Since hard light creates hard shadows, it draws more attention to texture. Generally for non-dramatic filming, we try to light sisters with a softer source of light (also called beauty lighting) because it hides blemishes and wrinkles. Hard lights will do the opposite, emphasizing and exaggerating any imperfections. Especially when filming older friends in a non-dramatic setting, consider using a softer light source. Key point: The softness of a light source is directly related to the size of the light source relative to the subject. Therefore, to make a hard light softer you must increase its size relative to the subject. This can often be achieved by shooting a light through a diffusion material or fabric.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">Short side vs. broad side key</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Video is a 2D medium, and thus creating the perception of depth can be a challenge. A principle that not only helps add depth but also creates a more appealing and flattering modeling of the face is to light someone from the short side of the face. Since most of the time a subject will not be looking directly into the camera lens but, rather, off to one side, we see more of one side of the face than the other. The short side is the side you may want to key from whenever practical.</span></p><img src="20170721_vpg_E_files/20170721_vpg_E-38.jpg" alt="" style="width:468pt;height:503pt;">

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">The Eye Light</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Whenever we talk with someone, where do we look? At their eyes! An eye light is a light that creates a sparkle or reflection of light from the eye's surface, giving life to the subject's eyes. Without the eye light, we often feel detached from the characters because we can’t see their expressions clearly. We look to the eye to see emotion and often a clue as to what the person is saying or feeling. Without this glint in the eye, we can feel that the character is distant, perhaps even mysterious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The eyes are very reflective, so even a low intensity source can create areflection. The larger the source relative to the subject, the larger the reflected shape will be. This is where the rule “angle of incidence equals angle of reflection” comes into play. Notice how a short or narrow side key often produces this eye light automatically.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">The content of the video, the mood of the story, and the look of the person and what they are saying are all factors that may motivate you to light them one way or another. But if you know the reasons why you’re making a certain decision you can be more in control of your story.</span></p>
