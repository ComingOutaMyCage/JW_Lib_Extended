<p><span class="font10">It was a time of sadness—and my heart, Although it knew and loved the better part, Felt wearied with the conflict and the strife, And all the needful discipline of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And while I thought on these as given to me, My trial-tests of faith and love to be, It seemed as if 1 never could be sure That faithful to the end 1 should endure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And thus, no longer trusting to His might Who says &quot;We walk by faith and not by sight,&quot; Doubting—and almost yielding to despair, 1 he thought arose, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">My cross I cannot bear !</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Far heavier its weight must surely he Than those of others which I daily see ,• Oh, if I might another burden choose, Methinks I should not fear my crown to lose</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A solemn silence reigned on all around, E'en nature's voices uttered not a sound / The evening shadows seemed of peace to tell, And sleep upon my weary spirit fell.</span></p><img src="1889_cog_E_files/1889_cog_E-6.jpg" alt="" style="width:297pt;height:470pt;">
<p><span class="font10">This may not be, I cried, and looked agai To see if any there could ease my pain. But one by one I passed them slowly by, Till on a lovely one I cast my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And so the little cross I quickly took ,-But all at once my frame beneath it shook The sparkling jewels, fair were they to see. But far too heavy was their </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">weight</span><span class="font10"> for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then speaking thus, 1 Ie led me far above, And there, beneath a canopy of love, Crosses of divers shape and size were seen, Larger and smaller than mine own had been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Fair flowers around its sculptured form entwined, And grace and beauty seemed in it combined,-Wondering I gazed—and still I wondered more To think so many should have passed it o'er.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A moment's pause—and then a heavenly light Beamed full upon my wondering, raptured sight Angels on silvery wings seemed everywhere, And angels' music thrilled the balmy air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Then One more fair than all the rest to see. One to whom al! the others bowed the knee, Came gently to me as I trembling lay, And, &quot;Follow me,&quot; He said, &quot;I am the Way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And one there was most beauteous to beltold-A little one, with jewels set in gold,-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ah, this, methought, 1 can with comfort wear, For it will be an easy one to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But oh, that form so beautiful to see, Soon made its hidden sorrows known to me ,— Thorns lay beneath those flowers and colours fair Sorrowing I said, This cross 1 may not bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And so it was with each and ail around, Not one to suit my </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">need</span><span class="font10"> could there be found ,-Weeping, I laid each heavy burden down, As my Guide gently said, &quot;No cross—no crown.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At length to Him I raised my saddened heart<sub>: </sub>He knew its sorrows, bid its doubts depart,— &quot;Be not afraid,&quot; He said, &quot;but trust in me, My perfect love shall now be shown to thee.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And then, with lightened eyes and willing feet, Again I turned my earthly cross to meet, With forward footsteps, turning not aside, For fear some hidden evil might betide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And there, in the prepared, appointed way, Listening to hear, and ready to obey, A cross I quickly found of plainest form, With only words of love inscribed thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With thankfulness I raised it from the rest, And joyfully acknowledged it the best,-The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font10"> one of all the many there, That I could feel was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">good</span><span class="font10"> for me to bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">And while I thus my chosen one confessed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I saw a heavenly brightness on it rest, And as I bent my burden to sustain, I recognised my own old cross again 1</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But oh, how different did it seem to be, Now I had learned its preciousness to see I No longer could I unbelieving say,-Perhaps another is a better way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ah, no I henceforth my one desire shall be, That He who knows me best should choose for me. And so, whate'er His love sees good to send, I'll trust is best— because He knows the end.</span></p><img src="1889_cog_E_files/1889_cog_E-7.jpg" alt="" style="width:178pt;height:225pt;">

<p><span class="font8">,'O,” said the lawyer, “I shan’t press your claim 1i against that man ; you can get someone else to take <sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the case, or you can withdraw it, just as you please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There would probably be some money in it, but it would, as you know, come from the sale of the little (‘.Cri house the man occupies and calls ‘ home *; but I don’t want to meddle with the matter, anyhow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I suppose likely the old fellow begged to be let off ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ Well—yes, he did.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And you ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ I didn’t speak a word to him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ Oh, he did all the talking, did he ? What did you do ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">‘ I believe I shed a few tears ; he didn’t speak a word to me.” “ Well, may I respectfully inquire whom he did address in your hearing ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">” Almighty God. But, not for my benefit in the least. You see” — the lawyer crossed his right foot over his left knee, and began stroking his lower leg up and down, as if to help state his case concisely—“you see, I found the little house easily enough, and knocked on the outer door which stood ajar, but nobody heard me ; so I stepped into the little hall, and saw through the crack of another door just as cosy a sitting room as there ever was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ There, on a bed, with her silver head way up high on the pillows, was an old lady. I was on the point of knocking, when she said, as clearly as could be, ‘ Come, father, now begin ; I’m all ready’—and down on his knees by her side went an old white-haired man, still older than his wife, I should judge ; and I couldn’t have knocked then. He began to pray ; first he reminded God they were still his submissive children, mother and he, and no matter what He saw fit to bring upon them, they should’nt rebel at His will; of course ’twas going to be very hard for them to go out homeless in their old age, specially with poor mother, so sick and helpless, but still they’d seen sadder things than ever that would be. He reminded God, in the next place how different it might have been if only one of their boys had been spared them ; then his voice kind of broke, and a thin white hand stole from under the coverlet and moved softly over his snowy hair ; then he went, on to repeat that nothing could be so sharp again as the parting with those three sons</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">—unless mother and he should be separated. But at last he fell to comforting himself with the fact that the dear Lord knew it was through no fault of his own that mother and he were threatened with the loss of their dear little home, which meant beggary, in a place they prayed to be delivered from entering, if it could be consistent with God's will ; and then he fell to quoting a multitude of promises concerning the safety of those who pul their trust in the Lord. Yes, I should say he begged hard ; in fact, it was the most thrilling plea to which I ever listened ; and at last he prayed for God's blessing on those who were about to demand justice. ' The lawyer stroked his lower limb in silence for a moment or two, then he continued, more slowly than ever : “ And—I—believe—I’d rather go to the poorhouse myself, to-night, than to stain my heart and hands with the blood of such a prosecution as that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ You are afraid to defeat the old man's prayer ? ” queried the client.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ Bless your soul, man, you couldn’t defeat it!” He left it all subject to the will of God ; but he left no doubt as to his wishes in the matter ; claimed that we were told to make known our desires unto God, but of all the pleading I ever heard, that beat all. You see, I was taught that kind of thing in my childhood ; and, why I was sent to hear that prayer, I’m sure I don’t know ; but I hand the case over.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I wish,” said the client, twisting uneasily, ” you hadn’t told me about the old fellow’s prayer, because I want the money the place would bring ; but I was taught the Bible when I was a youngster, and I’d hate to run counter to such an harangue as that you tell me about. I wish you hadn’t heard a word of it , and another time I wouldn’t listen to petitions not intended for my ears.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The lawyer smiled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ My dear fellow,” he said, “ you’re wrong again ; it was intended for my ears, and yours, too, and God Almighty intended it. My old mother used to sing about God's moving in a mysterious way, I remember.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ Well, my mother used to sing about it too,” said the claimant, as he twisted his claim-papers in his fingers. “ You can call in the morning, if you like, and tell ‘ mother and him ’ the claim has been met.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ In a mysterious way,” added the lawyer, smiling.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">zi'HE beat of the day is over, the hour is growing late, V* And many weary pilgrims press through the city gate, Eager to find a lodging within its sheltering wall Ere the rapid sunset vanish and darkness reigns o’er all. Oh sight to glad the spirit ! Oh rest for weary eyes To see the lofty temple high o’er the city rise !</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In every Jewish household the solemn feast is spread. The Paschal moon has risen, her silver light is shed Over the glad Jerusalem, its temple grand and fair ; The presence of Jehovah seems round them everywhere ; And the dear Lord is among them, and many heed it not; He in a borrowed upper room, unheeded and forgot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He with His loved disciples, keepeth the feast with them ; The Lord of all is dwelling in great Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let us leave outside the city, in its shadows deep and dim, To rest awhile with Jesus and keep the feast with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">£HE artist lifts the curtain, we are with the Master now ; *4* We see the look of sadness upon His kingly brow. Surrounded by His loved ones, there, in that quiet place, Surprise, and fear, and sorrow are seen on every face. The evening lamp now lighted, from vaulted roof is hung, A gentle soothing radiance o’er all the group has flung ; Its sevenfold rays descending, a halo bright has shed, Falling in silvery beauty about the Master's head. The last rays of the sunset, beyond the open door, Reveal the faithful Marys, who gaze around with awe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ztHE servant of the good man, bearing the meal away : S' They all have heard the Master these words in anguish say “ One of you shall betray Me and as the accents fall, Those sad eyes full of sorrow, look round upon them all. “ One of you shall betray Me,”—we seem to hear them cry, Even the voice of Judas joins with them, “ Is it I ? ” Have they not learned the lesson, “ The greatest shall be least ” ? Has not that dear One cleansed them, with whom they kept the feast? And spoken words of comfort to all their company ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And now He tells them sorrowing, that “one betrayetn Me.” r^HE water and the pitcher, the towel, all are there—</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Has not that sad voice told them each other's griefs to share. The manna pot upon the pier, dear to each pious Jew, Telling of all those wanderings his fathers had passed through, That has a voice for you and me, saying—The bread of life For us was broken to sustain all through this earthly strife, The unleavened bread upon the board, the cup and dish we see, Bring back the words of love—“ Do this in memory of Me.” Beneath the arch upon the pier, upon the other hand, We see a fast expiring lamp, and then we understand That symbol that the Saviour's life will very soon be o’er, And in that borrowed upper room they will meet nevermore. The palm branch set aside we see, token sweet of victory That speaks of joyous Olivet, and not of Calvary ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Soon will those voices heard again join in the awful cry, Those glad hosannas all forgot for shouts of “ Crucify.” 7tXE know the awful story of suffering and pain ; vAJ Oh, let us shut the world outside and ponder it again. We know ere the morrow’s sunset will those gentle tones be stilled ; That form on which they’re gazing will a borrowed grave have filled ; That moon which lights the city will light up a cross of shame, And those who profess to love Him will fear to own His name ! The sun withhold its shining, and darkness all will shroud, And the voice now speaking sadly be lifted clear and loud;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And the mocking ones will hear it, “ Why hast Thou forsaken Me ? ” As that loving heart is broken on gloomy Calvary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ftxE’LL ne’er forget the picture, the Saviour's look of pain, CU We shall often think upon it, and ponder o’er again : That lesson that the artist has taught to you and me. The words the Lord is saying to that sad company Will come to us when all around is hurry, care, and din— A gentle warning, lifting us above this world of sin, Oh, let us ask His guidance, that even you and I May gather round Him in that land to praise eternally ; To be in those fair mansions where He has gone before, This world of change all left behind, and blest for evermore.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The youngest angel, Asmiel, stood alone Not glad, nor sad, but full of earnest thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And thus his tidings to the Master brought:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ Lord in the City Lupon I have found</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Three servants of thy holy name renowned</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Above their fellows. One is very wise With thoughts that ever range above the skies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">That make men glad to hear when he doth teach. And one, with no rare gift or grace endued,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Has won the people's love by doing good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With these three saints Lupon is trebly blest But, Lord, I fain would know who loves thee best ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">x£*HEN spoke the Lord of Angels, before whose look \i/ The hearts of all are like an open book, “In every soul, the secret thought I read And well I know who loves me best indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But every life has pages vacant still, Whereon a man may write the things he will ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Therefore I read in silence day by day, And wait for hearts untaught to learn my way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But thou shalt go to Lupon, to the three Who serve me there, and take this word from me, Tell each of them his Master bids him go Alone to Spirans huts across the snow. There he shall find a certain task for me, But what, I do not tel! to them nor thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Give them the message, make my word the test, And crown for me the one who answers best.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">ORTH WITH the angel obedient and elate, 1/ Passed the self-same hour through Lupon's gate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First to the temple door he made his way And there, because it was a huly day, He saw the folk by thousands thronging, stirred</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">By ardent thirst, to hear the preacher's word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then, while the echoes murmured Bernol's name, Through the aisles that hushed behind him Bernol came.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Strung to the highest pitch of conscious might, With lips prepared and firm and eyes alight, One moment at the pulpit steps he knelt</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In silent prayer, and on his shoulders felt</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The angel's hand :—“ The Master bids thee go Alone to Spirans huts across the snow,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To serve Him there.” Then, Bernol's hidden face Went white as death, and for about the space</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of ten slow heart-beats there was no reply,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Till Bernol looked around and whispered—“ Why ? ” But answer to his question came there none :</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The angel sighed, and with that sigh was gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">^</span><span class="font8">ITHIN the humble house, where Malvin spent His studious years, on holy things intent, Sweet stillness reigned, and there the angel found The saintly sage immersed in thought profound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Weaving with patient toil and willing care A web of wisdom, wonderful and rare ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">A beauteous robe for truth's great bridal meet, And needing but one more thread to be complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then Asmiel touched his hand and broke the thread Of fine spun thought, and very gently said,— The One of whom thou thinkest bids thee go Alone to Spirans huts across the snow</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To serve Him there.” With sorrow and surprise Malvin looked up. reluctance in his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The broken thought, the strangeness of the call, The perilous passage of the mountain wall Appalled him. With a doubtful brow</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He scanned the doubtful task and muttered—“How?” And Asmiel answered, as he turned to go, With sad disheartened voice : “ I do not know!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">OW as he went with fading hope to seek</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Z</span><span class="font8"> The third and last to whom God made him speak, Scarce twenty steps away whom should he meet But Fermor, hurrying cheerful down the street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">With ready heart that faced his work like play, And joyed to find it greater every day,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The angel stopped him with uplifted hand, And gave without delay, his Lord's command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“ He, whom thou servest, would'st have thee go Alone to Spiran's huts across the snow</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To serve Him there.” Ere Asmiel breathed again The eager answer leaped to meet him—“When ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The angel's face with inward joy grew bright, And all his figure glowed with heavenly light,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He took the golden circlet fron his brow</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And gave the crown to Fermor, answering—“Now ! ” For thou hast met the Master's hidden test,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">And I have found the man who loves Him best;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not thine, nor mine, to question or reply. When He commands us, asking ‘How?’ or ‘Why?’ ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">He knows the cause ; His ways are wise and just, Who serves the King, must serve with perfect trust.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Had there been no Garden of Eden, There had never been a fall, And if never a tree had blossomed God would have loved us all.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Hush, child I &quot;the father answered, &quot;By His decree man fell ,-</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">OME seventy years ago 1 was a fisher by the Sea of Galilee. It was at sunset. How the tranquil tide bathed dreamily the pebbles. How the light crept up the distant hills, and in its wake soft purple shadows wrapped the dewy fields ! And then HE came and called me. Then I gazed for the first time on that sweet face. Those eyes, out of which shone Divinity, looked on my inmost soul, and lighted it forever. Then His words broke on the silence of my heart. His love took hold of me and claimed me for its own. There in the twilight I followed, holding fast his mantle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Oh, what holy walks we had through harvest fields, and desolate dreary wastes ! Oftentimes He leaned upon my arm, wearied and worn : I was young and strong and so upbore Him. Lord, now I am</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font8">weak and old and feeble ! Let me rest on Thee ’ So, put Thine arm around me. Closer still ! How strong Thou art!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">0, my Lord, my Lord! How bright Thou art! and yet the very same I loved in Galilee. Tis worth the hundred years to feel this bliss ! So lift me up, dear Lord, unto Thy bosom. There shall I abide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The twilight, even now. draws on apace. Come, let us leave the noisy streets and take the path to Bethany ; for Mary's smile awaits us at the gate, and Martha's hands have prepared the cheerful evening meal. Come, James, the Master waits, and Peter, see, has gone some steps before !</span></p><img src="1889_cog_E_files/1889_cog_E-45.jpg" alt="" style="width:269pt;height:438pt;">

<p><span class="font8">What say you, friends ? that Christ has gone to His Heavenly home ! Ay, ’tis so, ’tis so, I know it all ; and yet, once more I seemed to stand upon my native hills with the Master as of old. 0, how oft I’ve seen Him bring back strength to palsied limbs I I feel He has to mine. Up ! bear me once more tn my flock ! Once more let me tell of our Saviour's love ; for by the sweetness of the Master's voice just now, I think He must be very near. Coming perhaps to break the veil which time has worn so thin that I can almost see beyond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">How dark it is ! I cannot see the faces of my flock. Is that the sea that murmurs so, or—is it weeping? Hush, my children. God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son : So, love ye one another. Love God and man. Amen. Now bear me back. Why call ye me the Holy John ? Nay, call me rather, Jesus Christ's beloved, and lover of my children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Lay me down once more upon my couch, and open wide the eastern window. See, there comes a light like that which broke upon my soul at eve, when in the dreary isle of Patmos, Gabriel came and touched me. See, it grows I and hark ! How sweet that song the ransomed sing. Glory to the Lamb ! How loud it sounds ! Methinks my soul can join it now.</span></p>
