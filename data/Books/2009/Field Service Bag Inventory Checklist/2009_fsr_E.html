<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Meetings for Field Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Jesus set the example of caring for the Kingdom-preaching work in an organized and efficient manner. Likewise today, those responsible for this worldwide Kingdom-preaching campaign are very desirous of seeing this work cared for in like manner. In harmony with this endeavor, congregations worldwide use meetings for field service as one way to organize groups of Kingdom preachers for the field service.—Matt. 24:45-47; 25:21; Luke 10:1-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> A Fine Arrangement: </span><span class="font12">Meetings for field service are designed to provide encouragement, practical instruction, and direction for those about to go out in the field ministry. The daily text may be briefly discussed when clearly applicable to the field ministry. At times, reminders from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book, or perhaps the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font12"> book are called to mind in order to prepare all present for the work that day. A brief demonstration regarding a publication being offered may also be presented. Before the concluding prayer, all should know with whom they will be working in the ministry and where the territory to be worked is located. Shortly after this meeting of no more than 15 minutes, all should be on their way to the territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> How Are They Organized? </span><span class="font12">The service overseer, taking the lead, is responsible for the coordination of meetings for field service. Group overseers, or their assistants, are responsible for accompanying their respective field service groups on the weekends. Some overseers or ministerial servants may be able to accompany service groups midweek. Group overseers work closely with the service overseer so as to have sufficient territory for their group to work from house to house on the weekends. During the week, the service overseer will supervise the arrangements for those who will take the groups out for field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Where and When Should These Meetings Be Held? </span><span class="font12">Rather than having the entire congregation meet in one location, it is generally best for these meetings to be held in convenient locations, usually private homes, throughout the territory with the intent of working the congregation’s territory effectively. Kingdom Halls may also be used for this purpose. Many congregations use the Kingdom Hall to hold a meeting for service shortly following their Sunday public talk and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study. Effort should be made to minimize the amount of travel to the territory. Therefore, arrangements can be reviewed periodically to ensure that the current locations continue to be appropriate for working the territory efficiently and completely.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The best time for these meetings to be held and how many times they should be conducted throughout the week depend on the makeup of the territory. The following questions may serve as a guide to determine where and when meetings for field service can best be held.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> What territory needs further attention? What is the best time to work from house to house? Should a time in the evening be scheduled for house-to-house work or to make return visits? All field service arrangements should be placed on the congregation information board. It is the desire of all Kingdom publishers to cover their assigned territory thoroughly to such a degree that we too may say as did the apostle Paul: “I no longer have untouched territory.”—Rom. 15:23.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Conducting Meetings for Field Service: </span><span class="font12">The one assigned to care for this meeting shows deep respect for this theocratic arrangement by preparing well. These meetings should start on time and should be instructive and brief, between 10 and 15 minutes. The conductor should have territory for the group to work before the meeting is started. Although it is not necessary to wait for latecomers after the meeting for field service has ended, leaving a message about where the group will be working can be helpful. All should be on their way to the assigned territory shortly after</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">the meeting has finished. A well-organized and instructive meeting for field service will no doubt provide the necessary direction for all present to carry out their ministry that day.—Prov. 11:14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Attending Meetings for Field Service: </span><span class="font12">Cooperation is essential. (Heb. 13:17) When possible, the one organizing the group will assist any who need someone to work with. It is good for experienced publishers to be present so as to be helpful in caring for newer and less experienced publishers. Those willing to be assigned to work with someone different, on occasion, may be able to accomplish much good. (Prov. 27:17; Rom. 15:1, 2) All should make a concerted effort to be punctual. Our respect for this theocratic arrangement and consideration for our fellow workers will move us to make the necessary adjustments in this regard.—2 Cor. 6:3, 4; Phil. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Pioneer Support: </span><span class="font12">Pioneer support at meetings for field service is valuable and encouraging to all. Understandably, pioneers have many responsibilities. Aside from conducting Bible studies and making return visits, their daily schedule may include caring for family responsibilities and secular employment. Thus, pioneers should not feel required to support every meeting for field service organized by the congregation, especially if such are held each day. However, it will likely be possible for pioneers to support at least some meetings for service each week. To some degree, meetings for field service are a training ground, and the spiritual background and experience of the pioneers can be of great assistance to others. Their constant exposure to the field ministry has allowed them to gain experience in the ministry. This can be shared. Their zealous participation in the ministry and at meetings for field service has made them an example to imitate. And their participation at these meetings for service is very much appreciated.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> As was the case with Jesus and his disciples, a large part of our Kingdom-preaching work is accomplished by witnessing from house to house. Meetings for field service are for the purpose of mutual encouragement and effective participation in this work. All publishers of the good news should be supporters of such theocratic arrangements to the extent possible. (Acts 5:42; 20:20) May all of us give wholehearted support to this endeavor. By so doing, we can be sure of having Jehovah’s rich blessing and can make the heart of our Leader, Jesus Christ, rejoice as we preach the good news of God’s Kingdom.—Matt. 25:34-40; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Effective meetings for field service provide real encouragement and practical instruction before we go in the ministry. They enable us to share in group witnessing so that we can work along with others for mutual support and training. (Prov. 27:17; Eccl. 4:9, 10) What can we do to benefit fully from these meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Conductor: </span><span class="font6">Specific information to be considered at these meetings is not normally outlined in advance. Therefore, good preparation is needed if you will be conducting. Do not automatically plan to consider the daily text, though you may choose to include it in the discussion if it directly relates to the ministry. Think about what will provide practical help for those witnessing that day. For example, you may want to discuss or demonstrate a presentation. You might choose to review something from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning </span><span class="font6">book, the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Ministry School</span><span class="font6"> book, or a recent Service Meeting part. At other times, you might consider how to deal with a challenge that may arise in your territory, or you might discuss how to cultivate interest and start Bible studies, especially if many will be making return visits. Regardless of what is considered, be enthusiastic and positive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Start the meeting on time, even if you know that some will be late. Use good judgment in organizing the groups, and provide territory to those who need it. The length of the meeting should be no more than 10 to 15 minutes and shorter if it follows a congregation meeting. Before you end the meeting, all should know with whom and where they are going to work. The meeting should be concluded with prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> You Can Help: </span><span class="font6">As with congregation meetings, we show respect for Jehovah and consideration for others by arriving on time. Participate in the discussion. You may let the conductor assign you to work with someone, or you may choose to make your own arrangements in advance of the meeting. If you prefer to make your own arrangements, endeavor to “widen out” by working with a variety of publishers, rather than working with close friends each time. (2 Cor. 6:11-13) Once the meeting has concluded, avoid changing the arrangements, and depart promptly for the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> The purpose of meetings for field service is the same as that of congregation meetings. They are arranged so that we can “consider one another to incite to love and fine works.” (Heb. 10:24, 25) If we strive to benefit from these meetings, we will be helped to carry out our ministry—a fine work’ indeed!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Good Use of Our Publications</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> After Jesus miraculously fed a large crowd, he arranged for the leftover food to be saved. (Matt. 14:19-21) Such appreciation for Jehovah’s provisions sets a fine example for us to "show ourselves thankful" by making good use of all that Jehovah provides through “the faithful steward.”—Col. 3:15; Luke 12:42; Matt. 24:45-47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Magazines: </span><span class="font6">Magazines can easily accumulate. If we regularly have leftover magazines, we should reduce the number that we request. What about older magazines? These do not lose their value with the passage of time. If we have an accumulation of older magazines, perhaps the service overseer or another elder can assist us to find effective ways to place them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Other Literature: </span><span class="font6">When the offer changes to a different publication, first check to see if you already have field service copies of the publication at home before obtaining additional copies of the literature at the Kingdom Hall. Be mindful of getting copies only as needed for the week, and return to the counter for more after those are placed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> As for publications for personal use, request only what you actually need. Write your name in the space provided. That will help you keep track of your personal copy. If you use the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower Library</span><span class="font6"> on CD-ROM and have saved your personal copies of the magazines, you may not feel a need to request personal copies of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> bound volumes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Placement of Publications: </span><span class="font6">We strive to place our publications only with those who show genuine interest. Keep in mind that we are the ones primarily responsible for the financial coverage of these valuable tools in our ministry. When leaving a publication with interested ones, do not hesitate to inform them of the privilege they have to support the worldwide work with their donation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Jesus miraculously provided physical food for others, but more often he fed people spiritually. Jesus said: “Man must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah’s mouth.” (Matt. 4:4) Our publications teach Bible truths vital for gaining everlasting life. (John 17:3) They are far too valuable to waste!</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Our Literature Wisely</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Our organized use of literature began with distribution of 6,000 copies of the July 1, 1879, issue of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> magazine. Since then, a great variety of literature items have been printed and distributed in vast quantities.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">THE COMPLETE-DONATION ARRANGEMENT</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> At the end of February 1990, it was explained that magazines and literature will be provided to publishers and to the interested public on a complete donation basis, that is, without asking or suggesting that a specific contribution be made as a precondition to receiving an item. When literature is offered, voluntary donations will be accepted to support the worldwide work of publishing the good news. We have faith that Jehovah will bless this arrangement.—Compare Matthew 6:33.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">HANDLING SITUATIONS IN THE FIELD</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> We will continue to use Topics for Conversation to stimulate interest. Where no interest is shown, there is no need to offer the literature. We do not want to waste any of our literature by offering it to those with no interest. On the other hand, where interest is shown and the householder agrees to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">read the literature,</span><span class="font13"> it may be offered. We want to use our literature wisely.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The following are some remarks you might make after showing the literature: “If you would enjoy reading this publication, I would be happy to leave it with you.” Likely the householder will ask: “How much does it cost?” You could reply: “We are not engaged in a commercial work. We are not selling this literature. The work we are doing in your neighborhood today is being done voluntarily in 212 lands around the world to help people learn the way to everlasting life. If you would care to make a donation toward this work, I would be glad to accept it.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> When offering the magazines, you could raise questions about a specific article and then say: “I would like you to note the details in this article. If you would like to read these two magazines, I would be happy to leave them with you.” If they are accepted, you could add: “I am glad to be able to make this information available to you. I think you will find the subject truly informative. In fact, I would like to come back next week to get your viewpoint. You will note that </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> is published in 107 languages and distributed in nearly 14,000,000 copies around the world. This work is all supported by voluntary donations. If you also care to make a small donation toward this educational work, we will be happy to accept it.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> In some cases, the subject of donations for our worldwide work may be awkward to discuss. For example, an interested householder may ask: “Are you giving it away?” We might reply: “If you</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">want to read the publication and would like to have it, yes, it’s yours. I would like to stop by next week to discuss what we have talked about and to tell you more about our worldwide work.” On subsequent visits the householder may be informed as to how our work is financed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Or the householder may immediately accept the literature and reply, “Thank you.” You could respond by saying: “You are welcome. I know you will enjoy it. Many wonder how this work is financed, since we do it worldwide. Many who accept our publications have expressed appreciation for what they will learn and have volunteered a small donation to make further distribution possible. If people do that, we are pleased to accept it.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">IS THERE GENUINE INTEREST?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> It is obviously not our purpose to distribute literature at random. We want the literature to achieve its intended purpose, namely, to help sincere people learn more about Jehovah’s marvelous purposes. It could be wasteful to leave literature with individuals who have no appreciation for spiritual things. (Heb. 12:16) Productive distribution of literature depends upon your ability to identify genuine interest. How might such interest be shown? A kindly willingness to converse with you is a good sign. Or paying attention while you speak, responding to questions, and expressing an opinion indicate involvement in the discussion. Speaking to you in a respectful, neighborly manner suggests a kindly disposition. Following along as you read from the Bible implies a respect for God’s Word. Often, it is helpful to ask if they would read the literature being offered. Also, you might suggest a return visit to continue the conversation. A positive response is further evidence of their interest. When you observe such evidences of sincere interest, likely the individual will make good use of any literature received.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> This adjustment in our method of work provides further evidence that “we are not peddlers of the word of God.” (2 Cor. 2:17) It also proves we are separate from the world.—John 17:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> With the destruction of Babylon the Great drawing near, there are growing pressures against all religious elements. Our main concern is that the vital worldwide Kingdom-preaching work continues to move ahead without hindrance, bringing many more to salvation.—Matt. 24:14; Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> In many areas it is becoming increasingly difficult to find people at home. In these “critical times,” many are forced to work long hours just to make ends meet. (2 Tim. 3:1) Some may be away from home spending money or engaging in recreation. How can we reach such ones with the good news?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Keep Good Records: </span><span class="font12">The first step is to make note of those who are not at home. This is especially important if you work your territory frequently. Do you make note of the name of the street, the territory number, your name, and the date? You may leave room for making additional notes when you or another publisher returns to work the not-at-homes. At the end of the witnessing period, remember to give the record or notes to the person who has the territory, unless he agrees for you to work the not-at-homes. Use a separate sheet to record any interest found that you will care for.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Try at a Different Time: </span><span class="font12">Perhaps some who were not at home during the workday may be home in the evening or on weekends. Could you arrange your schedule to go back at a more opportune time? (1 Cor. 10:24) If not, you may be able to give the not-at-homes to a publisher who can go back at a different time. Otherwise, you might write to those who were not at home or try to reach them by telephone. Publishers whose health problems limit their share in the door-to-door work may be happy to assist you with this.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> One case illustrates the importance of trying to contact those who are not at home. After publishers repeatedly called at one home for three years, the householder was eventually contacted. It turned out that she had been waiting all that time for a Witness to come by in order to resume the Bible study that she had before moving to that area.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Complete the Territory: </span><span class="font12">When is a territory considered completed? Generally, this is when reasonable efforts have been made to contact someone at each home. It may be appropriate to leave a tract or an older magazine discreetly at the not-at-homes, especially in territories that are worked infrequently. The territory should be completed within four months. Then it should be checked in so that the territory servant can update his records.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We want as many people as possible to have an opportunity to learn to call on the name of Jehovah and be saved. (Rom. 10:13, 14) This includes those who happen to be away from their home when we call from house to house. Like the apostle Paul, make it your desire “to bear thorough witness to the good news of the undeserved kindness of God.”—Acts 20:24.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> There is certainly much to be accomplished in our ministry, and the time left is reduced. (John 4:35; 1 Cor. 7:29) With good organization and advance planning, we can make the most of the time we have scheduled for the ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Prepared: </span><span class="font12">Before going to the meeting for field service, make sure that you have the literature you will need and have your presentation well in mind. After the meeting is closed with prayer, go directly into the field. This will allow you and those working with you to accomplish as much as possible in the time available for field service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> If you are assigned to conduct the meeting for field service, begin on time. Keep the meeting brief—no more than 10 to 15 minutes. Before you dismiss the group, make sure that each one knows where and with whom he is going to work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> While in the Ministry: </span><span class="font12">Once the meeting for field service ends, do not linger unnecessarily, but begin making your way to the territory. If you anticipate having to leave the territory early, perhaps you can arrange for your own transportation so that the rest of the group does not have to leave early. When working with a group, be considerate of the others who may be waiting for you to finish a discussion. That could involve withdrawing tactfully from a person who is argumentative or arranging to call back on one who is interested.—Matt. 10:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> When making return visits, you can avoid unnecessary travel by caring for calls in one neighborhood before going to another. It may be possible to telephone certain individuals to make sure that they will be home. (Prov. 21:5) If you anticipate a lengthy visit, arrangements can be made for those in your group to preach nearby or to make another return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We are living in the time of a great spiritual harvest. (Matt. 9:37, 38) Soon the work will end. Therefore, our desire should be to make good use of our time while in the ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Your Time Count</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Everyone has the same amount of time at his disposal each week. The portion that we devote to spreading the good news is especially valuable because it is time spent in a life-saving work. (Rom. 1:16) We show our appreciation for this by preparing well for the service planned, arriving at meetings for service on time, and leaving promptly for the territory. We would rather be preaching than waiting. Since Jehovah has taught us that “for everything there is an appointed time,” we need to make the time that we have set aside for the ministry really count.—Eccl. 3:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Manage Your Time Wisely: </span><span class="font13">Many blessings come to us when we steadfastly hold to a schedule that allows for regular participation in the field ministry. Naturally, the good results that we achieve in the ministry should be proportionate to the amount of time spent in the service. With some slight adjustments to our routine, could we devote more time to the field service? For example, after magazine activity on Saturday, could we take some additional time to make a few return visits? If we have been in the field ministry for a while on Sunday, could we spend some time also making return visits or conducting a Bible study? Would it be possible to supplement our house-to-house activity with some street witnessing? In these or other ways, we may be able to improve in our service.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> When we are out in the ministry, we can lose valuable time if we are not careful. Of course, when weather conditions are severe, a short break will refresh us and help us to keep going. Be balanced, however, since such breaks may not always be necessary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> In recent years it has become increasingly difficult to find people at home. To cope with this situation, many publishers do their door-to-door witnessing at a different time of day. Why not try witnessing in the late afternoon or early evening?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> It is better if we do not visit with one another while engaging in street work. Instead, stand apart from one another and approach the people so as to start conversations with them. Thus time will be managed more effectively and greater joy will be derived from the work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Seize Opportunities to Witness: </span><span class="font13">When a householder said that she was not interested, a Witness asked if there was anyone else in the house with whom she might talk. This led to a conversation with the man of the house, who had been ill for many years and was largely confined to bed. The hope set out in God’s Word renewed his interest in life. He was soon out of bed, attending meetings at the Kingdom Hall, and sharing his newfound hope with others!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> A teenage sister applied the suggestion to engage in field service during the hour before the Congregation Book Study. At her first door, she met a 13-year-old girl who listened intently and took literature. The next day at school, the young sister saw this same girl. Soon thereafter, she offered to study the Bible with her, and the girl accepted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Make It Quality Time: </span><span class="font13">Having a regular share in field service helps us develop our skills in presenting the good news. Can you improve your ability to start a conversation at the door by using a more effective introduction? Could you become a more skillful teacher when conducting a home Bible study? By doing so, you can truly make your time in the service count and make your ministry more productive.—1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> Since “the time left is reduced,” our lives should be filled with Christian works. (1 Cor. 7:29) Allotting time for the preaching activity should be high on our list of priorities. Let us have a healthy, zealous share in the ministry. Time is a wonderful asset that Jehovah has given us. Always use it wisely and make it count.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">[Box on page 4]</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Consider These Suggestions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Arrive at meetings for service on time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Within reason, keep witnessing groups small.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Avoid delays in getting to the territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Work territory when most people are at home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Work alone at times if it is safe to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Make return visits nearest to the door-to-door territory.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Keep busy in service when others in the group are delayed at a door.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Whenever possible, depending on circumstances, stay out longer than an hour.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Simplicity Is Best</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Why do young publishers often hold the attention of those with whom they share the Kingdom message? One reason is that their expressions are simple. Some publishers may feel that to witness effectively requires an eloquent presentation. However, experience shows that a simple and clear presentation is the best.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God in a simple, straightforward manner and trained his disciples to do the same. (Matt. 4:17; 10:5-7; Luke 10:1, 9) He used uncomplicated introductions, questions, and illustrations to capture the attention of his listeners and reach their hearts. (John 4:7-14) We do well to imitate his example and give presentations that are easily understood.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The “good news of the kingdom” is the message we are to proclaim. (Matt. 24:14) Using the Kingdom as your basic theme will help keep your presentation simple. Speak of things that concern your listeners. Women are often more interested in their family than in political subjects. Of immediate concern to a father are his employment and his family’s safety. Young people are interested in their future; older people, in better health and their security. People are usually more concerned about local events than what happens in distant lands. After conversing about matters of common interest, direct attention to the blessings that obedient mankind will enjoy under God’s Kingdom rule. A few simple, well-chosen words combined with a scripture can be the best means to stir your listener’s interest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You might start a conversation by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “No doubt you agree that mankind is plagued with many incurable diseases. But did you know that God has promised he will soon eliminate all forms of sickness, as well as death?” Allow for a response, and then read Revelation 21:3, 4.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> With clear and simple presentations, may you reach the minds and hearts of more people in your territory, aiding them to learn about Jehovah and the prospect of enjoying everlasting life.— John 17:3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark106"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">*** km 7/99 p. 4 Let’s “Get to the Point!” ***</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Let’s “Get to the Point!”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Have you ever had a householder interrupt your carefully prepared presentation with the words: “What do you want? Get to the point!” What can we learn from such an experience?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Many people today are impatient. They want to know who we are and why we are there. When they find out that the purpose of our visit is to discuss the Bible, they may close their minds. Bible reading and spiritual conversations are not important things in the lives of many people. How can we convince such householders that they should take a few minutes to discuss a Bible topic with us?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> What Works Best: </span><span class="font13">The key is to show the householder that the Bible provides practical solutions for the problems that concern him and to do so in as few words as possible. The most effective presentations feature a specific question designed to make the householder think, followed by a scripture that answers the question. You may enjoy trying some of the following suggestions. They are designed to help us “get to the point” quickly while arousing the interest of the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> In territory where people often say that they are not interested, raise a question that involves them personally:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “As we approach the next millennium, do you feel hopeful or doubtful? [Allow for response.] The Bible predicted the unsettling events we see today as well as their outcome.” Read 2 Timothy 3:1, 2, 5 and Proverbs 2:21, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “There is much concern in this country about health care. Did you know that God promises that he will permanently solve all health problems?” Read Revelation 21:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “How do you think our community would benefit if everyone who lives here applied Bible principles?” Read Matthew 22:37-39.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> Since our commission is to preach the good news of the Kingdom, whenever possible we should call attention to what the Kingdom will accomplish. You might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “Did you know that the world’s oldest book, the Bible, foretold that there will be one government for the whole world?” Read Daniel 2:44.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “What do you think conditions would be like if Jesus Christ ruled the earth?” Read Psalm 72:7, 8.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> In territory where people are religious, you could try one of these introductions:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “Many people suffer discrimination because of their gender, religion, or skin color. How do you think God feels about such prejudice?” Read Acts 10:34, 35.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “We know that Jesus Christ performed many miracles in his day. If you could ask him to perform one more miracle, what would it be?” Read Psalm 72:12-14, 16.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> If the householder is reluctant to open the door, you might start a conversation by saying:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “Most people today are tired of hearing about problems. They want to hear about solutions. No doubt that is true of you. But where can we find real solutions to our problems?” Allow for response. Read 2 Timothy 3:16, 17.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Why Not Try It? </span><span class="font13">Oftentimes a simple, concise question is all that is needed to arouse a householder’s interest. One woman who was formerly opposed invited two sisters into her home after one of them asked the question: “Can you identify the Kingdom that you pray for in the Lord’s Prayer?” The woman was intrigued by the question, and she accepted a Bible study. She is now a dedicated servant of Jehovah!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup> When you are speaking to a householder, be genuine with your expressions. Speak from your heart. People are more likely to respond favorably when they are convinced that we are truly interested in them.—Acts 2:46, 47.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> The work of preaching the good news is a challenge today. Some householders are suspicious of strangers. Others lead hectic lives and have little time to spare. Yet, we can be sure that there are still many deserving ones to be found. (Matt. 10:11) Our efforts to search for them are likely to be more successful if we keep our presentations brief and “get to the point!”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Create Opportunities to Preach</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The Christian congregation is made up of people with a wide variety of circumstances. Yet, we are united in our determination to praise Jehovah. (Ps. 79:13) If poor health or other challenging circumstances limit our share in proclaiming the good news, how can we create opportunities to preach?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> In Daily Activities: </span><span class="font13">Jesus took advantage of his everyday dealings with people to give a witness. He spoke to Matthew while passing a tax office, to Zacchaeus while traveling, and to a Samaritan woman while resting. (Matt. 9:9; Luke 19:1-5; John 4:6-10) In our daily activities, we too can turn an ordinary conversation into a witness. Having a Bible handy, along with tracts or brochures, will encourage us to be ready to speak about our hope.—1 Pet. 3:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Does impaired mobility limit your participation in the door-to-door work? Be alert to opportunities to witness to visiting medical personnel and others with whom you come in contact. (Acts 28:30, 31) If circumstances often keep you at home, have you tried witnessing by telephone or by letter? One sister regularly writes to non-Witness family members. She includes encouraging thoughts from the Bible and experiences she has had while witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> At Work or School: </span><span class="font13">Our desire to praise Jehovah will also move us to create opportunities to plant seeds of truth at work or school. An eight-year-old publisher shared with his class what he read in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> about the moon. After learning where he got the information, his teacher began accepting </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> on a regular basis. At the workplace, our simply keeping a copy of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book where others can see it may prompt questions and lead to a witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Can you think of ways to create opportunities to preach in your daily activities? By making the most of our circumstances, may we strive each day to “offer to God a sacrifice of praise.”—Heb. 13:15.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Sharing Successfully in Our Lifesaving Ministry</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> The apostle Paul adapted his presentation of the good news that he “might by all means save some.” (1 Cor. 9:19-23) Likewise, we will be more successful in our ministry if we are alert to discern the householder’s interests and are prepared to adapt our discussion to his needs. This should not be difficult when offering </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> or one of our brochures.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> After introducing yourself, you might begin by saying in your own words something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Many people despair at the apparent inability of world governments to provide workable solutions to the problems of our times. Some even blame the governments for their problems. Do you think there could be a government able to care adequately for all our needs? [Allow for response.] Do you know we have a reliable promise of a government that will definitely do away with all the problems we face?” Listen carefully to the householder’s answer. Depending on what he says, be ready to branch off into one of several different presentations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> If there is an indication in the householder’s comments that he professes to be Christian, we could then ask if he prays the “Our Father,” or Lord’s Prayer. If he answers in the affirmative, we could recite the model prayer to the point where it says, “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matt. 6:9, 10) This proves that someday Jehovah’s will is going to be done here on earth. Reference can then be made to an appropriate article in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font6"> or to a brochure that follows through on this thought, such as page 3 of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Government That Will Bring Paradise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> If the householder evidences no faith in God, you could refer to Hebrews 3:4 and then turn to page 4 of the brochure </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?</span><span class="font6"> Read paragraphs 1 and 2 and ask the question listed at the bottom of the page. Or you could tie in appropriate material from a current magazine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> If the householder appears satisfied with his lot in life, you could raise the question:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Why should we seriously consider what the Bible says about the future of government?” Then we could use the information found in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font6"> book on pages 154 and 155, mentioning briefly one or more of the eight reasons provided therein. If the householder demonstrates interest, use the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?,</span><span class="font6"> beginning with the first paragraph on page 2, to further the conversation.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Your initial call will not be entirely successful if you do not whet the appetite of the householder for another visit. Therefore, be certain to ask an interesting question and promise to answer it when you return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> From the material above, select what you feel comfortable in saying. Adjust these suggestions to fit your territory. Become familiar with the brochures, tracts, and magazine articles you are going to use so that you can quickly adapt your discussion to the needs of the householder. May we all prepare our presentations diligently “for the sake of the good news” and thus share successfully in this lifesaving ministry.—1 Cor. 9:23.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Praise Jehovah Each Day</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> King David expressed his determination to praise Jehovah “all day long,” even to time indefinite. (Ps. 145:2, 7, 21) We too have good reason to praise Jehovah each day.—Ps. 37:10; 145:14, 18; 2 Pet. 3:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> In Our Home: </span><span class="font13">We have upbuilding printed material for meaningful spiritual discussions when considering the daily text, when enjoying Family Worship, and when preparing for congregation meetings. Many families make a practice of being together for at least one meal each day. That allows for unhurried, relaxed conversation and offers opportunities to praise Jehovah. Such informal discussions initiated by parents can be an important aid in bringing up their children in “the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah.”—Eph. 6:4; Deut. 6:5-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> With Our Brothers: </span><span class="font13">When in field service or at congregation meetings, we have excellent opportunities to praise Jehovah alongside fellow believers. (Prov. 15:30; Phil. 4:8; Heb. 13:15) Since we hold our love for Jehovah in common, it should be easy to include sincere expressions of appreciation for Jehovah’s goodness when talking with one another.—Ps. 106:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> When Speaking to Unbelievers: </span><span class="font13">Although circumstances may not allow us to share in the public ministry each day, speaking even briefly to workmates, schoolmates, and others around us about Jehovah and his purposes can instill hope in honesthearted people. (Ps. 27:14; 1 Pet. 3:15) While traveling on an airplane, a sister was able to witness to a fellow passenger who felt so comforted and encouraged by what she heard that she gave the sister her address and phone number so that they could keep in contact with each other. As the world suffers from deepening trouble and worsening conditions, Jehovah’s people continue to bring to those with listening ears “good news of something better.” This offers others hope and causes them to praise Jehovah.— Isa. 52:7; Rom. 15:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> How it must please Jehovah to hear his servants praising him each day! As with Jehovah’s visible creation that surrounds us, we too can bubble forth his praises each day in our homes, in the congregation, and when speaking with others who as yet have not become fellow praisers of Jehovah.—Ps. 19:1-4.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Can You Extend a Helping Hand?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah is always looking for ways to extend a helping hand to his loyal servants. (2 Chron. 16:9; Isa. 41:10, 13) Likening him to a caring shepherd, Isaiah wrote: “With his arm he will collect together the lambs; and in his bosom he will carry them. Those giving suck he will conduct with care.” (Isa. 40:11) Consider some ways in which we can imitate Jehovah’s loving concern.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Reach Out to New Ones: </span><span class="font13">We can extend a helping hand by inviting new ones to enjoy upbuilding association with us. (Prov. 13:20) Recalling how others reached out to him when he began associating with the congregation, one brother said: “On several occasions, a family included me in their family study. As I progressed, a young pioneer couple regularly invited me to join them for full days in the ministry. We always had great spiritual conversations.” He added: “Before becoming a Christian, I used to go out on Friday and Saturday nights. But the time I spent with the brothers filled my need for association.” The loving interest of the congregation helped this brother to become well rooted and stabilized in the faith, and he now serves as a member of the Bethel family.—Col. 2:6, 7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Build One Another Up: </span><span class="font13">We may discern an opportunity to extend a helping hand when our brothers face challenging circumstances. Could you arrange to do telephone witnessing with an infirm publisher or invite him to accompany you on a Bible study, perhaps even bringing the student to his home? Might a parent with small children appreciate a helping hand when sharing in the ministry? Are there timid ones who would welcome your assistance when making return visits or when engaging in some other facet of the ministry? Loving interest in our brothers will move us to look for ways to build them up.—Rom. 14:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> As we imitate Jehovah’s tender concern for his servants, we strengthen one another, help draw the congregation together in love, and glorify our heavenly Father.—Eph. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark108"></a>Introductions to Get Householders to Listen</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">1</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What is the most important part of your house-to-house presentation? Most of us would agree that it is the introduction. If you are unsuccessful in arousing the householder’s interest within the first 30 seconds or so, he will probably terminate the conversation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> What factors should you consider in preparing an effective introduction? Analyze the customs and needs of the people you are likely to meet. Is it customary to exchange pleasantries, or will you be expected to come quickly to the point? Are there many young couples in your area? What are their concerns? Are people in your neighborhood conscious of problems facing mankind in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might get them to listen by saying something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Good morning. My name is--------. I’m bothered when I read about people starving and being killed in wars. Are</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">you?” Other questions that may help start a conversation are: “What is the solution to the world’s problems?” “Do you think anyone can rid the earth of today’s problems?” “Suppose a ruler had qualifications like these mentioned at Isaiah 9:6, 7? [Read and comment on scripture.]”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> In some territories, people may show greater concern for their home and family than for global matters such as world peace.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might arouse interest by asking:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “What kind of life do you see for yourself and your family in ten years? The Bible’s view of the future is most encouraging because it foretells the coming of a ruler who will govern by perfect standards. Notice what Isaiah 9:6, 7 says about him.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Do you live in an area where crime and safety are the topic of the day? Some may lend a hearing ear if you use the first introduction under “Crime/Safety” on page 10 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Hello. We’re talking with folks about the matter of personal safety. There is a lot of crime around us, and it affects our lives.” Then a question such as “What is the solution?” or “Do you think anyone can rid the earth of these problems?” or “What if a ruler had qualifications like these?” may help start a conversation. You could then read Isaiah 9:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> All of us, including young people of school age, can use these simple one-scripture presentations. In fact, you may wish to try one when offering magazines. Remember, our goal is to assess the extent of the householder’s interest before offering literature. Do you not agree that such a Scriptural presentation would be a fine way to discern whether our listener manifests genuine interest? We are sure that many will enjoy using these presentations during January, both when offering magazines and when presenting the regular offer for the month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> If you make effective use of the first 30 seconds of your visit, both by your demeanor and by your introduction, you will likely achieve the important goal of getting householders to listen.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Presentations That Get a Response</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Presentations that get a response are those that clearly show how the subject concerns the householder, that it is something he needs or can use. Throughout your conversation, help the householder to realize, “This involves me.” In preparing a presentation, we should ask ourselves: „What subjects are of greatest concern to people in my territory? What are their needs? How can I present the message to show that Jehovah has their needs in mind?’ Listed below are a few things that are of vital interest to people today. Can you use one of these or something similar in your presentation? Note also how points from the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book can be tied in.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Concern About Lack of Happiness: </span><span class="font6">“We are speaking with people who are truly concerned with the quality of life in our community. Although people may have material necessities, many are not really happy with their lot in life. Do you think it is possible to have a truly happy life? [Allow for reply.] One of the keys to happiness is found in the Bible at Revelation 1:3. [Read.] Understanding what Revelation says about the future can bring you happiness. Note just one of its prophecies.” Read Revelation 21:3, 4 and then point to the illustration on page 302 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Concern About the Future: </span><span class="font6">“We are endeavoring to share with our neighbors a positive view of the future. Is that the way you try to look at life? [Allow for reply.] According to the Bible, we have reason to be optimistic if we do what it says at Revelation 1:3.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Concern About Maintaining Good Health: </span><span class="font6">“Many in our neighborhood are conscious of maintaining good health. Despite the precautions we take, however, we still suffer from sickness. Would you like to live in a world where everyone would enjoy perfect health and vitality? As unbelievable as this might seem, the Bible book of Revelation speaks of such a time and tells us that it is in the near future.” Read Revelation 21:3, 4. You could then point out the picture on pages 308-9 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book, showing how people will partake of the provisions for life during Christ’s Thousand Year Reign.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Concern About Pollution and the Environment: </span><span class="font6">“In speaking with our neighbors, we have found that many are concerned about how our air, water, and food are being polluted. Do you think that the governments will ever be able to put a stop to this? [Allow for comment.] It is encouraging to note what the Bible says will happen to those who are ruining the earth.” Read Revelation 11:18b. Point out that besides removing those ruining the earth, it is God’s purpose for the meek ones to make the earth a paradise, as indicated at Psalm 37:10, 11 or Isaiah 65:21, 22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> For Those Religiously Inclined: </span><span class="font6">“We are asking our neighbors a question: Do you think the book of Revelation was meant to be understood, or was it always to remain a mystery? [Allow for comment.] Many share your view. Notice what the Bible itself says at Revelation 1:3.”</span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> We should always display a warm, personal interest in the people we meet in the field ministry.

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ “In this modern, scientific world, is it reasonable to believe there is a God who created us and this beautiful earth on which we live? [Allow for response.] When we consider the vastness and wonders of the earth and the entire universe, we are impressed with its order and design. Does this not testify to the existence of a Creator? Notice the Bible’s reasoning on this matter. [Read Hebrews 3:4.] Logically, every building had a designer and builder. [Take out the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font12"> book and turn to the illustration on page 114.] Our universe is awe inspiring! Do you think it could have come into existence by itself?” Then turn to page 122 and read the caption below the picture of a watch. The illustration and scripture quoted on page 127 could also be used. Additional helpful points can be found in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book, pages 84-8.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ “What do you think is necessary for mankind to find true peace and happiness on this earth? [Allow for response.] The Bible says that we must fear God and acknowledge him as the Creator of heaven and earth.” Read Revelation 14:7, and then open the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font12"> book to pages 140 and 141, possibly reading paragraphs 24 and 25, where it explains that the earth was designed for human habitation. If the householder’s interest warrants further conversation, turn to chapter 19 and explain how an earthly paradise will soon be a reality.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> If the householder expresses doubts about the existence of a Creator, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Many people share your feelings, especially in view of all the suffering in the world. If there is a God, why would he permit suffering? Can you think of any reasonable explanation?” Depending on the response, you may be able to continue by using chapter 16 of the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font12"> book to further the discussion. Or if he listens with limited interest, you might just highlight a specific point or two from the article “Why Do Good People Suffer?” in the September 15, 1992, issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font12"> Additional helpful replies on this question can be found in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book, pages 399-400.

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Show Personal Interest—By Being Gracious</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Jehovah is gracious.” (Ps. 145:8) Although he is the Universal Sovereign, he is kind, considerate, and courteous in his dealings with imperfect humans. (Gen. 13:14; 19:18-21, 29) We can enhance our presentation of the good news by imitating our gracious God. (Col. 4:6) This involves more than simply being polite and respectful in our speech.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> From Door to Door: </span><span class="font13">What if we visit the householder at an inopportune time or when he is too busy to speak with us? We do well to acknowledge such circumstances by keeping our presentation very brief or by offering to return at another time. We kindly refrain from insisting that people accept literature if they choose to decline. Consideration for others will also prompt us to show respect for their property, such as by closing gates and doors and by training our children to do the same. We should make sure that any literature left at not-at-homes is out of sight. Indeed, graciousness will move us to treat others just as we would want them to treat us.—Luke 6:31.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> In Street Work: </span><span class="font13">While engaging in street work, we can show courtesy by not blocking the flow of pedestrians and by not congregating in front of businesses. We will be sensitive to the circumstances of others, seeking to speak with those who may have a few minutes rather than those who are clearly in a hurry. At times, we may need to speak up in order to be heard over street noise. Yet, we should do so with dignity, not calling attention to ourselves.—Matt. 12:19.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> When Telephone Witnessing: </span><span class="font13">Consideration for others will move us to do telephone witnessing in a place where background noise can be controlled. We show good manners when we readily identify ourselves and explain the reason for our call. Speaking directly into the mouthpiece and maintaining a pleasant tone will help to engage others in an upbuilding Scriptural conversation. (1 Cor. 14:8, 9) By being kind, considerate, and courteous in these various ways, we imitate our gracious God, Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Do You Ask for Referrals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you are currently conducting a Bible study, why not ask the student if any of his friends, relatives, or acquaintances would also enjoy learning what the Bible teaches? Often several names are given. With the student’s permission, you could mention his name when you visit those individuals to offer a Bible study. You might say, “[Name of student] has enjoyed studying the Bible, and he thought that you too might like to benefit from our free Bible study program.” Then briefly demonstrate how the study is conducted, using the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you have a student who is making good progress, you might encourage him to describe the study arrangement to friends and family members who might be interested. He could invite them to sit in on his study. Or if that is not convenient, he could arrange for you to meet with them to demonstrate the study arrangement. Doing this would encourage the student to begin sharing his Bible knowledge with others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Those on whom you make regular return visits may also provide you with referrals, even if they themselves have not yet accepted a regular Bible study. When you offer them a copy of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book, you could simply ask, “Do you know anyone else who would enjoy having a copy of this publication?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In view of the urgency of the times, we want to use every possible means to help people hear and accept the good news. Do you ask for referrals?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark112"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">*** km 6/94 p. 2 Question Box *** </span><span class="font13">no further calls at that home</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Question Box</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">- How should matters be handled when a householder insists that Jehovah’s Witnesses make no further calls at that home?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When we encounter a sign at the door that strictly prohibits calls of a religious nature and specifically mentions Jehovah’s Witnesses, it may be best to respect the householder’s wishes and avoid knocking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Sometimes we come upon a sign prohibiting salesmen or solicitors. Since we are doing charitable religious work, that does not really apply to us. It would be appropriate to go ahead and knock at such doors. If the householder objects, we can tactfully explain why we feel that such signs do not apply in our case. If the householder then makes it clear that the prohibition includes Jehovah’s Witnesses, we will respect his wishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">When we are working the territory, a householder may become visibly upset and emphatically insist that we do not call again. If he refuses to reason on the matter, we should comply with this request. A </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">dated</span><span class="font13"> note should be placed in the territory envelope so that publishers working the territory in the future will avoid calling at that address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Such homes are not to be avoided indefinitely. The present occupants may move away. We may contact another family member who will respond favorably. There is also the possibility that the householder to whom we spoke will have a change of heart and become more agreeable to having us call. So after some time a tactful inquiry should be made of the occupants to determine their current feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The territory file should be reviewed once a year, making a list of the homes where we have been advised not to call. Under the direction of the service overseer, some tactful, experienced publishers can be assigned to visit these homes. It could be explained that we are calling to inquire if the same householder still lives there. The publisher should be familiar with the material in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, pages 15-24, entitled “How You Might Respond to Potential Conversation Stoppers.” If there is a reasonable response, future calls can be made in the usual way. If the householder continues to be antagonistic, no further calls should be made until the following year. The local body of elders can decide if the circumstances in a particular case make it advisable to handle things differently.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark113"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">*** km 1/07 p. 1 “I’m Not Interested” ***</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">“I’m Not Interested”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> That is a common reaction to our message in some areas. What will help us to avoid becoming disheartened when faced with apathy in the territory? How might we be able to stimulate interest in the good news?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Maintain Joy: </span><span class="font13">Remembering why many are apathetic will help us to maintain joy. People who were taught the theory of evolution or who were raised in an atheistic society may not have considered the value of the Bible. Others may be disillusioned by the hypocrisy they have observed in religion. For some, their apathy may mirror their frustration and hopelessness. (Eph. 2:12) Some „take no note’ because they are weighed down with the anxieties of life.—Matt. 24:37-39.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Regardless of the negative reaction of some, we can have joy in the ministry, knowing that our efforts glorify Jehovah. (1 Pet. 4:11) In addition, talking about the truth, even to those who do not yet appreciate it, strengthens our own faith. Let us endeavor to view people in the territory as Jehovah does. He felt sorry for the people of Nineveh who did not “know the difference between their right hand and their left.” (Jonah 4:11) Those living in our territory need the good news! Therefore, we should not give up but should seek ways to stimulate their interest in the Bible’s message.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Discuss Local Concerns: </span><span class="font13">Perhaps you could bring up a matter of local concern in your introduction and ask the householder to express his views. Listen as he speaks, then show him the Bible’s comforting message in response to his concerns. After a local tragedy, one Witness expressed his sincere regrets at each door. “Suddenly, the people started talking,” he said. “I had many fine conversations that day because I showed interest in their lives.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Each problem facing mankind will be solved by God’s Kingdom. Try to discern the one that most concerns the householder. He may allow you to explain the Bible’s message of hope. If not, he may be willing to listen “even another time.”—Acts 17:32.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Prepare Your Own Magazine Presentation</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We appreciate the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> magazines for their timely and informative articles, which cover everything from world issues to “the deep things of God.” (1 Cor. 2:10) All of us recall many new and upbuilding things we have read in these journals, which Jehovah is using in progressively revealing the truth. (Prov. 4:18) We want to be eager to distribute them as widely as possible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Analyze Your Territory: </span><span class="font13">What type of people live in your area? If their pace of life is fast, you may need to prepare a presentation that is brief and to the point. If you have territory where the pace of life is less hurried, you may be able to say more. If most householders work during the day, you may have better success calling at their homes in the late afternoon or early evening. You might contact some in the daytime through street witnessing or working from store to store. Some publishers get good results by approaching people informally in parking lots and city parks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Acquaint Yourself With the Magazines: </span><span class="font13">Read each issue as soon as you receive it. Select the articles that you feel might appeal to the people in your territory. What subjects concern them? Look for a specific point that you can quote from the article you plan to feature. Think of a question that you can raise to stimulate interest. Pick out a timely scripture to read to the householder if you get the opportunity to do so. Think about what you might say to mention the donation arrangement and how you could lay the groundwork for a return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Prepare Your Opening Words: </span><span class="font13">Carefully choose the words you plan on using to introduce yourself and to start a conversation. Some have found success with this opening comment: “I’ve read a fascinating article in this magazine, and I want to share it with others.” Many open with a question that focuses on the talking point they plan to use. For example:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> If highlighting an article on the prevalence of crime, you could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">■ </span><span class="font13">“What will it take for us to be able to sleep at night without fear of being robbed or harmed?” Explain that you have some information about a remedy for this problem. The remedy will soon eliminate every other kind of social disorder as well. Refer to something in the magazine that offers such a hope. When you call back, you can draw the householder’s attention to chapter 1 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> When offering an article on family life, you might say this:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">■ </span><span class="font13">“Most parents find it a real challenge to raise a family these days. Many books have been written on the subject, but even the experts don’t agree. Is there anyone who can provide reliable guidance?” Share a specific comment from the magazine that demonstrates the wise counsel found in the Bible. When you make the return visit, discuss the Scriptural thoughts on rearing children covered in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book, pages 145-8.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> In featuring an article on a social problem, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">■ </span><span class="font13">“Many people feel under pressure because of the stressful times in which we live. Do you think God intended that we live this way?” Point to an article that shows how to cope with today’s problems or that gives reasons to look forward to a future that will be free from anxiety. On your next visit, discuss the illustration and caption on pages 4-5 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book, and then lead right into a home Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Adapt to the Householder: </span><span class="font13">You will meet people having different interests and backgrounds. Prepare a basic presentation that you can adjust for each householder. Have in mind how you might adapt what you say to a man, a woman, an older person, or a youth. There are no rigid rules about what you must say. Use whatever is comfortable for you and gets results. However, be enthusiastic, speak from the heart, and be a good listener. Those who are “rightly disposed” will sense your sincerity and will respond favorably.—Acts 13:48.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Assist One Another: </span><span class="font13">By sharing ideas with one another, we learn new ways to express ourselves. Practicing our presentations together gives us experience and confidence. (Pr. 27:17) If you rehearse what you are going to say, you will feel more at ease at the door. It is vital that parents take the time to help their children prepare, listen as they practice their presentation, and offer suggestions for improvement. New ones can benefit by working with more experienced publishers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> Preparing your own magazine presentation need not be difficult. It is simply a matter of getting something specific in mind to say and then expressing it in an appealing manner. With initiative and forethought, you can work up a fine presentation that will get a good response.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> Magazine distribution is one of the primary ways we spread the Kingdom message worldwide. If you can get </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> into the hands of sincere people, the magazines can speak for themselves. Always remember their value and how their message can save lives. This kind of „doing good and sharing of things with others’ is what pleases Jehovah very much.—Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark115"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>How to Prepare a Magazine Presentation</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Why should we prepare magazine presentations,’ you may wonder, „since presentations appear in each issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry?‘</span><span class="font12"> While many have found these sample presentations to be helpful, personal preparation is still needed. A presentation that is effective in one territory may not be practical in another. Therefore, we should not feel obligated to present the magazines exactly as worded in the sample presentations. Even if we choose to use a sample presentation, it is best to put the thoughts in our own words.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Choose an Article: </span><span class="font12">Having first read the magazine, choose an article that is appropriate for your territory and that you especially enjoyed. Your conviction and enthusiasm when presenting the article may move the householder to want to read it too. Though you will likely feature an article that has wide appeal in the local territory, be well acquainted with the other articles in the magazine as well. This will allow you to adjust your presentation if you encounter someone who may be more interested in another subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Ask a Question: </span><span class="font12">Next, carefully prepare your opening words. Your introduction is important. It may be helpful to ask the householder a thought-provoking question to stimulate his interest in the article that you have chosen to feature. Viewpoint questions usually work best. Avoid asking something that could make the householder uncomfortable or defensive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Read a Scripture: </span><span class="font12">Finally, choose a scripture to read if the householder’s circumstances allow, perhaps one found in the article you will feature. Reading a scripture will help the householder to see that our message is from God’s Word. (1 Thess. 2:13) The scripture will also give him a witness even if he refuses the magazines. Some have awakened the householder’s interest by reading a scripture before asking a specific question. You might introduce the scripture by saying, “I would like to get your opinion on what is stated in this Bible verse.” Then call the person’s attention to a related point in the magazine, and make a brief comment to stimulate his interest further before offering it.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> There are no rigid rules about what to say when offering the magazines. Generally, it is best to keep your presentation simple and brief. Use an approach that is comfortable for you and that gets good results. Focus on the excelling value of the magazines, and be enthusiastic. If you are well prepared, you will be more effective in placing </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> with those who are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”—Acts 13:48.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. Why is it better to prepare a personal magazine presentation rather than simply to memorize a sample given in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry?</span></p></li>

<h2><a name="bookmark117"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>Building One Another Up While in the Ministry</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> All of us appreciate receiving an encouraging “word spoken at the right time.” (Prov. 25:11) When we work with others in the ministry, how can we make sure that our conversation results in encouragement?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Upbuilding Conversation: </span><span class="font12">How upbuilding it is to include spiritual matters in our conversation while engaging in the preaching work! (Ps. 37:30) We could talk about our presentation or relate encouraging field service experiences we recently enjoyed. (Acts 15:3) Did we glean an interesting point from our personal Bible reading, the recent magazines, or a congregation meeting? We might discuss points presented in a public talk we recently heard at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> We may feel disheartened when a householder raises an objection that we are unable to overcome. It would be beneficial for us to take a few minutes after leaving the door to consider with our partner how such a situation might be handled in the future, perhaps by consulting the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book. And if we appreciated something about our partner’s presentation, a word of sincere commendation would provide welcome encouragement.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Take the Initiative: </span><span class="font12">Are there some in our book study group with whom we have not worked recently? Extending a personal invitation to accompany us in the ministry may result in “an interchange of encouragement.” (Rom. 1:12) Regular and auxiliary pioneers appreciate having others to work with, especially in the early morning or late afternoon, when fewer publishers may be sharing in the ministry. We can support the pioneers by making ourselves available. Is there an infirm publisher whose health limits what he is able to do in the ministry? Arranging for such a one to accompany us, perhaps on a Bible study, may be beneficial.—Prov. 27:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Commendation and expressions of appreciation are always encouraging, even in small matters. We should have that in mind when working with others in the ministry, since we want to “keep . . . building one another up.”—1 Thess. 5:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark119"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">*** km 7/05 p. 3 Help Your Children Progress in the Ministry ***</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Help Your Children Progress in the Ministry</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Christian parents shoulder the serious responsibility of training their children in the ministry from a young age. This may be achieved in a number of ways. Some children are able to recite an appropriate Bible text even before they are able to read. This can have a powerful effect on listeners. As little ones get older, they can do even more in the ministry. How can you parents help your children to share in giving a witness? Perhaps the following suggestions will be of further help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> After a greeting, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “My son, [his name], has a meaningful scripture that he would like to call to your attention.” Your child may say: “This scripture in Psalms taught me God’s name. [Child reads or recites Psalm 83:18.] These magazines talk about what Jehovah God will do for us. May I leave them with you?” You could conclude the conversation by explaining how the worldwide work is supported.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Or you might try this approach:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “Hello. I am training my daughter, [her name], to show concern for others in the community. She would like to share a brief Bible message with you.” She could say: “One way I like to help people is by sharing the Bible’s hope for the future. [Child reads or recites Revelation 21:4.] These magazines explain what God’s Kingdom will do for us. I think you will enjoy reading them.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Consistently using a simplified presentation allows children to gain confidence in their ability to share the Kingdom message. Practice sessions that focus on speaking clearly and with adequate volume will equip them to speak under a variety of circumstances. Good advance preparation and sincere commendation will help little ones to express their faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> With such encouragement, many young ones have qualified as unbaptized publishers. What a joy it is to see our children making progress in the Christian ministry!—Ps. 148:12, 13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Question Box</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">• May both parents report the time used for the regular family study?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Although fathers have the primary responsibility of bringing their children up “in the discipline and mental-regulating of Jehovah,” both parents share in training their children. (Eph. 6:4) The Bible encourages children: “Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and do not forsake the law of your mother.” (Prov. 1:8) One important aspect of parental training is the family Bible study.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">In the past, only the parent </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">conducting</span><span class="font13"> a family study with unbaptized children would report the time, even when both parents were involved in the discussion. However, this is being adjusted. If during the family study both parents share together in teaching the children, then both may count a maximum of one hour a week as field service. Of course, parents generally spend much more than one hour a week teaching their children. Training children involves constant effort on the part of both parents. (Deut. 6:6-9) However, the monthly field service report should reflect primarily what is being accomplished in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">field.</span><span class="font13"> Therefore, no more than one hour a week is to be counted, even if the study lasts longer than an hour, is conducted more than once a week, or separate studies are conducted with the children. Only one parent would report the family Bible study and up to one return visit each week that the study was conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Make Sure That You Go Back!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “What a good conversation! I’ll have to remember to make a return visit there.” Have you ever said those words and later forgotten where the person lives? If so, you know that the only way you can make sure that you go back is to put it in writing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Write It All Down: </span><span class="font13">While a conversation with an interested person is still fresh in your mind, take a moment to write down all the pertinent information about the call. Note the person’s name and how you will recognize him. Put down his address, but do not guess at it—check to be sure that what you write is correct. Note the subject you talked about, any scriptures that you read, and what literature was placed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> If you left the person with a question to be answered on the next call, write it down. Did you learn something about the person, his family, or his religion? If so, make a notation of this. Then the next time you call, your making mention of it will demonstrate your personal interest in the individual. Finally, include the day and time that you made the initial call and when you said you would return. By making good notes, you will have clear reminders and will be less likely to forget your promise to return.—1 Tim. 1:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Once your record is complete, put it with the rest of your field service equipment—book bag, Bible, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, and literature—so that it will always be handy. It is best to record not-at-homes on house-to-house records that are separate from those that you use to make note of your return visits. Of course, regardless of the work you put into keeping track of return visits, the important thing is to make sure that you go back!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Think About the Person: </span><span class="font13">When preparing for the ministry, review your return visit notes. Give thought to each individual and what approach might best be used when making the next call. Think of how to develop the person’s interest into a home Bible study. Such planning can increase your productivity as a minister of the good news and, hence, your personal joy.—Prov. 21:5a.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> So the next time you find a listening ear, do not reason that you can easily remember the call. Instead, write it down, review your notes, keep thinking about the person, and then make sure that you go back!</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark120"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark121"></a>Feature Magazines in Your Ministry</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> “Interesting, timely, and uplifting.” “The most encouraging journals I’ve ever read.” These comments well describe how readers the world over feel about </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> Indeed, our magazines have proved to be invaluable tools in reaching “all sorts of men” with the good news.—1 Tim. 2:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> A career-oriented man obtained an </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazine on a subject that interested him. Later, he read the accompanying issue of </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font12"> which contained an article that prompted him to scrutinize his lifelong belief in the Trinity. This sparked his interest. Six months later he was baptized. Another man regularly received the magazines but never read them. His wife, on the other hand, avoided the Witnesses but read the magazines left with her husband. Her heart was touched by the Bible’s promise of an earthly paradise filled with righteous people. In time, she, her son, and her sister became servants of Jehovah.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Offer Them as a Set: </span><span class="font12">As the foregoing examples show, we cannot be sure who will read our magazines or what may arouse their interest. (Eccl. 11:6) Therefore, it is advantageous to offer </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> together as a set, even though we will generally highlight only one magazine in our presentation. In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to offer several different issues of our magazines on a visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> It is beneficial to schedule one day each week to share in magazine work. On the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">2005 Calendar of Jehovah’s Witnesses,</span><span class="font12"> every Saturday is designated as “Magazine Day.” Of course, since local and personal circumstances vary, some may set aside another day to focus on offering our journals.

<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Set a Personal Goal: </span><span class="font12">Setting a personal monthly goal of magazine placements can help us to be more magazine conscious. Do you have a magazine route? Do you offer magazines to those whom you meet in the ministry? Could you offer magazines in street work, in business territory, and in public places? Do you carry magazines with you when traveling, shopping, and going to appointments? Take advantage of every appropriate opportunity to help others benefit from </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We might also make it our aim to place older issues that we have on hand. Even if magazines are not placed within a month or two of the issue date, the information retains its value. Get them into the hands of interested ones. For millions of people, the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> magazines have been “a word . . . at the right time.” (Prov. 25:11) Let us use them to help millions more come to know and serve Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Effectively Using Brochures in July</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> To speed up the disciple-making work, the organization has generously supplied many different publications. Among these are brochures that deal with specific themes, such as God’s purpose for the earth, the Trinity, God’s name, the Kingdom government, and God’s permission of wickedness. How can we use brochures effectively to help people in our territory?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> The brochure </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?</span><span class="font6"> explains logically that a new world free from suffering is near. How might we introduce it? Suggestions can be found in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font6"> book under the main heading “Suffering,” starting on page 393, or you may prefer the introduction on page 12 under the heading “Injustice/Suffering.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Have you ever wondered: „Does God really care that humans experience injustice and suffering?’” Allow for response. Read Psalm 72:12-14. Then turn to page 22 of the brochure </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?</span><span class="font6"> and discuss the bold headings in part 10, as well as the meaning of the illustration on page 23. If the brochure is refused, why not offer a tract, such as </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed</span><span class="font6"> or </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Good government is a topic of concern today. Many wonder if man’s rule will unite the world. Helpful information is found under “Government,” beginning on page 152 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font6"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Is it possible for humans to establish a government that will really bring lasting happiness?” Allow for reply, then ask: “What does the record of human history show?” Turn to Jeremiah 10:23, or turn to page 152 of the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font6"> book and read appropriate texts and comments. Thereafter, turn to pages 24 and 25 in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Government</span><span class="font6"> brochure and consider illustrations and scriptures. Explain how God’s government will unite people globally. If the householder does not accept the brochure, you may offer the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Will this World Survive?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> If there is fear of crime in your neighborhood, the following introduction may be appealing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">■ “Many people wonder, “If God is love, why does he permit wickedness?’ Have you wondered about this too?” Allow for comment, then say: “Notice that Proverbs 19:3 cautions against blaming God for the bad things people do.” After reading the text, direct attention to page 15 of the brochure </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making All Things New”</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> and read paragraph 27. This could lead into a discussion of the succeeding paragraphs.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Using brochures to teach sheeplike people about the good news is something that all of us can do.

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Use a Variety of Brochures in Your Ministry</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> People today are interested in a variety of subjects. As you engage in field service during July, you could have with you several different brochures, using a specific one that would appeal to people in the territory. Perhaps you would like to try one of these presentations:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> In offering the brochure “The Government That Will Bring Paradise,” you could ask:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “What do you think the world would be like if God were the only ruler? [Allow for response.] Having God take over the rulership of the earth is exactly what we are asking for when we pray the Lord’s Prayer, or Our Father, that Jesus Christ taught us. [Turn to page 3, and read the first paragraph, which quotes Matthew 6:10.] If you would like to live in a world like that, you should read this brochure.” Offer to leave it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> “When Someone You Love Dies” could be featured in this way:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Do you think the day will ever come when none of us will have to lose a loved one in death? [Allow for response.] This beautifully written brochure has comforted millions with the Bible’s sure promise that such a day is coming in the near future. [Turn to page 5, and read the fifth paragraph, including 1 Corinthians 15:21, 22. Then turn to the illustration on page 30.] Here the artist has captured the joy we may experience in welcoming back our dead loved ones in the resurrection. But where will that happy scene take place? This brochure will show you the Bible’s answer to that question.” If the brochure is accepted, you might add: “I would like to return later and discuss this subject further.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You might feature the brochure “Look! I Am Making All Things New,” using this direct approach to start a Bible study:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “Many people have questions about the Bible. You may have wondered about the answer to one of these. [Open to page 30.] This last question has stirred the interest of many: “How may you prepare for everlasting life in Paradise?’” If you discuss paragraphs 57-8 on pages 29-30 and read Revelation 21:3, 4, you will have laid the groundwork for starting a Bible study. Conclude by leaving the brochure and arranging for a return visit when you can discuss some of the other questions.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You might like to try this simple presentation with the brochure “The Divine Name That Will Endure Forever”:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “One of the first things I learned from the Bible was God’s name. Do you know what it is? [Allow for response.] Let me show you. It’s here in the Bible at Psalm 83:18. [Read.] This brochure shows how God’s name, Jehovah, appears in many different languages. [Show the box on page 8.] If you would like to learn more about Jehovah and his purposes, you should read this brochure.” Hand the brochure to the householder.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> With such a variety of fine brochures to use, we certainly are well equipped “to tell good news to the meek ones.”—Isa. 61:1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Returning to Stimulate Interest in the Bible</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Sometimes we meet people in field service who show some interest in the good news but are too busy to talk with us at the moment we call. Do we try to call back at another time to share the Kingdom message with them? Or perhaps we have an interesting conversation with a householder, but he does not accept any literature. Do we return to speak further with him about the truth?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> It is important to cover our territory thoroughly and to follow up on all interest we may find. Do we make return visits only on those who accept a book or the magazines? If so, we could be overlooking some interested people. We certainly would not want to judge someone as being unworthy of further spiritual encouragement just because he did not accept literature. (Compare Romans 14:4.) Perhaps after our visit, a householder may think about what we said or may come to appreciate the effort we made to visit him. He may be more favorably disposed when we return.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> When calling back on a person who was busy, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “I’m glad to see you once again. The last time I was here, we couldn’t talk because you didn’t have time. I can see that you are a busy person, and I’ll be brief. Likely you are concerned about good health for yourself and for those you love. Well, did you know that God has promised to put an end to all sickness? Wouldn’t that be wonderful? [Allow for response.] Notice the point in paragraph 4 of this brochure entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Look! I Am Making All Things New.”</span><span class="font6"> If time permits, read the paragraph and then consider one of the scriptures at the bottom of page 4 that depicts conditions in the new world. If the householder is receptive, you may be able to start a home Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> When revisiting someone who accepted a tract, you could say something like this:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">■ “The last time I saw you, you accepted a copy of this tract entitled </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who Really Rules the World?</span><span class="font6"> Do you find it hard to accept that Satan rules this world? [Allow for response.] Notice the first paragraph on page 6.” Read the paragraph, then ask: “Why would Satan want to deceive us?” After the householder replies, consider together the fourth paragraph on page 3. You may continue with a thorough consideration of the tract, or you may want to introduce the brochure </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?</span><span class="font6"> and consider paragraph 8 on page 13.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> There is good reason to be positive and to follow up on the interest we find in our preaching work even if it is expressed in a limited way. It is important to care about others, to be motivated to help them learn the truth. Jehovah’s organization provides literature and suggested presentations that can aid us in making others conscious of their spiritual need.—Matt. 5:3.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> If you have had a pleasant conversation with someone who may be even slightly interested, do not neglect calling back to cultivate the interest. It may result in starting a home Bible study and putting someone on the way to life. We encourage all to continue sharing conscientiously in this lifesaving work.— 1 Tim. 4:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Try a Flexible Approach</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Sincere interest in people will move us to try to discern their needs and show them how the Kingdom will provide the complete solution to the problems they face. (Phil. 2:4) A flexible approach that many publishers find effective is to invite the householder to comment on </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">illustrations of Paradise scenes</span><span class="font13"> in our publications, such as those listed in the right-hand column of this page. You might do this using one of the following introductions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “Do you think we will ever see the human family enjoying the kind of conditions pictured here?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “All of us would like our children to be able to enjoy the kind of world pictured here. What do you think it would take to bring this about?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “This is an illustration of what the earth will look like when God’s will takes place on earth as it is in heaven. Do you notice anything that is different from life today?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “Would you like to live under the conditions pictured here? [Allow for response.] Do you think this will happen in our lifetime?”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Listen carefully to the person‘s response, and kindly draw him out with an additional question or two.</span><span class="font13"> If some respond that they would not want to live under the conditions pictured or that they do not believe that such a thing is possible, do not quickly conclude that they have no interest. Tactfully inquire why they feel the way they do. Their comments may reveal a deep concern over the seemingly unsolvable problems facing mankind.—Ezek. 9:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">As you discern the householder‘s concerns, adapt your presentation accordingly.</span><span class="font13"> Highlight the aspect of the Kingdom message that most directly addresses his needs. Share one or two scriptures that touch on the matter that concerns him. (See suggestions in the right-hand column.) Let him see for himself what God’s Word says. If he shows interest, offer the publication and arrange to call again. Continue to build on your initial conversation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Simple and Effective Presentations</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus proclaimed the Kingdom of God in a simple and straightforward manner. He knew that sheeplike ones would react favorably when they heard the truth. He also knew that people differ in their thinking, interests, and reasoning ability. Accordingly, he used a variety of uncomplicated introductions, questions, and illustrations in order to capture the attention of his listeners and to touch their hearts. We can imitate his example and make good use of simple and effective</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">presentations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use the Reasoning &nbsp;Book Effectively: </span><span class="font13">The first introduction under the heading</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">“Employment/Housing” on page 11 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book is timely and easy to present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might say:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ “We’ve been talking with your neighbors about what can be done to assure that there will be employment and housing for everyone. Do you believe that it is reasonable to expect that human governments will accomplish this? . . . But there is someone who knows how to solve these problems; that is mankind’s Creator.” Read Isaiah 65:21-23. Then you could ask the householder how that sounds to him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The introduction under the heading “Injustice/Suffering” on page 12 will appeal to many today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You could ask:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “Have you ever wondered: Does God really care about the injustice and suffering that humans experience?” Allow householder to answer and then read Ecclesiastes 4:1 and Psalm 72:12-14. If it is appropriate to feature the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book, turn to the pictures on pages 150-3 and briefly show how world conditions today are a fulfillment of Bible prophecy. Then turn to pages 161-2 to show what God has further foretold for man’s blessing. Ask the householder which aspect appeals to him most.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> After a brief discussion with the householder, you may decide that it will be more appropriate to direct his attention to an article in one of the magazines, to a brochure, or to a tract than to the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever</span><span class="font13"> book.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For example, after using the introduction in paragraph 2 of this article, you might say:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “This brochure, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?,</span><span class="font13"> clearly explains what God has promised to do to care for our daily needs and shows how we can benefit.” Turn to pages 26 and 27 of the brochure, and call attention to paragraph 21.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Or after using the introduction in paragraph 3, the tract </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font13"> could be highlighted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">You might say:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “There is so much misery and trouble in the world today. This tract shows that war, food shortages, and health problems were all prophesied in the Bible. But God has also promised to bring about a marvelous change for mankind.” Read the last paragraph on page 5 of the tract.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Our sincere interest in people, coupled with a simple and effective presentation that touches the heart, will surely appeal to sheeplike ones.—John 10:16.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark124"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark125"></a>Cultivate Interest With a Magazine Route</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">1</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Many people whom we meet in the ministry welcome our visits and gladly accept our literature but hesitate to agree to a regular Bible study. One way to cultivate their interest is by means of a magazine route. When you place magazines, make a record of the person’s name and address, the date of the call, the issues that were accepted, and the scripture that was discussed, along with anything you noticed that might indicate the person’s interests. As each new issue of the magazines arrives, look for points that will appeal to those on your route, and feature them when you visit. (1 Cor. 9:19-23) In time, something they read in our journals may spark their interest and cause them to want to learn more.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> We recognize, though, that most people will not become servants of Jehovah simply by reading the magazines on their own. Since it is urgent for people to seek Jehovah now, what more can we do to help them? (Zeph. 2:2, 3; Rev. 14:6, 7) We can cultivate their interest by sharing a carefully selected scripture each time we deliver the magazines.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> One-Scripture Discussions: </span><span class="font12">Think about those on your magazine route, and prepare a series of one-scripture discussions for each one’s specific needs. (Phil. 2:4) For example, if someone has recently lost a loved one in death, you might use a number of return visits to discuss what the Bible says about the condition of the dead and the hope of the resurrection. Material in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font12"> book under the principal subjects “Death” and “Resurrection” could be used to prepare these one-scripture discussions. Additional discussions on related subjects, such as how sickness, old age, and death will be completely eliminated, might naturally follow. The key is to find a subject that interests the person and progressively show him what the Bible says about it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Impart Understanding: </span><span class="font12">Although it is usually best to keep such discussions simple and brief, more is needed than just reading the selected scripture. Satan has blinded people’s minds to the good news. (2 Cor. 4:3, 4) Even those who are familiar with the Bible need help to understand it. (Acts 8:30, 31) Hence, take time to explain and illustrate the text, much as you would in a talk in the Theocratic Ministry School. (Acts 17:3) Make sure the person sees the practical value of God’s Word in his own life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> If the person enjoys what he is learning, gradually extend the discussions to include two or three Bible texts each visit. Look for an opportunity to introduce the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure or the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font12"> book. In this way, a magazine-route call may eventually become a Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">[Study Questions]</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">1. How can we use a magazine route to cultivate interest?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Return Visits Lead to Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font12"> Jesus commissioned his followers not only to preach but also to “make disciples . . . , teaching them.” (Matt. 28:19, 20) A preacher proclaims, but a teacher does more. He instructs, explains, and offers proof. One way we teach others is by making return visits on interested ones with a view to starting Bible studies with them.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12"> On whom should you make return visits? Be sure to call back on all who accept literature or who show even a spark of interest in the good news. If you find interest when witnessing in a public setting, seek to obtain the person’s address or telephone number so that the interest can be cultivated. Be optimistic about starting Bible studies. Continue to search for those who will accept an offer to study the Bible, and you will likely find them.— Matt. 10:11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Show Personal Interest: </span><span class="font12">Preparation for an effective return visit begins on the initial call. Successful evangelizers take note of what interests the householder, and they use that as a basis for further discussions. Some find it advantageous to raise a question at the conclusion of the call in order to prime the householder for the next visit. Our sincere interest in people keeps us thinking about them even after we have left the door, and it prompts us to call again without delay. If possible, try to return while the interest is still fresh—perhaps even within a day or two.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12"> When making a return visit, seek to build on your previous discussion. Make it your aim to share at least one upbuilding Scriptural point each time, and be willing to listen. Get to know the householder better. Then on subsequent visits, share the truths from God’s Word that most directly address his concerns.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Bible-Study Conscious: </span><span class="font12">Make return visits with the objective of starting a Bible study. How can this be done? Mention that you would like to share an interesting point, and open to a paragraph in the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font12"> book or </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure that you think will appeal to the person. Read the paragraph, consider the question, and discuss one or two of the cited scriptures. This can be done right at the doorstep in five to ten minutes. Conclude by raising the next question and making arrangements to continue the discussion at another time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font12"> Cultivating all interest we find is a vital aspect of our ministry. Therefore, set aside time in your weekly schedule for making return visits. Doing so will add to the effectiveness of your ministry and bring real joy.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Turn Magazine Placements Into Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> On Saturdays we generally feature the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> magazines in the ministry. However, this is only the first step in reaching our goal of teaching honesthearted ones the truth. Below are some suggestions on how to place the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book on a return visit and start a Bible study. These may be adapted to your territory and put in your own words. Feel free to use another approach if it is effective for you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use the Introductory Pages: </span><span class="font13">When you return, you could say: “The magazines I left you direct attention to the Bible. Notice why Bible reading is so important.” Read Isaiah 48:17, 18; John 17:3; or another appropriate scripture. Then after introducing the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book and handing the householder a copy, you could proceed as follows:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ “The Bible gives us a real hope for the future.” Show the householder pages 4-5 and ask, “Which of these promises would you like to see fulfilled?” Direct him to the chapter that discusses the Scriptural promise he selected, and briefly consider a paragraph or two if he allows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Or you could say, “The Bible answers the most important questions of life.” Direct his attention to page 6, and ask if he has ever wondered about any of the questions at the bottom of the page. Turn to the chapter that gives the answer, and briefly discuss a paragraph or two.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Or you could point out some of the titles in the table of contents and ask which one of the subjects interests him. Turn to that chapter, and briefly demonstrate a Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Leave a Question on the Initial Visit: </span><span class="font13">Another option is to lay the groundwork for the return visit on the initial call. After the householder accepts the magazines, raise a question, and promise to answer it on your next visit. Endeavor to make a definite arrangement to return, and be sure to keep the appointment. (Matt. 5:37) When you go back, remind the householder of the question, and briefly read and discuss the answer from the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book. Hand him a copy so that he can follow along. Here are a few examples:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">■ </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">If the magazine you placed deals with worsening world conditions, you could say,</span><span class="font13"> “Next time we can discuss the Bible’s answer to this question, What changes will God bring about on the earth?” Use pages 4-5 when you return. Or you could raise the question, “Are tragedies God’s will?” On the return visit, show the householder paragraphs 7-8 in chapter 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">If the magazine you placed deals with the family, before leaving you might raise this question, </span><span class="font13">“What can each member of the family do to make family life happier?” When you return consider paragraph 4 in chapter 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">■ </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">If the magazine you placed deals with the reliability of the Bible, you could raise this question for your next discussion,</span><span class="font13"> “Is the Bible scientifically accurate?” On the return visit, consider paragraph 8 in chapter 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> At the end of each discussion, raise another question to be answered on the next visit. Once a regular study is established, consider the book systematically from beginning to end. What if the householder does not accept the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book? You can still continue to take him the magazines and have Scriptural discussions with him. As you cultivate his interest, he may in time accept a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>5</sup> The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> may stir up a person’s desire to learn what the Bible really teaches. Therefore, make a special effort to start Bible studies with those who accept the magazines. In this way, we will obey Jesus’ instructions to “make disciples . . . , teaching them.”— Matt. 28:19, 20.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">A Special Day for Offering Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Beginning in January, each congregation will designate one weekend every month, perhaps the first one, to concentrate on offering Bible studies. This would be either a Saturday or a Sunday, according to what is best locally. On that day if householders decline to accept such an offer, publishers may still offer the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font13"> book or place the latest magazines. All elders and ministerial servants should arrange to have a full share in this activity and assist publishers to start Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> The Congregation Service Committee will determine on which weekend a day will be set aside to offer Bible studies. Periodic reminders should be given so that publishers can prepare and put forth special effort to offer Bible studies from house to house and when visiting those who previously showed interest.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> How to Prepare: </span><span class="font13">We can find suggestions for starting Bible studies in the January 2006 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> insert and on page 12 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book. Some may choose to use a tract, such as </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know the Truth?</span><span class="font13"> Also, page 3 of the August 2007 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> gives suggestions for starting Bible studies when visiting those who accepted the magazines. Elders and ministerial servants will be scheduled to conduct a brief 10- to 15-minute meeting for field service, during which one or two practical suggestions for starting Bible studies should be discussed or demonstrated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Of course, not everyone will accept a Bible study or continue their study over an extended period. This should not cause us to hold back, since it is Jehovah who is drawing sheeplike ones to his organization. (John 6:44) Our responsibility is not just to sow seeds of truth but also to cultivate and water what has taken root, and that includes studying the Bible with righthearted ones. By so doing, we exercise the privilege of being God’s fellow workers.—1 Cor. 3:9.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark128"></a>Conduct Progressive Doorstep and Telephone Bible Studies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font8">1</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> What a joy it is to start a Bible study! However, finding someone who has an interest in studying the Bible is only the beginning. The purpose of the study is to help the person to become a genuine disciple of Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20) What can help us to attain that goal?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Busy People: </span><span class="font12">People today are increasingly busy. In some places, few people may initially be willing to set aside a full hour to study the Bible. To help such ones, we have been encouraged to start and conduct Bible studies at the doorstep or over the telephone. At first, these studies may be relatively brief and may involve considering just a few Bible texts with the aid of one or two paragraphs in a publication, such as the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12"> book. How commendable it is that many publishers are now conducting such studies at the doorstep or over the telephone!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> Should we be satisfied, though, to continue conducting a doorstep study indefinitely? No. Although we are wise not to overstay our welcome when a study is first started, the May 1990 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> page 8, commented: “Once the study is established and the householder’s interest has developed, a longer period of time may be spent on the study.” This is vital. To illustrate: A starving child might initially be fed small amounts of food until his appetite is restored, but we would hardly expect him to regain his full strength and grow normally if he were fed such small portions for months on end. Similarly, a Bible student needs a more formal and regular study in order to develop into a mature servant of God.—Heb. 5:13, 14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bible Studies Inside the Home: </span><span class="font12">It is preferable to conduct a study in a private location—in a home or in some other suitable area. This will be more conducive to learning and will help the student to get the sense of God’s Word. (Matt. 13:23) It will also better enable the teacher to tailor the study material to the needs of the student. Moreover, having a longer study period will allow for a more thorough, faith-strengthening consideration of God’s Word.—Rom. 10:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> How can you make the transition from a doorstep study to a study inside the home? After several brief studies, why not simply offer to study for a longer, specified period of time? Or you might use an indirect approach by asking the person, “Would you have time today to sit down and discuss this together?” or “How much time would you like to spend today discussing this subject?” If your efforts prove unsuccessful, by all means continue to have brief doorstep studies. At an appropriate time, try again to make the transition to inside the home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> As we continue to search for deserving ones, let us not lose sight of our purpose in starting and conducting Bible studies. Our aim is to help honesthearted ones become dedicated and baptized servants of Jehovah. May he bless our efforts as we carry out our ministry with this objective.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Make It Your Goal to Conduct a Bible Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> “Lift up your eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting.” (John 4:35) Those words spoken by Jesus Christ are certainly applicable to the situation Christian ministers face today.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Honesthearted people desirous of being taught the ways of Jehovah are still being found. This is evident in the number of new disciples being baptized each year. If you are genuinely interested in conducting a Bible study, what might you do?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Set a Goal: </span><span class="font13">First, set a goal to start and conduct a regular Bible study. Keep your goal in mind while engaging in the field ministry. Since our Christian commission involves teaching, along with preaching, all of us should seek to have an increased share in the Bible study work.—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Other Points to Keep in Mind: </span><span class="font13">Heartfelt prayer is a must for Kingdom publishers. At times we find people who have prayed for spiritual assistance. What a blessing it is to be used by Jehovah to find and teach such ones!—Hag. 2:7; Acts 10:1, 2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> A sister prayed for a Bible study and then displayed copies of the tract </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font13"> at her place of work. When a woman picked up one of the tracts, read it through, and began to fill out the coupon, the sister spoke to her and was able to start a Bible study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Fellow publishers who are effective in starting and conducting Bible studies can help you to reach your goal to conduct a Bible study. Prayerfully look for one, and take advantage of all the assistance available to reach this goal. Perhaps soon you will experience the joy of conducting a Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">(1) Question, (2) Scripture, and (3) Chapter</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A simple way to present </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font12"> is to (1) raise a viewpoint question, (2) read an appropriate scripture, and (3) feature a chapter in the book that discusses that subject by reading the introductory questions under the chapter title. If the householder shows interest, you may be able to demonstrate a Bible study using the opening paragraphs of that chapter. This approach can be used to start a study when making the initial call or a return visit.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Do you think it is possible for mere humans to come to know our almighty Creator, as stated here in the Bible?” Read Acts 17:26, 27, and allow for response. Then feature chapter 1.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font12">A Bible study may be reported when it has been conducted two times after the study arrangement was demonstrated and if there is reason to believe that the study will continue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Start Studies in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bible Teach</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many of us would be delighted to conduct a Bible study if only we could get the study started. The new book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Does the Bible Really Teach?</span><span class="font6"> can help us. The preface on pages 3-7 is designed to get the householder into a Bible discussion using the publication. Even those with limited experience in the ministry will find it easy to use to start studies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> You might try this approach using page 3:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">After mentioning a news item or a problem that is on the minds of people in your territory, direct the householder’s attention to the questions in bold type on page 3, and invite him to comment. Then turn to pages 4-5.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> Or you might prefer to start by highlighting pages 4-5:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">You could say, “Wouldn’t it be wonderful if the changes pictured here actually took place?” Or you might ask, “Which of these promises would you like to see fulfilled?” Listen carefully to the response.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the householder shows a special interest in one of the scriptures, show him what the Bible teaches on that subject by considering the paragraphs in the book that discuss that text. (See box on this page of insert.) Consider the material just as you would on a Bible study. This can be done in five to ten minutes on the initial call right at the doorstep.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;"> Another approach is to draw the person out using page 6:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Direct the householder’s attention to the questions at the bottom of the page, and ask, “Have you ever wondered about any of these questions?” If he expresses interest in one of the questions, turn to the paragraphs in the book that answer the question. (See box on this page of insert.) As you consider the information together, you are conducting a Bible study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Page 7 may be used to lead into a demonstration of a Bible study:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Read the first three sentences on the page, and then turn to chapter 3 and demonstrate a study using paragraphs 1-3. Arrange to return to discuss the answers to the questions in paragraph 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">■ </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">How to arrange to return:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When concluding the initial study, arrange to continue the discussion. You might simply say: “In just a few minutes, we learned what the Bible teaches on an important subject. Next time, we can discuss [leave a question that will be considered]. May I stop by at this same time next week?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As we draw closer to Jehovah’s appointed time, he continues to equip us for the task at hand. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 2 Tim. 3:17) Let us make good use of this marvelous new tool to start Bible studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 1: What Is a Bible Study?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">If you regularly and systematically have Bible discussions, though brief, using the Bible or along with it one of the recommended publications, you are conducting a Bible study. The study may be reported when it has been conducted two times after the study arrangement is demonstrated and if there is reason to believe that the study will continue.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 7/04 p. 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 2: Preparing to Conduct the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">We</span><span class="font13"> need to present the information in a way that touches the student’s heart. This requires thorough preparation with the student in mind.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 8/04 p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Prepare</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Examine the title, subheadings, and visual aids of the chapter or lesson.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Identify the answers to the printed questions, marking only key words and phrases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Decide which cited scriptures to read during the study. Make brief notes in the margin of the study publication.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Prepare a brief review of main points.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Personalize the Lesson</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Pray about the student and his needs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Anticipate points that the student may have difficulty understanding or accepting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Consider: What does he need to understand or work on in order to make spiritual progress? How can I reach his heart?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ As needed, prepare an illustration, an explanation, or a series of questions to help the student grasp a point or a scripture.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 3: Effective Use of the Scriptures</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Our purpose in conducting Bible studies is to “make disciples” by helping people to understand and accept the teachings of God’s Word and apply them in their lives. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 1 Thess. 2:13) Therefore, the study should center on the Scriptures.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 11/04 p. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Teach From God’s Word</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Show the student how to find specific texts in his own copy of the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Look up and discuss Bible texts that show the Scriptural basis for our beliefs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Use questions. Instead of explaining Bible texts to the student, have him explain them to you.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Keep it simple. Do not try to explain every aspect of a scripture. Include only what is needed to make the point clear.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Make practical application. Help the student to see how Bible texts apply to him personally.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 4: Training Students to Prepare</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">A student who reads the lesson beforehand, marks the answers, and thinks of how to express them in his own words makes rapid spiritual progress. Therefore, once a regular study has been established, prepare a lesson together to show the student how. With most students, it will be helpful to prepare an entire chapter or lesson together.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 12/04 p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Markings and Notations</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">■ Explain how to find direct answers to the printed questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Show the student your copy of the study publication in which you have marked only the key words or phrases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Help the student to see that each cited text supports a point in the paragraph, and show him how to make brief notations in the margin of his study publication.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Survey and Review</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Show the student how to examine the chapter or lesson title, subheadings, and illustrations before beginning his detailed preparation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Encourage the student to review the main points at the conclusion of the preparation session.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 5: Determining How Much Material to Cover</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">The amount of material that can be considered will depend on the ability and the circumstances of both the teacher and the student.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 1/05 p. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Build Solid Faith</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Do not sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding of God’s Word for the sake of speed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Spend whatever time is necessary to help the student understand and accept what he is learning.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Allow sufficient time to consider key scriptures that provide the basis for the teachings.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep the Study Moving</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ If the student is inclined to speak at length about personal matters, you may need to arrange to discuss these after the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Do not talk excessively during the study. Limit the discussion of side points and experiences so as not to hinder the student from acquiring an accurate knowledge of basic Bible teachings.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 6: When a Student Raises a Question</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Once a Bible study is well-established, it is usually best to consider Bible teachings in an orderly manner rather than jump from subject to subject. This helps the student to build a foundation of accurate knowledge and to progress spiritually.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 2/05 p. 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Discerning</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Questions related to the study material can usually be answered on the spot.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Questions unrelated to the study material or that require research can be considered at another time. It may be helpful to write down such questions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ If the student has difficulty accepting a certain teaching, consider additional material that thoroughly discusses the subject.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ If the student is still not convinced, leave the subject for another time and continue with the study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Be Modest</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ If you do not know the answer to a question, do not venture an opinion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Progressively teach the student how to do research.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 7: Offering Prayer at the Study</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">In order for Bible students to make spiritual progress, Jehovah’s blessing is essential. Therefore, it is proper to open and close an established study with prayer.—</span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font13"> 3/05 p. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Introduce Prayer</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ With those who are religiously inclined, prayer can often be offered from the very first study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ With others, we need to discern the appropriate time to introduce prayer.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Psalm 25:4, 5 and 1 John 5:14 can be used to explain why prayer is offered.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ John 15:16 can be used to show that we should pray to Jehovah through Jesus Christ.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">What to Include in Prayers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13">■ It is fitting to praise Jehovah as the Source of instruction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Express sincere interest in the student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Express appreciation for the organization that Jehovah is using.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13">■ Request Jehovah’s blessing on the student’s efforts to apply what he is learning.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Part 8: Directing Students to the Organization</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">Our goal in conducting Bible studies is not only to teach doctrinal information but also to help students become part of the Christian congregation. Take a few minutes each week on the study to share a point about Jehovah’s organization.— </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">km 4/05</span><span class="font13"> p. 8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">What Is a Bible Study?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Worldwide, about six million Bible studies are being conducted by God’s people each month. By using good teaching methods, we can help these Bible students progress to the point of dedication and baptism and become “adequately qualified to teach others.” (2 Tim. 2:2) Would you like to help your student to make such progress? Starting with this issue, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry </span><span class="font13">will feature a series of articles that will explain basic aspects of conducting progressive Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> When to Report a Bible Study: </span><span class="font13">If you regularly and systematically have Bible discussions, though brief, using the Bible along with one of the recommended publications, you are conducting a Bible study. This is true even if the study takes place on the doorstep or over the telephone. The study may be reported when it has been conducted two times after the study arrangement is demonstrated and if there is reason to believe that the study will continue.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> The </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book are publications used for conducting many Bible studies. After they have been completed, if it is evident that a person is making progress, even slowly, and that he is developing appreciation for what he is learning, then the study may be continued in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Worship God</span><span class="font13"> book. The brochure </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Be God‘s Friend!</span><span class="font13"> may be used to study with people who have limited education or reading ability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> The Bible study work has been effective in assisting millions to become true disciples of Jesus Christ. (Matt. 28:19, 20) By applying the suggestions offered in upcoming articles of this series, you can conduct a progressive Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 2—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies - Preparing to Conduct the Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Teaching effectively on a Bible study involves more than just discussing the material and looking up the cited scriptures. We need to present the information in a way that touches the student’s heart. This requires thorough preparation with the student in mind.—Prov. 15:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> How to Prepare: </span><span class="font13">Begin by praying to Jehovah about the person and his needs. Ask Jehovah to help you reach the student’s heart. (Col. 1:9, 10) To get the theme clearly in mind, take a moment to consider the title of the chapter or lesson, the subheadings, and any visual aids. Ask yourself, „What is the thrust of the material?’ This will help you to focus on the main points as you conduct the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Carefully review the material paragraph by paragraph. Identify the answers to the printed questions, marking only the key words and phrases. Analyze how the cited scriptures relate to the main point of the paragraph, and decide which ones to read during the study. You may find it helpful to make brief notes in the margin of the publication. The student should clearly see that what he is learning is from God’s Word.—1 Thess. 2:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Personalize the Lesson: </span><span class="font13">Next, consider the lesson with the particular student in mind. Try to anticipate his questions and the points that he may have difficulty understanding or accepting. Ask yourself: „What does he need to understand or work on in order to make spiritual progress? How can I reach his heart?’ Then adapt your teaching accordingly. At times, you may see a need to prepare an illustration, an explanation, or a series of questions to help the student grasp the meaning of a certain point or scripture. (Neh. 8:8) But avoid inserting additional information that contributes little to the theme. A brief review at the end of the study will help him to retain the main points.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> What joy we have when new ones bear righteous fruit to Jehovah’s praise! (Phil. 1:11) To help them reach that goal, prepare well each time you conduct a Bible study.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark141"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">*** km 11/04 p. 4 Part 3—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies ***</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Our purpose in conducting Bible studies is to “make disciples” by helping people to understand and accept the teachings of God’s Word and apply them in their lives. (Matt. 28:19, 20; 1 Thess. 2:13)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Therefore, the study should center on the Scriptures. At first, it may be helpful to show students how to find specific texts in their own copy of the Bible. How, though, can we use the Scriptures to help such ones to progress spiritually?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Select Texts to Read: </span><span class="font6">In your preparation, determine how each cited scripture in the lesson applies to the point under consideration, and decide which ones you will look up and discuss during the study. Generally, it is good to read those that show the Scriptural basis for our beliefs. Texts that provide background information may not need to be read. Take into consideration the needs and circumstances of each student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use Questions: </span><span class="font6">Instead of explaining Bible texts to the student, have him explain them to you. You can prompt him to do this by the skillful use of questions. If the application of a scripture is obvious, you might simply ask how the text supports what is stated in the paragraph. In other cases, a more specific question or series of questions may be needed to direct the student to the proper conclusion. If further explanations are needed, these can be made after the student has responded.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Keep It Simple: </span><span class="font6">A skilled archer often needs just one arrow to hit a target. Similarly, a skilled teacher does not require many words to make a point. He can convey information simply, clearly, and accurately. At times, you may need to do research in Christian publications to understand a scripture and explain it correctly. (2 Tim. 2:15) But avoid trying to explain every aspect of each scripture in the study. Include only what is needed to make the point under consideration.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Make Practical Application: </span><span class="font6">When appropriate, help the student to see how Bible texts apply to him personally. For example, when considering Hebrews 10:24, 25 with a student who is not yet attending Christian meetings, you might discuss one of the meetings and invite him to attend it. But avoid pressuring him. Allow God’s Word to motivate him to take the action needed to please Jehovah.—Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> As we carry out the commission to make disciples, may we “promote obedience by faith” through our effective use of the Scriptures.—Rom. 16:26.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">1. Why should we emphasize the Scriptures when conducting Bible studies?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">2. How do we decide which Bible texts to read and discuss?</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 4—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies - Training Students to Prepare</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> A student who reads the lesson beforehand, marks the answers, and thinks of how to express them in his own words should make rapid spiritual progress. Therefore, once a regular study has been established, prepare a lesson together to show the student how. With most students, it will be helpful to prepare an entire chapter or lesson together.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Markings and Notations: </span><span class="font13">Explain how to find direct answers to the printed questions. Show the student your copy of the study publication in which you have marked only the key words or phrases. As you consider the material, he may want to follow your example, marking in his copy only what is needed to help him recall the answer. (Luke 6:40) Then ask him to give the answer in his own words. This will allow you to see how well he understands the material.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> A careful examination of unquoted scriptures is an important part of the student’s preparation for the study. (Acts 17:11) Help him to see that each cited text supports a point in the paragraph. Show him how to make brief notations in the margin of his study publication. Keep before him the fact that the Bible is the basis for what he is learning. Encourage him to make generous use of the cited scriptures in his comments during the study.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Survey and Review: </span><span class="font13">Before the student begins his detailed preparation of the study material, it will be helpful for him to get an overview of the subject. Point out that he can survey the material by briefly examining the chapter title, subheadings, and illustrations. Explain that before concluding his session of preparation, he would be wise to take a moment to review the main points presented in the lesson, perhaps using the review box if one is provided. Such repetition will help him retain the information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Training the student to prepare well for his study will help him to make meaningful comments at congregation meetings. It will also help him to develop study habits that will benefit him long after his personal Bible study is completed.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 5—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies-Determining How Much Material to Cover</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When teaching, Jesus took into consideration his disciples’ limitations, speaking to them “as far as they were able to listen.” (Mark 4:33; John 16:12) In a similar way, teachers of God’s Word today need to gauge the pace at which they cover material on a Bible study. The amount of material that can be considered will depend on the ability and the circumstances of both the teacher and the student.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Build Solid Faith: </span><span class="font13">Some students may require two or three sessions to grasp what other students can easily take in during one session. We do not want to sacrifice the student’s having a clear understanding for the sake of speed. Every student needs a solid basis for his newfound faith in God’s Word.—Prov. 4:7; Rom. 12:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> As you conduct the study week by week, spend whatever time is necessary to help the student understand and accept what he is learning from God’s Word. Avoid a hurried pace that detracts from the richness of the truths being taught. Allow sufficient time to focus on the main points and to consider key scriptures that provide the basis for the teachings.—2 Tim. 3:16, 17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Keep the Study Moving: </span><span class="font13">While we want to avoid rushing through the study, we also want to avoid becoming sidetracked. If a student is inclined to speak at length about personal matters, we may need to arrange to discuss these after the study.—Eccl. 3:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> On the other hand, our own enthusiasm for the truth can make it a challenge not to talk excessively during the study. (Ps. 145:6, 7) An occasional side point or experience can enrich a study, but we would not want these to become so numerous or lengthy that they hinder the student from acquiring an accurate knowledge of basic Bible teachings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> By covering a reasonable amount of material at each study session, we help Bible students to “walk in the light of Jehovah.”—Isa. 2:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 6—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies- When a Student Raises a Question</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Once a Bible study is well established, it is usually best to consider Bible teachings in an orderly manner rather than jump from subject to subject. This helps the student to build a foundation of accurate knowledge and to progress spiritually. (Col. 1:9, 10) Often, though, students raise questions on various subjects during the study. How should these be handled?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Discerning: </span><span class="font13">Questions related to the study material being considered can usually be answered on the spot. If a question will be addressed later in the study publication, it may be sufficient simply to point that out. However, if a question is unrelated to the study material or will require research to answer properly, it may be better to consider the matter after the study or at another time. Some find that writing the question down assures the student that his question is being taken seriously and helps prevent the study from becoming sidetracked.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Many Bible teachings are considered only briefly in our basic study publications. What if a student has difficulty accepting a certain teaching or holds strongly to a false belief? It may be beneficial to consider additional material that thoroughly discusses what the Bible says on that subject. If the student is still not convinced, leave the subject for another time and continue on with his regular study. (John 16:12) As he gains a broader knowledge of the Bible and progresses spiritually, he may come to understand that Bible teaching.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Modest: </span><span class="font13">If you are not sure of the answer to a question, resist the temptation to venture an opinion. (2 Tim. 2:15; 1 Pet. 4:11) Explain that you will research the matter and return with an answer. You might even use the opportunity to teach the student how to do research. Progressively show him how to use the various research tools provided by Jehovah’s organization. In this way he will eventually be able to answer his own questions.—Acts 17:11.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 7—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies - Offering Prayer at the Study</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> In order for Bible students to make spiritual progress, Jehovah’s blessing is essential. (1 Cor. 3:6) Therefore, it is proper to open and close an established study with prayer. We can often do this from the very first study with people who are religiously inclined. With others, we may need to discern the appropriate time to introduce prayer. You might use Psalm 25:4, 5 and 1 John 5:14 to help the student see why prayer should be offered and also use John 15:16 to explain the importance of praying to Jehovah through Jesus Christ.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Who should offer prayer at a Bible study? If a baptized brother accompanies a sister on a study, he would offer prayer, although the sister might conduct the study while wearing a head covering. (1 Cor. 11:5, 10) On the other hand, if an unbaptized male Kingdom publisher accompanies a sister on a study, she would offer prayer. In such a situation, she should wear a head covering when praying as well as when conducting.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> What the Prayer May Include: </span><span class="font13">Prayers at a Bible study need not be lengthy, but they should be specific. Besides seeking God’s blessing on the study and giving thanks for the truths learned, it is fitting to give praise to Jehovah as the Source of instruction. (Isa. 54:13) We can also include expressions that reflect our sincere interest in the student and our appreciation for the organization that Jehovah is using. (1 Thess. 1:2, 3; 2:7, 8) Our asking for Jehovah’s blessing on the student’s efforts to apply what he is learning can help him to see the importance of being a “doer of the word.”—Jas. 1:22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Many are the benefits of prayer. It brings God’s blessing. (Luke 11:13) It emphasizes the seriousness of studying God’s Word. As the student listens to our prayers, he is learning how to pray. (Luke 6:40) Moreover, prayers that spring from a heart filled with love for God and gratitude for his matchless qualities can help the student to develop a personal relationship with Jehovah.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 8—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies - Directing Students to the Organization</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">1</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Our goal in conducting Bible studies is not only to teach doctrinal information but also to help students become part of the Christian congregation. (Zech. 8:23) The brochure </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah‘s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?</span><span class="font12"> can help us to do this. Place a copy with new Bible students, and encourage them to read it. In addition, take a few minutes each week on the study to share a point about Jehovah’s organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Congregation Meetings: </span><span class="font12">The principal way in which Bible students come to appreciate God’s organization is by associating with us at congregation meetings. (1 Cor. 14:24, 25) Therefore, you might begin getting them acquainted by describing the five weekly meetings, one meeting at a time. Mention the title of the next public talk. Show them the material that will be considered at the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> Study and at the Congregation Book Study. Describe the Theocratic Ministry School and the Service Meeting. When you have an assignment in the school, perhaps you could rehearse it with them. Share outstanding points that were presented at the meetings. Use photographs in our publications to help them visualize what takes place. From the very first study, invite them to attend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">3</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> When the Memorial, assemblies, and the visit of the circuit overseer approach, take a few minutes to explain and build enthusiasm for these arrangements. Progressively answer questions such as: Why are we called Jehovah’s Witnesses? Why do we refer to our meeting places as Kingdom Halls? What are the duties of the elders and ministerial servants? How are the preaching work and the territory organized? How is our literature produced? How is the organization financed? What are the roles of the branch office and the Governing Body in overseeing the work?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Instructive Videos: </span><span class="font12">Another way Bible students can see Jehovah’s marvelous organization is by means of our videos. These can take them </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">To the Ends of the Earth,</span><span class="font12"> acquaint them with </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Whole Association of Brothers,</span><span class="font12"> and show them how we are </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">United by Divine Teaching.</span><span class="font12"> A woman who had received our magazines and other literature for five years was moved to tears by the video </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah‘s Witnesses—The Organization Behind the Name.</span><span class="font12"> She had come to trust the Witnesses that visited her, but after watching the video, she felt that she could trust the organization too. A formal study was started with her, and the following week, she attended meetings at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> By spending a few minutes each week with our students and using the tools that have been provided, we can progressively direct Bible students to the one organization that Jehovah is using today.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">[Study Questions]</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. Why is it beneficial to share a point about Jehovah’s organization each week on a Bible study?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. How can you encourage Bible students to attend congregation meetings?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. What features of the organization might we discuss?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">4, 5. How can our videos build appreciation for the organization?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 9—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies -Preparing Students to Witness Informally</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When Andrew and Philip realized that Jesus was the promised Messiah, they could not hold back from telling others the thrilling news. (John 1:40-45) Likewise today, as Bible students begin to exercise faith in what they are learning, they are impelled to speak about it. (2 Cor. 4:13) How can we encourage them to witness informally and prepare them to do so effectively?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> You might simply ask the student whether he has spoken to others about what he has learned from the Bible. Perhaps there are friends and family members whom he could invite to sit in on the study. Ask him if any of his workmates, schoolmates, or other acquaintances have expressed interest. In this way he can begin to give a witness. Help him appreciate the need to exercise discernment and to be respectful and kind when speaking with others about Jehovah God and his purposes.—Col. 4:6; 2 Tim. 2:24, 25.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Sharing Their Beliefs: </span><span class="font13">It is very important to train Bible students to use God’s Word when sharing their beliefs. At selected points during the study, ask the student: “How would you use the Bible to explain this truth to your family?” or “What Bible text would you use to prove this to a friend?” Note how he responds, and show him how to base his teaching on the Scriptures. (2 Tim. 2:15) By so doing, you will be preparing the student to witness both informally and, when he qualifies, in the organized preaching work with the congregation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> It is wise to prepare Bible students to face opposition. (Matt. 10:36; Luke 8:13; 2 Tim. 3:12) When others raise questions or make comments about Jehovah’s Witnesses, this may open the way for students to give a witness. The brochure </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah‘s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?</span><span class="font13"> can equip them to be “ready to make a defense.” (1 Pet. 3:15) It provides accurate information that new ones can use to help well-meaning friends and family members understand our Bible-based beliefs and activities.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 10—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies - Training Students in the House-to-House Ministry</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When the elders determine that a Bible student qualifies as an unbaptized publisher, he may begin to share with the congregation in the public preaching work. (See </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Do Jehovah‘s Will,</span><span class="font13"> pp. 79-81.) How can we help the student to meet the challenge of preaching from house to house?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Preparing Together: </span><span class="font13">There is no substitute for good preparation. Show the student where he can find suggested presentations in </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font13"> and the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, and help him select a simple approach that is practical for the local territory. From the start, encourage him to feature the Bible in his ministry.—2 Tim. 4:2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Practice sessions are very beneficial for a new publisher. As the student rehearses the presentation, show him how to handle tactfully the responses that are common in the territory. (Col. 4:6) Assure him that Christian ministers do not need to know the answer to every question that a householder might raise. Often it is best to handle such questions by offering to do research and to return to discuss the matter further.—Prov. 15:28.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Preaching Together: </span><span class="font13">The first time the student shares in the house-to-house ministry, let him observe as you give the presentation that the two of you prepared together. Then get him involved. In some cases, it may be best to have the new publisher give only part of the presentation, such as reading and commenting on a scripture. Take into consideration the personality and abilities of the student. (Phil. 4:5) Be generous in giving commendation as you progressively train him in the various aspects of the preaching work.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> It is important to help a new publisher establish a regular schedule for participating in the ministry, doing so weekly if possible. (Phil. 3:16) Make definite arrangements to work together in service, and encourage him to work with other zealous ones also. Their example and association will help him to develop skill and find joy in preaching from house to house.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 11—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies - Helping Students to Make Return Visits</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When a Bible student begins to share in the preaching work, he will meet people who show interest in the good news. How can we help the new publisher to make effective return visits and to cultivate the interest he finds?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Preparation for a return visit begins with the initial call. Encourage the student to take a sincere interest in those with whom he speaks. (Phil. 2:4) Progressively train him to draw them out, to listen to their comments, and to note the things that concern them. When someone shows interest, have the new publisher write down the pertinent information about the call. Use that information to help him plan further discussions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Preparing to Return: </span><span class="font13">Review the initial call, and show the student how to select an aspect of the Kingdom message that will appeal to the householder. (1 Cor. 9:19-23) Prepare together a brief presentation that features one Bible text along with a paragraph in a study publication. In addition, prepare a question that can be raised at the conclusion of the discussion to lay the groundwork for the next visit. Show the new publisher how to add to the person’s knowledge of God’s Word with each successive visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> It is also helpful to provide the student with a simple introduction. After greeting the householder, he might say: “I enjoyed our previous conversation, and I have returned to share further Bible information on [mention the topic].” You may also need to show the new publisher how to respond if a different person answers the door.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Follow Up Diligently: </span><span class="font13">Encourage the student to set a good example in returning promptly on all who show interest. Finding people at home may require persistence in calling back. Teach the student how to make appointments to visit again, and help him appreciate the need to return as promised. (Matt. 5:37) Train the new publisher to be kind, considerate, and respectful as he searches for sheeplike ones and cultivates their interest.—Titus 3:2.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Part 12—Conducting Progressive Bible Studies - Helping Students Start and Conduct Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> When our Bible students begin sharing in the field ministry, they may be intimidated by the thought of starting and conducting their own Bible studies. How can we help them develop a positive attitude toward this essential part of our ministry?—Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Once a Bible student qualifies to be an unbaptized publisher, he is likely already taking full advantage of the Theocratic Ministry School. The training he receives in preparing and presenting student assignments will help him to develop the teaching skills that are needed by “a workman with nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of the truth aright.”—2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Teach by Your Example: </span><span class="font13">Jesus trained his disciples by giving clear instruction and setting a fine example. He said: “Everyone that is perfectly instructed will be like his teacher.” (Luke 6:40) Your imitating Jesus by setting a proper example in your own ministry is vital. As your student observes your lead in the ministry, he will appreciate that the objective in making return visits is to start Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Explain that when we offer a study, it is not generally necessary to describe the study arrangement in detail. Often it is best simply to demonstrate the study by using one or perhaps two paragraphs from a study publication. Helpful suggestions for doing this can be found on page 8 of this issue and on page 6 of the January 2002 </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> When appropriate, invite the student to accompany you or another experienced publisher on other Bible studies. He might share in commenting on a paragraph or a key scripture. Thus, by observation, the student will learn much about conducting progressive Bible studies. (Prov. 27:17; 2 Tim. 2:2) Give him commendation, and discuss how he can improve.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> Training new publishers to be teachers of God’s Word will equip them for the “good work” of starting and conducting studies of their own. (2 Tim. 3:17) How satisfying it is to work side by side with them in extending the loving invitation: “Let anyone that wishes take life’s water free”!—Rev. 22:17.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Witness as a Good Neighbor</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Jesus said to “love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matt. 22:39) Undoubtedly, you “work what is good” toward fellow believers, but can you widen out in your love toward those people who live nearby? (Gal. 6:10) In what ways?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> By Identifying Yourself: </span><span class="font13">Do your neighbors know that you are a Witness? If not, why not call on them in field service? The results may surprise you! Or if you would feel more comfortable, try to witness to them informally. When outdoors, you might see them working in their yard or casually walking by on the street. Approach them with a warm smile. Endeavor to speak about your beliefs, the location of the Kingdom Hall, and what goes on there, and let them know whoever else from the neighborhood attends. Extend an invitation to the meetings. Be determined to bear thorough witness about the good news to everyone you know.—Acts 10:42; 28:23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> By Your Exemplary Conduct: </span><span class="font13">Your neighborly conduct speaks volumes about you and may open the way to give a witness. It also “adorns the teaching of God.” (Titus 2:7, 10) Show genuine interest in your neighbors. Be friendly and understanding. Respect their right to privacy and quiet surroundings. If one of them becomes ill, be considerate and offer to help. When a new family moves into the neighborhood, stop by to welcome them. Such kind acts leave a favorable impression and are pleasing to Jehovah.—Heb. 13:16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> By the Appearance of Your Property: </span><span class="font13">Being a good neighbor includes caring for your home so that it is presentable. A home and yard that are clean and attractive are a witness in themselves. But a home that is dirty or that has discarded items lying around will likely detract from the Kingdom message. Thus, it is very important to keep your home, yard, and vehicles clean and in good repair.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Displaying concern for those outside the Christian congregation demonstrates love for your neighbors. What may be the outcome? It may well be that “as a result of your fine works of which they are eyewitnesses,” some of them will “glorify God.”—1 Pet. 2:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark142"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark143"></a>Witnessing Effectively in Public Places</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Like Jesus’ early disciples, Christians today seek to share the good news with people wherever they can be found. (Acts 16:13; 17:17; 20:20, 21) As a result of their efforts to witness in public places, they are finding interest among people who might otherwise never have been contacted in the house-to-house ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> Discernment is needed when witnessing publicly. Usually, it is best to work inconspicuously. For example, if too many publishers witness in the same area or visit the same businesses, some people may feel overwhelmed by our presence. This detracts from the dignity of our work and may limit our effectiveness. What can be done to prevent this from happening? Some congregations that have many areas for public witnessing have found it helpful to organize these into individual territories. (1 Cor. 14:40) In addition, we can contribute to good order by working only in our congregation’s assigned territory unless specific arrangements have been made through the Congregation Service Committee to assist another congregation.—See the November 1998 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font12"> p. 6, pars. 18-19.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Approaching People: </span><span class="font12">When Jesus spoke with a woman at a well, he started with a brief remark and progressively expanded the conversation as her interest became manifest. (John 4:7-26) This approach is also effective in certain settings today. Some publishers find that to get into the proper frame of mind for public witnessing, it is helpful to spend a few minutes greeting people and showing personal interest in them before presenting the Kingdom message. They comment on a topic of local interest, which often leads to a conversation. As others express their concerns, they listen carefully. Before long, they are sharing comfort from God’s Word.—Rom. 15:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cultivating Interest: </span><span class="font12">Each time we have a good discussion, we should try to make arrangements to cultivate the interest. How can we do this? As the discussion is coming to a close, you might take out your notebook and say: “I have enjoyed our conversation. Is there any way we can continue at another time?” Or say: “I would like you to read an article that I am sure will interest you. May I bring it to your home or office?” Some publishers simply ask: “At what number can you be reached?” This often elicits a favorable response.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> Many people who were first contacted in public places have accepted Bible studies. Such studies can be conducted at the person’s home, at his place of employment, in an appropriate public setting, or by telephone. May we make it our aim to start Bible studies as we witness effectively in public places.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Presenting the Good News—By Telephone</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> We prefer to preach the good news to people face-to-face, but circumstances may make witnessing over the telephone a necessary alternative. Publishers temporarily or permanently confined to their homes because of illness or physical disability may make good use of the telephone for witnessing. Also, telephone calls can be very successful in contacting the residents of high-security buildings, mobile-home courts, or other areas where one may not be permitted to enter without a prior invitation. Telephone witnessing presents unique challenges, but with careful thought and planning, these can be overcome.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Sometimes names may be obtained from directories in lobbies of buildings or from mailboxes. Telephone directories can then be used to locate the telephone numbers. This should be done under the direction of the service overseer so that telephone territories can be organized and complete records kept.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO PREPARE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> A warm, pleasing voice is needed for effective telephone witnessing. Avoid making calls early in the day, late at night, and during mealtimes. It is not necessary to let the telephone ring many times. If you reach a telephone answering machine, you might say: “My name is . . . , and I am calling to share the Bible’s hope for the future. I will call you again.” It may be best to treat the call as a not-at-home and telephone again at another time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup> Thoroughly rehearse your presentation beforehand so that it does not sound as if you are reading it. Make the householder feel that you are personally interested in him by attempting to involve him in the conversation. Personalize your call by using your first and last name in your introduction, and strive to use the householder’s name throughout the conversation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> Speak slowly and deliberately, but do not pause unless actually asking a question, as a pause may be interpreted as a question. You might say, “My name is . . . , and I am calling you because I am not able to come to see you personally.” Then, without pausing, you can continue as follows: “The purpose of my call is to invite your opinion on a very interesting question. Have you ever wondered if . . . ?” You can change the question by asking, “Has it ever occurred to you . . . ?” or “Have you ever thought about . . . ?” There are no wrong answers to these questions, and they provide an easy way for the householder to enter the conversation. </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Do not</span><span class="font13"> invite negative responses by saying, “I hope I am not interrupting you” or “I hope you are not too busy.” Assume it is a good time unless the householder tells you otherwise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> If the person asks, “Whom do you represent?” simply say without pausing, “I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, and I am calling to invite your opinion on this interesting question. Have you ever wondered . . . ?” If the householder asks, “Where did you get my telephone number?” you could reply, “From the directory, and I am calling to invite your opinion on this interesting question. Has it ever occurred to you . . . ?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> Some have had success in simply telling the householder that we have a free program for answering Bible questions and then mentioning some of the chapter titles in the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Live Forever </span><span class="font13">book. Or you could say, “Since your building is secured due to high crime, I am calling to invite your opinion. Why do you think there is such a high crime rate today?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> In one high-security building, not much success was experienced until telephone witnessing was tried. The result was that 14 new Bible studies were started. Thus, limited-access buildings can constitute virtually untouched territory and have tremendous potential. With a positive attitude, knowing that we have Jehovah’s help, we may find telephone witnessing another effective way to present the good news.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Telephone Witnessing Can Be Effective</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Why might we consider using telephone witnessing in our ministry? Because it is another means of helping others to obtain accurate knowledge for gaining salvation. (2 Pet. 3:9) Although our primary method of declaring the good news of God’s Kingdom is house-to-house preaching, we willingly take advantage of other methods to reach those who may not be found at home.—Matt. 24:14; Luke 10:1-7; Rev. 14:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> How It Is Organized: </span><span class="font6">As with field service arrangements for house-to-house work, telephone witnessing territory is also provided for the publishers. It may be done alone or with a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">small group of perhaps two or three.</span><span class="font6"> The place that is used should be conducive to the task at hand. Many find it advantageous to sit at a table and have in front of them items that they normally use when preaching from house to house.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> How to Witness by Telephone: </span><span class="font6">When witnessing over the telephone, our presentation should be conversational. Some who are just beginning may read a presentation to the householder but in a conversational manner. Introductions found in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font6"> book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font6"> and the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know the Truth?</span><span class="font6"> can be helpful in this regard. When developing your own presentation, identify a theme, develop a question, and be ready to share a few scriptures that provide the answer. Generally you would offer the same publications that are being offered from house to house. Consider the following reminders: Relax and speak slowly. Be courteous, patient, and friendly, as this can be perceived over the phone. Listen as the householder gives his thoughts, then acknowledge and express appreciation for his comments. Be careful not to mention the donation arrangement, as this could be misinterpreted as a form of telephone solicitation.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> The person you talk to on the telephone may be a shut-in or a person whose work schedule makes it difficult to reach him in the house-to-house ministry. There are others who live in gated communities or in apartments with restricted entrance. Therefore, in an effort to accomplish our ministry more fully and thoroughly, consider using the effective method of telephone witnessing.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Successful Telephone Witnessing</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> Our objective as Jehovah’s Witnesses is not merely to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">engage</span><span class="font13"> in preaching the good news but also to </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">reach everyone possible</span><span class="font13"> with the Kingdom message. (Acts 10:42; 20:24) While the house-to-house work continues to be the principal way to reach people, we realize that not even by this systematic method do we contact everyone. So to “fully accomplish our ministry,” we are using other methods—including telephone witnessing—to find sheeplike individuals.—2 Tim. 4:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> In many places, people live in high-security apartments, multi-family complexes, or gated communities, where it is difficult to engage in our traditional door-to-door method of reaching people. Even in territories where we can work from house to house, a substantial number of people are not at home. However, many publishers are having excellent success in reaching these residents by telephone. In a morning of house-to-house work, one married couple had nine not-at-homes. After returning to the Kingdom Hall, they looked these up in a reverse directory that lists telephone numbers by addresses. They called the numbers and found eight of the householders at home!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup> Are you reluctant to include telephone witnessing in your ministry? One brother admits: “I don’t like anyone calling me at home to sell me anything, so I have a mental block about this type of witnessing.” However, after making just two phone calls, he said: “I love it! I never thought that could happen, but I love it! People are relaxed on the phone, and you have everything you need within reach. This is great!” A sister had a similar reaction: “I was really not excited about telephone witnessing. To tell you the truth, I did not want to do it. But I tried it and found it to be very fruitful. I have 37 return visits from phone witnessing and more studies than I can care for!” If you are willing to try telephone witnessing, you too can be successful.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Organizing for Telephone Witnessing: </span><span class="font13">The witnessing activity of the congregation comes under the supervision of the service overseer. Depending on the need, the body of elders may choose to appoint another elder or a qualified ministerial servant to work closely with him in organizing telephone witnessing. The brother caring for territories should also be involved, since he will assign the territories and keep an up-to-date record. Likewise, the circuit overseer will be interested in the progress of the program.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup> If there are areas in your territory not accessible by door-to-door witnessing, telephone territories should be prepared. The brother assigned will carefully make a list of the addresses that are to be converted into such territories, which should be kept relatively small so that they can be worked regularly. All territory maps with those areas on them should be marked with a notation that the specified section is designated for telephone witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup> From where can you obtain the telephone numbers? A reverse directory that lists phone numbers by addresses may be available at the public library. If a high-security complex has its own telephone list, perhaps you can get the numbers from there. Otherwise, it may be possible to copy the names of the residents from the directory in the lobby and to look them up in a standard telephone book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup> The elders can take an active interest in this work by arranging for those with experience in telephone witnessing to train others, perhaps through the Pioneers Assist Others program. Periodically, a local needs part on the Service Meeting may be devoted to enhancing the success of this feature of witnessing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup> When elders make shepherding calls on shut-ins or the infirm, they can be alert to encourage these ones to participate in telephone witnessing. Perhaps an elder can make a few calls while the publisher observes. Then the publisher may enjoy an opportunity to make a call. Many who have started in this way spend a few minutes each day in this work, and they really love it.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Suggestions for Success: </span><span class="font13">When Jesus sent out his disciples to preach, he “sent them forth by twos.” (Luke 10:1) Why? He knew that by working together they would learn from and encourage each other. The same is true in telephone witnessing. By working as partners, you can learn from each other, discuss your results, and offer suggestions for the next conversation. Even during a phone call, you can help each other locate appropriate information.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup> To promote clear thinking and concentration, sit where you can lay your witnessing materials—Bible, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure, magazines, and so forth—in front of you. Write out some presentations, and have them where you can see them. Be prepared to keep accurate and complete records, including the date and time of day so that you will know when to follow up the interest found.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup> People are often cautious when hearing an unfamiliar voice on the phone. So be warm, friendly, and tactful. The householder has only the sound of your voice to determine your character and sincerity. Relax and speak from your heart. Speak slowly and clearly and with sufficient volume to be heard. Allow the householder opportunity to speak. Use your full name, and mention that you live in the community. We do not want people to think that we are telemarketers. Rather than saying that you are calling all the residents in a particular building or complex, personalize your call.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Telephone Presentations: </span><span class="font13">Many of the introductions on pages 9-15 of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font13"> book can be adapted to telephone witnessing. You might say: “I’m calling you on the phone because I’m unable to come and see you personally. The purpose of my call is to ask your opinion on a very interesting question.” Then state the question.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> The first presentation under the heading “Crime/Safety” could be used this way: “Hello. My name is.................. I live in the community. I want to assure you that I am not selling anything</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">or taking a survey. I am calling because of my concern about the matter of personal safety. There is a lot of crime around us, and it affects our lives. Do you think the time will come when all people will be able to walk on the street at night and feel safe? [Allow for response.] Let me read what God has promised to do.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>14</sup> Using the direct approach to offer Bible studies over the phone has had good results. The study may be demonstrated in a few minutes. Offer to visit the individual at his home to continue the study, or if the person is reluctant, offer to continue the study by phone on another day.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>15</sup> When you close a conversation, have in mind something that will lead to your visiting the person at his home or to mailing a piece of literature. If the person hesitates to give you his address, offer to phone again. It may take several calls before he feels comfortable enough to invite you to his home.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>16</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Taking the Initiative: </span><span class="font13">A 15-year-old sister started her morning service with a phone call. She talked to a woman who agreed to accept a </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font13"> book. When the sister delivered the book to the home, the woman wanted to know how the youth knew her phone number, since it was unlisted. The sister had dialed it by mistake! The woman welcomed a study and is now an unbaptized publisher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>17</sup> A sister signed out a telephone territory but held off working it for three weeks because of fear. What gave her the courage to start? She remembered the January 22, 1997, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> article entitled “When I Am Weak, Then I Am Powerful.” It was about a Witness who preaches by telephone in spite of physical limitations. The sister said: “I prayed to Jehovah and asked for strength. I asked him to give me the proper words to give my presentation.” What was the result of her first day of telephone witnessing? She reports: “Jehovah answered my prayer. The people gave me their attention, and I arranged for a return visit.” Later her telephone witnessing resulted in a Bible study. She concludes: “Jehovah has taught me once more to trust in him and not in myself.”—Prov. 3:5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>18</sup> Presenting the truth by telephone has become a successful method of preaching the good news. Prepare well, and participate wholeheartedly. Do not become discouraged if a favorable response is not forthcoming on the first few tries. Pray for Jehovah’s direction, and compare notes with others who are preaching in this exciting way. With a desire to miss no one in our territory, may we thoroughly carry out our ministry with urgency.—Rom. 10:13, 14.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">What Do You Say to an Answering Machine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The telephone is an effective means of witnessing to people who cannot be found at home or who live in territories that are inaccessible. However, more and more people do not answer the phone—an answering machine does it for them. When this happens, what can you do? Do not hang up. Instead, have a well-prepared response written out that you can read over the phone. Practice doing so in a pleasant, conversational voice. What can you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">You could extend a warm invitation to the householder to attend the next Public Meeting at the Kingdom Hall. You might say: “I am sorry that I did not find you at home. If you would like to hear a Bible-based discussion of [title of public talk], please come to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. The public is invited. No collections are ever taken.” Then state clearly the day and time of the meeting, and give the street address or describe the location of the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Be alert to any new ones who may attend the meetings, introduce yourself to them, and make them feel welcome. Do not forget to offer a free home Bible study!</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">■</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> When witnessing by telephone, should we explain the donation arrangement?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">When we give a witness in person, it may be possible to explain that the worldwide Bible educational work of Jehovah’s Witnesses is supported entirely by voluntary donations and that we are happy to accept such donations. However, no mention of donations or the donation arrangement should be made when witnessing by telephone, as this could be misinterpreted as a form of telephone solicitation. The ministry of Jehovah’s Witnesses is noncommercial in every way.—2 Cor. 2:17.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">■</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> When witnessing by telephone, what should we do if a person requests that Jehovah’s Witnesses not call again?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">The wishes of the person should be respected. A </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dated</span><span class="font6"> note with the name of the person should be placed in the territory envelope so that publishers will avoid calling that number in the future. Once a year, the list of people who have requested that we not call should be reviewed. Under the direction of the service overseer, experienced, tactful publishers can be assigned to contact these people to determine their current feelings.—See the June 1994 </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font6"> Question Box.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">•</span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> What should we keep in mind when writing letters to householders whom we have been unable to find at home?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">For a variety of reasons, we are finding it increasingly difficult to contact people when we visit their homes. Some publishers have found letter writing to be a practical way to reach them. While this can produce some good results, there is a need to consider some reminders that can help us to avoid some difficulties:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do not use the Society’s return address. This would improperly indicate that the correspondence was sent from our offices, causing unnecessary problems and sometimes extra expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Make sure you have the correct address and sufficient postage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do not address letters to “Occupant”; use a specific name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do not leave letters in the door when no one is at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Brief letters are best. Enclose a tract or a magazine rather than attempt to write out a lengthy message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Typewritten letters are much easier to read and create a more favorable impression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Letters are not counted as return visits unless you have personally witnessed to the individual previously.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">If you are writing to a person who formerly showed interest, you should provide an address or phone number so that you can be contacted. Explain our Bible study program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Extend an invitation to the meetings of the local congregation. Give the address and meeting times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Do not continue to send letters to not-at-homes after turning in the territory; the publisher who currently holds the territory is responsible for working it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Comfort the Brokenhearted</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> At no other time in mankind’s history has there been such a need to provide comfort. Following the lead of our King, Christ Jesus, we also work to “bind up the brokenhearted.”—Isa. 61:1.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Approach: </span><span class="font6">To comfort people, our ministry should be characterized by a well-balanced, positive presentation. When we keep discussions about the world’s bad deeds and false doctrines to a minimum, Scriptural truth and the bright hope of God’s comforting promises are foremost in the conversation. This does not mean that Armageddon should not be discussed. Our commission is to proclaim both “the year of goodwill on the part of Jehovah and the day of vengeance on the part of our God,” and to “warn the wicked one from his wicked way.” However, the warning of Armageddon and a description of its destructive results is not meant to overshadow the theme of the good news of God’s Kingdom.—Isa. 61:2; Ezek. 3:18; Matt. 24:14.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> From Door-to-Door: </span><span class="font6">It is not uncommon to find people who are downhearted because of sickness, the death of a loved one, injustices, or economic problems. As imitators of Christ, we are “moved with pity” and show a sympathetic attitude toward those whom we meet in the ministry. (Luke 7:13; Rom. 12:15) Although we share a scripture or two related to the problem, we must prove to be “swift about hearing,” thus allowing the person to express his feelings. (Jas. 1:19) After first listening, we are in a better position to provide comfort.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> At an appropriate time in the conversation, we might say, “I would like to share with you some encouraging words from the Bible.” Good judgment should be used so as not to endeavor to refute every wrong view that the person may express. Rather, our focus should be to provide encouragement and comfort by using the Scriptures to fortify the heart. In this regard, you may consult </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures</span><span class="font6"> pages 117-121 under the heading “Encouragement.” Or you may furnish the householder with a copy of the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed</span><span class="font6"> and review the encouraging material therein.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Look for Opportunities to Comfort Others: </span><span class="font6">Do you know of a neighbor, workmate, schoolmate, or family member that is in need of comfort? Why not make an effort to visit such ones at their home with the goal of sharing comfort from the Scriptures? Knowing why they need comfort, you can prepare for that particular situation. In this regard some have written letters or made telephone calls. True love of neighbor will move us to show fellow feeling and to provide needed comfort from the Scriptures.—Luke 10:25-37.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> Yes, we are commissioned to comfort those who mourn, to lift saddened hearts, and to instill hope for a bright future. This is the comfort that people around the world need. Talking joyfully about the many good things God has promised will bring comfort and hope to the honesthearted. May we always remember the need to bind up the brokenhearted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">How to Preach in Business Territory</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font12"> Would you like to preach in territory where people generally welcome visitors and where not-at-homes are rare? You may be able to do so right in your congregation territory. How? By calling on the businesses found there. Publishers witnessing from store to store often enjoy good results.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12"> Some congregations have business districts as part of their assigned territory. The brother caring for the territory may prepare special map cards of these heavily concentrated business sections. Any residential territory map cards that overlap them should clearly indicate that the businesses are not to be worked as part of the territory. In other territories, businesses can be worked along with the residences. If you have never done business witnessing, start by trying a few smaller stores.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use a Simple Approach: </span><span class="font12">When witnessing from store to store, it is important to dress as you would for a meeting at the Kingdom Hall. It is also good to choose a time when the store is not busy. If possible, enter when there are no customers waiting to be served. Ask to speak to the manager or the person in charge. Be brief and to the point. What might you say?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12"> When speaking with a storekeeper or manager, you might say something like this: “Business people have such full schedules that we rarely find them at home, so we are visiting you at your workplace. Our magazines give a global perspective on current events.” Then feature one brief point from one magazine.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12"> Or you might try this simple approach: “Many people would like to know more about the Bible but have very little time. This tract explains a free study program that is available to help you find answers to your Bible questions.” Then point out pages 4-5 of the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font12"> If the person in charge seems to be busy, you might just offer a tract and say: “I will stop by again when you are not so busy. I would like to know what you think of this tract.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cultivating Interest Shown: </span><span class="font12">You may even be able to conduct a Bible study in business territory. A special pioneer regularly delivered the magazines to a businessman. When the man expressed appreciation for what he was reading, the pioneer demonstrated the Bible study arrangement, using the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font12"> brochure. A study was established right there at the man’s place of work. Taking into account the circumstances, the pioneer limited it to 10 or 15 minutes each time. May we, likewise, continue to search for deserving ones by witnessing in business territory.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">[Study Questions]</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">1. What are some advantages of witnessing in business territory?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">2. How can business witnessing be organized?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">3. What will help us to be effective when witnessing from store to store?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">4-6. What can we say when witnessing to a storekeeper or manager?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">7. How can we cultivate the interest we find in business territory?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Why Tracts Are So Valuable in Our Ministry Today</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> In the January 1, 1991, issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6">, page 30, there was an experience entitled “He Found a Tract on the Track.” It told of a railroad maintenance supervisor who found one of our tracts wedged under a rail. He read the tract immediately and then told his son-in-law: “Today I have found the truth!” Both men ordered more literature and studied it. Now, over a hundred of their descendants are active in the truth. This shows what can result from reading just one tract.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Making Use of Opportunities: </span><span class="font6">The brothers everywhere are making use of opportunities to place tracts. One Witness youth noted that her schoolteacher was feeling sad because of the death of her mother-in-law. The young sister wrote her teacher a comforting letter and enclosed the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span><span class="font6"> The teacher wrote a thank-you note and then spoke with our young sister. Now this teacher regularly accepts the magazines from her.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Some publishers who were witnessing on a street that led to a cemetery saw people whitewashing graves. The publishers used the opportunity to offer them tracts. The next day was a holiday on which many people visit the cemetery, so the publishers decided to stand at the entrance of the cemetery and offer tracts. Over five hundred tracts were placed, with only three persons refusing them. The next year, publishers returned and distributed more than a thousand tracts, with only six refusals. A number of individuals expressed deep appreciation. One man read the tract as he was leaving, and shortly he returned to speak with the sister who had given it to him. He said: “There is someone I would like to have read this message. May I have another one?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> Tracts are a handy size and easy to carry with us wherever we go. When having informal conversations with others, whether strangers or acquaintances, we should strive to make a brief statement that could lead into discussing one of the eight tracts that we now have available. This could be done while talking with neighbors, while shopping or waiting for an appointment, while visiting relatives, or in many other situations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Why Effective: </span><span class="font6">The tracts are appealingly colorful. They are brief. Householders and those we meet in informal situations are not overwhelmed, feeling obligated to do extensive reading. Yet, the message is absorbing and informative. The reader gets a solid Scriptural view of the issue addressed in the tract. After receiving the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font6"> and having it reviewed with him, one young man exclaimed: “Never have I heard such encouraging information about the world’s situation!”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> We want to use these tracts on every appropriate occasion. Many publishers have found them helpful in getting conversations started in house-to-house work. Numerous studies now being conducted were started with a tract. On page 4 of this issue of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font6"> there are some practical suggestions on how to use tracts effectively. Yes, tracts are small but valuable tools for our ministry.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">We Have a New Tool for Starting Studies!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>1</sup> The American woman was a devout Roman Catholic. She faithfully defended the church’s teachings. She even made a pilgrimage to the Vatican. And yet, when one of Jehovah’s Witnesses called at her door, she accepted the offer of a home Bible study. Why? Because she wanted to learn what the Bible says and her church did not offer a home Bible study. What does this experience teach us? That we never know who is likely to accept a free Bible study.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>2</sup> Have you ever hesitated to tell people that we are willing to study the Bible with anyone who is interested? Does everyone in your community know that we offer this free service? How can we make sure that they do? By making use of a new tool! It is an attractive, six-page tract entitled </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Would You Like to Know More About the Bible?</span><span class="font13"> Let’s get acquainted with this tract, subheading by subheading.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Why Read the Bible?” </span><span class="font13">The reasons that the tract gives are very appealing. It explains that the Bible contains “loving instruction from God,” showing how to approach him in prayer for help and how to receive his gift of everlasting life. (1 Thess. 2:13) The tract refers to various Bible “truths that give enlightenment,” such as what happens after we die and why there is so much trouble on earth. It describes “godly principles in the Bible” that when applied bring physical benefits and promote happiness, hope, and other desirable qualities. The tract refers to one more reason for reading the Bible—the prophecies about the future that show what is just ahead of us.—Rev. 21:3, 4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Help in Understanding the Bible”: </span><span class="font13">The tract states: “All of us need help in understanding God’s Word.” Then it describes our method of studying the Bible: “Usually it is best to study the Bible progressively, beginning with basic teachings.” While making it plain that “the Bible is the authority,” the tract specifically mentions the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure as something that will help the student “to understand Scriptural references on a variety of subjects.” The next subheading raises a compelling question.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Are You Willing to Spend Time Each Week to Understand the Bible?” </span><span class="font13">The tract explains that the Bible study can be arranged at a time and place convenient for the student, either in the privacy of his or her own home or even over the telephone. Who can share in the discussion? The tract answers: “Your entire family. Any friends that you choose to invite may also share. Or if you prefer, the discussion can be held with just you.” For how long must one study? It explains: “Many set aside an hour each week to study the Bible. If you are able to spend more time or are limited</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13">to less time each week, the Witnesses will make themselves available to help you.” There is the key! We are willing to adjust to the circumstances of each student.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> “An Invitation to Learn”: </span><span class="font13">A coupon is provided on which the recipient of the tract can request the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure or a visit to explain our free home Bible study program. The cover of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure is shown in full color. Can you not see why this tract will encourage more honesthearted ones to accept our help? Now, how can we make the best use of this new tool?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> To Whom Can You Offer the Tract? </span><span class="font13">The tract can be handed to people in person or left at not-at-homes. It can be distributed from house to house, on the street, and in business territory. Offer it to people whether they accept our literature or refuse it. Insert it into the magazines or other publications that are placed. Enclose it when you are writing letters. Offer to mail it to those whom you contact by telephone. Always have copies with you to distribute when shopping, when using public transportation, and when witnessing informally. Give it to anyone who calls at your door. Offer it to your relatives, neighbors, workmates, schoolmates, and other acquaintances. Endeavor to get this tract into the hands of everyone you meet! Then what?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> If the Response Is Immediate: </span><span class="font13">Some individuals will respond immediately by saying that they would like to have a Bible study. Therefore, whenever engaged in field service activity, be sure you always have two copies of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure—one for the student and one for yourself. If the person is willing, start the study right then and there. Open to the inside cover, and read “How to Use This Brochure.” Then go right to lesson 1, and demonstrate the study. What could be easier?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> If Your Listener Needs Time to Think About It: </span><span class="font13">Before too much time elapses, endeavor to contact him again. When you do, be sure to have the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure with you. Show him the table of contents on the inside cover. Let him pick the subject that looks the most interesting to him. Turn to it, and begin discussing the lesson he chose.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>10</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Following Up Magazine Placements: </span><span class="font13">If you left the tract along with a set of magazines, you might return with this approach: “The last time I called, I was pleased to leave with you a copy of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> magazine. Perhaps you noticed that the full title of the journal is </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower Announcing Jehovah‘s Kingdom.</span><span class="font13"> Today I would like to explain what this Kingdom is and what it will mean for you and your family.” Then open the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font13"> brochure to lesson 6. Beginning with the first paragraph, read and discuss as much as the householder has time for. Then make arrangements to return another day and finish the lesson.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>11</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> Do Not Run Out of Tracts: </span><span class="font13">The service overseer and the brothers who handle literature supplies will want to keep an ample supply of the </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Know the Bible</span><span class="font13"> tract on hand at all times in the congregation. Keep some in your pocket or purse, in your car, at your workplace, at school, near the entrance to your home—wherever they will be handy. Of course, carry some in your witnessing case for those times when you meet someone with whom you can converse about the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>12</sup></span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"> May Jehovah Bless Our Efforts: </span><span class="font13">A desirable goal for all Christians is to teach the truth to someone else. (Matt. 28:19, 20) Are you currently conducting a home Bible study? If you are, can you find time for another one in your weekly schedule? If you are not now conducting a study, surely you wish you were. Pray for Jehovah to bless your efforts to find someone with whom you can study. Then work in harmony with those prayers.—1 John 5:14, 15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font13"><sup>13</sup> We have a new tool for starting studies! Get familiar with it. Distribute it freely. Do all you can “to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share” what you have learned about the Word of God.—1 Tim. 6:18.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Tie In the Tracts With Other Literature</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font12"> Of all the magazines being published today, only </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font12"> can help sincere readers find the path to everlasting life. As you converse with people during April and May, some will show unmistakable interest in the Kingdom message, and you may draw their attention directly to the latest magazines or one of the Society’s colorful brochures. Others may initially show little interest. In such cases, first you might discuss a point or two in a tract; then if the householder shows further interest, tie in the tract with the magazine or brochure you are featuring.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Most people would agree that in today’s world, there are more problems than solutions. Did you know that many of our most serious problems were foretold in the Bible?” Then you may turn to pages 4 and 5 of the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font12"> and discuss some of the problems.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12"> If you are featuring the April 1 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> and the householder shows interest in what you have read from the tract, you can point to the article entitled “Follow the Light of the World” and explain how Jesus Christ will ultimately solve all man’s problems. Then offer to return at a convenient time to discuss the matter further.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> If the April 8 “Awake!” is being highlighted, you could use the introduction outlined in paragraph 2 of this article and then add:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Many are skeptical of the ability of religion and politics to solve our problems, but they wonder whether science has the answer.” Then read an appropriate point in the article “Can Science Meet the Challenges of the 21st Century?” It is quite likely that this article will appeal to many young people, especially students.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> When featuring the “Look!” brochure, you might use a different approach:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Many people wonder what happens to us when we die. Some say we go either to heaven or to hell; others are not sure. The Bible’s answer is both surprising and reassuring.” Then you could introduce and discuss portions of the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">What Hope for Dead Loved Ones?</span><span class="font12"> Thereafter you could refer to pages 16 and 17 in the brochure if the householder shows interest in the tract.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font12"> When witnessing to Jewish people, use the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">A Peaceful New World—Will It Come?,</span><span class="font12"> which features quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. You could ask the householder the two questions presented in the first paragraph of the tract. After he responds, direct his attention to the first paragraph on page 3. This points to the Messiah as the means by which the peaceful new world will come. If the householder shows further interest, use the April 1 </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font12"> in the way suggested in paragraph 3 of this article.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font12"> If you are a new publisher, you will no doubt appreciate a simple approach. Why not obtain a supply of the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font12"> and follow the suggestions outlined above in paragraph 2?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font12"> We are honored to bring the message of salvation to the homes of people. In our search for „deserving ones,’ let us make good use of our tracts and tie them in with other literature when interest is found.—Matt. 10:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Use Tracts to Introduce the </span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Book</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font12"> During the month of June, many publishers will be using tracts to arouse interest in the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived.</span><span class="font12"> This approach helps them to determine the degree of interest and to decide whether it would be appropriate to offer the book to a particular householder on the initial visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Will This World Survive? </span><span class="font12">Tracts are of great assistance in starting conversations. They help to capture the attention of householders because the tracts deal with meaningful subjects that affect them personally.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">For example, you may say something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “In talking with people, we have noticed that many mention their concern over . . . [choose a current event in the news]. It seems that world conditions are going from bad to worse. Some even wonder if this world can survive. How do you feel about that? [Allow householder to respond. Most people are optimistic.] I read something encouraging I would like to share with you. It is in this tract. [Hand householder the tract </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font12"> as you hold an identical tract in your hand.] Notice how Jesus prophesied that . . . ” Read from a paragraph on page 4 or 5 that coincides with the current event mentioned in your introduction. If the individual shows genuine interest, you may decide to show the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font12"> book. If it seems appropriate, turn to additional information on Jesus’ prophecy highlighted in chapter 111. Before leaving, you may be able to explain briefly the overall nature of our worldwide work and describe how it is supported. Also, be sure to raise a question on a subject for discussion when you return.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Life in a Peaceful New World: </span><span class="font12">What does living in a peaceful new world mean to you? Generally, people think of lovely scenes of majestic rivers and peaceful valleys, with beautiful animals living at peace with one another. Those who are distressed by present world conditions may find the prospect of a peaceful new world most refreshing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12"> Are you prepared to offer something refreshing and pleasant to your neighbors, your workmates, and those you meet from house to house?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Using the tract “Life in a Peaceful New World,” you could say something like this:</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">■ “Do you think it will ever be possible for people to live in peace as shown on the cover of this tract? [Allow householder to respond.] Please look at the last sentence in the first paragraph on page 2. It asks: „But is it just a dream, or fantasy, to believe these conditions will ever exist on earth?’ [Then read the next paragraph in the tract.] That quotation about new heavens and a new earth is from the Bible, at 2 Peter 3:13. If it’s convenient for you to get your Bible, we can read Psalm 104:5 to learn more about the earth’s future.” Or you could just read the verse from your Bible. If the individual shows interest, direct the discussion to the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Greatest Man</span><span class="font12"> book, chapter 133.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Using Tracts to Produce Beneficial Results</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>1</sup> Jehovah’s modern-day organization has a history of successfully using tracts. The very name of our legal corporation, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, implies that tracts play a vital part in the dissemination of the good news. From 1881 to 1918, more than 300 million tracts were distributed by Jehovah’s people. Many of those who became part of the remnant of Christ’s brothers during this period were first introduced to the truth by means of these early tracts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> In 1987 renewed emphasis was placed on the use of small tracts with the release of four colorful ones that have been available since then. It was announced at the 1992 “Light Bearers” District Convention that this series of tracts was to be enlarged with the addition of four more colorful and thought-provoking tracts. They are </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed, Enjoy Family Life, Who Really Rules the World?,</span><span class="font6"> and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?</span><span class="font6"> Are you using all eight tracts to produce beneficial results in your ministry?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> Good results come from using the tracts effectively. We will need to familiarize ourselves with each of them. For example, have you read them over carefully to get in mind what each one discusses? Have you thought about what type of person each tract will appeal to? Thoroughly familiarizing yourself with each tract will build your confidence in using them in the house-to-house work as well as in many situations where you can give an informal witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use in the House-to-House Ministry: </span><span class="font6">One circuit overseer writes: “I am having fine success by starting most of my discussions with the tract.” Have you tried this approach? Why not use tracts as a means to introduce your conversation? With eight tracts, we now have eight stimulating introductions to choose from. Each tract gives us an opportunity to start a Bible study either on the initial call or on a return visit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> There are other opportunities for using tracts. During a conversation at the door, you may learn that the person has recently lost a loved one in death or that someone in the family is ill. People who experience great sorrow or who are trying to cope with prolonged difficulties often develop negative emotions and become depressed. How loving it would be to share the encouraging message found in the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort for the Depressed!</span><span class="font6"> You may learn that the person was recently divorced or that he has lost his employment. Such experiences can be traumatic and take quite a toll on the family. Use the questions on page 2 of the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Enjoy Family Life:</span><span class="font6"> “Why are families today bombarded with such serious problems? How can we enjoy family life?” Perhaps these are the very questions that the person has foremost in mind. Even if immediate interest is not apparent, it is possible that he will read the tract later on.—Eccl. 11:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> In some congregations the territory has been worked frequently, and many people already have some of our literature. By using the tracts, we will have an opportunity to discuss something of interest with householders, draw them out, and get them to think about the Kingdom hope. Plant a question in their minds that can be discussed at a later time. Make a return visit, and develop this interest further. In time we may be able to begin studying with them using a brochure or a book they already have.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use Tracts Informally: </span><span class="font6">If we keep tracts within easy reach—in our shirt pocket, coat pocket, purse, or witnessing bag—we can use them on many different occasions, wherever people may be found. Use them when shopping, traveling, or talking to relatives or visitors. Tracts afford us the opportunity to give a brief witness. A tract is something that does not overwhelm a person but is pointed and tactful. It is more readily accepted than a book or the magazines, since there is not so much to read.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> Be alert to opportunities to offer the tracts informally at school or your place of employment, at restaurants, at a gas station, and so forth. When making arrangements to take her grandmother to the doctor, a sister made sure that she had some tracts with her. At the doctor’s office, she started a conversation with an expectant mother. After showing the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World</span><span class="font6"> to the woman, the sister asked: “Would you like to raise your child in a world like the one pictured here?” She was able to follow up that conversation with a visit to the woman’s house. This led to a number of regular return visits.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Bible Studies Can Be Started With Tracts: </span><span class="font6">One circuit overseer reported that the congregation he was visiting started 64 home Bible studies during the week by using tracts when initially greeting the householder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Have you tried offering a Bible study on initial house-to-house calls? By using a tract, you may be able to demonstrate briefly how a study is conducted. One sister did this using the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span><span class="font6"> Pointing to the picture, she asked the householder if she thought our earth would ever be like that. After the householder responded, the sister invited her to read 2 Peter 3:13 and Isaiah 65:17, which are highlighted in the tract. Our sister then said: “These promises are neither a dream nor a fantasy but are actually made in God’s Word, the Bible.” She then arranged to continue the conversation the following week. On the next visit, a number of the woman’s questions were answered and the book </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth</span><span class="font6"> was left. A Bible study resulted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> Are you one who is newly baptized or perhaps an unbaptized publisher who is gaining experience in your ministry? If so, you may want to seek out those who are more experienced and ask for their suggestions on using tracts in your congregation territory. We have many examples in the Bible of those who received encouragement and direction from mature ones in the faith.—Acts 18:24-27; 1 Cor. 4:17.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> The Congregation Book Study conductor can be especially helpful in making arrangements for others to give you assistance in using tracts effectively. Parents have the responsibility to help their children make advancement in the preaching work. One young Witness was trained by her parents to offer the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Life in a Peaceful New World.</span><span class="font6"> While with her mother on a Bible study, she offered a tract to the interested person’s husband. The husband was impressed that a young person would have such strong religious convictions. He thoroughly enjoyed reading the tract. Each time the young girl returned with her mother, she shared a scripture or Bible story that she had prepared especially for him. The man now reads the magazines regularly, has shown interest in the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Revelation Climax</span><span class="font6"> book, and has attended a few meetings. All of this resulted because the parents took time to care for their responsibilities in teaching their daughter to make good use of the tracts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use Our New Tracts Effectively: </span><span class="font6">In using the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Will This World Survive?,</span><span class="font6"> you could introduce yourself and begin your conversation by saying: “Good morning. We are talking to people about the quality of life today. Do you think the quality of life will improve, or will it continue to decline? [Allow for response.] Some think that what is happening in the world today is in fulfillment of Bible prophecy and that the world’s end is near. What do you think?” After the householder responds, offer the tract and draw attention to the three questions in the second paragraph. Then follow the development of the tract to show how a world has ended before and that this one also will end. As the visit is concluded, arrange for another visit to consider the Bible evidence that the end of the world is near.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Many times we find ourselves in a position to share the Kingdom message with others only briefly, such as at work or at school. At your place of employment, a discussion may come up about recent news items concerning government. You could agree that despite all efforts made by leaders who may be wellmeaning, the world has suffered terribly throughout history. Then refer to the bottom paragraph on page 2 of the tract </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Who Really Rules the World?</span><span class="font6"> Read the three thought-provoking questions. If there is no time for a brief conversation, give the person(s) the tract and make arrangements to discuss these questions at another time or place.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> As individuals and families, take time to consider how to present each of these different tracts. Hold practice sessions. How can you use the tracts with the other literature being featured in the field ministry for the month? What appointments do you have coming up where you could take a few tracts along with you? Will you come in contact with someone this week who would benefit from the timely message these tracts offer?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> Deep love for Jehovah and concern for people will motivate us to do all we can in making the good news known. Using tracts regularly will help us do that. One young boy, seven years of age, wanted to help his next-door neighbor make it into the new system, so he gave her a tract, and a Bible study was started. It sounds so simple! But do we appreciate this simple approach in our ministry? The next time we leave a tract with someone, it may lead to a Bible study too. If we make wise use of tracts in preaching the good news of the Kingdom, we are certain to experience beneficial results.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">Are You Using Handbills?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">One day an 11-year-old boy found a handbill advertising a public lecture on the subject of hell. “This keenly interested me,” he later explained, “as it seemed that I was always doing the wrong thing, and so I worried a lot about going to a burning hell when I died.” He attended the lecture, and about a year later, after several sessions of Bible study, he was baptized. Thus began the Christian career of Karl Klein, who later served for many years as a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses. It all began with a handbill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Handbills continue to be an effective witnessing tool today. Many publishers find that handing one to a person is a good way to introduce themselves and start conversations. Parents can involve their young children in the ministry by having them offer a handbill at the door. Publishers who share in witnessing by letter can advertise the meetings by enclosing a handbill. And, of course, handbills are a convenient way to invite Bible students and other interested ones to come to our meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">On the front of the handbill is a brief description of each congregation meeting. Since the Kingdom Hall address and meeting times are not included, you will need to supply that information when offering the handbill. There is space to print or stamp that information on the handbill if desired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Are you making good use of handbills in your ministry?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In some lands more than half of those getting baptized are from a Buddhist background. What is attracting these ones to the truth? How can you present the good news to a Buddhist?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Show Genuine Concern: </span><span class="font11">Many former Buddhists have said that it was not profound reasoning that attracted them to the truth. Rather, they were touched by the genuine personal concern shown to them. An Asian woman living in the United States was so impressed with the friendliness of the sister who called on her that she agreed to study. She could not speak English well, but the sister was patient. When the woman was tired or unable to study, the sister would simply make a friendly visit and arrange for the next session. Eventually the woman, her two sons, and her aged mother got baptized. She returned to the land of her birth and assisted many others to learn the truth. One of her sons now serves at the branch office. What blessings resulted from reflecting Jehovah’s "kindness and love for man"!—Titus 3:4.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Buddhist Thought: </span><span class="font11">Buddhists generally are tolerant of other ideas, but they do not consider it necessary to adhere to specific dogma. So their individual beliefs vary. A common theme in one branch of Buddhist teaching is that life is full of suffering, but by means of enlightenment, one can stop the continuous cycle of rebirth into unsatisfactory lives. It is said that to be liberated from this cycle, one must achieve Nirvana, a state that cannot be described because it is not a place or an event but, rather, a void in which pain and evil are nonexistent. (See </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">What Happens to Us When We Die?,</span><span class="font11"> pages 9-10.) What does this tell us? That it would be counterproductive to engage people in debates on Buddhist philosophy. Instead, discuss common problems that are of concern to all.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Emphasize Mutual Interests: </span><span class="font11">Since Buddhists generally equate life on earth with suffering, the concept of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">everlasting</span><span class="font11"> life on earth may strike them as absurd. Still, all of us share the desire to enjoy happy family life, to see suffering eliminated, and to know the meaning of life. Note how such mutual needs can be highlighted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You might try this introduction:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Today we live in a world where many innocent people suffer. What do you believe is needed to bring an end to pain and misery for all? [Allow for response.] There is an ancient promise that is very comforting to me. [Read Revelation 21:4.] Of course, that time has not yet come, but when it arrives, we would like to see it, wouldn’t we?” Then offer a publication that explains how suffering will end.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> To an older person, you could say:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Perhaps you are as concerned as I am about the current flood of degraded ideas and the effect that these are having on our children. Why is there such an increase in immorality among young people? [Allow for response.] Did you know that this was foretold in a book that started to be written long before the founding of the Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religions? [Read 2 Timothy 3:1-3.] Note that these conditions prevail despite continuous learning. [Read verse 7.] This publication helped me to understand the truth that most people never learn. Would you like to read it?” Offer an appropriate book or brochure.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> Buddhists generally respect the Bible as a sacred writing. So read from it directly. (Heb. 4:12) If the person feels uneasy about the influence of Western culture, mention to him that all of the Bible writers were Asians.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Which Publications Work Best? </span><span class="font10">Published especially for Buddhists, the tract </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Will Suffering Ever End?</span><span class="font10"> is printed in Chinese, Japanese, Sinhalese, and Thai. In addition, many publishers have successfully used the following literature: the books </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Mankind‘s Search for God, The Secret of Family Happiness,</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Questions Young People Ask—Answers That Work;</span><span class="font10"> the brochures </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making All Things New,&quot;</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">What Is the Purpose of Life—How Can You Find It?;</span><span class="font10"> and, if still available, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font10"> No. 35, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Will All People Ever Love One Another?</span><span class="font10"> Most Buddhists who are now learning the truth study the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font10"> brochure first and then the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> Although Buddhist missionaries are said to have arrived in Athens nearly 400 years before Paul preached there, it is uncertain whether he ever met a person influenced by Buddhist thought. However, we do know how Paul felt about witnessing to people of all sorts. He made himself “the slave to all” so that he “might by all means save some.” (1 Cor. 9:19-23) We can do the same by showing personal interest in people and by emphasizing the hope that we hold in common as we witness to everyone we meet.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> As you may know, there are many Hindus living in various lands, including this country. This means that sooner or later you may meet a Hindu in the course of your ministry. When you do, how will you handle the call?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Remember These Points: </span><span class="font11">Missionaries who have successfully witnessed to Hindus say that it is not necessary to make a deep study of Hinduism in order to give an effective witness. A simple, tactful presentation of the truth often brings a positive response. Ask to speak to the head of the household first. If his response is favorable, it will be easier to witness to other family members. At the outset avoid suggesting that you are bringing a message that is superior to what the householder believes or that you want to discuss the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">only</span><span class="font11"> true God or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">oldest</span><span class="font11"> sacred writings. Since many Hindus consider the Bible to be a Western book, you can break down prejudice by explaining that it does not promote colonialism or the superiority of one race over another.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Use the Right Tools: </span><span class="font11">Two brochures have been prepared specifically with Hindus in mind. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Why Should We Worship God in Love and Truth?</span><span class="font11"> is printed in Gujarati and Punjabi. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Problems—Who Will Help Us Solve Them?</span><span class="font11"> is printed in 11 additional Indian languages. Both are available in English. The brochures </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">“Look! I Am Making All Things New”</span><span class="font11"> and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Does God Really Care About Us?</span><span class="font11"> have also proved effective when witnessing to those of Hindu background. The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure and the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge </span><span class="font11">book can be used successfully to conduct Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Establish Common Ground: </span><span class="font11">It is not difficult to find common ground with Hindus. They believe that we are living in a time when wickedness is at its peak and that God will rid the world of its problems through a great catastrophe to be followed by an era of truth. You can see how easily these beliefs can be related to the Bible’s teachings about the last days, the great tribulation, and the coming new world. Since most Hindus view life as a series of problems for which there are no solutions, they are interested in the topics of family life, crime and safety, and what happens at death. Here are two sample presentations that you might try.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> This may appeal to a family man:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■ “I am visiting people who are concerned about the state of family life in many lands today. What do you think will help keep the family together? [Allow for response.] Some people know what the Hindu scriptures say about the family, but they have never had the opportunity to compare this with what the Bible has to say on the subject. I would like to share with you this thought at Colossians 3:12-14.” After reading the scripture, show the householder chapter 15 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book and say: “I would be pleased to spend a little time reading this chapter with you.”</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> A young person might respond to this:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■ “No doubt you believe in God. What do you think God’s purpose is for us?” Allow for a response. Then read Genesis 1:28, and say: “In many places the earth is overpopulated and plagued with problems. Do you think the Creator would be willing to help us solve our problems?” After hearing the response, turn to an appropriate publication.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Enjoy Positive Results: </span><span class="font10">A 22-year-old Hindu man approached a sister who was witnessing in a market and asked for a Bible study. He explained to her that eight years earlier he had overheard a Bible discussion between his mother and her. Although he had been impressed by the Bible’s practical answers to mankind’s problems, his mother was not interested and he had felt that he was too young to pursue the truth on his own. Now as an adult, he wanted to learn more. The young man wasted no time. In only 23 days, he completed his study of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font10"> book, and just four months after he had met the sister at the market, he asked to be baptized!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>8</sup> A brother started a study with a Hindu man whom he met on a train. The man was experiencing difficulties in his marriage. He also had a drinking problem. The man agreed to have the Witness call on him and share the Bible’s advice on family life. The Bible’s moral teachings appealed to him, and he agreed to a Bible study. He and his family began attending meetings together. Later they shared the truth with friends and relatives. So far, six of these people have accepted the truth!</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>9</sup> God’s will is that “all sorts of men should be saved and come to an accurate knowledge of truth.” (1 Tim. 2:4) That includes men and women who profess a non-Christian religion, such as Hinduism. If there are Hindus in your territory, why not visit them soon and use some of the suggestions presented in this article?</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> In the first century, many of “the sons of Israel” responded appreciatively to the preaching of Jesus and his apostles. (Acts 10:36) As was true then, a number of sincere Jews today are wholeheartedly embracing the truth—not only in Israel but also in Russia, the United States, and other countries. Would you like to be more successful in reaching out to Jewish people? The following suggestions will help you give a tactful witness both to religious and to secular Jews.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Witnessing to Religious Jews: </span><span class="font11">It should be realized that religious Jews are often more concerned with observing the traditions of the rabbis than with defining specific doctrines. Indeed, they generally view tradition as having authority equal to the Scriptures. Hence, they are not necessarily interested in discussing deep Bible subjects. They also tend to think of the Bible as a Christian book. For that reason, it is usually best when referring to the Bible to use the terms “the Hebrew Scriptures,” “the Torah,” or “the Scriptures.” An excellent publication prepared especially for the Jewish population is the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Will There Ever Be a World Without War?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> What topics might interest religious Jews? Well, they believe that there is one God, who is keenly interested in man. They also believe that God does intervene in human affairs. You might use these points to establish common ground. In addition, most Jews are keenly aware of the suffering of their people during World War II. They wonder why God permitted such injustice and when wickedness will come to an end. We are well equipped to answer such questions, referring, for example, to what our brothers experienced during the Holocaust.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Of course, to avoid alienating the householder, it is best not to bring up the matter of the identity of the Messiah too soon in the conversation. Instead, you might discuss the role that Moses played in Israel’s history and ask the householder if he believes that Moses’ teachings are relevant today. When it seems appropriate to discuss the identity of the Messiah, you might first read Deuteronomy 18:15, which states: “A prophet from your own midst, from your brothers, like me, is what Jehovah your God will raise up for you—to him you people should listen.” Ask the householder who it was that Moses had in mind when he spoke of a prophet like himself. Then cover a few points in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World Without War</span><span class="font11"> brochure, page 14, paragraphs 17 and 18.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Secular Jews View Matters Differently: </span><span class="font11">Not everyone who identifies himself as Jewish accepts the teachings of Judaism. Many Jews are secular in their outlook. They are more interested in promoting a separate Jewish identity, with its culture, tradition, and education, than in practicing the Jewish religion. Some secular Jews are agnostics—a few are even atheists. Initially, little would be gained by quoting extensively from the Hebrew Scriptures. It would be more beneficial to approach the conversation as you would any discussion with a person who is not religious. You might explain, for example, how the Bible is practical for our day. If the householder does not believe that the Bible is inspired, some points in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World Without War</span><span class="font11"> brochure may be helpful, particularly those found in the section on page 3 entitled “The Bible—Inspired by God?”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> When witnessing to a Jewish person, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Most of us have had the sad experience of losing a loved one in death. What do you think happens to us when we die?” Allow for a response. Then direct the householder to the box entitled “Death and the Soul—What Are They?” on page 22 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World Without War</span><span class="font11"> brochure. The box compares what the Scriptures say about life after death with what the rabbis teach. Then turn to paragraph 17 on page 23, and show that according to the Scriptures, the dead will be resurrected to life on a paradise earth. Offer the brochure. In preparation for the return visit, you might mention that the patriarch Job entertained the resurrection hope. Refer to the scriptures cited at the end of paragraph 17, and offer to return and discuss them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> The books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and Acts record experiences of Jews who listened to and acted on the truth. Jehovah is still holding the way to everlasting life open. Many sincere Jews may yet learn about Jehovah, the true God, so that they too can live forever in God’s new world.—Mic. 4:1-4.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will You Say to a Muslim?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> Have you had the experience of witnessing to a Muslim? If so, you probably learned that Muslims have a fervent belief in God. However, they know little about the coming Paradise on earth as foretold by Jehovah’s prophets, and we would like to share that hope with them. (1 Tim. 2:3, 4) The following information should help you give a good witness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup> Their holy book is the Koran, and their</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">religion is called Islam, which means “submission.” The Koran states that lying and the worship of idols are wrong, that God is one, and that he is no part of a Trinity. Also, it teaches the immortality of the soul, hellfire, and a heavenly paradise. Muslims accept the Bible as God’s Word but believe that it has been changed, while the Koran, still in its original language, has been kept pure.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Be Friendly, Tactful, and Discerning: </span><span class="font11">When engaging a Muslim in conversation, be friendly and tactful. (Prov. 25:15) Bear in mind that Muslim beliefs are firmly entrenched and that most of them have been learned by rote. Thus, reasoning on religious teachings and proving to themselves what God’s will is has not been a part of their spiritual development. (Rom. 12:2) To help Muslims, patience and understanding are vital.—1 Cor. 9:19-23.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> Avoid using expressions that would in a Muslim person’s mind link you with Christendom. Make it clear that you are no part of either Catholic or Protestant religion, that you are different. Refer to the Bible as the Book of God. Since Muslims have an aversion to the term “Son of God,” it is usually best not to use it or to discuss this subject until spiritual progress has been made. However, you can speak about Jesus, referring to him as a prophet or messenger. Avoid arguing. If you observe that anger begins to surface, politely take your leave immediately.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup> It is best to speak with just one person and not with a group. Usually, it is advisable for women to witness to women, and men, to men. Obviously, there are exceptions to this, but good judgment should be used. Also, many Muslims are sensitive about what they consider to be immodest dress and grooming by women. Sisters need to be aware of this.—1 Cor. 10:31-33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Things to Talk About: </span><span class="font11">Speak frankly about the greatness of God and his love. Do not hesitate to state that you are a true</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">believer, that God is one (not a Trinity), and that idol worship is wrong. Speak about the wickedness in the world today—wars, civil</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">unrest, racial hatred, and the hypocrisy that is evident among so many religious people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup> The brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Guidance of God—Our Way to Paradise</span><span class="font11"> will give you further insight into topics that can be used to open conversations with Muslims. It is designed to appeal to Muslims who live in an environment where they may feel free to study the Bible.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> As a presentation, you might say:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11">■ “I am making a special effort to speak to Muslims. I have been reading about your religion and believe that I am right in saying that Muslims believe in one true God and in all the prophets. [Allow for response.] I would like to talk with you about an ancient prophecy that foretells the transformation of the earth into a paradise. May I read to you what the prophet wrote? [Read Isaiah 11:6-9.] This prophecy makes me think of a quotation from the Koran that is found in this brochure.” Turn to page 9 in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Guidance of God</span><span class="font11"> brochure, and read the quotation in bold print, which refers to righteous ones’ inheriting the earth. If interest is shown, continue the conversation by discussing paragraphs 7 to 9 on the opposite page. Leave the brochure, and arrange for a return visit.—For another presentation, see the February 1998 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font11"> page 6, paragraph 27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> When inviting someone to consider the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Guidance of God</span><span class="font11"> brochure, it is best to call it a discussion, not a Bible study. When you complete the brochure, the student should be ready to study the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Require</span><span class="font11"> brochure or the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Knowledge</span><span class="font11"> book.

<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>10</sup> With this knowledge of Islamic beliefs and sensitivities, we can be discerning in our selection of literature that we offer to Muslims and in the way that we witness to them. May Jehovah continue to bless our efforts to assist people of all sorts to call on his name and be saved.—Acts 2:21.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">What Will You Say to an Atheist?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> “I am an atheist,” a professor from Poland told a missionary in Africa. However, the sister was able to have a discussion with the woman and gave her the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font11"> When the missionary returned the next week, the professor told her: “I’m no longer an atheist!” She had read the entire </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creation</span><span class="font11"> book and now asked for a Bible study. What can you do to succeed in giving a witness to those who say that they do not believe in God? First, consider the various reasons why people make this claim.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Factors That Contribute to Disbelief: </span><span class="font11">Not all atheists were raised as such. Many were exposed to a form of religion and at one time believed in God. However, serious health or family problems or certain injustices they experienced weakened their faith. For others, courses taught in schools of higher learning have had a negative impact on their concept of God. Note the following examples of atheists who eventually developed a strong belief in Jehovah God and became his Witnesses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup> A woman in Paris had been born with a debilitating bone disease. Although baptized as a Catholic, she proclaimed herself an atheist. When she asked the nuns why God had allowed her to be born with such a disability, their answer was: “Because he loves you.” She refused to accept that absurd idea. Also, consider a young person in Finland who was diagnosed as having an incurable muscle disease and was confined to a wheelchair. His mother took him to a Pentecostal who claimed to cure sick people. But there was no miraculous healing. As a result, the young man lost interest in God and became an atheist.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>4</sup> A man in Honduras was raised a Catholic but studied Socialist philosophy and atheism. Convinced by university teaching that mankind is the product of evolution, he ceased to believe in God. Similarly, a woman in the United States was raised a Methodist. In college, she took psychology classes. How was her belief affected? She said: “In one summer they destroyed every bit of faith I had in religion.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>5</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Reaching the Hearts of Sincere Ones: </span><span class="font11">Many individuals who say that they do not believe in God would appreciate knowing if there is a solution to the problems of poor health, family discord, injustice, and so forth. They are sincerely interested in finding answers to such questions as: “Why does evil exist?” “Why do bad things happen to good people?” and „What is the meaning of life?’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>6</sup> A husband and wife living in Switzerland had both been raised as atheists. When they were first contacted with the truth, their response was negative. But they had serious family problems and were considering divorce. When the Witness visited again, she showed the couple from the Bible how to overcome their problems. The couple were astonished at the practical counsel contained in the Scriptures, and they agreed to a Bible study. Their marriage was strengthened, they progressed spiritually, and they got baptized.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> What You Can Say to an Atheist: </span><span class="font11">When someone tells you he is an atheist, endeavor to find out the reason why he says that. Is it because of the education he has received, the problems he has experienced, or religious hypocrisy and false teachings he has seen? You might ask him: “Have you always felt this way?” or “What is the reason for your conclusion?” His answer will help you determine what to say. Where powerful arguments are required, the book </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Is There a Creator Who Cares About You?</span><span class="font11"> may be just what is needed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> You might pursue a conversation with an atheist by asking:</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11">■ “Have you ever wondered: “If there is a God, why is there so much suffering and injustice in the world?” [Allow for response. ] May I show you the Bible’s view on this subject?” Read Jeremiah 10:23. After reading it, ask his opinion of the text. Then show him pages 16 and 17 in the brochure </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Will There Ever Be a World Without War?</span><span class="font11"> Or, instead, you may use chapter 10 of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Creator </span><span class="font11">book. Invite him to accept the publication and read the material.—For further suggestions, see the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font11"> book, pages 150-1.</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup> Admittedly, not all atheists will accept the truth. But there are many who are willing to consider another viewpoint. Use logic, persuasion and, above all, the power of God’s Word to help them see the truth.—Acts 28:23, 24; Heb. 4:12.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark151"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">*** sg study 10 pp. 51-52 pars. 9-12 Developing the Art of Teaching ***</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Questions. </span><span class="font12">Questions are especially helpful in effective teaching, as Jesus Christ often demonstrated. (Luke 10:36) So when conducting a Bible study you can follow his method, using the printed questions in the publications. But if you are a thorough teacher, you will not be satisfied if the student simply reads the answer from the book. In such a case you need additional questions that stimulate the student to put the thought into his own words. Sometimes all you need to say is: “That is right, but how would you explain it in your own words?”</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> You will also find </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">leading</span><span class="font12"> questions to be helpful in teaching. These are questions that aid you to direct the mind of the person, on the basis of what he already knows, to a conclusion that perhaps he has never thought about. (Matt. 17:25, 26; 22:41-46) In effect you say to yourself: „I know this student has knowledge of this and that, so if I ask some questions in a logical sequence, he can arrive at the right conclusion. But if I skip the leading questions and outrightly ask him the main question, he may jump to the wrong conclusion.’ In other words, the student has information with which he can arrive at the answer. But he needs help. The easy way, of course, is to tell him the answer. But if you use leading questions, you not only make the answer more acceptable because the student states it himself, but also help him to develop thinking ability. Your questions will lead his mind along the steps of logical thought to the right conclusion. This will be of immeasurable value to him later.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">11</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> At times you will find it desirable to ask </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">viewpoint</span><span class="font12"> questions. By means of them you seek to find out what the student personally believes on a matter. For example, you might ask him what God’s law is on fornication. He may be able to quote a scripture that shows it is wrong. But does the student really agree with the answer he gave? Is that his personal view? You may wish to ask a question to find out what he actually thinks about fornication. You might ask, “What difference does it make whether we live that way or not?” You may then discern areas where more help is needed and you can follow through. Viewpoint questions help you to reach the heart of the student.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> Questions are also helpful in the house-to-house ministry. For example, you want to find out what the householder is thinking so you can better help him to understand Bible truths. You also ask questions and invite his comment because you know that if he is given the opportunity to express his view, he will be more inclined to listen to what you say.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Directing attention to the Great Teachers. </span><span class="font12">As a Christian teacher you should always be conscious of the importance of directing attention to Jehovah God as the Source of life and to Jesus Christ as God’s channel through whom life and blessings come. (John 17:3) Endeavor to develop in others a warm appreciation for these truly Great Teachers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> As you master the art of teaching you will also appreciate the part played by love. If a student really comes to love Jehovah God, then he will serve him faithfully. So, in the course of the study, at appropriate points, draw attention to the significance of what God has done and is doing for sinful men. Highlight the wisdom, justice, love and power of God, those attributes that always blend so wonderfully for the benefit of obedient humans. If a student’s heart is right, in time he too will feel a deep loyalty to Jehovah and a desire to share in magnifying his name.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Applying tactfulness in the field ministry. </span><span class="font12">In the house-to-house ministry, you can show tactfulness by starting your conversation with matters that are of concern to the householder and showing how God’s kingdom will provide the remedy. Appeal to the person’s love of righteousness, to his reason and to his desire for better things. Ridicule or condemnation of his religious views will only close his mind. So, instead of talking on matters that stir up controversy, appeal to the things people generally accept as right. If it is necessary to pass on to something more controversial, first find some point of agreement with the householder and stress that agreement. If you can impress on the mind of the householder the hope-inspiring truths of the Kingdom and its blessings, other matters will in due time be corrected as the person comes to appreciate God’s undeserved kindness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p></li></ul>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> The tactful person makes every effort to encourage the one to whom he is talking to enter into the conversation and reveal his views. Paul endeavored to think from the viewpoint of those to whom he witnessed, thus being better able to bring to bear powerful arguments in favor of the good news. (1 Cor. 9:20-22) We need to do the same. A sympathetic viewing of other people’s circumstances, why they are what they are, why they believe and speak as they do, will help one to deal with them tactfully, with empathy. It may be that different circumstances in life, different experiences, or relying on a different authority accounts for the way they think. Once you have some clue to the thinking of the other party, you can lead into your presentation of the good news in a positive way rather than giving needless offense because of not knowing how the other person thinks and his reasons for thinking that way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> Considering the other person’s viewpoint does not imply a compromising of what is right. Tact is not a distortion of facts. At all times there must be firm adherence to what is right. Otherwise a person may find that instead of being tactful he is compromising the truth. He may find that he is moved by fear of man rather than by love of righteousness. Yet, while tact does not involve compromising the truth, it does involve timing, that is, determining the right time to give out certain information. Sometimes it is tactful simply to ignore something that is said. It may be best to leave certain things for later, until a person is ready for them. As Jesus said to his disciples: “I have many things yet to say to you, but you are not able to bear them at present.” (John 16:12) So while we may not agree with the one with whom we are talking, we do not immediately have to point out every mistaken idea. If we did, it might serve only to close his mind and prevent further discussion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> When a householder, in the course of conversation, brings up many things from the Bible that he says are wrong, it is difficult in a brief time tactfully to refute every objection. Often it is best simply to ignore most of them and discuss only what bears on the particular matter under consideration. Or the householder may try to draw you into worldly arguments. Tactfully avoid involvement, giving the Bible’s answer to such worldly problems. In this way you will imitate the example of Jesus.—Matt. 22:15-22.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> When meeting an angry householder, be tactful and yet firm. Do not compromise the truth just to try to calm him down. Rather, try to understand why he feels as he does, perhaps even asking him why he has that viewpoint. If he comments, you might say that, in turn, you would like to inform him as to why you feel the way you do. But no matter how far you are able to pursue the conversation, tactfulness will get the best results. Remember the counsel at Proverbs 15:1: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage, but a word causing pain makes anger to come up.” However, if some persons show themselves to be unreasonable, then it is best simply to leave.—Matt. 7:6.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark152"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark153"></a>Study 17</span><br><br><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark154"></a>How to Write Letters</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font5"> In the early Christian congregation letters were put to good use in a number of ways. They were a means of keeping in touch with congregations. (Phil. 1:1) They were used to encourage those who had taken on special responsibilities. (2 Tim. 1:1, 2, 6) Letters upbuilt those who had recently become believers or who were faced with hardship. (1 Thess. 1:1-7; 3:1-7) And the early Christians used letters to keep in touch with those who had become close to them in the service of the Lord.— 3 John 1, 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font5"> Theocratic ministers of today also have many reasons for writing letters, and these letters can accomplish much good. Business letters may be necessary at times. Public officials may have to be written to with regard to the Kingdom work. Tenants who live in exclusive apartment buildings, as well as those who live in isolated places, often can be contacted with the “good news” only by means of letters. Some publishers in your congregation may have moved away, or relatives may live at a considerable distance, and you may wish to show your loving concern for them by writing a letter. Also, there are times when you send a letter to express thanks or condolence.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>3</sup></span><span class="font5"> Our letters should be worthy of our God-given ministry. They should be friendly, tactful and show loving consideration for those who read them. They should be positive and upbuilding, rather than negative and expressing a spirit of complaint, which tears down faith and depresses the reader. “Love builds up,” says God’s Word. (1 Cor. 8:1) Consider, too, the overall appearance and impression the letter will give. For the sake of neatness, it helps to have a fairly uniform margin around the sides and bottom of the letter. Smudges do not give a good impression. Also, good spelling and sentence structure deserve attention. However, if you are not skilled at these, do not let it discourage you from writing to friends. Warmth, interest and enthusiasm usually more than make up for errors in spelling and sentence structure. But spelling can be improved by using a dictionary, and sentence structure can improve as we note how others put words and phrases together. With these points in mind, let us now take a closer look at the various types of letters we may have occasion to write in connection with our ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>7</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> To give a witness. </span><span class="font5">Letter writing has also proved valuable in preaching the Kingdom message. In some areas there are large apartments or residence hotels that cannot be worked freely, but we can write letters to the occupants. Then, too, some persons repeatedly are not found at home in the house-to-house work, but they do pick up their mail. And, for a publisher who is confined to his home, writing letters to these people may be the only way he has of sharing the Kingdom message with others.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font5"> When writing a letter to give a witness concerning God’s kingdom, it is good to introduce yourself first. You may also want to state why you are writing instead of making a personal visit. It will impress the recipient as to your earnestness. Then set out what you wanted to tell him personally if you could have visited. It is not difficult to do if you apply the principles that you have been learning in the ministry school. You may use a Scripture presentation from a recent copy of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font5"> or put in your own words a portion out of a recent issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font5"> or the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font5"> You might also enclose a tract, magazine or booklet and encourage the person to read it. Explain why this information is so important. As you do in the house-to-house work, you might suggest that he look up the scriptures in his own Bible. Then, with a view to your cultivating interest that may have been aroused, tell him how to get in touch with you and invite him to do so. Clearly give your name and address so that if he wishes to thank you or to subscribe for The Watchtower or Awake!, he will know where to write.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>9</sup></span><span class="font5"> On the outside of the envelope, always show your own return address. Check to be sure that you have used sufficient postage, especially if you have enclosed literature. If the postage is not adequate, the householder may be charged for the amount due, and this may detract from your effort to give a good witness.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> Answering objections in the field ministry. </span><span class="font12">You will find that you have little difficulty in answering questions in the house-to-house ministry if you are regular in personal study and in attending meetings. But if you do not know the answer to a question that is asked, do not hesitate to tell the householder that. Then offer to get the information and return. If the person is sincere, he will be glad to have you do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> Besides such questions, you may at times encounter objections. How will you handle them? Before you answer objections it is helpful to know something about the thinking of the person. You might ask what gives rise to his objection. For example, a person may object that he has heard that you do not believe in Christ, but in actuality he is simply confused because of the Trinity doctrine. Many objections are the result of such misunderstandings. It is important to come to a mutual understanding of the meaning of key terms before embarking on a discussion. In fact, this may answer the objection and make further discussion of the point unnecessary.</span></p></li>
<li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> It is good, too, when objections are raised, to treat the matter as one of mutual interest, where possible, rather than as something that makes you opponents. So instead of considering an objection as unpleasant or distasteful, view the objection as a point that really does concern the householder. With this in mind, you might tell him that you are glad he brought the matter up. Consider it a key to continued conversation, as something that may open up the person’s mind to receive Bible truths. Why not practice this in the ministry school, including in your talks situations that require you to cope with objections?</span></p></li>
<li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> At times when you are talking to an interested person someone else raises objections in order to disrupt your discussion. In such a situation, you might shift the burden of proof back to the objector. Jesus Christ used counterquestions to silence opposers who tried to interfere with his preaching. (Matt. 22:41-46) So it is good to keep in mind that the burden of proof is properly on the person who makes an assertion about some matter. For example, if a householder tells you: “You people do not believe in the Trinity,” in a tone that implies that such belief is required of Christians, you might say: “I believe everything the Bible teaches. Will you kindly show me from the Bible why I should believe that doctrine?” Then the burden of proof is on the other party to support what he claims to be the truth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> The most authoritative answer to anyone who claims to accept the Scriptures is one taken directly from God’s own Word. It is far more persuasive than anything that we personally might say. Of course, when giving answers, always remain calm and show courtesy, regardless of the attitude of your questioner. This befits a minister of God.</span></p></li>
<li>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup></span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"> At Bible studies. </span><span class="font12">At Bible studies there is usually a friendly, relaxed atmosphere, conducive to reasoning on matters. So, after you answer a student’s question, it is a good practice to ask whether he is satisfied. It may be that some points are still unclear in his mind. If you are not sure of a particular answer, offer to look it up for him. If further help is needed, you can inquire of a more experienced publisher. Remember, when you assist someone to gain a deeper insight into the Bible’s message you may be starting that one on the road to life, even as Philip the evangelist assisted the Ethiopian eunuch by answering his questions.—Acts 8:26-39.</span></p></li>
<li>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> In time it may be better not to answer all the questions brought up at a Bible study, but to save certain ones that will be covered in your further study material. Also, with a view to the student’s own progress, it is good to show him how to find answers by doing research himself. You might refer him to such Bible study helps as the indexes to the Society’s publications or an appropriate chapter in </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth.</span><span class="font12"> Then ask him later what information he found, and his understanding of it. Have in mind his spiritual growth, not merely answering his questions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12"><sup>1</sup> Our desire in the ministry is to direct the attention of everyone to God’s Word, the Bible. It contains the message that we preach, and we want the people to realize that what we say is not of our own originality but from God. People who love God have confidence in the Bible. When it is read to them, they listen and take its counsel to heart. But when they get out their own copy of the Bible and read it for themselves, the impression is considerably deepened. So, in the field ministry, when circumstances make it possible, it is wise to encourage the householder to get out his own copy of the Bible and look up the scriptures with you. Likewise, at congregation meetings, if all are encouraged to use their Bible, newer ones will more readily recognize that it is the source of our beliefs, and all will benefit from the added emphasis of visual impression.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark159"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">*** be p. 62 - p. 64 How to Improve Conversation Skills ***</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark160"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark161"></a>How to Improve Conversation Skills</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">DO YOU generally find it easy to converse with others? For many, the very thought of engaging in conversation, especially with someone they do not know, causes anxiety. Such people may be shy. They may wonder: „What should I talk about? How can I get the discussion started? How can I keep it going?’ Confident, outgoing people may tend to dominate a conversation. Their challenge may be to draw others out and to learn to listen to what is said. So all of us, whether shy or outgoing, need to keep cultivating the art of conversation.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark162"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark163"></a>Start at Home</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To improve your conversation skills, why not start at home? Upbuilding conversation can contribute much to the happiness of a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foremost key to such conversation is caring deeply about one another. (Deut. 6:6, 7; Prov. 4:1-4) When we care, we communicate, and we listen when the other person wants to say something. Another important factor is having something worthwhile to say. If we have a regular program of personal Bible reading and study, there will be much that we can share. Wise use of the booklet </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Examining the Scriptures Daily</span><span class="font5"> can stimulate discussion. During the day, perhaps we have an enjoyable experience in the field service. We may read something that is informative or humorous. We should make it a practice to share these things during wholesome family conversation. This will also help us to converse with people outside the family circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Conversing With a Stranger</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people hesitate to start a conversation with someone they do not know. But because of love for God and for their neighbor, Jehovah’s Witnesses make an earnest effort to learn how to converse in order to share Bible truths with others. What can help you to improve in this area?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The principle stated at Philippians 2:4 is valuable. We are encouraged to keep an eye, “not in personal interest upon just [our] own matters, but also in personal interest upon those of the others.” Think of it this way: If you have never met the person before, he views you as a stranger. How can you put him at ease? A warm smile and a friendly greeting will help. But there is more to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You may have interrupted his thoughts. If you try to get him to discuss what is on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">your</span><span class="font5"> mind without concern for what is on </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font5"> mind, will he respond favorably? What did Jesus do when he met a woman at a well in Samaria? Her mind was on getting water. Jesus initiated his conversation with her on that basis, and he soon turned it into a lively spiritual discussion.—John 4:7-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you are observant, you too can discern what people may be thinking about. Does the person look happy or sad? Is he elderly, possibly infirm? Do you see evidence that there are children in the home? Does it seem that the person is materially well-off or that he struggles to obtain the necessities of life? Do home decorations or personal jewelry indicate a religious influence? If your greeting takes such things into account, the person may view you as someone who shares an interest in common with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If you do not meet the householder face-to-face, perhaps only hearing his voice through a locked door, what might you conclude? The person may live in fear. Could you use that information to start a conversation through the door?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some places it is possible for you to draw a person into conversation by telling him something about yourself—your background, why you have come to his door, why you believe in God, why you began to study the Bible, and how the Bible has helped you. (Acts 26:4-23) Of course, this needs to be done with discretion and with a clear objective in mind. This, in turn, may move the person to tell you something about himself and how he views matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some cultures, hospitality to strangers is customary. People may readily invite you to come in and sit down. Once you are seated, if you make a polite inquiry about the well-being of the family and sincerely listen to the response, the householder may be equally attentive to what you have to say. Other peoples show even more intense interest in visitors, so the preliminary greetings may be extensive. In the process, they may find that they have things in common with you. This can lead to a beneficial spiritual discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What if there are many people in your area who speak languages other than yours? How can you reach these people? If you learn even simple greetings in some of those languages, the people will realize that you are interested in them. This may open the way for further communication.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark164"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark165"></a>How to Continue a Conversation</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">To keep a conversation going, be interested in the thoughts of the other person. Encourage him to express himself if he is willing to do so. Well-chosen questions can help. Viewpoint questions are best because they usually prompt more than a yes or no response. For example, after mentioning a problem of local concern, you could ask: “What do you think has caused this situation?” or “What do you think is the remedy?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you ask a question, listen attentively to the reply. Indicate your genuine interest by a word, a nod, a gesture. Do not interrupt. With an open mind, consider what is being said. “Be swift about hearing, slow about speaking.” (Jas. 1:19) When you do respond, show that you were really listening to what was said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Realize, however, that not everyone will answer your questions. From some people the only response may be raised eyebrows or a smile. Others may simply say yes or no. Do not get frustrated. Be patient. Do not try to force the conversation. If the person is willing to listen, use the opportunity to share upbuilding Scriptural thoughts. In time, the person may come to view you as a friend. Then perhaps he will be willing to share his thoughts more freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As you talk with people, have an eye to the future. If a person raises a number of questions, answer some of them but leave one or two for the next time you talk together. Offer to do research, and then share the results with him. If he does not raise questions, you might conclude your conversation with a question that you believe will interest him. Offer to discuss it on the next call. A wealth of ideas can be found in the book </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures,</span><span class="font5"> the brochure </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">What Does God Require of Us?,</span><span class="font5"> and recent issues of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark166"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark167"></a>Know How You Ought to Answer</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">SOME questions are like icebergs. The most substantial part lies hidden beneath the surface. An underlying issue is often more important than the question itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Even when the inquirer is eager for the answer, your knowing how you ought to answer may involve discerning how much to say and the angle from which to approach the subject. (John 16:12) In some cases, as Jesus indicated to his apostles, a person may ask for information to which he is not entitled or that would really not benefit him.—Acts 1:6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Scriptures counsel us: “Let your utterance be always with graciousness, seasoned with salt, so as to know how you ought to give an answer to each one.” (Col. 4:6) Thus, before we answer, we need to consider not only what we are going to say but how we are going to say it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Discern the Questioner’s Viewpoint</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The Sadducees tried to entrap Jesus with a question about the resurrection of a woman who had been married several times. However, Jesus knew that they actually did not believe in the resurrection. So in his reply, he answered their question in a way that dealt with the mistaken viewpoint that was the underlying basis for that question. Using masterful reasoning and a familiar Scriptural account, Jesus pointed out something that they had never considered previously—clear evidence that God is indeed going to resurrect the dead. His answer so amazed his opposers that they were afraid to question him any further.—Luke 20:27-40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">To know how you ought to answer, you must likewise discern the views and concerns of your questioners. For example, a classmate or a workmate may ask you why you do not celebrate Christmas. Why does he ask? Does he really care about the reason, or is he simply wondering whether you are permitted to have a good time? To find out, you may need to ask what gave rise to the question. Then answer accordingly. You might also use the opportunity to show how following the Bible’s direction protects us from those aspects of the holiday that have become a frustration and a burden to people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Suppose you are invited to speak about Jehovah’s Witnesses to a group of students. After your presentation, they may ask questions. If the questions seem to be sincere and straightforward, answers that are simple and direct may be best. If the questions reflect community prejudices, you might do more good by preceding your answers with brief comments about what can shape popular views on such issues and why Jehovah’s Witnesses choose to let the Bible set the standard for them. Frequently, it is beneficial to view such questions as subjects of concern, not as challenges—even though they may have been presented in that way. Your reply, then, affords you opportunity to broaden the viewpoint of your audience, provide them with accurate information, and explain the Scriptural basis for our beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How will you respond to an employer who does not want to give you time away from work to attend a convention? First, consider things from his viewpoint. Might your offering to do overtime at another time help? If you explain to him that the instruction given at our conventions helps us to be honest, trustworthy workers, might that make a difference? If you show that you are taking his interests into account, perhaps he will also give favorable consideration to what he realizes is important in your life. But what if he wants you to do something dishonest? A clearly stated rejection coupled with a thought from the Scriptures would state your position. But might more good be accomplished if you first reason with him that a person who is willing to lie or steal </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font11"> him might also lie </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font11"> him or steal </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">from</span><span class="font11"> him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">On the other hand, perhaps you are a student who does not want to participate in certain unscriptural activities at school. Remember, the teacher probably does not share your views, and it is his responsibility to maintain discipline in the class. The challenges that face you are (1) to show regard for what concerns him, (2) to explain your position respectfully, and (3) to be firm for what you know will please Jehovah. For best results, more may be needed than a simple, direct statement of what you believe. (Prov. 15:28) If you are young, no doubt your father or mother will help you prepare something to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">At times, you may be required to refute charges brought against you by someone in authority. A police officer, a government official, or a judge might demand that you answer questions about obedience to a certain law, your position of Christian neutrality,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">or your attitude toward participation in patriotic ceremonies. How should you reply? “With a mild temper and deep respect,” the Bible counsels. (1 Pet. 3:15) Also, ask yourself why these issues are of concern, and respectfully acknowledge that concern. Then what? The apostle Paul referred to the guarantees of Roman law, so you might point out legal guarantees that apply in your case. (Acts 22:25-29) Perhaps facts about the position taken by early Christians and by Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide would broaden the official’s viewpoint. Or you might point out how recognition of the authority of God actually motivates people to be more consistently obedient to proper laws of men. (Rom. 13:1-14) Against such a background, a statement of Scriptural reasons for your position might be favorably received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Questioner’s View of the Scriptures</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When deciding how to answer, you may also need to consider your questioner’s view of the Holy Scriptures. Jesus did this when answering the Sadducees’ question about the resurrection. Knowing that they accepted only Moses’ writings, Jesus reasoned on an account contained in the Pentateuch, prefacing his remarks by saying: “But that the dead are raised up even Moses disclosed.” (Luke 20:37) You may likewise find it advantageous to quote from portions of the Bible that your listener accepts and with which he is familiar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">What if your listener does not view the Bible as authoritative? Note what the apostle Paul did in his speech on the Areopagus, as recorded at Acts 17:22-31. He shared Scriptural truths without directly quoting from the Bible. Where necessary, you can do the same. In some places you may have to have several discussions with a person before making direct reference to the Bible. When you do introduce the Bible, you may be wise at first simply to offer some reasons why it is worthy of consideration rather than state firmly that it is God’s Word. Your aim, however, should be to give a clear witness about God’s purpose and, in time, to let your listener see for himself what the Bible says. The Bible is far more persuasive than anything that we personally might say.—Heb. 4:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">“Always With Graciousness”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How appropriate that servants of Jehovah, who himself is gracious, are told to let their speech be “always with graciousness, seasoned with salt”! (Col. 4:6; Ex. 34:6) This means that we ought to speak with kindness, even when it may not seem deserved. Our speech should be in good taste, not rough or tactless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Many people are under tremendous pressure, and daily they are subjected to verbal abuse. When we call on such people, they may speak harshly. How should we respond? The Bible says: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage.” Such an answer can also soften one who has an opposing viewpoint. (Prov. 15:1; 25:15) To people who experience roughness every day, a manner and a voice that express kindness can be so appealing that they may listen to the good news we bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">We have no interest in arguing with those who show no respect for truth. Rather, our desire is to reason from the Scriptures with people who will allow us to do so. Regardless of the situation we encounter, we keep in mind that we ought to answer with kindness and with conviction that the precious promises of God are reliable.—1 Thess. 1:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Personal Decisions and Matters of Conscience</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">When a Bible student or a fellow believer asks what he should do in a given situation, how should you answer? You may know what you would personally do. But each person must bear responsibility for his own decisions in life. (Gal. 6:5) The apostle Paul explained that he encouraged “obedience by faith” among the people to whom he preached. (Rom. 16:26) That is a fine example for us to follow. A person who makes decisions mainly to please his Bible teacher or another human is serving men, not living by faith. (Gal. 1:10) So a simple, direct answer may not be in the best interests of the one who is making the inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">How, then, could you reply in a manner that is consistent with the Bible’s guidelines? You might draw attention to appropriate Bible principles and examples included in the Bible record. In some cases, you might show him how to do research so as to find those principles and examples himself. You could even discuss the principles and the value of the examples but without applying them to the situation at hand. Ask the person if he sees in them something that might help him to make a wise decision. Encourage him to consider in the light of these principles and examples what course would be pleasing to Jehovah. You are thus helping him to „train his own perceptive powers to distinguish both right and wrong.’—Heb. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark168"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">*** be p. 71 - p. 73 Communicating Through Letters ***</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark169"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark170"></a>Communicating Through Letters</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">LETTERS have improved the lives and behavior of millions of people. Most of the books of the Christian Greek Scriptures were originally letters. We today can write letters in order to build up new believers, keep in touch with friends, encourage brothers and sisters who have taken on special responsibilities, fortify those who are facing hardships, and relay information needed to care for congregation activities.—1 Thess. 1:1-7; 5:27; 2 Pet. 3:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Letter writing is also an effective way to witness. In some areas, many people live in high-security apartment buildings or residence hotels that cannot be worked freely. Some are away from home most of the time, so we miss them when we witness from house to house. Others live in isolated places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Sickness, bad weather, or a curfew may at times confine you to your home. Might you be able to write a letter to give a further witness to a relative or to someone you talked to informally? Has one of your Bible students moved? A letter from you might be just what he needs to keep his spiritual interest alive. Or perhaps you can share appropriate Scriptural information with those who have recently got married, become parents, or lost loved ones in death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnessing by Letter</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When writing to witness to someone you have never met, first introduce yourself. You might explain that you are participating in an international volunteer work. If it seems appropriate to do so, mention that you are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Let the person know why you are writing instead of making a personal visit. Write as if you were talking to the person face-to-face. Still, in line with the direction to “prove yourselves cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves,” give serious thought to how much information you should divulge about yourself.—Matt. 10:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Include in the letter what you would have said to the person if you could have visited him. You might adapt an introduction from the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning</span><span class="font5"> book or use a Scriptural presentation from a recent issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry.</span><span class="font5"> You could pose a question and encourage the person to think about it. Some publishers simply explain that we have a free program for answering Bible questions and then cite some of the chapter titles from one of our study aids. A sample letter written to give a witness appears on page 73. It may give you some ideas, but it is good to vary the content. Otherwise, people may, in time, get the same letter repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some people are reluctant to read a long letter from a stranger. So it may be the course of wisdom to keep your letter brief. Bring your letter to a close before the recipient might tire of reading it. It would be appropriate to enclose a printed invitation to meetings at the Kingdom Hall. You could include a tract, a brochure, or an issue of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font5">and explain that these can be provided on a regular basis if desired. Or you could ask if a visit may be made to the recipient’s home to speak with him further on the subject discussed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark171"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark172"></a>A Word About Form</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Take a look now at the sample letter. Notice the following: (1) It looks tidy, not cluttered. (2) Even if the envelope gets misplaced, the recipient will still have the sender’s name and postal address. (3) The purpose of the letter is stated simply and directly in the first paragraph. (4) Each main thought is dealt with in a separate paragraph. (5) In view of its purpose, the letter is neither too casual nor too formal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In a more formal letter, such as one that the congregation secretary might send to the branch office, the name of the congregation would be included, along with the secretary’s own name, his postal address, and the date. The name and address of the person or organization to whom the letter is being sent would also appear. This is followed by an appropriate salutation. To close the letter, in some languages an expression such as “Very truly yours” or “Sincerely” appears above the signature. The signature itself should be handwritten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In any letter, give attention to proper spelling, grammar, punctuation and, of course, neatness. Doing so will lend dignity to your letter and the message that it contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the outside of the envelope, always provide a return address—preferably your own postal address. If you feel that it would be unwise to give your own address when witnessing by letter to strangers, ask the elders if they would approve of your using the return address of the local Kingdom Hall. The Watch Tower Society’s address should never be used for this purpose, as this would improperly indicate that your correspondence was sent from the Society’s offices and would cause confusion. If no return address is provided and literature is included, this too may give the wrong impression that the Society is the sender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Make sure that you affix sufficient postage, especially if you have enclosed literature. If the postage is inadequate, the recipient may be charged for the amount due, and this would detract from your message. Remember that in many countries when a brochure or a magazine is enclosed, the postal rate is more than that required for just a letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The Right Tone</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Once you have completed your letter, read it to evaluate the content. How does it sound? Is it friendly and tactful? Love and kindness are among the qualities that we endeavor to manifest in our dealings with others. (Gal. 5:22, 23) If you detect a negative tone or a hint of pessimism, adjust the wording.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A letter can go places that you cannot. This fact alone makes it a significant tool for the ministry. Since your letter represents you and the things you stand for, give thought to what it says, how it looks, and how it sounds. It may provide just what is needed to start, strengthen, or encourage a precious soul on the road to life.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark177"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark178"></a>What do you need to do?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Show consideration for others, according them honor.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark179"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark180"></a>Why is it important?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Showing respect is a Christian requirement that promotes an atmosphere in which others are more likely to accept what you present to them from the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Scriptures tell us to “honor men of all sorts” and “to speak injuriously of no one.” (1 Pet. 2:17; Titus 3:2) Indeed, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">every</span><span class="font5"> human we meet has “come into existence “in the likeness of God.” (Jas. 3:9) Each person is someone for whom Christ died. (John 3:16) And all deserve to hear the good news in order to act on it and be saved. (2 Pet. 3:9) Some people have qualities or authority that merit special deference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why might some people try to excuse themselves from showing the sort of respect that the Bible encourages? Local culture may dictate who is eligible for honor according to caste, color, gender, health, age, wealth, or social status. Widespread corruption among public officials has eroded respect for authority. In some lands people are greatly dissatisfied with their lot in life, perhaps working long hours just to have the bare necessities, and they are surrounded by people who do not manifest respect. Youths experience peer pressure to join in rebellion against unpopular teachers and other authority figures. Many are influenced by television’s portrayal of children outsmarting and dominating their parents. It takes effort to keep such fleshly concepts from altering our regard for others. Yet, when we accord people dignity, this engenders an atmosphere in which an interchange of ideas is more readily possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Respectful Approach.</span><span class="font5"> A person who is engaging in religious work is expected to show respect by dressing and acting appropriately. What is viewed as appropriate decorum varies from place to place. Some consider it disrespectful to approach another person while wearing a hat or having one hand in a pocket. In other places, people might accept such decorum. Take local feelings into account so as not to offend. Doing so can help you to avoid impediments to your making known the good news effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The same applies to our manner of addressing others, especially those who are elderly. It is generally viewed as impertinent for youths to call adults by their first name unless the youths receive permission to do so. In some places adults too are expected to refrain from addressing strangers by their first name. Also, many languages employ a plural form of the word “you” or some other device to show respect for someone older or in authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Respectful Acknowledgment.</span><span class="font5"> In smaller communities it is expected that you will acknowledge the presence of someone you encounter, either while walking along the road or when entering a room. This is accomplished by means of a simple greeting, a smile, a nod of the head, or even the raising of the eyebrows. Ignoring another person is viewed as disrespectful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some, though, may feel ignored even if you acknowledge their presence. How so? Because of their perception that you fail to see them as individuals. It is not uncommon for people to be categorized by some physical trait. People with disabilities and health problems are often shunned. Yet, God’s Word shows us how to treat such individuals with love and respect. (Matt. 8:2, 3) All of us are affected in some way by our inheritance of Adamic sin. Would you feel respected if others always identified you by your flaws? Would you not rather want to be recognized for your many positive qualities?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respect also involves acknowledging headship. In some places it is necessary to speak to the head of the house before witnessing to others in the household. Although our commission to preach and teach comes from Jehovah, we recognize that parents are the ones authorized by God to train, discipline, and direct their children. (Eph. 6:1-4) Hence, when calling at a home, it is usually appropriate to speak first to the parents before engaging children in any extended discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With age comes life experience that must be respected. (Job 32:6, 7) Acknowledging this helped a young pioneer sister in Sri Lanka who called on an elderly man. He at first objected to her visit, saying: “How can a youngster like you teach me the Bible?” But she replied: “Really, I didn’t come to teach but to share with you something I learned that made me so happy I just have to tell others.” The pioneer’s respectful response aroused the man’s interest. “Then tell me, what did you learn?” he asked. “I have learned how to live forever,” she said. The elderly man began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. Not all older people will voice a desire to be treated with such respect, but most will appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is possible, however, to carry displays of deference too far. In the islands of the Pacific and elsewhere, the respectful use of the customary form of address when approaching village or tribal chiefs can help the Witnesses to gain a hearing ear and an opportunity to speak to both the chiefs and the people under their jurisdiction. Yet, flattery is neither necessary nor proper. (Prov. 29:5) Similarly, a language may include honorifics as part of its grammar, but Christian respect does not require that these be multiplied excessively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Respectful Delivery.</span><span class="font5"> The Bible urges us to explain the reason for our hope “with a mild temper and deep respect.” (1 Pet. 3:15) So, although we might be able quickly to expose the flaws of another person’s viewpoint, is it wise to do so in a manner that may deprive him of his dignity? Might it not be better to listen patiently, perhaps ask why he feels the way he does, and then take his feelings into account as we reason with him from The Scriptures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Respect like that shown in one-on-one situations should also be evident when addressing an audience from the platform. A speaker who respects his audience will not harshly criticize them or exude an attitude that implies: “You could do this if you really wanted to.” Speaking in such a manner only discourages others. How much better to view the audience as an assembly of people who love Jehovah and want to serve him! In imitation of Jesus, we should show understanding when dealing with those who may be spiritually weak, less experienced, or slower to apply Bible counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The audience will sense the speaker’s respect for them if he includes himself as one needing to apply God’s Word more fully. Thus, it is wise to avoid constant use of the personal pronoun “you” when applying scriptures. Note, for example, the difference between the question “Are you doing everything that you can?” and the statement “Each of us does well to ask himself: “Am I doing everything that I can?” The point of each question is the same, but the first implies that the speaker does not put himself on the same level as his audience. The second encourages each person, including the speaker, to analyze his own situation and his own motives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Resist the temptation to make witty remarks just for the sake of making the audience laugh. This detracts from the dignity of the Bible’s message. True, we should take delight in our service to God. There may even be facets of our assigned material that are somewhat humorous. Yet, to reduce serious matters to laughing matters betrays a lack of respect for the audience and for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">May our approach, our demeanor, and our speech always demonstrate that we have come to view others the way that Jehovah has taught us to see them.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark185"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark186"></a>What do you need to do?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">Show discretion in what you say as well as how and when you say it, in order to avoid offending others needlessly.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark187"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark188"></a>Why is it important?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">If you are tactful, people may be inclined to listen with an open mind to the good news. Tactfulness will also help you to maintain good relations with fellow Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">TACT is the ability to deal with other people without giving needless offense. It involves knowing how and when to say things. This does not imply a compromising of what is right or a distortion of facts. Tact should not be confused with fear of man.—Prov. 29:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The fruitage of the spirit provides the finest foundation for being tactful. Thus, a person who is motivated by love does not want to irritate others; he wants to help them. One who is kind and mild-tempered is gentle in his way of doing things. The person who is peaceable seeks ways to promote good relations with others. Even when people are abrasive in their manner, an individual who is long-suffering remains calm.—Gal. 5:22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Regardless of how the Bible’s message is presented, however, some people will take offense at it. Because of the wicked heart condition of the majority of first-century Jews, Jesus Christ became to them “a stone of stumbling and a rock-mass of offense.” (1 Pet. 2:7, 8) In connection with his work of Kingdom proclamation, Jesus said: “I came to start a fire on the earth.” (Luke 12:49) And the message of Jehovah’s Kingdom, which includes the need for humans to recognize the sovereignty of their Creator, continues to be the burning issue that confronts mankind. Many people take offense at the message that God’s Kingdom will soon remove the present wicked system of things. Yet, in obedience to God, we keep on preaching. While doing so, however, we keep in mind the Bible’s counsel: “If possible, as far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men.”—Rom. 12:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tactful When Witnessing.</span><span class="font12"> There are many circumstances under which we speak to others about our faith. Of course, we do so when in the field ministry, but we also seek appropriate opportunities when with relatives, workmates, and schoolmates. In all these settings, tact is needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">If we present the Kingdom message in such a manner that others feel we are giving them a lecture, they may resent it. When they have not asked for help and perhaps do not feel the need for it, they may take offense at any implication that they need to be set straight. How can we avoid giving the wrong impression? Learning the art of friendly conversation can help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Endeavor to begin the conversation by bringing up a subject that is of interest to the other person. If that person is a relative, a coworker, or a schoolmate, you may already know what interests him. Even if you have never met the person before, you might bring up an item that you heard on the news or read in the newspaper. Such subjects usually reflect what is on the minds of many people. When you are working from house to house, be observant. Home decorations, toys in the yard, religious items, and bumper stickers on a car parked in the driveway may provide further indications as to the interests of the householder. When the householder comes to the door, listen as he expresses himself. What he says will either confirm or correct your conclusions about his interests and viewpoint and will provide further indications of what you need to consider in order to give a witness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">As the conversation unfolds, share points from the Bible and Bible-based literature that have a bearing on the subject. But do not dominate the conversation. (Eccl. 3:7) Involve your householder in the discussion if he is willing to share. Be interested in his views and opinions. These may provide the clues you need in order to be tactful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Before you say things, consider how they will sound to the other person. Proverbs 12:8 commends a “mouth of discretion.” The Hebrew expression used here is associated with such concepts as insight and prudence. Thus, discretion involves cautious reserve in speech as a result of thinking a matter through so as to act wisely. Verse 18 of that same chapter of Proverbs warns against “speaking thoughtlessly as with the stabs of a sword.” It is possible to uphold Bible truth without being offensive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Simply showing discernment in your choice of terms may help you to avoid raising a barrier needlessly. If use of the term “the Bible” raises a mental barrier, you might use an expression such as “holy writings” or “a book that is now published in more than 2,000 languages.” If you do refer to the Bible, you might ask the person his opinion of it and then take his comments into account during the rest of your conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Being tactful often involves determining the right time to say things. (Prov. 25:11) You may not agree with all that the other person says, but there is no need to take issue with every unscriptural view he expresses. Do not try to tell the householder everything at once. Jesus told his disciples: “I have many things yet to say to you, but you are not able to bear them at present.”—John 16:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When possible, sincerely commend those to whom you speak. Even when the householder is argumentative, you may still be able to commend him for holding a certain viewpoint. The apostle Paul did this when speaking to the philosophers at the Areopagus in Athens. Philosophers were “conversing with him controversially.” How could he make his point without giving offense? Earlier he observed the many altars they had made to their gods. Instead of condemning the Athenians for their idolatrous worship, he tactfully commended them for their strong religious feelings. He said: “I behold that in all things you seem to be more given to the fear of the deities than others are.” This approach opened the way for him to present his message concerning the true God. As a result, some became believers.—Acts 17:18, 22, 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do not overreact when objections are raised. Keep calm. View these as opportunities to gain some insight into the person’s thinking. You might thank him for expressing his views. What if he abruptly says: “I have my own religion”? You might in a tactful way ask: “Have you been a religious person all your life?” Then, after he responds, add: “Do you think mankind will ever be united in one religion?” This may open the way for further conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Having a proper view of ourselves can help us to be tactful. We are firmly convinced of the rightness of Jehovah’s ways and the truthfulness of his Word. We speak with conviction regarding these things. But there is no reason for us to be self-righteous. (Eccl. 7:15, 16) We are grateful to know the truth and to enjoy Jehovah’s blessing, but we well know that our having his approval is a result of his undeserved kindness and our faith in Christ, not a result of our own righteousness. (Eph. 2:8, 9) We recognize the need to “keep testing whether we are in the faith, to keep proving what we ourselves are.” (2 Cor. 13:5) So when we speak to people about the need to conform to God’s requirements, we humbly apply the Bible’s counsel to ourselves too. It is not our place to sit in judgment of our fellowman. Jehovah “has committed all the judging to the Son,” and it is before his judgment seat that we must answer for what we do.—John 5:22; 2 Cor. 5:10.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark190"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark191"></a>Study 48</span><br><br><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark192"></a>Reasoning Manner</span></h2>
<h2><a name="bookmark193"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark194"></a>What do you need to do?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">Use scriptures, illustrations, and questions in a logical way and in a manner that encourages people to listen and to think.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark195"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark196"></a>Why is it important?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">A blunt, dogmatic approach tends to close minds and hearts. A reasoning manner encourages discussion, gives people something to think about later, and leaves the way open for future conversations. It can be powerfully persuasive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">WE ARE grateful for the changes that God’s Word has brought about in our lives, and we want others to benefit as well. Furthermore, we realize that how people respond to the good news will affect their future prospects. (Matt. 7:13, 14; John 12:48) We earnestly want them to accept the truth. However, our strong convictions and zeal need to be coupled with discernment in order to accomplish the most good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A blunt statement of truth that exposes as false a cherished belief of another person, even when buttressed with the recitation of a long list of Scripture texts, is generally not well received. For example, if popular celebrations are simply denounced as being of pagan origin, this may not change how other people feel about them. A reasoning approach is usually more successful. What is involved in being reasonable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">The Scriptures tell us that “the wisdom from above is . . . peaceable, reasonable.” (Jas. 3:17) The Greek word here rendered “reasonable” literally means “yielding.” Some translations render it “considerate,” “gentle,” or “forbearing.” Notice that reasonableness is associated with peaceableness. At Titus 3:2, it is mentioned along with mildness and is contrasted with belligerence. Philippians 4:5 urges us to be known for our “reasonableness.” A person who is reasonable takes into account the background, circumstances, and feelings of the one to whom he is talking. He is willing to yield when it is appropriate to do so. Dealing with others in such a way helps to open their minds and hearts so that they are more receptive when we reason with them from The Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Where to Begin.</span><span class="font12"> The historian Luke reports that when the apostle Paul was in Thessalonica, he used The Scriptures, “explaining and proving by references that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead.” (Acts 17:2, 3) It is noteworthy that Paul did this in a Jewish synagogue. Those to whom he was speaking recognized the Hebrew Scriptures as an authority. It was appropriate to start with something that they accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">When Paul was speaking to Greeks at the Areopagus in Athens, he did not begin with references to The Scriptures. Instead, he started with things that they knew and accepted, and he used these to lead them to a consideration of the Creator and His purposes.—Acts 17:22-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In modern times, there are billions who do not recognize the Bible as an authority in their lives. But the life of nearly everyone is affected by harsh situations in the present system of things. People long for something better. If you first show concern for what disturbs them and then show how the Bible explains it, such a reasonable approach might move them to listen to what the Bible says about God’s purpose for humankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">It may be that the heritage passed on to a Bible student by his parents included certain religious beliefs and customs. Now, the student learns that those beliefs and customs are not pleasing to God, and he rejects them in favor of what is taught in the Bible. How can the student explain that decision to his parents? They may feel that by rejecting the religious heritage they gave him, he is rejecting them. The Bible student may conclude that before trying to explain from the Bible the basis for his decision, he will need to reassure his parents of his love and respect for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">When to Yield.</span><span class="font12"> Jehovah himself, though having full authority to command, shows outstanding reasonableness. When rescuing Lot and his family from Sodom, Jehovah’s angels urged: “Escape to the mountainous region for fear you may be swept away!” Yet, Lot pleaded: “Not that, please, Jehovah!” He begged to be permitted to flee to Zoar. Jehovah showed consideration for Lot by allowing him to do that; so when other cities were destroyed, Zoar was spared. Later, however, Lot followed Jehovah’s original direction and moved to the mountainous region. (Gen. 19:17-30) Jehovah knew that his way was right, but he patiently showed consideration while Lot came to appreciate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">In order to deal successfully with others, we too need to be reasonable. We may be convinced that the other person is wrong, and we may have in mind powerful arguments that would prove it. But at times it is better not to press the matter. Reasonableness does not mean compromising Jehovah’s standards. It may simply be better to thank the other person for expressing himself or to let some wrong statements pass unchallenged so that you can focus the discussion on something that will accomplish more good. Even if he condemns what you believe, do not overreact. You might ask him why he feels as he does. Listen carefully to his reply. This will give you insight into his thinking. It may also lay the groundwork for constructive conversation at a future time.—Prov. 16:23; 19:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Jehovah has endowed humans with the ability to choose. He allows them to use that ability, even though they may not use it wisely. As Jehovah’s spokesman, Joshua recounted God’s dealings with Israel. But then he said: “Now if it is bad in your eyes to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your forefathers who were on the other side of the River served or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are dwelling. But as for me and my household, we shall serve Jehovah.” (Josh. 24:15) Our assignment today is to give “a witness,” and we speak with conviction, but we do not try to pressure others to believe. (Matt. 24:14) They must choose, and we do not deny them that right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ask Questions.</span><span class="font12"> Jesus set an outstanding example in reasoning with people. He took into account their background and used illustrations that they would readily accept. He also made effective use of questions. This gave others opportunity to express themselves and revealed what was in their hearts. It also encouraged them to reason on the matter being considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">A man versed in the Law asked Jesus: “Teacher, by doing what shall I inherit everlasting life?” Jesus could easily have given him the answer. But he invited the man to express himself. “What is written in the Law? How do </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">you </span><span class="font12">read?” The man answered correctly. Did his giving a correct answer end that discussion? Not at all. Jesus let the man continue, and a question that the man himself asked indicated that he was trying to prove himself righteous. He asked: “Who really is my neighbor?” Rather than give a definition, which the man might have disputed because of the prevailing Jewish attitude toward Gentiles and Samaritans, Jesus invited him to reason on an illustration. It was about a neighborly Samaritan who came to the aid of a traveler that had been robbed and beaten, whereas a priest and a Levite did not. With a simple question, Jesus made sure that the man got the point. Jesus’ manner of reasoning made the expression “neighbor” take on a meaning that this man had never before discerned. (Luke 10:25-37) What a fine example to imitate! Instead of doing all the talking yourself, in effect, thinking for your householder, learn how to use tactful questions and illustrations to encourage your listener to think.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Give Reasons.</span><span class="font12"> When the apostle Paul spoke in the synagogue in Thessalonica, he did more than read from an authority that his audience accepted. Luke reports that Paul explained, proved, and made application of what he read. As a result, “some of them became believers and associated themselves with Paul and Silas.”—Acts 17:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Regardless of who may be in your audience, such a reasoning approach can be beneficial. That is true when you witness to relatives, speak to workmates or schoolmates, talk to strangers in your public witnessing, conduct a Bible study, or give a talk in the congregation. When you read a scripture, the meaning may be plain to you but perhaps not so to someone else. Your explanation or your application may sound like dogmatic assertion. Would isolating and explaining certain key expressions in the scripture help? Could you present supporting evidence, possibly from the context or from another scripture that deals with the subject? Might an illustration demonstrate the reasonableness of what you have said? Would questions help your audience to reason on the matter? Such a reasoning approach leaves a favorable impression and gives others much to think about.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark197"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark198"></a>HOW TO DO IT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">When deciding how to begin your discussion, take into account the background and attitude of your listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Do not challenge every wrong statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Speak with conviction, but recognize that others have the freedom to choose what they will believe, just as you do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Instead of answering questions quickly, use other questions or illustrations to help the inquirer to reason on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">Make it a habit to reason on a scripture by explaining key expressions, showing how the context or other scriptures shed light on the meaning, or using an example to show how the scripture applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">EXERCISES: </span><span class="font12">(1) After you witness to someone who has strong views, analyze the way that you handled the discussion. What evidence did you present? What illustration did you include? What questions did you use? How did you show consideration for his background or feelings? If unable to do this in the field service, try it in a practice session with another publisher. (2) Rehearse how you would reason with someone (a peer or a child) who has in mind doing something that is wrong.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark200"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark201"></a>The Message We Must Proclaim</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah has given us a responsibility and a great privilege, saying: “You are my witnesses, . . . and I am God.” (Isa. 43:12) We are not simply believers. We are witnesses who publicly testify to vital truths contained in God’s inspired Word. What is the message that Jehovah has commissioned us to deliver in our day? It focuses attention on Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, and the Messianic Kingdom.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark202"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark203"></a>“FEAR THE TRUE GOD AND KEEP HIS COMMANDMENTS”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">LONG before the Christian era, Jehovah told faithful Abraham about a provision for “all nations of the earth” to bless themselves. (Gen. 22:18) He also inspired Solomon to write regarding a fundamental requirement that rests on all humans: “Fear the true God and keep his commandments. For this is the whole obligation of man.” (Eccl. 12:13) But how would the people living in all nations learn about these things?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Although there have always been some people who believed God’s word, the Bible indicates that the intensive global witness that would actually reach all nations with the good news was reserved for “the Lord’s day.” This began in 1914. (Rev. 1:10) Concerning this time, Revelation 14:6, 7 foretold that a vital proclamation under angelic direction would be made “to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.” They would be urged: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived, and so worship the One who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.” It is God’s will that this message be delivered. We have the privilege of sharing in that work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“The True God.”</span><span class="font5"> When Jehovah declared, “You are my witnesses,” it was in a setting where the issue of Godship was being debated. (Isa. 43:10) The message that must be delivered is not merely that people should have a religion or believe in a god. Rather, they need to be given the opportunity to learn that the Creator of heaven and earth is the only true God. (Isa. 45:5, 18, 21, 22; John 17:3) Only the true God can reliably foretell the future. It is our privilege to point out that the fulfillment of Jehovah’s word in the past gives sound basis for confidence that everything he has promised for the future will come true.—Josh. 23:14; Isa. 55:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, many to whom we witness worship other gods or claim to worship no god at all. In order to gain a hearing ear, we may need to begin with something of mutual interest. We can benefit from the example recorded at Acts 17:22-31. Notice that although the apostle Paul was tactful, he clearly stated the accountability of all people to the God who is Creator of heaven and earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Making Known God’s Name.</span><span class="font5"> Do not fail to identify the true God by name. Jehovah loves his name. (Ex. 3:15; Isa. 42:8) He wants people to know that name. He caused his illustrious name to be included in the Bible more than 7,000 times. It is our responsibility to acquaint people with it.—Deut. 4:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The future life prospects of all humankind depend on their knowing Jehovah and calling on him in faith. (Joel 2:32; Mal. 3:16; 2 Thess. 1:8) Yet, most people do not know Jehovah. That includes large numbers who profess to worship the God of the Bible. Even if they have a Bible and read it, they still may not know God’s personal name because it has been removed from many modern translations. The only acquaintance that some people have with the name Jehovah is that their religious leaders have told them not to use it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How might we acquaint people with God’s name? Nothing is quite as effective as showing it to them in the Bible—their own copy if possible. In some translations, that name appears thousands of times. In others, it may appear only at Psalm 83:18 or Exodus 6:3-6, or it may be found in a footnote on Exodus 3:14, 15 or 6:3. In a number of translations, substitute expressions, such as “Lord” and “God,” are set in distinctive type when the original-language text contains the personal name of God. Where modern translators have omitted God’s personal name entirely, you may need to use an older Bible translation to show people what has been done. In some lands you might point out the divine name in religious hymns or in an inscription on a public building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even for those who worship other gods, Jeremiah 10:10-13 in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation</span><span class="font5"> can be used effectively. It not only states the name of God but also clearly explains who he is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Do not hide the name Jehovah behind such labels as “God” and “Lord,” as Christendom does. This does not mean that the name has to be used at the beginning of every conversation. Because of prejudice, some people would cut off the discussion. But after establishing a basis for conversation, do not shy away from using the divine name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is noteworthy that the Bible uses the personal name of God more often than the combined number of times that it uses such designations as “Lord” and “God.” Even so, Bible writers did not try to include the divine name in every sentence. They simply did it naturally, freely, and respectfully. That is a good pattern to follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Person Identified by the Name.</span><span class="font5"> Although the fact that God has a personal name is in itself a profound truth, that is only the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In order to love Jehovah and call on him in faith, people need to know the kind of God he is. When Jehovah made his name known to Moses on Mount Sinai, He did much more than just repeat the word “Jehovah.” He drew attention to some of His outstanding qualities. (Ex. 34:6, 7) That is an example for us to imitate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whether you are witnessing to newly interested people or giving talks in the congregation, when you speak about the blessings of the Kingdom, point out what these indicate about the God who makes such promises. When referring to his commandments, emphasize the wisdom and the love that they reflect. Make clear that God’s requirements do not impose a hardship on us but, rather, are designed to benefit us. (Isa. 48:17, 18; Mic. 6:8) Show how each of Jehovah’s expressions of power reveals something about his personality, his standards, his purpose. Draw attention to the balance shown in the way that Jehovah manifests his qualities. Let people hear you express your own feelings about Jehovah. Your love for Jehovah can help to stir up such love in others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The urgent message for our day calls on all people to fear God. By what we say, we should seek to build up such godly fear. This fear is a wholesome fear, an awe of Jehovah, a profound reverence for him. (Ps. 89:7) It includes an awareness that Jehovah is the supreme Judge and that our future life prospects depend on our having his approval. (Luke 12:5; Rom. 14:12) Such fear, therefore, is intertwined with deep love for him and, consequently, an intense desire to please him. (Deut. 10:12, 13) Godly fear also moves us to hate what is bad, to obey God’s commandments, and to worship him with a complete heart. (Deut. 5:29; 1 Chron. 28:9; Prov. 8:13) It safeguards us against trying to serve God while loving things of the world.—1 John 2:15-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">God’s Name—“A Strong Tower.”</span><span class="font5"> People who truly come to know Jehovah enjoy great protection. This is not simply because they use his personal name or can list some of his qualities. It is because they put their trust in Jehovah himself. Regarding them, Proverbs 18:10 states: “The name of Jehovah is a strong tower. Into it the righteous runs and is given protection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Make good use of opportunities to urge others to trust in Jehovah. (Ps. 37:3; Prov. 3:5, 6) Such trust shows faith in Jehovah and his promises. (Heb. 11:6) When people “call on the name of Jehovah” because they know that he is the Universal Sovereign, love his ways, and fully believe that true salvation can come only from him, then—God’s Word assures us—they will be saved. (Rom. 10:13, 14) As you teach others, help them to build up that sort of faith in connection with every aspect of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people face overwhelming personal problems. They may not see a way out. Urge them to learn Jehovah’s ways, to trust in him, and to apply what they learn. (Ps. 25:5) Encourage them to pray earnestly for God’s help and to thank him for his blessings. (Phil. 4:6, 7) When they come to know Jehovah, not simply by reading certain statements in the Bible but also by experiencing the fulfillment of his promises in their own lives, they will begin to enjoy the security that comes with truly appreciating what the name of Jehovah represents.—Ps. 34:8; Jer. 17:7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Use well every opportunity to help people to appreciate the wisdom of fearing the true God, Jehovah, and keeping his commandments.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark204"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark205"></a>“BEARING WITNESS TO JESUS”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">AFTER his resurrection and before his return to heaven, Jesus Christ gave instructions to his disciples, saying: “You will be witnesses of me . . . to the most distant part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8) Loyal servants of God in our day are described as those who “have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.” (Rev. 12:17) How diligent are you about giving that witness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many people who sincerely say that they believe in Jesus know nothing of his prehuman existence. They do not realize that he truly was human when on earth. They do not comprehend what is meant by his being the Son of God. They know very little about his role in the fulfillment of God’s purpose. They do not know what he is doing now, and they do not realize how their lives will be affected by what he does in the future. They may even mistakenly think that Jehovah’s Witnesses do not believe in Jesus. It is our privilege to endeavor to make known the truth about these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Still other people do not believe that anyone like the Jesus described in the Bible really lived. Some view Jesus merely as a great man. Many reject the idea that he is God’s Son. “Bearing witness to Jesus” among such people requires much effort, patience, and tactfulness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regardless of the viewpoint of your listeners, they need to take in knowledge of Jesus Christ if they are to avail themselves of God’s provision for eternal life. (John 17:3) God’s clearly expressed will is that all who live must “openly acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord” and must submit to his authority. (Phil. 2:9-11) Thus, we cannot simply avoid the issue when we encounter people who have strong but wrong opinions or outright prejudice. Whereas in some cases we can speak freely about Jesus Christ—even on our initial visit—in others, we may need to make discreet comments that help our listeners to begin thinking correctly about him. We may also need to think of ways to introduce additional aspects of the subject on future visits. However, it may not be possible to discuss all that is involved until we conduct a home Bible study with a person.—1 Tim. 2:3-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jesus’ Vital Place in God’s Purpose.</span><span class="font5"> We need to help people appreciate that since Jesus is “the way” and ‘no one comes to the Father except through him,’ it is impossible to have an approved relationship with God without faith in Jesus Christ. (John 14:6) Unless a person realizes the vital role that Jehovah has assigned to his firstborn Son, it is impossible to understand the Bible. Why? Because Jehovah made this Son the key figure in the outworking of all His purposes. (Col. 1:17-20) Bible prophecy revolves around this fact. (Rev. 19:10) Jesus Christ is the one through whom the solution is provided for all the problems raised by Satan’s rebellion and the sin of Adam.—Heb. 2:5-9, 14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To appreciate Christ’s role, a person must recognize that humans are in a lamentable condition from which they cannot free themselves. All of us are born in sin. This may affect us in various ways during our lifetime. Sooner or later, however, it results in death. (Rom. 3:23; 5:12) Reason on that fact with those to whom you witness. Then point out that through the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, Jehovah has lovingly made deliverance from sin and death possible for those who exercise faith in that provision. (Mark 10:45; Heb. 2:9) This opens the way for them to enjoy everlasting life in perfection. (John 3:16, 36) It is not possible in any other way. (Acts 4:12) As a teacher, whether in private or in the congregation, do more than simply state these facts. Kindly and patiently build in your listeners a feeling of gratitude for Christ’s role as our Redeemer. Appreciation for this provision can have a profound effect on a person’s attitude, conduct, and goals in life.— 2 Cor. 5:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Of course, Jesus laid down his life in sacrifice just once. (Heb. 9:28) However, he is actively serving as High Priest now. Help others to understand what that means. Are they experiencing stress, disappointment, suffering, or problems because of unkindness on the part of people around them? When Jesus was a human, he experienced all of these. He knows how </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font5"> feel. Because of imperfection, do we feel the need for God’s mercy? If we pray to God for forgiveness on the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice, Jesus acts as “a helper with the Father.” Compassionately, he “pleads for us.” (1 John 2:1,2; Rom. 8:34) On the basis of Jesus’ sacrifice and through his services as High Priest, we are able to approach Jehovah’s “throne of undeserved kindness” to receive help at the right time. (Heb. 4:15, 16) Though we are imperfect, the help that Jesus provides as High Priest enables us to serve God with a clean conscience.—Heb. 9:13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Additionally, Jesus exercises great authority as the one designated by God to be Head of the Christian congregation. (Matt. 28:18; Eph. 1:22, 23) As such, he provides needed direction in harmony with God’s will. When you teach others, help them to appreciate that Jesus Christ, and no human, is the Head of the congregation. (Matt. 23:10) From your initial contact with interested ones, invite them to meetings of the local congregation, where we study the Bible with the help of material provided through “the faithful and discreet slave.” Explain to them not only who the “slave” is but also who the Master is so that they become aware of Jesus’ headship. (Matt. 24:45-47) Introduce them to the elders, and explain the Scriptural qualifications that these must meet. (1 Tim. 3:1-7; Titus 1:5-9) Point out that the congregation does not belong to the elders but that they help us to walk in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. (Acts 20:28; Eph. 4:16; 1 Pet. 5:2, 3) Help these interested ones see that there is an organized, worldwide society operating under Christ’s headship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the Gospels, we learn that when Jesus entered Jerusalem shortly before his death, his disciples hailed him as “the One coming as the King in Jehovah’s name!” (Luke 19:38) As people study the Bible more deeply, they learn that Jehovah has now invested Jesus with ruling authority that affects people of all nations. (Dan. 7:13, 14) When you give talks in the congregation or conduct studies, build appreciation for what Jesus’ rulership should mean to all of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Emphasize that our way of life shows whether we really believe that Jesus Christ is King and whether we willingly submit to his rulership. Highlight the work that Jesus, after being anointed as King, assigned his followers to do. (Matt. 24:14; 28:18-20) Discuss what Jesus, the Wonderful Counselor, said regarding priorities in life. (Isa. 9:6, 7; Matt. 6:19-34) Direct attention to the spirit that the Prince of Peace said his followers would manifest. (Matt. 20:25-27; John 13:35) Be careful not to take it upon yourself to judge whether others are doing as much as they should, but encourage them to consider what their actions indicate about their submission to Christ’s kingship. As you do so, acknowledge your need to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Laying Christ as the Foundation.</span><span class="font5"> The Bible likens the work of making a Christian disciple to building a structure upon Jesus Christ as the foundation. (1 Cor. 3:10-15) To accomplish this, help people to know Jesus as he is described in the Bible. Exercise care that they do not look to you as the one they are following. (1 Cor. 3:4-7) Direct their attention to Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the foundation has been laid well, students will appreciate that Christ left a model for us “to follow his steps closely.” (1 Pet. 2:21) To build on that, encourage students to read the Gospels not merely as truthful history but as a pattern to be followed. Help them to take to heart the attitudes and qualities that characterized Jesus. Encourage them to observe how Jesus felt about his Father, how he dealt with temptations and trials, how he showed submission to God, and how he dealt with humans under various circumstances. Emphasize the activity with which Jesus filled his life. Then, when faced with decisions and trials in life, a student will ask himself: “What would Jesus do in this situation? Will my course show proper appreciation for what he has done for me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">When you speak before the congregation, do not conclude that since your brothers already have faith in Jesus, there is no need to draw special attention to him. What you say will mean more if you build on that faith. When you speak about meetings, connect this with Jesus’ role as Head of the congregation. When you discuss the field ministry, draw attention to the spirit Jesus showed as he carried on his ministry, and present the ministry in the light of what Christ as King is doing to gather people for preservation into the new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is evident that more is needed than simply learning basic facts about Jesus. To become real Christians, people must exercise faith in him and truly love him. Such love motivates loyal obedience. (John 14:15, 21) It enables people to stand firm in the faith under adversity, to continue to walk in Christ’s footsteps all the days of their life, to prove themselves mature Christians who are firmly “rooted and established on the foundation.” (Eph. 3:17) Such a course brings glory to Jehovah, the God and Father of Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark206"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>“THIS GOOD NEWS OF THE KINGDOM”</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">WHEN providing details regarding the sign of his presence and the conclusion of the system of things, Jesus foretold: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.”—Matt. 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Exactly what is this message that is to be given such wide publicity? It is about the Kingdom for which Jesus taught us to pray to God, saying: “Let your kingdom come.” (Matt. 6:10) Revelation 11:15 describes it as “the kingdom of our Lord [Jehovah] and of his Christ” because the ruling authority originates with Jehovah and is conferred upon Christ as King. Note, however, that the message that Jesus said would be proclaimed in our day goes beyond what his followers preached in the first century. They told people: “The kingdom of God has come near to you.” (Luke 10:9) Jesus, the one anointed to be King, was then in their midst. But as recorded at Matthew 24:14, Jesus foretold the worldwide announcement of another development in the fulfillment of God’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prophet Daniel was given a vision of this development. He saw “someone like a son of man,” Jesus Christ, receiving from “the Ancient of Days,” Jehovah God, “rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.” (Dan. 7:13, 14) That event of universal significance took place in heaven in the year 1914. Thereafter, the Devil and his demons were hurled down to the earth. (Rev. 12:7-10) The old system of things had entered its last days. But before it is completely removed, a global proclamation is being made that Jehovah’s Messianic King now rules from his heavenly throne. People everywhere are being put on notice. Their response gives evidence of their attitude toward the Most High as Ruler in “the kingdom of mankind.”—Dan. 4:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">True, more is yet to come—much more! We still pray, “Let your kingdom come,” but it is not with the idea that the establishment of God’s Kingdom is yet future. Rather, it is with the intent that the heavenly Kingdom will act in a decisive way to fulfill such prophecies as Daniel 2:44 and Revelation 21:2-4. It will transform the earth into a paradise filled with people who love God and their fellowman. As we preach “this good news of the Kingdom,” we point to those future prospects. But we also confidently make known that Jehovah has already conferred full ruling authority on his Son. Are you emphasizing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font5"> good news when you witness about the Kingdom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Explaining the Kingdom.</span><span class="font5"> How can we fulfill our commission to announce God’s Kingdom? We may arouse interest by starting conversations on a variety of subjects, but it should soon become clear that our message is about God’s Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An important aspect of this work involves reading or quoting scriptures that refer to the Kingdom. When you refer to the Kingdom, be sure that those to whom you speak understand what it is. More may be required than simply saying that God’s Kingdom is a government. Some people may find it difficult to think of something invisible as a government. You might reason with them in various ways. For example, gravity is invisible, but it has a powerful effect on our lives. We cannot see the One who made the law of gravity, but it is obvious that he has great power. The Bible refers to him as “the King of eternity.” (1 Tim. 1:17) Or you might reason that in a large country, many people have never been to the capital or seen their ruler in person. They learn about these through news reports. Likewise, the Bible, published in over 2,200 languages, tells us about God’s Kingdom; it lets us know who has been entrusted with authority and what the Kingdom is doing. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower,</span><span class="font5"> published in more languages than any other periodical, is devoted to “Announcing Jehovah’s Kingdom,” as stated on the front cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To help people understand what the Kingdom is, you might mention some of the things that they want governments to provide: economic security, peace, freedom from crime, impartial treatment of all ethnic groups, education, and health care. Show that only by means of God’s Kingdom will these and all other wholesome desires of mankind be fully satisfied.—Ps. 145:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Endeavor to stimulate a desire on the part of people to be subjects of the Kingdom, in which Jesus Christ rules as King. Point to the miracles he performed as previews of what he will do as heavenly King. Speak often of the appealing qualities he manifested. (Matt. 8:2, 3; 11:28-30) Explain that he laid down his life for us and that God thereafter raised him to immortal life in the heavens. It is from there that he rules as King.—Acts 2:29-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Emphasize that God’s Kingdom is now ruling from the heavens. Realize, however, that most people do not see the conditions that they think would be evidence of such rule. Acknowledge that, and ask if they know what </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Jesus Christ</span><span class="font5"> said would be evidence of it. Highlight some of the features of the composite sign found in Matthew chapter 24, Mark chapter 13, or Luke chapter 21. Then ask why Christ’s enthronement in heaven would lead to such conditions on earth. Direct attention to Revelation 12:7-10, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As tangible evidence of what God’s Kingdom is doing, read Matthew 24:14, and describe the global program of Bible education that is taking place now. (Isa. 54:13) Tell people about the various schools from which Jehovah’s Witnesses benefit—all based on the Bible, all held free of charge. Explain that in addition to our house-to-house ministry, we offer free home instruction in the Bible to individuals and families in over 230 lands. What human government is in a position to provide such an extensive educational program not only for its subjects but for people earth wide? Invite people to come to the Kingdom Hall, to attend assemblies and conventions of Jehovah’s Witnesses, to see evidence of how such education is affecting the lives of people.—Isa. 2:2-4; 32:1, 17; John 13:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But will the householder realize how his own life is affected? You might tactfully point out that the purpose of your visit is to discuss the opportunity that is open to all to choose life as subjects of God’s Kingdom. How? By learning what God requires and living in harmony with it now.—Deut. 30:19, 20; Rev. 22:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Helping Others Put the Kingdom First.</span><span class="font5"> Even after a person accepts the Kingdom message, there are decisions that he must make. What priority will he give God’s Kingdom in his own life? Jesus urged his disciples to “keep on . . . seeking first the kingdom.” (Matt. 6:33) How can we help fellow Christians to do that? By setting a good example ourselves and by discussing opportunities that are available. At times, by asking whether a person has considered certain possibilities and by sharing experiences to show what others are doing. By discussing Bible accounts in such a way that these deepen one’s love for Jehovah. By stressing the reality of the Kingdom. By emphasizing how important the work of Kingdom proclamation really is. The greatest good is often done, not by telling people what needs to be done, but by stimulating in them a desire to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without a doubt, the vital message that all of us must proclaim focuses primary attention on Jehovah God, Jesus Christ, and the Kingdom. The vital truths regarding these should be emphasized in our public witnessing, in our congregations, and in our personal lives. When we do that, we demonstrate that we are truly benefiting from our Theocratic Ministry School education.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark88"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark227"></a>Introductions for Use in the Field Ministry</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Comments: </span><span class="font11">In determining the kind of introduction to use when you share in the field ministry, three things deserve careful consideration: (1) The message that we are commissioned to deliver is “this good news of the kingdom.” (Matt. 24:14) Even when we are not discussing it directly, we should have in mind helping people to see the need for it, or perhaps clearing out of the way obstacles to their being willing to consider it. (2) Genuine concern for the welfare of the people we meet will help us, as it did Jesus, to reach hearts. (Mark 6:34) Such genuine interest may be indicated by a warm smile and a friendly manner, willingness to listen when they speak and then adapting our remarks accordingly, also by our use of questions that encourage them to express themselves so we can better understand their viewpoint. First Corinthians 9:19-23 shows that the apostle Paul adapted his presentation of the good news to the circumstances of the people to whom he spoke. (3) In some parts of the world, visitors are expected to observe certain formalities before stating the reason they are calling. Elsewhere the householder may expect an uninvited visitor to get to the point quickly.—Compare Luke 10:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The following introductions show how some experienced Witnesses begin conversations. If the introductions you are now using seldom open the way for conversations, try some of these suggestions. When you do so, you will no doubt want to put them in your own words. Also, you will find it helpful to get suggestions from other Witnesses in your congregation who have good success in approaching people.</span></p>

What do you believe Armageddon will mean to mankind? . . . Actually, the name Armageddon is taken from the Bible, and it means something quite different from what the word is commonly used to express. (Rev. 16:14, 16) The Bible also shows that there are things we personally can do with a view to survival.

<li>
<p><span class="font12">• “We’re talking to our neighbors about where to find practical help to cope with problems of life. In the past, many people consulted the Bible. But we live in a time when attitudes are changing. How do you feel about it? Do you believe that the Bible is God’s Word or do you feel that it is just a good book written by men? . . .

Do you think the time will come when people like you and me will be able to walk the streets at night and feel safe? (Or, Do you feel that anyone has a real solution to the problem?) . . .

That report on (mention some current item of concern)—what do you think about it? . . . It is not unusual to hear people ask, What is this world coming to?

(Isa. 65:21-23)’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">• „We are sharing with our neighbors a thought about good government. Most people would like to have the kind of government that is free from corruption, one that provides employment and good housing for everyone.

<li>
<p><span class="font12">• „We all want our children to have happy lives. But do you think there is sound reason to expect a happy outcome for the trouble the world is in today? . . . So, what kind of world do you think our children are going to face when they grow up? . . . The Bible shows that God is going to make this earth a wonderful place in which to live. (Ps. 37:10, 11) But whether our children will share in it may depend to a large extent on the choice </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">we</span><span class="font12"> make.

Do you find that some situations make this hard to do? . . . I have found that the Bible is very helpful in this respect. It realistically describes the conditions that exist in our day, but it also explains their meaning and tells us what the outcome will be. (Luke 21:28, 31)’</span></p></li>

That would be desirable, don’t you agree? . . . Is there such a government today? . . . Many people have actually prayed for a government that can do those things. No doubt you have prayed for it, but not many people think of it as a government.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Comments: </span><span class="font11">The life prospects of people depend on their attitude toward Jehovah God and his Kingdom by Christ Jesus. The message of God’s Kingdom is thrilling, and it points to the only dependable hope for humankind. It is a message that transforms lives. We want everyone to hear it. We realize that only a minority will receive it appreciatively, but we know that people at least need to hear it if they are to make an informed choice. Yet not everyone is willing to listen, and we do not try to force them. But with discernment it is often possible to turn potential conversation stoppers into opportunities for further discussion. Here are examples of what some experienced Witnesses have used in their efforts to search out deserving ones. (Matt. 10:11) Our recommendation is not that you memorize any of these replies but that you get the idea in mind, put it in your own words and express it in a manner that conveys your genuine interest in the person to whom you are speaking. As you do so, you can have confidence that those whose hearts are rightly disposed will listen and respond appreciatively to what Jehovah is doing to draw them to his loving provisions for life.—John 6:44; Acts 16:14.</span></p>

I ask that because we have met many who at one time were religious but no longer go to church because they see much hypocrisy in the churches (or, they feel that religion is just another money-making business; or, they do not approve of religion’s involvement in politics; etc.). The Bible does not approve of such practices either and it provides the only basis on which we can look to the future with confidence.’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12">• „If you mean that you are not interested in another religion, I can understand that. But more than likely you are interested in what kind of future we can expect in view of the threat of nuclear war (or, how we can safeguard our children against drug abuse; or, what can be done about crime so that we won’t have to be afraid to walk the streets; etc.). Can you see any prospect for a real solution?’</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, ‘I’M A BUDDHIST’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• Do not conclude that the person’s beliefs are the same as those of all other Buddhists. Buddhist teachings are vague and the interpretation varies from one person to another. Japanese Buddhism is quite different from the Buddhism of Southeast Asia. Individuals, too, differ as to their viewpoint. In general, however, the following points may be helpful: (1) Buddhism does not recognize an external God, a personal Creator. But many Buddhists worship images and relics of Buddha. (2) Siddhartha Gautama, who was given the title Buddha, came to be viewed as the religious ideal of his followers, to be imitated by them. He encouraged gaining enlightenment by studying mankind from a human standpoint, also severing the roots of suffering by controlling the mind so as to eliminate all earthly desire. He taught that in this way one might attain to Nirvana, free from the rebirths of transmigration. (3) Buddhists worship their ancestors, because they view these as the source of their life.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Suggestions for conversation: (1) When speaking with Buddhists, emphasize that you are no part of Christendom. (2) Buddhists have respect for “holy books,” and generally they respect the Bible for that reason. Instead of dwelling on Buddhist philosophy, present the positive message of the Bible. Let them know that the Bible is not mere human philosophy but the authoritative Word of mankind’s Creator, Jehovah God. Ask politely if you may show them an interesting point in this holy book, the Bible. (3) Many Buddhists are keenly interested in peace and family life and want to live moral lives. Discussion on any of these matters is often welcomed. (4) Show that the Bible points to a righteous heavenly government over the earth as the real solution to the problems facing mankind. It explains the future of the earth and the wonderful prospect of living forever in an earthly paradise. (5) You might point out that the Bible explains the origin of life, the meaning of life, the condition of the dead and the resurrection hope, the reason for the existence of wickedness. A kindly presentation of the clear truths of God’s Word will find appreciative response in the hearts of sheeplike ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The booklet </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">In Search of a Father</span><span class="font10"> was prepared especially for the benefit of sincere Buddhists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, ‘I’M A HINDU’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• You ought to be aware that Hindu philosophy is very complex and does not conform to normal logic. You may find it helpful to have the following points in mind: (1) Hinduism teaches that the god Brahman includes three forms—Brahma the Creator, Vishnu the Preserver, and Siva the Destroyer. But Hindus do not think of a personal god with an individual existence. (2) Hindus believe that all natural objects possess a soul that never dies, that the soul experiences a virtually endless cycle of reincarnation, that the forms in which it is reborn are determined by deeds (Karma), that release from this “endless wheel” is possible only by extinguishing all physical desire, and that if this is achieved, the soul will merge with the universal spirit. (3) In general, Hindus respect other religions. Hindus believe that, in spite of the fact that they teach conflicting doctrines, all religions lead to the same truth.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Instead of trying to deal with the complexities of Hindu philosophy, present the satisfying truths found in the Holy Bible. Jehovah’s loving provisions for life are open to people of all kinds, and the clear truths in his Word will reach the hearts of those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Only the Bible provides a truly well-founded hope for the future; only the Bible gives really satisfying answers to the important questions that face all mankind. Give them opportunity to hear those answers. It is of interest that the Hindu </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Rig-Veda</span><span class="font10"> hymn, 10. 121, is entitled “To the Unknown God.” In some cases you may find it appropriate to refer to this in a manner similar to the apostle Paul’s reference to the altar “To an Unknown God” in Athens. (Acts 17:22, 23) Interestingly, the name of the Hindu god Vishnu, without the digamma, is Ish-nuh, which in Chaldee means “the man Noah.” Point out what the Bible says about the significance of the global Flood in the days of Noah. Those who are distressed by the prospect of endless reincarnations may be helped by the material on pages 320, 321, under the main heading “Reincarnation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The booklets </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Path of Divine Truth Leading to Liberation</span><span class="font10"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">From Kurukshetra to Armageddon—And Your Survival</span><span class="font10"> contain information that will be very beneficial to sincere Hindus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, ‘I’M A JEW’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• First, ascertain how the person views himself as a Jew. Few are religious. For many, being Jewish is simply an ethnic designation.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">Here are a few points that are beneficial to have in mind: (1) Religious Jews view the pronouncing of God’s name as forbidden. (2) Many Jews think of “the Bible” as a Christian book, but if you refer to “the Hebrew Scriptures,” “the Scriptures,” or “the Torah,” that problem does not arise. (3) Tradition is a central part of their faith and is viewed by many religious Jews as equal in authority with the Scriptures. (4) They may associate Jesus Christ with the brutal persecution experienced by the Jews at the hands of Christendom in the name of Jesus. (5) They frequently believe that God requires the Jews to keep the Sabbath, which belief includes refraining from handling money on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">To establish a common ground, you might say: (1) „You would no doubt agree that, regardless of our background, we all face many of the same difficulties in today’s world. Do you believe that there will really be a lasting solution to the great problems that face this generation? (Ps. 37:10, 11, 29; Ps. 146:3-5; Dan. 2:44)’ (2) „We are no part of Christendom and do not believe in a Trinity but worship the God of Abraham. We are especially interested in the matter of religious truth. Do you mind if I ask how you determine what is true, especially in view of the fact that there are great differences of beliefs among Jewish people? . . . (Deut. 4:2; Isa. 29:13, 14; Ps. 119:160)’ (3) „We are keenly interested in God’s promise to Abraham that through his seed people of all nations will be blessed. (Gen. 22:18)’</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the person expresses lack of faith in God, ask whether he has always felt that way. Then perhaps discuss why God has permitted wickedness and suffering. Memories of the Nazi holocaust have caused many Jews to be concerned about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If you discuss the importance of using God’s name, find out first how the other person feels about it. Point out that Exodus 20:7 for bids taking up God’s name in a worthless way, but </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">it does not forbid using it with respect.</span><span class="font10"> Then reason on texts such as Exodus 3:15 (or Psalm 135:13); 1 Kings 8:41-43; Isaiah 12:4; Jeremiah 10:25; Malachi 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When you discuss the Messiah: (1) Talk first about the future blessings under his rule, instead of his identity. (2) Then reason on texts that point to a </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font10"> Messiah. (Gen. 22:17, 18; Zech. 9:9, 10; Dan. 7:13, 14) (3) You may need to discuss the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">two</span><span class="font10"> comings of the Messiah. (Contrast Daniel 7:13, 14 with Daniel 9:24-26.) (4) When referring to Jesus, do so in a context that emphasizes the progressive nature of God’s purpose. Mention that when Jesus taught, the time was near when God allowed the second temple to be destroyed, never to be rebuilt. But Jesus emphasized the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">fulfillment</span><span class="font10"> of the Law and of the Prophets and the glorious future to which these would direct persons with faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">WHEN SOMEONE SAYS, ‘I’M A MUSLIM’</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">• A few points to have in mind are these: (1) The Koran is their principal “holy book.” Some will agree that the Bible is God’s Word, but they believe that it is superseded by the Koran. (2) They believe that there is only one true God. (3) They say that Jesus was one of the prophets, as was Muhammad, and that Muhammad (570-632 C.E.) was the Comforter foretold by Jesus. They believe Muhammad was the last and most important prophet. (4) They strongly believe that God has no son.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">A common ground can sometimes be established in the following ways: (1) You might say: „I have come to discuss the Word of God with you. It tells about the problems of life that people like you and me experience and it shows us what the real solution is.’ Then discuss the Kingdom. (2) You could say: „I do not believe in Christendom’s Trinity. I worship the one true God, the Creator of heaven and earth.’ (3) „Am I right that you believe that Jesus (or Moses) was a prophet? . . . Was he a true prophet? . . . Then what he said was from God and if other teachings do not agree with it, they must be from another source, is that not so?’ Then use statements made by Jesus (or Moses) as a basis for further discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If they make strong assertions concerning their beliefs, it can be beneficial to ask them, tactfully, to show you the point in the Koran, sura (chapter) and verse. (Wait while they search for it.) When they are unable to find it, some give evidence of greater willingness to listen to what you show them in the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Possible topics for discussion: (1) After laying a foundation, as above, you may be able to point out what God said to Moses about His personal name. (Ex. 3:15; Deut. 6:4, 5) (2) Material in this book under the main headings “Fate” and “Suffering” can be used to help some to see that God is not responsible for the injustice and suffering they experience and that lasting relief will come by means of God’s Kingdom. (3) If you are asked about your view regarding the Comforter, you can point out how Jesus spoke of it, showing that it is not a person and that it would remind his disciples of all the things that Jesus had taught them, rather than introduce a new religion. (John 14:26, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">KJ, NW;</span><span class="font10"> Acts 1:8) (4) If the objection is raised that God cannot have a Son, you might endeavor to reason on the matter. God’s having a Son does not mean that he had sexual relations with a wife. But God is the Creator. Since he gives life to those that he creates, can he not refer to himself as their Father? He speaks of his very first creation as his Son. He calls the angels sons of God, and he refers to Adam as his son. Why? Because he gave them life. How did Mary conceive Jesus? Not by sexual relations with God but, as the Bible says, it was by means of holy spirit, the same active force that God used in creation.—Matt. 3:17; 16:16, 17; Luke 1:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The booklet </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">The Time for True Submission to God</span><span class="font10"> can be a real aid to sincere Muslims in understanding God’s purpose</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark332"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark333"></a>Showing Appreciation for the Two Greatest Expressions of Love</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">“As for us, we love, because he first loved us.”—1 JOHN 4:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12">HOW can we best show our appreciation for the great love that Jehovah God and Jesus Christ have expressed toward us? A primary way is by imitating Jesus, who tirelessly witnessed to his Father’s name and Kingdom. (1 Peter 2:21) He did so in homes, in synagogues, in the temple, on mountainsides, and at the seashore. Let us consider nine distinct ways that may be open to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">The House-to-House Activity</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">2</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>2</sup> The first, and perhaps most distinctive, way in which we can show our love and appreciation is by going from house to house with the good news of God’s Kingdom. Doing so requires real freeness of speech because it continually involves direct confrontation with others, many of whom will view us as a bother. It takes genuine love for God and for neighbor to keep going from door to door, though we may meet up with indifference, annoyance, contempt, or direct opposition.—Compare Ezekiel 3:7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>3</sup> The Gospel record of Jesus’ instructions to his 12 apostles, and later to the 70 evangelists, clearly indicates that they were to go from house to house preaching the good news of God’s Kingdom. (Matthew 10:5-14; Luke 10:1-7) At Acts 20:20 Paul tells of his going from house to house. Those words have been applied to his making shepherding calls, but verse 21 leaves no doubt as to the activity meant, for Paul adds: “I thoroughly bore witness both to Jews and to Greeks”—not to Christian brothers and sisters—“about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus.” When making shepherding calls, an elder usually does not urge 'repentance toward God and faith in Jesus.’ Rather, he encourages fellow Christians to have increased appreciation of meetings or the ministry, or he helps them with personal problems.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>4</sup> Not only is there sound Scriptural basis for our going from house to house but the fruits of that activity show that Jehovah’s blessing is upon it. Yes, “wisdom is proved righteous by its works.” (Matthew 11:19) Frequently, those going from house to house have seen evidence of angelic direction that leads them to those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness. The householder has said that he or she had been praying for help and that the Witness’ visit answered that prayer.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">5</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>5</sup> What great help for the field service we have in the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Reasoning From the Scriptures!</span><span class="font12"> It contains many appealing introductions for Bible discussions as well as useful information on numerous Scriptural or religious subjects. So not only carry it but keep referring to it. The pioneers in particular have expressed great appreciation for this valuable field-service aid. Could you manifest your appreciation for God’s love by using this book more fully and more effectively?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>6</sup> We should not overlook the fact that we personally stand to benefit greatly by sharing in the house-to-house ministry. As we Christians act on our faith, it becomes more firm; as we speak with conviction, it is strengthened. We cannot tell others about our hope without our own hope becoming brighter. There is nothing like participating regularly in the house-to-house ministry for cultivating the fruits of the spirit mentioned at Galatians 5:22, 23. It simply has to be that way, for the Bible assures us: “A generous man will prosper; he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.”— Proverbs 11:25, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">New International Version.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark334"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark335"></a>Making Return Visits</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>7</sup> A second way for us to respond to the love that God and Christ have shown us is by making return visits on persons who previously evinced an interest in the Kingdom message. Paul and Barnabas were concerned about those to whom they had preached. (Acts 15:36) In fact, consistency requires that we make return visits. While witnessing from door to door, informally, or on the streets, we are looking for those “conscious of their spiritual need.” (Matthew 5:3) Obviously, giving them, as it were, one glass of spiritual water or one piece of spiritual bread is by no means enough. For them to get on the road to life, they need more help.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>8</sup> Our first efforts might be likened to planting seeds of truth. But as the apostle Paul indicated at 1 Corinthians 3:6, 7, more is needed. It was not enough that he planted. The seeds also required water, such as Apollos supplied. Then it could be expected that God would make it grow. This feature of the work is neglected by some, and yet many consider it to be really the easiest feature of the Christian ministry. Why? Because the people we call on have already shown some interest.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Conducting Home Bible Studies</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>9</sup> When return visits are made regularly on persons who have shown an interest in the Kingdom message, the result often is a home Bible study—a third way in which we can show our appreciation. It really can be the most enjoyable and most rewarding feature of our ministry. Why? Well, what a joy it is to see people grow in knowledge and appreciation of Bible truths, to see them make changes in their lives, and to assist them until they dedicate themselves to do God’s will and get baptized! Such ones can truly be viewed as our spiritual children and we as their spiritual parents.—Compare 1 Corinthians 4:14, 15; 1 Peter 5:13.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">10</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>10</sup> Consider a typical example. A missionary going from house to house in a Caribbean island met a hippie couple whose home was anything but neat and orderly. Yet they expressed interest. A Bible study aid was placed, and a home Bible study was started with the couple, who were not married although they had several children. As the study progressed, the home began to look more presentable and so did the couple and their children. Before long the couple asked the missionary to marry them, opening the way to their getting baptized. Then one day the new brother happily displayed his auto driver’s license, the first he had ever obtained. Yes, before he became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, he had not seen the need to get either a marriage license or a driver’s license, but now he was obeying both God’s laws and those of caesar.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Street Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">11</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>11</sup> A fourth way in which we can show our appreciation for what God and Christ have done for us is by street witnessing. When we take part, we are helping to fulfill Proverbs 1:20, 21 in a somewhat literal way: “True wisdom itself keeps crying aloud in the very street. In the public squares it keeps giving forth its voice. At the upper end of the noisy streets it calls out.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">12</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>12</sup> There are ever so many good reasons for us to share regularly in this feature of Kingdom preaching. In many areas, it is more and more difficult to find people at home. They are either sharing in some form of recreation, shopping, or working. Also, many people live in exclusive apartment buildings or condominiums, not to mention those living in hotels. But usually there are people to be seen on the streets.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">13</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>13</sup> An elder in the United States currently conducts four home Bible studies with individuals whom he first contacted in the street witnessing activity. Of course, he does not simply stand mute (although in some lands that is all that the law permits). Rather, with a friendly smile and cheerful voice, he approaches people who are standing, waiting for a bus, or walking along leisurely. His “utterances are with graciousness, seasoned with salt,” and he uses discernment as to how to approach each one. (Colossians 4:5, 6; 1 Peter 3:15) Not only has he obtained home Bible studies by such street witnessing but he is also very successful in placing literature with many. Yes, by being neatly groomed and having a friendly smile together with freeness of speech, you can be very effective in street witnessing. In fact, five Witnesses recently placed more than 30 copies of the book </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Life—How Did It Get Here? By Evolution or by Creation?</span><span class="font12"> in public shopping areas. Many of the books were obtained by people sitting in their cars.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Informal Witnessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">14</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>14</sup> A fifth way for us to show appreciation for the great love that God and Christ have expressed to us is by informal witnessing. How effective this has often been, both in finding persons hungering and thirsting for righteousness and in placing literature! It certainly is one way by which we can heed the advice found at Ephesians 5:15, 16, “to buy out the opportune time for ourselves.” A missionary struck up a conversation with a fellow passenger in a taxicab. The man showed interest. Return visits were made and a Bible study was started. Today that man is a Christian elder. Elsewhere an elder started a conversation with a woman who, it turned out, was changing her religion to marry a Jew. She wanted to know who came first, Moses, Noah, David, and so forth. He told her that what she needed was the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Bible Stories</span><span class="font12"> book, which presents Bible events in chronological order. Although he was a perfect stranger to her, she readily gave him her name and address and the necessary contribution so that he could mail the book to her.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">15</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>15</sup> Sometimes, for fear we may get rebuffed, we may hesitate to start a conversation with someone traveling next to us. How often, though, we are richly rewarded if we summon up the courage to do so! Appreciation of God’s goodness and people’s need will help us to have the necessary courage. Yes, remember that “God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.”—2 Timothy 1:7, </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">NIV.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Welcoming Strangers</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>16</sup> A sixth way in which we can show our gratitude to God and Christ is by welcoming strangers that show up at our Kingdom Hall. Love for neighbor should make us alert to notice any stranger that visits our place of worship. Let us strive to make him feel at ease, to feel that he is among friends who are sincerely interested in his spiritual well-being. Most likely, more than idle curiosity brought him there. He may truly be hungering and thirsting for righteousness. Our genuine concern for him may result in our starting a home Bible study, helping him on the road to life. (Matthew 5:3, 6; 7:13, 14) In fact, this very thing has happened often. A missionary from the first class of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead noted that his two most promising Bible students were those whom he first met at the Kingdom Hall.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Witnessing by Writing Letters</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">17</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>17</sup> A seventh way for us to witness, in response to the love God and Christ have shown us, is by writing letters. Often, those who use this form of witnessing get some very appreciative letters in reply. This is a method employed by some full-time ministers who may temporarily be unable to go from house to house because of physical infirmity. For example: There was a family with 12 children. One day the father came home to find five of them shot in cold blood by one of his daughter’s suitors. In vain he looked for comfort from Christendom’s clergy. Then one day he received a letter from a stranger, a Witness who had read in the press about his tragedy and who wanted to comfort him, enclosing a </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">Truth</span><span class="font12"> book. This was just what the man was looking for. Today he, too, is a zealous Witness.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Making Phone Calls</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>18</sup> To mention an eighth avenue of witnessing, there is the opportunity to use the telephone in preaching the Kingdom good news. This increasingly is proving to be a pleasant and an effective form of witnessing. More and more Witnesses are becoming skilled in this feature of the ministry, which has much to recommend it. By it we reach some people whom we are unable to meet in the house-to-house activity. When phone witnessing is done discreetly, with kindness, tact, and skill, some have found even better response than from calling on such persons at their homes.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">20</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12"><sup>20</sup> A ninth way in which we can bring praise to God is by our good conduct. A Russian journalist once stated that our fine conduct was our best sermon. In fact, repeatedly the press has commented on Jehovah’s Witnesses’ high morality. One reported: “Jehovah’s Witnesses are recognizably the most honest people in the Federal Republic of Germany.” At the beginning of her school term, a Witness girl brought the </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font12"> brochure to her teacher. He bluntly rejected it, saying he wanted nothing to do with the Witnesses. However, in time her fine conduct won her his highest praise and caused an entire change of attitude on his part toward the Witnesses. Of similar import is the letter that Witness parents received from their children’s schoolteacher: “The undeniable measure of the success of your beliefs is your children.”</span></p>

Taking sufficient time to discuss or demonstrate a simple presentation that is well-suited to the territory or to consider other practical information that can be used in the ministry that day will further equip those present to give an effective witness.

<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Meeting the Challenges of the House-to-House Ministry</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“We mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to you the good news of God with a great deal of struggling.”—1 THESS. 2:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">JEREMIAH was a person with feelings like ours. When Jehovah informed him of his commission to be “prophet to the nations,” he cried out: “Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah! Here I actually do not know how to speak, for I am but a boy.” Nevertheless, trusting in Jehovah, he accepted the assignment. (Jer. 1:4-10) For more than 40 years, Jeremiah contended with apathy, rejection, ridicule, and even physical violence. (Jer. 20:1, 2) At times, he felt like giving up. Yet, he persevered in declaring an unpopular message to a largely unreceptive people. In God’s strength, Jeremiah accomplished what he could never have done on his own.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Read Jeremiah 20:7-9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>2</sup> Many of God’s servants today can relate to Jeremiah’s feelings. When contemplating the prospect of preaching from house to house, more than a few of us once thought, “That is something I could never do.” Yet, when we realized that it was Jehovah’s will that we proclaim the good news, we overcame our apprehension and got busy preaching. Even so, many of us faced circumstances in our lives that made it difficult, at least for a time, to keep on preaching. There is no denying that it is a challenge to start preaching from house to house and to keep on preaching right to the end.—Matt. 24:13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>3</sup> What if you have been studying the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses and attending congregation meetings for some time but are hesitant to start preaching from house to house? Or what if you are a baptized Witness who finds it difficult to share in the door-to-door work, even though you are physically able to do so? Be assured that people of all backgrounds are meeting the challenges of the house-to-house ministry. With Jehovah’s help, so can you.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Mustering Up Boldness</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>4</sup> You no doubt recognize that the global preaching work is being accomplished, not by human power or wisdom, but by God’s spirit. (Zech. 4:6) That is also true of the ministry of individual Christians. (2 Cor. 4:7) Consider the apostle Paul. Recalling a time when he and his missionary companion were mistreated by opposers, he wrote: “After we had first suffered and been insolently treated . . . in Philippi, we mustered up boldness by means of our God to speak to you the good news of God with a great deal of struggling.” (1 Thess. 2:2; Acts 16:22-24) We may find it hard to imagine that a zealous preacher like Paul had times when it was a struggle for him to preach. Yet, like all of us, Paul had to lean on Jehovah in order to speak the good news with boldness. (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Read Ephesians 6:18-20.</span><span class="font6">) How can we imitate Paul’s example?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>5</sup> One way we muster up boldness to preach is through prayer. A pioneer said: “I pray that I can speak with confidence, pray that I can reach the hearts of people, and pray that I can find joy in the ministry. After all, this is Jehovah’s work, not our own, so we can do nothing without his help.” (1 Thess. 5:17) All of us need to pray continually for the help of God’s holy spirit to preach with boldness.—Luke 11:9-13.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>6</sup> The book of Ezekiel reveals something else that can help us to speak with boldness. In a vision, Jehovah gave Ezekiel a scroll written on both sides with “dirges and moaning and wailing” and told him to eat it, saying: “Son of man, you should cause your own belly to eat, that you may fill your very intestines with this roll that I am giving you.” What did this vision mean? Ezekiel was to absorb fully the message he was to deliver. It was to become part of him, as it were, affecting his inmost feelings. The prophet goes on to relate: “I began to eat it, and it came to be in my mouth like honey for sweetness.” Declaring God’s message in public was a delight—like tasting honey—for Ezekiel. He felt highly privileged to represent Jehovah and to fulfill this God-given assignment, even though that meant delivering a strong message to an unreceptive people.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Read Ezekiel 2:8-3:4, 7-9.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>7</sup> This vision contains a valuable lesson for God’s servants today. We too have a strong message to deliver to people who are not always appreciative of our efforts. For us to continue to view the Christian ministry as a God-given privilege, we must be well-nourished spiritually. Superficial or haphazard study habits will not be sufficient for us to absorb God’s Word fully. Could you improve the quality or regularity of your personal Bible reading and Bible study? Could you more often meditate on what you read?—Ps. 1:2, 3.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Starting Bible Discussions</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>8</sup> For many publishers, the most difficult part of the house-to-house ministry is the initial exchange with the householder. Admittedly, in some territories it is a challenge to start conversations. Some publishers feel more comfortable when speaking to people at the door if they begin their presentation with a few well-chosen words and then hand the householder a tract, as outlined in the accompanying box. The title of the tract or its colorful illustration may capture the householder’s attention, allowing us to mention briefly the purpose of our visit and to raise a question. A variation of this approach is to show the householder three or four different tracts and invite him to select one that interests him. Of course, our goal is not simply to place tracts or to use them at every door but to start Bible discussions that lead to Bible studies.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>9</sup> Whatever approach you use, good preparation will help you to be poised and enthusiastic in the house-to-house ministry. One pioneer observed: “I have more joy if I am well prepared. It makes me want to give my presentation.” Another pioneer said, “When I familiarize myself with the publications that I am going to offer, I become enthusiastic about using them.” While there is some benefit in silently reviewing what you are going to say, many find it more helpful to rehearse their presentation out loud. Doing so helps them to give their best to Jehovah.—Col. 3:23; 2 Tim. 2:15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>10</sup> Practical meetings for field service contribute to our effectiveness and joy in the house-to-house ministry. If the daily text deals directly with the preaching activity, it may be read and briefly discussed. However, the brother conducting the meeting for field service should take sufficient time to discuss or demonstrate a simple presentation that is well-suited to the territory or to consider other practical information that can be used in the ministry that day. This will further equip those present to give an effective witness. With good advance preparation, elders and others who conduct these meetings can accomplish this and still conclude the meeting within the allotted time.—Rom. 12:8.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The Power of Listening</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>11</sup> It is not only good preparation but a deep personal interest in others that helps us to start Bible discussions and reach people in the ministry. One way we demonstrate such interest is by the way we listen. A traveling overseer observed: “Being patient and showing a willingness to listen to people has an amazing power to attract and is a wonderful expression of warm personal interest.” Compassionate listening can be the key that unlocks a householder’s heart, as the following experience shows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>12</sup> In an open letter published in the newspaper </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Le Progres,</span><span class="font6"> of Saint-Etienne, France, a woman described the visit of two people who knocked on her door shortly after she suffered the tragic loss of her three-month-old daughter in death. “I immediately recognized them as Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she wrote. “I was ready to dismiss them politely, but then I noticed a brochure they were offering. It was about why God permits suffering. So I decided to invite them in with the intention of demolishing their arguments.... The</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Witnesses stayed a little over an hour. They listened to me with great compassion, and when they were leaving, I felt so much better that I agreed to another visit.” (Rom. 12:15) In time, this woman accepted a Bible study. It is revealing that what she remembered about that first visit was, not what the Witnesses said, but how they listened.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>13</sup> When we listen compassionately, we in effect allow people to tell us why they need the Kingdom. This puts us in a much better position to share the good news with them. You have likely observed that effective evangelizers are usually skilled listeners. (Prov. 20:5) They show a real interest in the people they meet in the ministry. They take note not only of their names and addresses but also of their interests and needs. When someone expresses a specific concern, they do research and soon return to share what they found. Like the apostle Paul, they adapt their presentation of the Kingdom message to the individuals they meet. (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Read 1 Corinthians 9:19-23.</span><span class="font6">) Such sincere interest attracts people to the good news and wonderfully reflects “the tender compassion of our God.”—Luke 1:78.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Maintain a Positive Attitude</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>14</sup> Jehovah has dignified us by giving us free will. Although he is God Almighty, he forces no one to serve him but appeals to people on the basis of love, blessing those who respond appreciatively to his marvelous provisions. (Rom. 2:4) As his ministers, we should be ready to present the good news in a manner worthy of our merciful God each time we give a witness. (2 Cor. 5:20, 21; 6:3-6) To that end, we need to maintain a positive attitude toward the people in our territory. What can help us to meet this challenge?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>15</sup> Jesus instructed his followers not to become unduly concerned if some rejected the message but rather to focus on finding deserving ones. (</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Read Matthew 10:11-15.</span><span class="font6">) Setting small, reachable goals can help us to do this. One brother likens himself to a prospector. His motto is, “I look forward to striking gold sometime today.” Another brother has the goal “to meet one nice person each week and return within a few days to cultivate the interest.” Some publishers endeavor to share at least one scripture with each householder if possible. What realistic goal could you set for yourself?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>16</sup> The success of the house-to-house ministry does not depend solely on the response of people in the territory. True, the preaching work plays a vital role in the salvation of honesthearted ones, but it also serves other important purposes. The Christian ministry gives us an opportunity to demonstrate our love for Jehovah. (1 John 5:3) It enables us to avoid bloodguilt. (Acts 20:26, 27) It warns the ungodly that “the hour of the judgment by [God] has arrived.” (Rev. 14:6, 7) Above all, through the preaching of the good news, Jehovah’s name is being praised in all the earth. (Ps. 113:3) Hence, whether people listen or not, we must keep sounding forth the Kingdom message. Indeed, all our efforts to proclaim the good news are beautiful in Jehovah’s eyes.—Rom. 10:13-15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6"><sup>17</sup> Although many today disregard our preaching work, they will soon come to view it in a different light. (Matt. 24:37-39) Jehovah assured Ezekiel that when the judgments he proclaimed came true, the rebellious house of Israel would “certainly know also that a prophet himself happened to be in the midst of them.” (Ezek. 2:5) Similarly, when God carries out his judgments against the present system of things, people will be forced to recognize that the message Jehovah’s Witnesses preached in public places and from house to house actually originated with the one true God, Jehovah, and that the Witnesses really did serve as his representatives. What a privilege we have to bear his name and declare his message in these momentous times! In his strength, may we continue to meet the challenges of the house-to-house ministry.</span></p></li></ul>
