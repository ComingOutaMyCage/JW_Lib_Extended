<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Introduction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">This </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4"> has been produced to help bodies of elders and operating committees care for the Kingdom Hall so that it continues to be a comfortable, dignified and modest place in which to give praise to Jehovah. (Psalm 122:1) It covers all the issues normally encountered, and contains all the forms needed, in connection with the operation of Kingdom Halls. It supersedes all previous letters in connection with Kingdom Hall operation and the Kingdom Hall Assistance Arrangement other than those referred to herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One copy of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4">should be kept in each congregation’s file after circulation around the body of elders. Each member of the operating committee should also have a copy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The information in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4"> is provided in an effort to be helpful, but is not a comprehensive guide to elders’ legal responsibilities. We are unable to accept liability for the consequences of any errors or omissions.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>Operating Committee</span><br><br><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Overview</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The elders supervise the upkeep and maintenance of the Kingdom Hall. When two or more congregations use the same hall, the bodies of elders appoint an operating committee composed of capable elders or ministerial servants. This committee works entirely under the direction of the bodies of elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The operating committee should take the lead in caring for the Kingdom Hall, see to it that there are sufficient supplies on hand, and make sure no hazardous conditions exist in the hall or the grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The brothers selected to serve on the operating committee must be (1) spiritual men, and (2) available.—Acts 6:3, 4; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> October 15, 1992, page 23, paragraph 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The congregations sharing a Kingdom Hall should have </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">equal </span><span class="font4">representation on the operating committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One member of the committee should be designated to care for all day-to-day matters in connection with the operation of the hall. He should be given the authority to care for repairs, the replenishing of supplies, and so forth, which do not involve alterations to the Kingdom Hall or spending large sums of money. A permanent chairman, an elder if possible, should be appointed by the bodies of elders. He should have good organizational ability, be able to take the initiative, and be quick to expedite matters. He should not be a procrastinator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The operating committee should select a brother to inspect the Kingdom Hall in accordance with the annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34) every September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the operating committee comes up against difficult questions or unanticipated major expenditures, these should be referred to the whole group of elders for determination. If the elders feel that a major expenditure is advisable, their recommendation should be outlined to the respective congregations, setting forth the facts, including the anticipated costs. A final decision will then be made by means of a resolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: Where only a single congregation uses a Kingdom Hall it may only be necessary for one elder or ministerial servant to carry out the responsibilities of the operating committee. However, for the sake of simplicity, the term “operating committee” has been used throughout these guidelines. Of course, if only one brother cares for this assignment, the body of elders should be especially observant to ensure that the responsibilities of the assignment are cared for.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>Operating Account</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Each congregation should contribute an agreed-upon amount monthly for Kingdom Hall operation. All the elders of congregations meeting in the hall should discuss and agree an appropriate monthly payment to cover operating expenses and any loan repayment. This amount will then be presented to the congregation(s) for a decision to be made. As necessary, and as seems advisable, adjustments can be made in the amount sent to this fund by each congregation. Where all congregations using a Kingdom Hall are about the same size, they may all decide to remit the same amount monthly. Where there is a considerable size difference, the larger congregation(s) might lovingly decide to contribute a larger portion monthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The account should be set up, kept and audited in accordance with the current </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Instructions for Congregation Accounting</span><span class="font4"> (S-27) and the instructions </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Congregation Annual Accounts—Charity Commission Requirements</span><span class="font4"> together with the accompanying </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Guidance Notes—Congregation Annual Accounts—Requirements for Registered Charities</span><span class="font4"> as provided to each congregation by the branch office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A cut-off point for how much can be spent on normal operations without special approval should be established by the body/bodies of elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A copy of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Monthly Congregation Accounts Report</span><span class="font4"> (S-30) for the operating account should be given to each body of elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The committee member appointed to care for day-to-day operational matters will need to be provided with adequate resources to care for necessary purchases. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font4"> October 15, 1992, page 23.) He should provide receipts for funds spent.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Operating File</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The operating committee keeps a file of information relevant to the safety, maintenance and general operation of the Kingdom Hall. The appropriate records should be available to those authorized when maintenance or equipment servicing takes place. This file would include items such as:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Installation guides, user instructions, maintenance instructions etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Maintenance and servicing records.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Plans/as-built drawings of the building.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Copies of completed forms (see back of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4">) including the annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Completed report regarding potential asbestos containing materials in the building.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">NOTE: On new Kingdom Hall projects, the Regional Building Committee will produce a document containing the above noted information, which in the construction industry is called a “Health and Safety file.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Biennial Kingdom Hall Inspection</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Regional Building Committee will perform a thorough inspection of each Kingdom Hall in their area of operation at least once every two years. This will provide an opportunity to review the condition of each Kingdom Hall and offer suggestions if needed. It will also enable them to better coordinate plans for future Kingdom Hall construction within the region. This arrangement should help conserve dedicated funds that can be used for the worldwide work. The chairman of the operating committee should accompany the Regional Building Committee representative when the inspection is carried out. Thereafter, a written report will be prepared by the Regional Building Committee representative and given to the body of elders of each congregation using the hall, as well as the circuit overseer. In this way, all will be alerted to any areas of concern, so that these may be given prompt attention.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Ownership</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">No one congregation should feel that it “owns” the Kingdom Hall. It is dedicated to Jehovah’s worship. The congregation that builds or rents a building has committed into its care a trust in connection with the hall, and the body of elders has the responsibility to manage wisely the Kingdom Hall’s operation so that Kingdom interests are best served. In many instances, several congregations share the same Kingdom Hall in order to get full use of the facilities and to keep down expenses. The branch office deals with only one of the congregations as far as property matters are concerned, and this congregation is the one that holds title to the Kingdom Hall property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Written Agreement</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When more than one congregation uses the hall, it is best for all the elders in the congregations involved to meet and decide Kingdom Hall matters. In this way, problems resulting from lack of communication or representation are kept to a minimum. Thus, there is a common sharing of the building dedicated to Jehovah’s service, and there is common responsibility to take good care of it. Under this arrangement no one congregation dominates while others become mere “tenants.” The agreement describing how the building will be cared for and used and when meetings will be held and what will be the responsibility of each congregation financially and otherwise should be in writing, with a copy for each congregation’s file, since elders may move and subsequent elders may not be aware of any oral understanding.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Selecting Meeting Times</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When there is only one congregation meeting in a Kingdom Hall, the elders should consider what they feel will be the best times for the meetings and should present their recommendations to the congregation for discussion, possible adjustment, and final decision (by majority vote of the baptized publishers), making the times as convenient as possible for the majority. However, in line with what is stated above, when more than one congregation meets in the hall, the elders of all the congregations may wish to meet and discuss meeting-time preferences to work out the best arrangements for all concerned. Where there is a choice in the times of meetings, the decision rests not simply with the elders but with each congregation. Some congregations find that rotating the times of meetings, or offering to do so every year or so, is desirable. When a rotation is made, it should take place on the first of January. (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">OurKingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> December 1994, page 2.) Good communication and cooperation contribute to mutual understanding and contentment, preventing the feeling that one congregation has certain advantages all the time. Good cooperation is also needed in connection with meetings during the circuit overseer’s visit, weddings, and so forth.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>Trustees</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The law differs in detail in Scotland from England and Wales. Generally however, all Kingdom Hall property, whether freehold or leasehold, is held by trustees on behalf of the congregation that, for legal purposes, records ownership of the property. This is a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">separate </span><span class="font4">arrangement from that whereby elders serve as “Charity Trustees” for each congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Local brothers may act as trustees for the Kingdom Hall. Alternatively, the Kingdom Hall Trust may act as a Custodian Trustee, whereby the legal title is held at the branch office on behalf of the congregation. This arrangement is progressively being expanded by the branch office as appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For a detailed consideration of the role and responsibilities of Charity Trustees, see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">CC3 - The Essential Trustee: What you need to know</span><span class="font4"> published by the Charity Commis-sion.—www.charitycommission.gov.uk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If you have queries in this regard, or if you become aware that your current trustee arrangement is not up to date, please write to the Legal Department at the branch office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Cleaning</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Kingdom Hall should be cleaned according to a regular schedule, depending on its use and needs. All may have a share, even the children. (Children should be properly supervised by their parents and must not be given access to any hazardous substances.) In this way all will learn the responsibility attached to the upkeep of the Kingdom Hall and will appreciate it more. Usually cleaning is arranged according to field service group. The elders may wish to make a schedule so that groups, under the direction of the group overseer or another brother in the group, may rotate weekly in looking after the cleaning. A list of things to be done may be placed on the noticeboard. Supplies and equipment should be on hand for use in cleaning. With all having a part in caring for the hall, the burden will not fall on just a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Periodic intensive cleaning required for areas of the building such as guttering and soft furnishings (wet cleaning) should be carefully organized so that it is safe. Please refer to the Maintenance and Safety sections of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Maintenance</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Kingdom Hall should be given regular attention. Does it need painting inside or out? Are repairs needed? Does the car park need attention? Is there sufficient security? If there is a garden, is it regularly maintained? Is the property being treated with proper respect?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">An annual inspection should be carried out in September. Any matters that require attention should be dealt with promptly. The appended </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34) provides further information and instructions in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If additional advice is needed in caring for maintenance of the Kingdom Hall, the elders should contact the Regional Building Committee. This might include matters such as carpet care, remedying of damp problems, servicing/testing of the electrical installation, the heating/air-conditioning system, the boiler, and any fire or security alarm. (Gas and electrical work must be carried out by competent people. Registration under the Gas Safe Register is legally required for gas work.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is best that unpaid volunteers perform maintenance work where possible. However, if it becomes necessary to hire a contractor to care for some work, such as pest control, the elders should:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Seek competitive bids, from three or more companies, based on a detailed written description of the work to be performed and any materials to be supplied.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Select the best tender and put the recommendation to the congregation(s). This procedure should be followed even if a brother has offered to do the work or supply the needed materials at a specified price.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Confirm the contractor has adequate liability insurance before work is carried out.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Waste Collection Arrangements</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom Halls, as places of worship, are entitled to have refuse collected by the Local Authority without charge. If charges have been made, the Local Authority must reimburse the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some congregations already receive free refuse disposal. In this situation, no further action is necessary. Other congregations have decided that it is not necessary to obtain regular refuse collection, perhaps due to the small amount of waste produced or because of the site usually being locked. In some cases where no refuse collection arrangements appear to be in place, the Local Authority has challenged the congregation to prove that illegal waste disposal is not taking place. If this occurs, please contact the branch office for advice.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Sanitary Waste Collection</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is no requirement for Kingdom Halls to have any specific arrangements or a contract for sanitary waste to be removed from the Kingdom Hall.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark77"></a>Supply of Electricity and Gas</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses are classed as charity (non-business activity) users with regard to the supply of utilities. Thus, VAT should be charged at 5% rather than the current business rate. Any overpayment should be reclaimed from your utility supplier(s).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some congregations have made considerable financial savings by carefully selecting their supplier(s) of electricity and gas. You may find that dedicated resources can be used more effectively.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark78"></a>Registering as Places of Worship and for Marriages</span><br><br><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark79"></a>England and Wales</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom Halls must be certified as places of worship. One benefit is that they are thus exempt from business rates. Therefore it is good to register as soon as a new Kingdom Hall is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When a congregation stops using a Kingdom Hall, builds a new hall, or carries out structural alterations to an existing hall, the General Register Office should be advised.—Telephone 0151 471 4803.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom Halls certified as places of worship can also be registered for the solemnization of marriages. Information regarding the necessary action to take and the appropriate forms to complete can be obtained from the superintendent registrar at your local register office. Kingdom Halls registered for marriages are required to have a safe in which to store the marriage registers. The safe must be of solid metal construction, fireproof to one hour, with internal dimensions of 45 x 30cm (18” x 12”) and, ideally, bolted to the floor. There should not be more than two key (or lock combination) holders. If required the Regional Building Committees have details of a safe that meets these criteria.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Scotland</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When a new hall is built or an existing hall is structurally altered, the Local Authority can advise on necessary procedures. Regarding the solemnization of marriages, it is the individual that is registered rather than the building. If information on the appointment procedure is required, please write to the branch office.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Seating</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Chairs in Kingdom Hall auditoriums should be linked (or floor fixed). This prevents individual chairs being moved out of position, which could inhibit safe exit from the building during an emergency. If chairs are not linked, the elders should ascertain if linking is possible. If this cannot be achieved, the situation should be managed so as to minimize any risks to safety. If clarification is required, please contact the Regional Building Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please note the following recommendations (which are not retrospective):</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Any aisles should be at least 1050mm in width.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> There should be at least 300mm clear width between the top back edge of one row of chairs and the front of the row behind.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> If there are requests for wheelchairs, pushchairs or folding chairs to be brought into the auditorium, it is essential to take a reasonable and practical attitude so that as many as possible can benefit from the meetings. Escape routes should be kept clear and any chairs brought into the hall should be safe to use and not detract from the dignity of the hall. Discernment and tact will enable those who have a genuine need to be cared for in a reasonable and loving manner.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark82"></a>First Aid</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom Halls are not required by law to keep a first aid box on the premises. If the body/bodies of elders choose to make such a provision, ensure that the contents are properly maintained. Such a kit would normally contain sterile hypo-allergenic plasters, eye pads, eyewash solution, triangular bandages, safety pins, medium and large dressings, individually wrapped wipes, disposable vinyl or blue nitrile examination gloves (not latex because of allergy) and a roll of microporous tape. The quantities should be based on the size of the congregation and the history of need. A simple (mouth-to-mouth) resuscitation protector is also advisable. The kit should be regularly checked to ensure all items are present and that the use-by date has not expired. Once something is used, it should be replaced. If food preparation is occasionally carried on at the Kingdom Hall, such as for pioneer schools, blue plasters should be available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A simple biohazard spill kit is advisable for safe clean-up of body fluids such as vomit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no legal requirement to have an appointed first aider at a meeting at a Kingdom Hall. The body/bodies of elders may, however, consider it appropriate to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">During construction or maintenance of a Kingdom Hall property, although every effort should be made to prevent accidents from occurring, arrangements for dealing with injury should be thought through before work starts. During construction involving the Regional Building Committee, qualified first aid volunteers should be present and be suitably equipped. The public emergency services should promptly be called upon to handle a medical emergency.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Fire Prevention</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Give careful attention to the annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34), which addresses fire and arson risk. The elders must always be mindful of the fire risk and evacuation elements of this worksheet.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Decision-Making at the Time of a Chubb Engineer Visit</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Choose a responsible brother to open the Kingdom Hall for the Chubb engineer. This brother should be able to approve the replacement of defective or missing extinguishers </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">at the time of inspection</span><span class="font4">. The engineer will explain to the brother opening the Kingdom Hall what is needed and why. If the brother is satisfied—say for example he sees there is a defect in one of the extinguishers—he will be able to authorize immediate replacement because the price of new equipment is now very low, so there is no need to be afraid that the extinguisher could be more economically obtained elsewhere. If the brother is not satisfied with the need for a replacement, or if there are new items that the engineer is recommending, such as wayfinding signs, the brother can ask that the recommendations be made in writing to the elders. Matters could then be decided in time for the next annual inspection if they are not urgent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please note that it is best to only approve the replacement of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">one extinguisher per year</span><span class="font4"> if minor defects can be tolerated in a second extinguisher. This is because the extinguisher cost is low, and the site visit and servicing costs are low, but there is a £25 minimum invoice charge in the new contract. (See table.) Thus, most benefit from this contract will be achieved if the replacement of extinguishers is staggered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If there is a problem with your inspection or billing, or if you want to order from any recommendations, or change contact details, the first point of contact should be Clair Holoham on 0845 606 1155 or Chubb customer services on the same number.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark85"></a>Number and Type of Extinguishers Needed</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Our data from Chubb seems to indicate that many Kingdom Halls have too many extinguishers. The body of elders has the final say on what is needed, but, the more extinguishers you have, the more you will pay to service and replace them. In all Kingdom Halls of standard design we specify only </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">2 AFF (foam) and one carbon dioxide</span><span class="font4"> (for electrical risks) to cover the building. We see no need to have separate extinguishers for a boiler room and kitchen, especially as no cooking usually takes place in the latter. If it does, it might best be served by a fire blanket. The boiler room can be served by the extinguishers in the other parts of the Kingdom Hall if one or two suitable types are within 30m. If you have more fire extinguishers than this, please carefully consider whether you can reduce them by reference to the guidance below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Dry powder extinguishers have operational disadvantages and we prefer carbon dioxide. Thus as the powder extinguishers go out of date we suggest replacing them with carbon dioxide if an extinguisher is still needed in that location. Fires involving the escape of gas are best dealt with by isolating the gas supply to the building along with evacuation. Extinguishers should not be used on such fires until the gas supply is isolated because there is a risk of explosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Engineers might recommend that extinguishers be located on every exit and adjacent to every fire hazard. This is not necessary! You might have to be quite firm with the extinguisher engineer on this point. The secular guidance is as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> “The basic scale of provision of extinguishers where these are only primary first aid means of fire defense is that, on each storey, there should be at least two extin-guishers.”—BS5306—8:2000 para. 6.2.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> “The provision of one [foam] extinguisher for approximately every 200m2 of floor space, with a minimum of two extinguishers per floor, will normally be adequate.” —Fire Safety and Risk Assessment, Small and Medium Places of Assembly p55.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> “Extinguishers should be cited in such a way that it is not necessary to travel more than 30m from the site of the fire to reach an extinguisher.”—BS5306—8:2000 para. 7.3.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> “Normally, extinguishers should be located in conspicuous positions on brackets or stands where they will be readily seen by persons following an escape route. Siting positions near to room exits, corridors, stairways, lobbies and landings are most suitable.”—BS5306—8:2000 para. 7.1.</span></p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark86"></a>Fire Safety</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The level of fire risk in Kingdom Halls is generally low as there is no smoking, the building occupants are always alert when they are in the building, and there are few other sources of ignition. However, a little carelessness in fire prevention could result in complete destruction of the Kingdom Hall. (James 3:5) This section constitutes the Kingdom Hall’s fire risk assessment. (No forms, procedures, or checklists other than those referred to here are necessary.)</span></p>

The body of elders is the “responsible person” under this Order. Following all aspects of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4"> closely with respect to fire will assist in fulfilling their legal duties. Two members of each congregation are chosen to receive training in fire safety and fire extinguisher use every three years at the circuit assembly. These ones thereby become competent to assist the body of elders in following the direction here. They can assist in completing the fire aspects of the annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34). They can also take the lead in organizing the evacuation and, if appropriate in the circumstances, emergency fire fighting. Further, with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual,</span><span class="font4"> there are two copies of a check sheet for them called the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Competent Person’s Check Sheet</span><span class="font4">. Give these to them to follow through on the checks specified therein. Records of these checks must be kept in the Kingdom Hall Maintenance File.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Hall Fire Action Notice</span><span class="font4"> supplied with this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4"> must be completed and displayed on the noticeboard and brought to the attention of the congregation regularly. If local circumstances make the notice inappropriate in any way, adapt it or replace it with one of your own. A blank copy is provided to congregations with multi-language groups and to multi-language congregations for completion by hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Define a Fire Assembly Point at least 50 metres away from the building, where the brothers are safe from smoke, traffic and emergency vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Appoint elders to become incident controllers in the event of fire. There should be a cascade arrangement, so that it is clear who is next in line if the first brother(s) are not present. They will act quickly and calmly in an emergency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The priorities of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Incident Controller </span><span class="font4">are to:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Commence evacuation immediately on fire alert.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Ascertain whether there is a real fire or not while the evacuation proceeds. Do so carefully.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Organize calling the fire brigade on 999 in the event of a fire.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Inform the fire brigade on arrival about any who were not able to evacuate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> If sure that there is no fire, authorize re-entry of the building. (If the fire brigade has been called, they will make this decision once the building has been declared safe.)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Take any safe measures in the event of fire to minimize damage.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Have complete oversight of the incident until the fire brigade arrives. Be available to assist in every matter they require.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Attendants act as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Fire Wardens </span><span class="font4">if the alarm is raised when they are on duty. They should:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Immediately open exit doors and help all evacuate through the nearest safe exit.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Quickly check all areas of the building including ancillary rooms and toilets. If anyone is found, instruct him or her to leave if they are able, and if not, help them to leave.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Close doors and windows.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Report to the Fire Assembly Point.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Whilst two members of each congregation have received branch approved training in the use of fire extinguishers, anyone who is able, may use a fire extinguisher. Of course it must be safe to do so, i.e. there is a clear evacuation route, the fire is not bigger than them, and there is no danger from smoke or heat. Those who have been trained should be especially alert to taking the lead in using the fire extinguisher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rehearse the evacuation procedure during a meeting once a year. The congregation can be forewarned. The elderly and infirm can stay inside and others could play their role, walking at their pace etc., to test the evacuation procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Arson is the greatest fire hazard to Kingdom Halls, and protecting against it should be carefully considered in the annual inspection.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark88"></a>Safety</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Life is sacred. (Compare 1 Chronicles 11:17-19.) Protecting the health and safety of those volunteering to clean and maintain the Kingdom Hall is an important matter for all in the congregation, especially the elders. Accidents occasionally occur, but they could usually have been prevented by some basic preparation and forethought. This guidance is adapted from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) leaflet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">An Introduction to Health And Safety</span><span class="font4"> to help bodies of elders prevent accidents and ill health. Elders, as congregation trustees, have responsibility for all activities in connection with the Kingdom Hall, and this guidance will help them discharge these responsibilities safely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many safety and risk issues are dealt with on the annual </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34). However, it is good for the operating committee to have such issues in mind throughout the year:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark89"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Do health and safety laws apply to the Kingdom Hall or congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If volunteers working on a Kingdom Hall are not paid for their work, and if no legal relationship is intended between those volunteering and the trustees of the congregation, then no employment relationship exists and, therefore, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Health and Safety at Work</span><span class="font4">(</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font4">) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Act,1974,</span><span class="font4">does not apply. However, we want to ensure health and safety is practised as if the full force of the law did apply.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Can Local Authority or HSE inspectors enforce the law on our Kingdom Hall premises?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Elders do not object to inspectors entering Kingdom Halls and making observations. However, such inspectors should be aware that, because there are no employers and employees, they do not normally have </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">enforceable </span><span class="font4">rights of entry under the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Health and Safety at Work</span><span class="font4">(</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font4">) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Act,1974</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Where can we get health and safety information from?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Whilst the Regional Building Committee is a reliable source of safety guidance for work on Kingdom Halls, congregations, in fulfilling their responsibilities for safety, are entitled to obtain information from other reliable sources. Congregations can contact the HSE confidential telephone information service, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">InfoLine,</span><span class="font4">on 0870 154 5500 or alternatively at </span><a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk"><span class="font4">www.hse.gov.uk</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Do we need to display any safety posters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No, there isno need for Kingdom Halls to display safety posters such as the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Health and Safety Law</span><span class="font4"> poster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Do we have to report injuries taking place in the Kingdom Hall to the HSE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No, for the above reasons this is not necessary. However, they must be promptly reported to the branch office using the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Accident Notice</span><span class="font4">(T-5) that accompanies this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Do we need to prepare a health and safety policy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No, for the reasons set out above.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark90"></a>Risk Assessment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Risk assessment is the main tool used in safety legislation for controlling risk. A hazard is something that can cause harm. A risk is the chance, high or low, that somebody will be harmed by the hazard. A risk assessment is the means by which hazards are evaluated and suitable controls established. It identifies the hazards and who might be affected by them; evaluates the precautions in place and whether they can be improved; and identifies action points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the guidance and completing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34) in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4"> is the way to ensure that the great majority of risks in Kingdom Halls and their operation are properly assessed and controlled. Thus, there is usually no need for a separate risk assessment. If there are unusual risks at Kingdom Halls that are not dealt with in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual,</span><span class="font4"> or if non-routine activities such as construction or landscaping are being carried out, the Regional Building Committee should be contacted for advice.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Work at Height</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">In industry, falls from height account for around 70 fatalities and 4,000 major injuries every year. One of the main causes is falls from ladders. Those carrying out tasks at height should use </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">appropriate equipment </span><span class="font4">and be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">competent. </span><span class="font4">If activity at height is required, give attention to the following points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Make an assessment of the task to be carried out. Is there a way that work at height could be avoided?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Will equipment appropriate for the task be used? There is now a wide range of access solutions available and something like an access tower or mobile elevating work platform might be safer than a ladder.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Those using such equipment should be properly trained, managed and supervised.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Sufficient protection, such as suitable personal protective equipment, should be used when working at height.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> The elders should consider the safety of work at height in simple cleaning and maintenance, such as taking down and putting up curtains or changing light bulbs. Is there a way to avoid working at height? Is the most appropriate equipment available to be used? Are those using it competent to do so? Would it be safer to use other equipment rather than a ladder?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Does anyone go into the roof space? If so, this presents a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">very serious hazard. </span><span class="font4">Could such access be avoided? If not, the body/bodies of elders must consider whether it is properly </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">boarded out </span><span class="font4">with suitable materials that are firmly fixed to the joists and able to take the full weight that may be imposed. If not, there must be some other arrangement to prevent falls from height. The best approach may be to establish access from below, through the ceiling, and prohibit access to the roof space. If the installation of proper boarding cannot be safely carried out, could a combination of partial boarding, nets, barriers, and fall prevention equipment be installed, along with appropriate signs, to ensure the highest standard of safety?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> For all significant operations, such as work on the roof or painting the exterior of the Kingdom Hall, the Regional Building Committee should be contacted before any work takes place.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">The most common injuries sustained on Kingdom Hall property are due to slips and trips. The resulting falls can be serious and so it is important to address these hazards, especially in areas accessible to the public. Please look out for the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Are there floors, e.g. in the toilets, that are, or can become, slippery when wet? If so, can the floor surface be changed for one less slippery when wet?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> If spillage or contamination occurs is it dealt with quickly?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Are external paths, stairs, ramps and car parks, free from slippery debris or deposits and well lit? Are there good handrails where necessary?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> How are slip and trip hazards such as trailing cables dealt with?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> If removing slip/trip hazards involves alterations to the fabric of the building, the Regional Building Committee should be contacted.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Also, thoughtful consideration for older ones is vital. We should be quick to offer a supporting hand as they move about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Note: Cordless microphones, whilst removing the trip hazard of trailing cables, should not be used during confidential meetings.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark93"></a>Electrical Safety</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">A competent person should carry out all electrical work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom Hall electrical systems should be inspected and tested by a qualified, competent person at a maximum interval of every five years. Prior to starting the inspection, the electrician who carries it out should be given a copy of the Kingdom Hall’s asbestos survey report (unless the hall was built after January 2004). The certificate of compliance should be kept in the Kingdom Hall Maintenance File.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) should also be carried out at a maximum interval of every five years.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark94"></a>Gas Safety</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Only engineers registered under the Gas Safe Register can work on gas appliances or supply. Have them checked annually as specified in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34).</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark95"></a>Equipment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Only suitable equipment should be used at the Kingdom Hall. Any ladders, gardening equipment, hand tools or other equipment should regularly be checked, maintained and inspected by someone competent to do so. Anyone using such equipment should be properly trained, supervised by those with appropriate experience, follow manufacturer’s instructions and work safely.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark96"></a>Hazardous Substances</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">It is not recommended that substances with a hazard-warning symbol be stored or used in the Kingdom Hall. However, if for some reason this is necessary, bear in mind the following points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Exposure to hazardous substances can result from inhalation, contact with the skin, splashing into the eyes, or swallowing.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Ensure that hazardous substances are used and stored strictly in accordance with the instructions printed on the container and available from the manufacturer in the form of a safety data sheet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> The leaflet </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">COSHH: A Brief Guide to the RegulationsINDG136</span><span class="font4">[</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">revised2</span><span class="font4">]isavailable in small quantities from HSE books if further information is required.</span></p></li></ul>
<h2><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark97"></a>Asbestos</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Unless your Kingdom Hall was built after January 2004 it is the responsibility of the body/bodies of elders to ensure that what is known as a type II survey of the Kingdom Hall has been carried out in order to identify any materials that might contain asbestos. This should have been done by now. If it has not, please follow the procedure under “Maintenance” to select a qualified asbestos surveyor. Organizations offering an asbestos survey should be able to comply with UKAS accreditation EN45004. Alternatively, individuals carrying out surveys should possess the minimum qualification of either P402 Proficiency from the British Occupational Hygiene Society (BOHS) or Level 3 Certificate in Asbestos Inspection Procedures from The Royal Society for the Protection of Health (RSPH), and be able to demonstrate experience in surveying buildings for asbestos. Their professional indemnity cover should be in the region of £2 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Samples taken by the surveyor should be analysed by a laboratory with UKAS accreditation ISO 17025.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No work at all which may create or disturb dust or fibres can be carried out until at least a type II survey has been completed and it is sure that the work will not expose volunteers to asbestos containing materials. Regional Building Committees will not carry out, or approve, work on any Kingdom Halls built before January 2004 until they have studied at least a type II report. Kingdom Halls that are scheduled for refurbishment or demolition likely need a type III survey of the work area. (A type III survey builds on the type II survey but examines all potentially asbestos containing materials in the work area, not just those accessible in the type II survey.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The survey report should be retained in the Kingdom Hall operating file. Any asbestos removal work recommended should be carried out by a licensed contractor chosen according to the above-mentioned procedure. Your local Health and Safety Executive office may be able to assist with a list of contractors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Any asbestos-containing materials not recommended for removal in the Asbestos Management Plan prepared as a result of the survey must remain in a safe condition. You will check this as an item on the annual inspection for the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34). If the asbestos or its coating seems to be damaged or to have deteriorated so that it might release fibres, seek expert advice from a surveyor or contractor as above. The materials must either be brought into a safe condition, or be safely removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Having asbestos work carried out by a qualified professional will cost, but by selecting the company prudently, you can be sure that the expense is necessary and proportionate to the risk.—Proverbs 22:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Your Regional Building Committee has summary sheets prepared by the branch office dealing with the following matters: The Law Regarding Asbestos, Commissioning an Asbestos Survey, The Asbestos Management Plan, and Regulations Relating to Repair and Removal. Please request these from the Regional Building Committee as necessary.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark98"></a>Legionella</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Water stored in unclean tanks at temperatures between 20 and 45°C can support the growth of legionella bacteria. This may include cold-water tanks in warm roof spaces during summer, or warm water tanks that never get hot enough to destroy the bacterium (e.g. where the heating is only switched on intermittently for meetings). This problem is not applicable in many halls as the taps are fed directly from the water main, with hot water being provided via a combination boiler. If, however, you have concerns about the arrangements in the Kingdom Hall, obtain a report from a qualified plumber through your Regional Building Committee.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark99"></a>Vehicles</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">There is a risk that pedestrians, especially children or the elderly, may be injured by vehicle movements at the Kingdom Hall site. There should be good pedestrian and vehicle separation, and parents must control their children properly at all times, especially in the car park area. The risk to children from the public highway should also be considered and parents must be advised to take proper precautions. The elders should be concerned about the speed at which vehicles move within the Kingdom Hall car park, and efforts must be made to ensure that this is not excessive.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark100"></a>Monitoring of Contractors</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">If a commercial contractor is used to maintain any heating systems, electrical systems, pressure vessels, or personnel lifts, then a mature brother should accompany the contractor throughout his visit. The brother should be capable of pointing out any unusual hazards in connection with the building. He should also be able to handle the contractor authoritatively so that he does not, for example, misuse the Kingdom Hall telephone or take items that do not belong to him. Any contractors chosen for such work should be fully qualified, competent, and able to work safely. The contractor should provide an up-to-date certificate of liability insurance before any work commences. As the congregation is not an employer, the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Health and Safety at Work</span><span class="font4"> (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font4">) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Act, 1974,</span><span class="font4"> does not apply to it. However, the contractor should fully comply with the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Health and Safety at Work</span><span class="font4"> (</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font4">) </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Act, 1974,</span><span class="font4"> when working at the hall as he will be either an employee of a company or selfemployed.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark101"></a>Lone Working</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">For safety reasons, generally this is to be avoided.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark102"></a>Security</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Giving proper attention to the security of the Kingdom Hall will protect its dignity as a place of worship. It will also show proper regard for the resources that the local brothers and sisters have given to bring praise to God. (Proverbs 2:11) The level of security required will depend on the location of the hall. The following provisions would be considered reasonable:</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Kingdom Hall Assistance Arrangement</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The Kingdom Hall Assistance Arrangement (KHAA) is a means by which congregations can pool their resources to protect against losses for which they would otherwise have to buy insurance. Contributions designated for the KHAA can be used to pay for property damage to Kingdom Halls and liability claims against congregations and their authorized representatives during the course and within the scope of their assigned duties. The KHAA may also help defray expenses incurred by those injured in accidents at Kingdom Halls. The KHAA does not pay for wear-and-tear, deterioration of property, or other maintenance needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This is not a commercial insurance programme.</span><span class="font4"> The branch office administers the KHAA fund, which is held by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Britain and into which KHAA contributions from congregations are deposited. This fund is used to make virtually all applicable payments. The fund is also used to purchase commercial “excess” insurance to protect the branch corporations and the congregations from large claims or catastrophic property losses. We believe this arrangement is in line with Charity Commission guidance in publication </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">CC49 Charities and Insurance</span><span class="font4"> (Version Feb. 2007).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Congregations have a legal right and duty, as registered charities, to decide what insurance is appropriate for their activities, and the body of elders, as trustees, bears the responsibility for this. However, the Kingdom Hall Assistance Arrangement has been put in place by the Governing Body and the branch office to care for all such needs. It would not be prudent for congregations to buy insurance that duplicates the provisions of the Kingdom Hall Assistance Arrangement. Thus, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the branch does not recommend the purchase of any commercial insurance policy for congregations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is an exception to this guidance for congregations that are obliged to carry commercial property insurance as a stipulation of their Kingdom Hall lease, and congregations where the Kingdom Hall is part of a larger building or attached to other buildings. In such circumstances the Risk Assessment Desk at the branch office provides advice and assistance on request. Another exception is the provision of insurance for hired plant and equipment and this should also be discussed with the Risk Assessment Desk.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark105"></a>Scope</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The following are </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font4">within the scope of the arrangement:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> The personal property of those at the Kingdom Hall. Thus for example, cars parked in the Kingdom Hall car park are there entirely at the owners’ risk, as are coats placed in the Kingdom Hall cloakroom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Personal arrangements brothers and sisters make to travel to and from the meetings and an individual’s involvement in the public ministry.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Kingdom Halls that share premises with other third parties. In such cases it is generally advisable to obtain commercial insurance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Contributions: </span><span class="font4">Congregations will receive, at the start of each year, a letter suggesting a contribution amount based upon the needs of all those supported by the KHAA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Construction: </span><span class="font4">Plant may be covered by the KHAA upon request to the Risk Management Desk. Please contact them well in advance to avoid project delays. It is not possible for the KHAA to provide </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">certificates</span><span class="font4"> of cover for plant, so if the hirer demands one, you may have to purchase insurance from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Certificates of public liability insurance: </span><span class="font4">These are provided by the KHAA for when congregations rent facilities for congregation meetings, such as for the Memorial. Requests should be made well in advance to ensure that your needs are cared for in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Newly purchased properties and land: </span><span class="font4">Please complete a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Property Description Form </span><span class="font4">(T-49b) to list the property with the KHAA. All properties held in preparation for Kingdom Hall construction should be kept free of hazards and secured against trespassers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Flats: </span><span class="font4">Some properties used by travelling overseers or special pioneers, can be included, by request, in the KHAA. Personal property of the occupants is not protected by the KHAA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The same standards for inspections, security and safety that apply to Kingdom Halls would also apply to such accommodation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Unpaid volunteers: </span><span class="font4">Unpaid volunteers assisting with Kingdom Hall construction, even if they have out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed, are within the scope of the KHAA. However, anyone paid even a nominal amount for work at the Kingdom Hall would not be protected and should arrange his or her own insurance. See the “Maintenance” section of this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual</span><span class="font4"> for information on hiring contractors.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Keeping Costs Down</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The success of the KHAA relies upon the vigilance and care of all the members of the congregation with respect to maintenance and security as set out in this </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Manual.</span><span class="font4"> The body/bodies of elders should ensure that the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fire Risk Assessment and Safety Inspection Worksheet</span><span class="font4"> (T-34) appended is completed annually and then quickly complete any necessary work.

To comply, “service providers” (i.e. the body/bodies of elders) have to make “reasonable adjustments” to physical features of the Kingdom Hall that hinder disabled ones endeavouring to benefit from the meeting programme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Act defines a disabled person as someone who has a physical or mental impairment that has an effect on their ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. The following points may assist you in assessing compliance.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Congregations will fill many of the requirements of the DDA simply by showing the typical courteous and helpful attitude for which Jehovah’s people are well known.

Carry out a survey of the hall to identify features of the building that may cause difficulties for disabled ones and keep on file a written list of the findings. Lighting, signage, the sound system (deaf loop system), steps, door handles and door closers are typical of the aspects of a Kingdom Hall that could cause difficulties. Once this survey has been completed, if it is decided that there are modifications that need to be made, the elders should arrange for this to be done promptly. If there is uncertainty as to whether any work is necessary, please contact the Regional Building Committee who will guide you in this regard.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> If it is not reasonably possible to remove, alter or avoid features that inhibit accessibility, for example, perhaps due to a very awkward access route up stairs, it will be necessary to think creatively about alternative ways of assisting disabled ones to benefit from the meetings.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> The resources of an organization are taken into account. As congregations generally have limited resources, the body/bodies of elders and individuals with disabilities would need to be reasonable as far as making practical adjustments to the building is concerned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> It will often be more cost effective to improve access to a building during a refurbishment project than undertake a separate project specifically to address DDA issues. To illustrate, a congregation may be working towards a new hall or refurbishment. It may be appropriate to make some reasonable adaptations straight away to improve the existing building in line with the DDA. However, it would be counter-productive to spend large sums of money on adaptations that would only be applicable for a short time and erode funds set aside for future construction.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">“No Smoking” Signage</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Smoking is prohibited inside public buildings in England, Scotland and Wales. Although smoking is abhorrent to Jehovah’s people and totally prohibited in Kingdom Halls, to comply with the law it is necessary to install a sign to confirm that the building is a no-smoking area.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Guidance and template signs can be obtained from </span><a href="http://www.smokefreeengland.co.uk"><span class="font4">www.smokefreeengland.co.uk</span></a><span class="font4">, </span><a href="http://www.clearingtheairscotland.com"><span class="font4">www.clearingtheairscotland.com</span></a><span class="font4"> and </span><a href="http://www.smokingbanwales.co.uk"><span class="font4">www.smokingbanwales.co.uk</span></a><span class="font4">.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark110"></a>Construction</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">If construction works are required, it is essential that the Regional Building Committee be contacted at the outset. (Even work to outbuildings on the Kingdom Hall is viewed as construction.)</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark111"></a>Overview</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Indeed, it is gratifying to see how our brothers voluntary contributions have supported Kingdom Hall construction, resulting in the advancement of true worship. (Isaiah 54:2, 3) Yet, since lands with limited resources continue to have a need for more Kingdom Halls, your further assistance is needed in limiting Kingdom Hall construction in Britain to what is really needed. It continues to be a time for moderation in planning for the remodelling of existing Kingdom Halls and the construction of new ones in Britain so that it will be possible to channel more money into meeting critical needs in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What can elders do to support this arrangement? Endeavour to keep your Kingdom Hall in good repair. By giving needed attention to maintaining your present Kingdom Hall, its lifetime can be lengthened, and this will help avoid a premature need for a replacement. All the elders must cooperate to make the care of the Kingdom Hall a priority. In this way, the building will continue to represent Jehovah properly in the community.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Counting the Cost</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Carefully count the cost and carefully weigh the need before rushing to remodel your Kingdom Hall or seeking to build a new one. When renovation or new construction is needed, please limit this to what is necessary—even if you have sufficient funds on hand locally. A fine principle was stated in the February 1992 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> page 4, paragraph 11: “Even though a congregation may have accumulated funds sufficient to include extra features [in its own Kingdom Hall] without seeking a loan, consideration should be given to using conventional designs and to building modestly. This makes additional funds available for use in other theocratic endeavours.”—See also </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will,</span><span class="font4"> page 120; 2 Corinthians 8:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Regional Building Committees are being asked to be mindful of economizing when aiding congregations in buying property, performing major renovations, or building new Kingdom Halls. Before deciding to renovate, for example, the question should be raised, Does an urgent need really exist, or is it simply a desire to upgrade or relocate an otherwise suitable facility? Consider whether this is really needed or whether existing Kingdom Halls can be used more efficiently. A single auditorium can often be used by three or four congregations. (See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> December 1990, page 3, paragraph 8.) If it seems wise to build on a new site, the Regional Building Committee can help you evaluate property before any offer to purchase is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Kingdom Hall designs, including finishes, should be modest and appropriate to the surroundings and should minimize labour-intensive details—in this way reducing construction time and simplifying maintenance. This was one of the prime objectives in instituting the Kingdom Hall Package. Your cooperation is essential to keep down overall costs and not deviate from standard Kingdom Hall designs. The need for much additional work is removed when congregations utilize the Kingdom Hall Package rather than insisting on their own preferences with regard to constructional detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When undertaking construction at your Kingdom Hall, please give attention to enlisting full volunteer support of the local congregation(s). Of course, key personnel that usually work with the Regional Building Committee will supplement this. Health and Safety legislation means it is vital to ensure that all those used on the project have adequate and appropriate training. However, having volunteers from the local congregation(s) assist with the project fosters a sense of responsibility toward any new facility, including its continued upkeep and maintenance. In any case, operating and maintenance expenses inherent in the design selected should not exceed the collective means of the congregation(s) as reflected in the financial survey that is made along with the estimated budget.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark113"></a>Regional Building Committee Involvement With Construction and Refurbishment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Whenever a Kingdom Hall project, whether for new construction or renovation, involves using volunteer help from outside the congregation(s) that will meet in a new hall or in an existing one undergoing renovation, the Regional Building Committee should take oversight. This will include the entire project, from the initial decision to expand, to initiating a building fund through purchasing property, advising on health and safety organization, constructing the hall, and completing the final landscaping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Even larger maintenance projects (such as painting or repair work) could have unforeseen legal and financial implications. Therefore, bodies of elders should discuss proposed work on the Kingdom Hall with the Regional Building Committee at an early stage and be amenable to their guidance and help. The body/bodies of elders, not the operating committee, are responsible to contact the Regional Building Committee for the purpose of organizing construction projects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When problems have arisen in connection with Kingdom Hall projects, the root cause has been a lack of communication or an unrealistic view as to how long it would take for the project to come to fruition. Thus, take steps to ensure that good communication exists within the body/bodies of elders and with the Regional Building Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When two or more congregations decide to cooperate in buying land and building a hall or in remodelling an existing building, there should be thorough discussion by all the elders, along with the Regional Building Committee, of what is proposed and the agreement reached. The respective congregations should clearly know, through their bodies of elders, what is recommended and the estimated cost so that a final decision can be made by each congregation on the basis of sound information. The general agreement to cooperate on the project and the basic understanding should be set down in writing and signed by all the elders after approval by the respective congregations. We cannot emphasize too strongly the need for cooperation among the bodies of elders and the congregations involved. Your making good use of the voluntary efforts available through those working with the Regional Building Committee follows the example of the tabernacle construction in the wilderness and the building of Solomon’s temple, when fine craftsmen from among Jehovah’s people were used.—Exodus 35:34, 35; 2 Chronicles 2:11-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Emergency situations will be handled promptly by the Regional Building Committee. Congregations, however, can show their regard for the time and resources of the volunteers and of dedicated funds by not neglecting maintenance or security to the extent that an emergency is created.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is best that unpaid volunteers perform the construction, renovation or repair work where possible. However, in view of the high cost of travel, it is appropriate for Regional Building Committee members and some key personnel to have their out-of-pocket expenses covered in connection with assistance given to congregations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark114"></a>Purchase/Sale of Property</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Whenever a congregation is seriously contemplating buying, selling or leasing any kind of property, it is imperative that the body/bodies of elders contact the branch office promptly. There are legal duties that must be performed before negotiations begin. Please also note the Charity Commission guidance, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">CC33 - Acquiring Land,</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">CC28 - Disposing of Charity Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Under the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Places of Worship (Enfranchisement) Act 1920,</span><span class="font4"> the trustees of a place of worship held on a long lease (not less than 21 years) have powers of compulsory acquisition of the freehold of the property. This means that the congregation has the legal right to buy the Kingdom Hall. The Act does not apply where the freehold is owned by certain public authorities, including local authorities.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark115"></a>Project Organization</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When a new Kingdom Hall is to be built or a major renovation project is being planned, it is advisable for the elders to initially select a Local Building Committee. It is good to select brothers for this committee who have some building or business experience, if possible. There should be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">equal </span><span class="font4">representation of all congregations that will meet in the Kingdom Hall. The building committee should cooperate well with the body, or bodies, of elders, consulting them, since the building committee is responsible to them. The elders will be consulted on any major changes or unusual developments. If the elders, Regional Building Committee, circuit overseer, and circuit planning representative conclude that the project is feasible, then a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Project Committee </span><span class="font4">should be formed. The local building committee will cease to exist when the project committee is formed. When planning for expansion it is essential that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">good cooperation and communication </span><span class="font4">is maintained between all those involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The project committee will comprise of two Regional Building Committee representatives, and two elders from the congregation involved (or one elder per congregation if the hall is shared). The chairman will be one of the Regional Building Committee’s representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The project committee will have involvement in the safe organization of the project, VAT registration (if applicable), and some of the routine matters concerning the proposed works. Significant or unusual matters will be discussed and agreed between the Regional Building Committee and the entire body(ies) of elders.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark116"></a>Financing the Project</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">Financing the purchase, construction, refurbishment or purchase of freehold for a Kingdom Hall is the responsibility of the entire congregation(s).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Loans with interest-free repayments are available from the branch office to meet valid needs. The Regional Building Committee coordinates loan applications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Congregations are encouraged to repay loans within 10 years. However, if circumstances warrant a departure from this guideline, the branch office will consider each request on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the congregation is discussing the possibility of obtaining a Kingdom Hall or renovating one, the elders may seek needed information concerning finances available from those associated with the congregation. The information required will include the following points:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> The total amount already raised towards the project.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Additional funds to be contributed before the project starts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> Any individual loans to be received from members of the congregation(s). Bear in mind that on occasion, “unforeseen occurrence” has resulted in this type of loan having to be recalled at short notice. Thus, unless the amount is relatively low, appropriate caution should be exercised if loans of this type are accepted.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">■</span><span class="font4"> The total amount that will be contributed each month to cover congregation expenses and loan repayments.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">To determine these amounts, slips of paper can be distributed in order to give all the privilege and opportunity to anonymously indicate the amounts they could contribute or make available for some or all of the categories indicated above. All in the congregation(s) should be encouraged to begin immediately contributing the amount they have indicated they could donate monthly. Subsequently, if potential donations are not sufficient, determine how much you will need to borrow and the maximum monthly loan payment that the con-gregation(s) can reasonably bear. The larger your loan payment the sooner your loan will be paid off and the sooner other congregations will be able to receive funds for their Kingdom Hall projects. When determining the amount that realistically can be paid monthly for the loan repayment, be aware that at times the amounts listed on the survey slips are higher than what will actually be contributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Congregation Approval for a Proposed Project</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When the elders, along with the Regional Building Committee, have a recommendation to make to the congregation(s) regarding a proposed Kingdom Hall construction project, they should share full details with the publishers. At the outset, the congregations should know basically what the total cost of building at a certain location would be. If property is to be purchased for a new Kingdom Hall, the added cost of developing the site and of constructing the hall, including the statutory approvals, should be outlined. The publishers should have opportunity to consider the full details and to have all their questions answered before voting on a resolution to build.—Please review the Question Box from the July 1984 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry</span><span class="font4"> as to how resolutions are to be prepared and presented.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark117"></a>Property Description Form</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The body/bodies of elders should ensure that where the value or design of the Kingdom Hall significantly changes, a new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Property Description Form</span><span class="font4"> (T-49b) is completed. The original should be sent to the branch office, and a copy kept in the Kingdom Hall operating file.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark118"></a>Street Numbering</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">When a new hall is built on a new site (or the site layout is changed) it may be necessary to apply for a street number (or building name). This will also ensure that a postcode is assigned to the hall. Contact the Local Authority street naming and numbering department for instructions on the procedure to follow.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark119"></a>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Should the structure of the hall be modified for the benefit of a multi-language group/ congregation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not recommended that expensive or costly adaptations be made for multi-language groups or congregations because they often outgrow such modifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Should we sell our existing hall so as to have funds available to purchase a new hall?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No. It cannot be guaranteed that another site will be obtained quickly and it can be difficult to save funds towards a new hall while renting another building. If you have any queries on this subject, it is essential to discuss the matter with the Regional Building Committee. If required, the Regional Building Committee will write to the branch office on your behalf for further advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The branch office does not offer bridging loans to enable congregations to purchase a new site before selling their old one. It is recommended that congregations do not obtain commercial loans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Is it appropriate to establish a joint fund to contribute towards a project?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If a specific project is contemplated, then congregations that would benefit from the hall may contribute to a joint fund until the project is paid for whereupon the fund should be discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Can funds be donated to another congregation in support of their project?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no objection to this when there is a tangible link between congregations. The congregation constitution allows for this to be done by resolution. However, bear in mind that it is inappropriate for congregations to solicit funds from other congregations.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark120"></a>Construction Volunteers</span></h2>
<p><span class="font4">The May 2006 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Kingdom Ministry,</span><span class="font4"> highlighted that willing volunteers who are baptized and have a cooperative spirit are needed to support the work of the Regional Building Committees. It mentioned: “Even if you do not have construction skills, you can still contribute much to the success of a building project. You may also receive training that will allow you to be used more extensively in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Additionally, note what is stated on pages 116-17 of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will</span><span class="font4"> regarding this activity: “The construction of Kingdom Halls and Assembly Halls is a form of sacred service, similar to the work of constructing Solomon’s temple. (1 Ki. 8:13-18) Many brothers and sisters show outstanding zeal for Jehovah’s organization by volunteering their time and assets to support and have a part in this work. Are you in a position to assist in this aspect of sacred service? If you are a baptized publisher and are willing to share in such activity, the Regional Building Committee would very much appreciate your offering to assist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those who desire to offer volunteer assistance to Kingdom Hall construction should obtain a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Hall Volunteer Questionnaire</span><span class="font4"> (S-82) from the congregation secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On completion of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Questionnaire,</span><span class="font4"> the volunteer should return it to the Congregation Service Committee. They will need to give serious consideration to each question on the reverse side of the form, since these will also be used in the future when volunteers are needed for specialized work such as disaster relief. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A copy of all approved newly completed forms should be retained in the congregation’s file, and the original should promptly be sent to the chairman of the Regional Building Committee for your area</span><span class="font4">. If the service committee determines that an individual does not qualify, two of them should meet with him and advise him of this while lovingly encouraging him to do what is necessary to qualify in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If there is any change in the circumstances of a volunteer, a new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Questionnaire</span><span class="font4"> should be submitted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">immediately, </span><span class="font4">especially when a brother is appointed as an elder or ministerial servant or there is a change of address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Regional Building Committee should promptly be notified if a volunteer moves away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If an approved volunteer becomes disqualified, i.e. is no longer one of Jehovah’s Witnesses or is judicially reproved, the body of elders is responsible to notify the Regional Building Committee </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">promptly, </span><span class="font4">so that the worker is no longer used for Kingdom Hall construction. If, for some other reason, the body of elders feels that a volunteer no longer qualifies, the local elders should discuss their concerns with the individual. If their view remains unchanged, they should notify the Regional Building Committee. However, please note that confidential details as to the reason for the disqualification should not be shared with the Regional Building Committee. If the individual later qualifies, he may submit a new </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Hall Volunteer Questionnaire</span><span class="font4"> as outlined above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The body of elders can request additional copies of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom Hall Volunteer Questionnaire</span><span class="font4"> (S-82) from the Regional Building Committee or via the monthly congregation literature request.</span></p>
