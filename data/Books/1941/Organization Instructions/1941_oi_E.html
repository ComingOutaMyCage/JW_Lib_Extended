<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark1"></a>ORGANIZATION INSTRUCTIONS</span></h1>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark3"></a>(as amended)</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">For the promotion of the Kingdom Interests the Society deems it necessary to make some minor changes in the Organi-zation Instructions. The instructions set out below take the place of the ones heretofore issued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What Is said here concerning the organization in the United States will apply to all parts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The territory embraced hi the United States is divided into zones, each having from five to twenty companies* The zones are designated alphabetically according to states, beginning with Alabama. The zones will be numbered from one to the number of zones within the state. Where the zone in one state laps over into some other state adjoining, the zone will still be considered as of the state in which it originates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Zone organization will be made up as follows: A servant for each zone, whose duties are set out below. Each separate and distinct company to have a company servant; other servants to be appointed, where the size of the company requires it, as follows; territory servant, secretary, treasurer, stockkeeper, sound servant, back-call servant, and advertising servant, or any others that the Society may hereafter Indicate. All of these shall be the assistants to the company servant and in turn all assistants of the zone servant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Appointments</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All servants, including conductors of study meetings, will be appointed by the Society. Each company may recommend to the Society persons qualified to serve in the respective positions. A committee composed of mature brethren may be selected by each company to canvass the situation carefully and submit a list of names of persons and send such to the Society's office* Such may be of the anointed or Jonadabs. The Society will not be bound by this list; but the list will be merely advisory. The zone servant will carefully take into consideration the qualifications of the members of the various companies and send in to the Society his recommendations of persons best qualified to act in the places indicated. The personnel of the servants of each company and the zone servants will be subject to change at any time by the Society. There will be no disposition to make a change so long as the organization is working to the advancement of the Kingdom and the glory of the Lord. Each one appointed to serve should do everything as unto the Lord for the advancement of the Kingdom, having In mind the responsibility of faithfulness to the Lord. The zone servant will, from time to time, recommend to the Society’s office at headquarters any changes in any company that appear to be to the advantage or advancement of the Kingdom, and in making recommendations will state his reasons for so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In any city or subdivision of a zone that has a company of more than 200 publishers said company shall be divided into units, and this without regard to language or color or nationality* No unit should contain more than 200 publishers, and when a unit exceeds that number the Society will subdivide It, establishing another unit</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The territory of the company shall be Subdivided to the best advantage to cover it, having in mind local conditions affecting the method of carrying forward the witness work in ti 'territory*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Co-ordination</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In order that there may be full coordination and complete harmonious action the jurisdiction of the various servants shall be as follows: The zone servant shall have general supervision of the field activities of the entire zone. The company servant will have supervision of the company service units, subject to the zone servant and, in particular, subject to the Society headquarters at Brooklyn. The servant in each unit, the servant of each company, and the zone servant shall all work together harmoniously and all be subject to the Society’s direction.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Duties of Zone Servant</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">He shall, at stated intervals, visit all the companies within the zone. Where a company is made up of two or more units, there shall be a general meeting of all the units to be attended by the zone servant, and, where it appears necessary for the zone servant to do so, he may visit the units separately, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... <sub>y</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The zone servant should become thoroughly acquainted **4rh the publishers within his zone, check their service records, note the spirit of co-operation of each, and particularly note the ones best qualified to serve in the respective positions, and from time to time send such recommendations to the office at 117 Adams Street, Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When visiting a company he shall notify that company by and through Its servant two weeks in advance. Ills schedule for visiting companies may be arranged or altered to meet the most urgent needs or requirements. He will have In mind always. however, the conservation of energy and time and saving of expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The zone servant has no authority to appoint a person to serve in any position, nor to remove one. He will recommend appointments or changes and send such recommendations to the Society. It shall be the duty of the zone servant to personally Interview each servant within the company or unit, check his work, and see that it is being done In accordance with the instructions, and wheresoever possible the company servant should accompany the zone servant at such interview with servants, each one having in mind nt all times Ilie necessity of complete unity in action to the best interests of the Kingdom. If conditions are such In any company that more than one meeting Is required, the zone servant may arrange for the same together with the company servant, appointing time and place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Upon visiting a company the zone servant will have a general meeting of the company and nil the units of the company and submit and discuss before such meeting the instructions Issued by the Society relative to field service.

All the time of the zone servant not required to aid the respective companies or units shall be devoted to house-to-house service in publishing the Kingdom message as a pioneer, lie may take with him newly Interested ones and demonstrate to such the proper manner of the publishing work. Since most of the meetings will be held in the evenings, the zone servant will be enabled to devote most of every day In the pioneer service, and all evenings to back-calls except the evenings on which be Is required to meet with the companies, ci ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The zone servant should familiarize himself with the duties of all the servants of the company In order that he may render such aid or counsel to them as may be required and proper in harmony with the Society*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairmen of Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meetings attended by the zone servant may be presided over by the zone servant or by some other mature brother selected by the company at the time of the meeting for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Study Meetings</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the person assigned to conduct a meeting is not able for any reason to perform his duty, he shall assign a substitute for that particular meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those assigned to conduct the study meetings will closely follow the Watchtower outline or Instructions as to conducting such study meetings.

To submit to the vote of the company the question of whether or not 11'at eft tower instructions shall be put into practice by the company, such as reading the paragraph, is entirely out of order. For the one conducting to occupy much time talking is also out of order. As a sum-up to ail questions discussed, the Watchtower paragraph, or the paragraph In the textbook used, germane to the question, shall be read. The conductor will see to it that each person who speaks to a question makes his speech short and to the point and avoids speaking of immaterial matters or things that do not relate to the question under consideration. All study meetings shall be limited to one hour. Service meetings may continue more than one hour when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It shall be the duty of the zone servant to ascertain the residence of each one of the publishers and endeavor to organize a separate study within the bounds of a territory where ten or more persons are within close range of each other.

Such study together with the phonograph and a Model Study booklet should be encouraged. When interested persons meet together in a private home such study will </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">be QTTunged by the publisher. All atudies </span><span class="font6">should be led by consecrated men, but, where all In attendance are women and there Is no consecrated man present qualified to conduct such model study, a consecrated woman may take the chair, keep order, use the phonograph, and have someone present read the questions, and then the one in the chair will rend the answer as set forth in the booklet, together with the scriptures cited. A model study presided over by a woman as above stated is not contrary to the scripture which says, &quot;I suffer not a woman to teach.” All model studies begun by pioneers should be turned over to the company when the pioneer moves to another community, and then a consecrated man If available in the company will conduct the study. As soon as possible the newly interested will be encouraged to participate in the field service and to attend the regular company studies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Necessarily the publishing work will entail a certain amount of expense upon those who are devoted to the Lord. General expenses are met by contributions; and since the obligation is upon the Society to direct the work, all contributions for the support of the work should be made to the Society; but such voluntary contributions may be handed to the zone servant, who shall receipt for the same and report the same to the Society.
