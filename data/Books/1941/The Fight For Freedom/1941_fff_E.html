<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THIS FIGHT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">FOR</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>FREEDOM</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2">THE Theocracy has at all times been violently opposed by the Devil and his agents, visible and invisible. There has been a conflict between the two since the very beginning and always Jehovah has had his faithful servants on the earth who have been unafraid of the enemy and have carried the fight right into his camp. In Australia the religio-political combine made an attempt to hinder the Lord’s work on January 17th, 1941 when the Society’s various corporations, and Jehovah’s witnesses, were declared unlawful in the Commonwealth. The Ambassadors of the Theocracy, however, did not take this lying down. In fact a more powerful witness than ever has been given, especially to the rulers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hereinafter follow some of the letters and telegrams that have passed between the Society’s attorney in Australasia and various officials of the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Representatives of the Sydney newspapers first advised the Society’s office of the proposed “ban” on Thursday evening January 16th, 1941. Newspapers and radio stations blared forth the news bright and early on Friday morning, but the “ban” had not yet been gazetted and for the time being the authorities were powerless!</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gow-rie, received the following letter at Canberra early <a name="bookmark4"></a><a name="bookmark5"></a>on Saturday morning January 18th, 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Your Excellency,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">News has just reached me per medium of the press to the effect that the Menzies Government has declared Jehovah's witnesses an illegal organization. In a country which has ever been a bulwark of liberty this is surely most disquieting and as attorney for the Watch Tower Bible &lt;£ Tract Society, Brooklyn, New York, I wish to enter a vigorous protest against such arbitrary action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the present time and for some weeks past several shipments of Bible helps have been held in bond by the Customs Department. These were printed in America and shipped here after the necessary licences had been approved at this end for their importation. The action of the Government in banning these must of necessity be considered an insult to the United States, especially since it cannot possibly be proven that they are subversive in any sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I also have the privilege to be the attorney here for the International Bible Students Association, a London corporation closely allied with the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. In Britain, Jehovah's witnesses are, as you are no doubt aware, permitted to go about their business of preaching the gospel of God's Kingdom without hindrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a report to the British Government in 1939, Sir Neville Henderson referred to the suffering of Jehovah's witnesses in Germany under the tyrannical hand of Hitler. This information was published in White Paper Germany (Number 2) 1939, &quot;Treatment of German Nationals in Germany”. Already these facts have been brought to the attention of the Federal Government. Does it not seem strange that Jehovah's witnesses in this country should be declared illegal and at the same time 6,000 of their brethren in Germany and many others in countries now occupied by Germany, should suffer untold tortures in concentration camps, because they will not break their solemn covenant with Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In my humble judgment it would have been much better if the Federal Government had waited till Mr. Menzies had visited Britain and ascertained the existing position as far as Jehovah's witnesses are concerned there. We are now faced with a nation divided against itself. In England the Government continues to regard the preaching of the gospel of God's Kingdom as of paramount importance. In this country responsible persons apparently take the view of Hitler, who was the first to ban Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His Majesty, King George VI, recently called upon his people to put their hand in the hand of God. Your Excellency and other leaders from time to time have used similar expressions, thus showing faith in the Almighty and absolute dependence upon Him for aid. Hence a witness to His supreme power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Jehovah’s witnesses are neither a sect nor a cult although the newspapers who arc unfortunately controlled in the majority of cases by a foreign power have so referred to them. There is no desire on the part of Jehovah’s witnesses to curry favour from any earthly potentate. It is a joy and privilege to continue to bear testimony to Christ’s Kingdom now being set up which is the world’s only hope. My purpose in sending this letter is that the responsible persons will choose, with knowledge, whether they are for or against God and His Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Respectfully,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A. MacGillivray</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark7"></a>On January 22nd, a letter over the signature of the Military and Official Secretary to the Governor-General was sent in reply:</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Dear Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am desired by the Governor-General to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 17th January and tn say that it has been referred for the consideration of the Commonwealth Government and reply direct, observing that the matter raised by you is one of Government policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) L. W. Bracegirdle</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Captain, R. A. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In view of the fact that no communication was received from the government on this vitally urgent matter, a telegram was despatched to His Excellency the Governor-General on January 30th as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">PLEASE CONVEY HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE VI INFORMATION THAT NO LONGER IS IT permissible TO CIRCULATE IN AUSTRALIA BIBLES PRINTED BY KINGS COMMAND OXFORD CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS OF WHICH LARGE CONSIGNMENT FROM WATCHTOWER SOCIETY URGENTLY REQUIRED IN BURMA and NOW HELD WHARF SYDNEY STOP AT SAME TIME CHRISTIAN HOMES RIFLED OF BIBLES STOP CHRISTIANS NO LONGER PERMITTED MEET BOOKS CONTAINING EXPOSURE HITLER AND ASSOCIATES FORBIDDEN AUSTRALIAN DISTRIBUTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Prompt reply was received:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">AS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF YOUR TELEGRAM DATED THIRTIETH JANUARY IS ENTIRELY ONE OF GOVERNMENT POLICY IT HAS BEEN FORWARDED FOR THE CONSIDERATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">OF THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT MILITARY &amp;&nbsp;OFFICIAL SCTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Apparently, however, the government had not considered the matter for they were as silent as the grave. Desiring urgent action, unencumbered by the usual red-tape delays, the Society’s attorney again addressed the “head of the house,” direct, February 6th:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HIS EXCELLENCY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THE GOVERNOR GENERAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">LORD GOWRIE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CANBERRA</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFERRING MY TELEGRAM 30 JANUARY AND YOUR SECRETARY’S REPLY GIST YOUR EXCELLENCY’S INSTRUCTIONS NOT ACTED UPON BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STOP OFFICERS OF COMMONWEALTH CONTINUE CARRY ON PERSECUTION OUTLINED MY TELEGRAM STOP HOMES RAIDED CHRISTIANS DEPRIVED OF EMPLOYMENT EJECTED FROM HOMES LEFT TO STARVE STOP AS A BRITISH CITIZEN I EMPHATICALLY PROTEST AGAINST THIS OUTRAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESPECTFULLY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This brought the following reply from the Governor-General, written on the same day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dear Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am desired by the Governor-General to acknowledge receipt of your telegram dated 6th February, in which the following appears: “Your Excellency’s instructions not acted upon by Federal Government. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No instructions whatsoever were forwarded by the Governor-General to the Commonwealth Government in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">connection with the matter under review. To do so would be in strict contravention of British constitutional practice. As previously stated the Government’s actions, to which you refer, are based on a matter of Government policy, and I am to suggest that it would be quite fitting, if any further communication on the subject were addressed to the Prime Minister or Acting Prime Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yours faithfully, L. W. Bracegirdle Captain, R. A. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile Christians had to endure the loss of their freedom in a country where freedom is—or was—a most jealously guarded heritage. It was no use dealing with the “lesser lights*<sup>1</sup> so the Society’s attorney sent a further urgent communication to the King’s representative on February 9th. This telegram was later confirmed in writing:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HIS EXCELLENCY, THE GOVERNOR GENERAL GRAVE SITUATION HAS DEVELOPED STOP CHRISTIANS ARE NO LONGER PERMITTED MEET FOR WORSHIP OF ALMIGHTY GOD GOVERNMENT SPENDS HUNDREDS POUNDS TO PREVENT DISTRIBUTION BIBLES MAINTAINS EXPENSIVE GESTAPO OVER MY HOME STOP IF MINISTERS AND SOLICITOR GENERAL CONTINUE DEFIANCE CLAUSE 116 CONSTITUTION AND VIOLATION RIGHTS GUARANTEED THEREBY RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST YOU DISMISS AS SIR PHILIP GAME DISMISSED LABOUR PREMIER LANG FOR BREACH OF LAW STOP ONLY REDRESS IN SUCH CASES IS DIRECT INTERVENTION OF KING'S REPRESENTATIVE THEREFORE IT IS USELESS TO ASK ME TO</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">COMMUNICATE WITH THE LAWBREAKERS THEMSELVES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Formal acknowledgment from Captain Bracegirdle, was duly received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">February 11th brought a letter from the Prime Minister's Department! It was carefully examined for helpful information, but without success. This is what it said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dear Sir,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am directed to refer to your telegrams dated •30th January and 6th February addressed to His Excellency the Governor-General regarding the action recently taken by the Commonwealth Government in the interests of national security.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I am to state that the representations you have submitted in the above connection have been noted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) F. Strahan</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TIME MARCHES ON! After a trip around Australia during which he visited Jehovah’s witnesses in nearly every state, the Australian representative of the Society sent a further very-much-to-the-point telegram to His Excellency pointing out tho sad state of affairs in this “land of the free and home of the brave”. Here it is. It was sent on March 22nd:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HIS EXCELLENCY, THE GOVERNOR GENERAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">DISAPPOINTED HAVING NO ACTION MY TELEGRAM NINTH FEBRUARY REPORTS COMING TO HAND REVEAL CHRISTIANS BEING HELD UP AT BAYONET POINT AND LOADED GUN STOP CONTRAST THIS WITH STATEMENT MADE BY CHURCHILL REGARDING FREEDOM OF UTTERANCE IN ENGLAND STOP DO YOU APPROVE OF CHRISTIANS BEING FORBIDDEN TO MEET FOR WORSHIP OF ALMIGHTY GOD SONG PRAYER STUDY OF BIBLE WITH NECESSARY HELPS PLEASE ANSWER YES OR NO</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No reply to this telegram was received by noon on April 3rd. Apparently it had been intercepted. A further wire, in which His Excellency was advised of the Postal Section of Hitler’s secret weapon in Australia, was despatched that afternoon :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I WIRED YOU ON SATURDAY MARCH 22ND AND HAVING HAD NO REPLY I AM SUSPICIOUS THAT THE FIFTH COLUMN CATHOLIC ACTION SECTION OF THE’ POST OFFICE MAY HAVE CONFISCATED SAME STOP IF SO I SHALL DELIVER TEXT OF TELEGRAM BY SPECIAL MESSENGER</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And the reply received on the same day:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">YOUR TELEGRAM TWENTYSECOND MARCH AND THIRD APRIL RECEIVED BY GOVERNOR GENERAL STOP SUGGEST THAT THE ANSWER MAY BE FOUND IN THE LATTER PART OF THE FINAL PARAGRAPH OF MY LETTER YOU DATED SIXTH FEBRUARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MILITARY AND OFFICIAL SECRETARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">MEMORIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The celebration of the memorial of our Lord’s death is sacred to all true Christians. The date set down for this celebration in 1941, in accordance with Scriptural reckoning, was after 6 p.m. April 11th and before 3 p.m. April 12th. Just because the Government had exceeded its authority and insulted the Most High by attempting to ban the Theocratic Government in Australia, that did not mean that His people would forego their obligations and privileges before Jehovah. On April 3rd the following telegram was sent to Hon. W. M. Hughes, Attorney General:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WE HAVE BEEN DENIED THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING AT SEVEN BERESFORD ROAD STRATHFIELD FOR STUDY OF THE BIBLE STOP WOULD YOU APPROVE OF A BODY OF CHRISTIANS MEETING AT THE ABOVE ADDRESS ON THE ELEVENTH APRIL FOR THE PURPOSE OF CELEBRATING THE MEMORIAL OF THE LORD’S DEATH KINDLY ADVISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In due course a telegram from Mr. Hughes was received, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REPLYING TO YOUR TELEGRAM THIRD APRIL MY PERMISSION OR APPROVAL NOT NECESSARY FOR HOLDING OF ANY SERVICE OR MEETING FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE APPLICATIONS YOU REPRESENT THE DISSOLVED ASSOCIATIONS AND AS PREVIOUSLY STATED I AM NOT ABLE TO FACILITATE ANY MEETINGS TO BE HELD UNDER THEIR AUSPICES</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W. M. HUGHES COMMONWEALTH ATTORNEY GENERAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7 I 11</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mr. MacGillivray was by this time in ?&lt;ew Zealand, which is another story. However, to the Attorney General’s rather complicated telegram the following reply was promptly sent:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFERRING YOUR TELEGRAM SEVENTH INSTANT IN VIEW OF FACT DISSOLVED ASSOCIATIONS NOT INVOLVED WHATSOEVER AND AS NO APPROVAL NECESSARY ACCORDING FIRST PORTION YOUR TELEGRAM CHRISTIANS PROPOSE TO CELEBRATE MEMORIAL OF LORD’S DEATH SEVEN BERESFORD ROAD STRATHFIELD FRIDAY NEXT</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8/4/41 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What happened at the Theocratic Embassy on April 12th at 2 p.m. is now history. 600 Christians assembled to worship and praise Almighty God and to celebrate in a befitting manner the memorial of the death of His Son, our Theocratic King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">BIBLES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Commonwealth Government may seize and unlawfully hold Bible text books by Judge Rutherford which expose as do no other publications, the machinations of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Franco and Pacelli, but it has no business to lock up Bibles. Of such a dastardly crime, however, is it guilty. Christians throughout Australia desiring to go from place to place with the Bible, as commanded by Jesus have been unable so to do because their stocks have been locked away. Appreciating the urgency and importance of the whole situation, the Society’s Australasian Attorney sent the following telegram to the Attorney General, Mr. Hughes on April 24th last:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">LARGE CONSIGNMENT KING JAMES VERSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">BIBLES URGENTLY REQUIRED READY SHIP FROM MY LONDON OFFICE STOP MAY I HAVE ASSURANCE THESE WILL BE DELIVERED ME ON ARRIVAL STOP NO OVERSEAS EXCHANGE NECESSARY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile, a further vita! telegram to His Excellency the Governor-General: </span><span class="font1">BRITAIN IN DECLARING WAR ON GERMANY GAVE AS ONE OF HER REASONS THE ILL TREATMENT OF GERMAN NATIONALS MAKING PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE CRUEL ACTION OF HITLER AGAINST CHRISTIANS KNOWN AS JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES STOP SINCE THEN BRITAIN HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW FAVOUR TO THE LORD’S PEOPLE AND THE WORK OF JEHOVAH’S WIT-NESSES OF COMFORTING THE PEOPLE BY MEANS OF BIBLE AND BIBLE HELPS WHICH HAS BEEN CARRIED ON WITHOUT HINDRANCE STOP IN CONTRA-DISTINCTION TO THIS THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT BY ORDER IN COUNCIL ON THE SEVENTEENTH DAY OF JANUARY OUTLAWED CHRISTIANITY BROUGHT UNTOLD PERSECUTION AND SUFFERING UPON JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES AND SPENDS ONE THOUSAND POUNDS PER WEEK TO PREVENT FREEDOM OF WORSHIP AND THE CARRYING ON OF CHRISTIAN WORK BY THOUSANDS OF LOYAL CITIZENS THROUGHOUT THE LAND STOP AT THIS TIME MANY ARE IN GREAT DISTRESS AND IN NEED OF COMFORT STOP THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT STANDS RESPONSIBLE BEFORE ALMIGHTY GOD FOR</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION AND OPPOSING THE THEOCRACY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By May 9th, 1941 no reply had been received from Mr. Hughes regarding Bibles, not even an acknowledgment. A forceful reminder outlining the shameful course of action of the Commonwealth Government was sent forthwith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ON APRIL 24TH I WIRED YOU CONCERNING SHIPMENT OF BIBLES FROM LONDON SENT YOU REMINDER MAY 2ND BOTH COMMUNICATIONS YOUR DEPARTMENT IGNORED STOP LEAST COULD BE EXPECTED OF PUBLIC SERVANTS IS COMMON COURTESY STOP LAST JANAURY COMMONWEALTH AFTER ONLY TWENTY MINUTES DELIBERATION DISGRACED THE EMPIRE BY OUTLAWING CHRISTIANITY AND APPROPRIATING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS PUBLIC MONEY FOR MAINTAINING GESTAPO HITLER STYLE TO PREVENT FREE WORSHIP THEREFORE NEED I BE SURPRISED AT YOUR GOVERNMENT CONTINUING PERSECUTION AND IN-SULTING HUNDREDS THOUSANDS AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS WHOSE FATHERS SONS BROTHERS ARE NOW FIGHTING AND DYING FOR LIBERTY STOP THEIR LOVED ONES BACK HOME CANNOT HAVE BIBLES OR BIBLE HELPS BECAUSE BOOKS EXPOSING HITLER AND EMPIRES ENEMIES ARE FORBIDDEN ENTRY AND DISTRIBUTION AUSTRALIA STOP WHAT WILL YOUR ANSWER BE TO THESE FIGHTERS FOR FREEDOM WHEN THEY HEAR OF THIS RANK HYPOCRISY</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It appears, however, that Mr. Hughes reply and the last-mentioned telegram crossed in transit. Herewith is the somewhat vague answer of the Attorney General to Mr. MacGillivray’s enquiry for Bibles:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFERENCE YOUR TELEGRAM DATED APRIL TWENTYFOURTH REGARDING CONSIGNMENT KING JAMES VERSION BIBLES STOP IF THESE BIBLES ARE CONSIGNED TO YOU PERSONALLY AND NOT TO YOU AS ATTORNEY OR REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OF THE DISSOLVED ASSOCIATIONS THEN SO FAR AS THE COMMONWEALTH IS CONCERNED THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO THEIR DELIVERY SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH CUSTOMS AND OTHER STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS STOP BUT THE COMMONWEALTH WILL NOT BE PREPARED TO FACILITATE ANY MODE OF DELIVERY WHICH WOULD HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF RECOGNIZING THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF THE ASSOCIATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN DISSOLVED</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HUGHES</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Without further comment, here is the reply Mr. Hughes received on May 12th. It is 200 words long and amazed the Postal Clerk who received it. The Attorney General’s reply was merely an acknowledgment :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">YOUR TELEGRAM NINTH INSTANT DELIVERED MY OFFICE WHILE ABSENT STOP I SHALL BE NO PARTY TO ANYTHING THAT INSULTS THE ALMIGHTY GOD HIS SERVANTS JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES HIS MAJESTY THE KING OR BRITAIN WHICH IN THE WORDS OF CHURCHILL STANDS NOW FOR FREEDOM STOP ACTION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN DECLARING CHRISTIANITY ILLEGAL IN COMMONWEALTH WHOLLY CONTRARY TO BRITISH TRADITION STOP ANY PERSONS WHO THINK THEY CAN DISSOLVE THE THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT OF JEHOVAH GOD ARE EITHER DEMONIZED OR CRAZY STOP BIBLES REFERRED TO IN MY TELEGRAM WILL BE DISTRIBUTED BY LOYAL BRITISH SUBJECTS STOP BE ADVISED THAT A WAVE OF INDIGNATION HAS SPREAD OVER NATION AND THAT WE STILL HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY THOUSANDS OF LOYAL BRITISHERS WHO WILL STAND BY BRITAIN IN THIS HOUR OF NEED NOTWITHSTANDING FACT THAT LEADERS HAVE BETRAYED HER STOP PLEASE GIVE ME ASSURANCE IN WRITING THAT BIBLES WILL BE IMMEDIATELY HANDED ME ON ARRIVAL STOP I HAVE ALREADY BEEN HUMBUGGED BY CUSTOMS AND OTHER OFFICIALS WHO ARE EVIDENTLY MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SERV-ING THEIR FOREIGN CONTROLLERS AT VATICAN CITY THAN THEY ARE OF PERFORMING DUTY ACCORDING TO THEIR OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO HIS MAJESTY THE KING</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mr. MacGillivray was still not sure whether, if he told London to send the Bibles, they would be delivered to him or left to rot in Bond along with £5,000 worth of Biblical text books which were stolen and locked up since November, 1940. Desiring further information another shot was fired and here it is. The date is May, 28th:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REPLYING YOUR TELEGRAM NINTH MAY STOP FIRST PORTION IS QUITE CLEAR BUT LATTER 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">PORTION PUTS RESTRICTIONS ON DISTRIBUTION OF BIBLES STOP I AM NOT AWARE THAT HIS MAJESTY KING GEORGE DEFENDER OF THE FAITH HAS AT ANY TIME GIVEN HIS-MINISTERS AUTHORITY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM RECEIVING COPIES OF THE BIBLE OR CONFINED THE DISTRIBUTION OF SAME TO ANY PARTICULAR SECT STOP ALL CHRISTIANS ARE JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES ISAIAH FORTY-THREE TEN AND SINCE CHRISTIANS ARE THE ONLY ONES USING THE BIBLE YOUR EDICT WOULD MEAN&quot; TOTAL PROHIBITION OF DISTRIBUTION OF THE BIBLE IN THE COMMONWEALTH STOP ALREADY THE COMMONWEALTH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCKING UP MILLIONS OF BIBLES AND BOOKS CONTAINING BIBLE SERMONS IN RAT INFESTED BUILDINGS STOP MISSION BOATS WORTH THOUSANDS OF POUNDS UNLAWFULLY TAKEN FROM THEIR MOORINGS IN SYDNEY HAVE BEEN IN THE WATER UNATTENDED FOR FOUR AND HALF MONTHS AND MAY NOW BE CONSIDERED A TOTAL LOSS STOP MY REPRESENTATIONS TO CANBERRA HAVE BEEN OF NO AVAIL STOP IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS LAND ARE BEGINNING TO ASK WHETHER OR NOT THE GOVERNMENT IS ANTI-CHRIST</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MACGILLIVRAY</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And so the battle goes on. The Theocracy having taken up the offensive is pushing forever onward. Soon the mighty Executive Officer of Jehovah will smite the enemy to the dust. The name and word of the Great Theocrat will be vindicated and his faithful servants avenged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(To be continued!)</span></p>
