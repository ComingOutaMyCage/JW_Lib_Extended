<p><span class="font3">TO A WORLD, a large part of which groans under the wicked aggressions of the totalitarian dictators and the other part of which stands in mortal fear thereof, the prophetic proof of the early end of the Axis Powers and of all oppressors comes indeed as great comfort to countless mourners. But what follows that end, to wit, the long-promised Theocratic Government with its unspeakable blessings to obedient men, is of still greater consolation. When Judge Rutherford delivered the speech on this comforting theme to the many thousands gathered in a national assembly on Saturday, August 9, 1941, in and about The Arena, St. Louis, Mo., the vast audience acclaimed the message with joyous applause and enthusiastically adopted the Resolution that followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For the comfort of yet other unnumbered multitudes Judge Rutherford’s speech is gratefully published herein.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark1"></a>COMFORT ALL</span><br><br><span class="font10"><a name="bookmark2"></a>THAT MOURN</span></h1>
<p><span class="font9">W</span><span class="font6">HEN the people of all nations mourn; when all are in distress and greatly perplexed, there is need of diligence to ascertain the cause of distress and learn and give heed to the prescribed remedy for such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Never within the memory of man has there been on earth such general sorrow and mourning as now. Never a time when the people need comfort as they do now. Who can give the desired comfort?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Creator of heaven and earth, the Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah,” is the God of all comfort. In the Bible, which is His Word, he has set forth the truth telling plainly why the people mourn and what is the complete remedy therefor. All persons who would have such information, and who would receive comfort, must resort to and give heed to the Word of God. All persons who are now of good-will toward Almighty God will do that very thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christians are those persons who follow the lead of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are the servants of the Almighty God. As his servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">they are duly and fully ordained and commissioned by the Almighty God to deliver His message of truth to all persons on earth who are of good-will toward Jehovah. The commission which Almighty God has given to each one of his faithful servants and followers of Christ Jesus is set down at Isaiah 61:1,2, in these words: “The spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the ipeek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the “day of vengeance of our God”, and therefore the time when He will vindicate His holy name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before He exercises his power for the vindication of his name his servants must proclaim His great name throughout the earth. For several years past the witnesses for Jehovah have declared to the people throughout the earth the purpose of God to vindicate his name, and of his vengeance against all wickedness. The time draws near, therefore, for him to exercise his supreme power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is the day in which the people mourn, and this is the time when Jehovah’s servants must carry the message of God’s comfort to all that mourn. This is the time when the good news, or gospel, must be preached, as commanded by the Lord, to all nations for a witness, and that preaching must he done by those who are devoted to Jehovah, and who therefore are Jehovah’s witnesses.—Matthew 24:14; Isaiah 43:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Every follower of Christ Jesus who is in a covenant to do the will of God is and indeed must be a preacher of this gospel in obedience to the Lord’s commandment. All such have, in obedience to God’s commandment, separated themselves from the things of this world, and they must, as commanded, keep themselves “unspotted from the world”. (James 1:27) They must devote all of their energies to preaching “this gospel of the kingdom” to the people that those who mourn may receive comfort. That is the present-day work of paramount importance to all who would live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those in distress, and who mourn and who desire comfort, must fully realize that Almighty God is the fountain of life and source of all comfort and joy. (Psalm 36: 9) The Bible contains all of that needed information, which will comfort all who desire righteousness and peace. The faithful servants of God, receiving comfort from the Lord as set forth in the Bible, must bear that same message of comfort to them that are in trouble and who desire to hear the truth. Such is the present-day commission and work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The people are torn by war, famine, pestilence, and beset by all manner of wickedness. No longer are the people free to assemble, speak and worship God as He has commanded. All human remedies offered have failed, and in the world the people are without hope. The hour has struck when the people must turn to God and his Word if they would receive comfort and survive the terrible disaster that is impending and about to fall upon the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CAUSE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What is the cause of the great mourning of the people of all nations? How it is possible for the people to have peace and joy ? Those two questions are answered in the terse and forceful words of the Bible record at Proverbs 29: 2, to wit: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The sorrow, distress and mourning of the people of all nations, therefore, as the Lord has stated, is because the wicked now bear rule and use that ruling authority to oppress the people and take away their liberties and the substance of their labor. The only remedy is the authoritative rule of the world by the King of righteousness. Those who now exercise faith in God and in his Word, and who obtain the truth from his Word, look forward with eagerness to the day when the righteous shall be in complete authority in all the earth. It is the truth that will make the people free from fear and mourning. Receiving the truth, their joy at once begins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the Bible testimony both the wicked and the righteous must be definitely identified, and this must be done before any man can understand and appreciate the cause of the world distress and what is the true remedy therefor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THE WICKED</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The mighty wicked ruler is Satan the Devil. He is invisible to human eyes, but exercises tremendous power over men and nations. Associated with him is a host of wicked angels or demons, likewise invisible to human eyes, and at all times preying upon the people. That invisible, wicked rule is represented on the earth by visible agents that yield to and are controlled by the invisible demon-power. Those human agents generally are entirely blind to the fact that the demons exercise the real ruling power, and hence they are Jed blindly into deeds of wickedness. Concerning this it is written in the Bible that Satan, the god of this world, hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ Jesus, who is the image of God, should shine unto them. (2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4) Those that believe not, here mentioned, are the ones who do not have and exercise faith in God and in Christ, and who disregard the Bible as God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Satan is the “prince [god] of this world”. (John 12: 31; John 14; 30) He is the &quot;chief of demons’, meaning that he is the leader of all the demon host. (Matthew 9:34; Matthew 12:24, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> The rule of wickedness is over the entire earth; as it is written: ‘The whole world lies in the wicked one.’ (1 John 5:19) Since the year 1914 the sorrows and mourning of the nations have continuously increased, and the reason therefor is stated at Revelation 12:12 in these words: “Woe to the inhabiters of the earth [meaning the rulers of the earth], and of the sea [meaning the peoples that bear up and support those nations]! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.” The Devil knows his time is short because the due time is here when he must be ousted and when righteousness shall rule the world, and which good news, when proclaimed, brings comfort and joy to all who have faith in God and in his Word. The present is the transition period from the wicked to the righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THE RIGHTEOUS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Almighty God, whose name alone is Jehovah, is the eternal, righteous One. (Psalm 116:5) “God is in the generation of the righteous.” (Psalm 14:5) All his ways are righteous, and his commandments are righteousness. (Psalm 119:172) His beloved Son, Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah has made Lord and King of the world, is the express image of his Father Jehovah. (Hebrews 1:3) He is the world’s rightful and righteous. King, duly appointed and anointed by Jehovah to rule. (John 18:37) God’s due </span><span class="font6">time, when He shall rule, has come. His rule as King of The Theocracy is of the greatest importance to all creation. Under His rule the righteous will of Jehovah shall be done in the earth, and for this reason Jesus commanded all Christians to pray to God these words: ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth as it is done in heaven.’ (Matthew 6:10) Concerning Christ Jesus, the righteous King, it is written, at Isaiah 9:6: “The government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” When that righteous King rules the world in completeness the people shall rejoice. The hour for his unobstructed rule is at hand, and every person who gets life everlasting must take his place wholly on the side of the King of The Theocracy and, doing so, will participate in the blessings to be administered. This good news, or gospel, must now be preached to the people that they may have hope and have an opportunity to choose Christ the King of righteousness and live, and, failing to do so, remain as supporters of the wicked rule and perish. Each person, therefore, must choose his own destiny. The obligation and commission of Jehovah’s witnesses is to proclaim the truth of and concerning The Theocracy, which will enable the people to intelligently choose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The facts are indisputable, and therefore admitted, that the Nazis, Fascists and the mightiest religious organization on earth, acting together and designated as “the Axis powers”, now rule from Norway to Egypt and within that realm the people mourn. That ruling power is opposed to the Kingdom of God under Christ and violently opposes everyone who advocates The Theoceacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Opposing the Nazi, religious combine is another mighty world power, carried on by the political and commercial strong men of those nations, and ably supported by religious leaders. That world power is generally known as the advocate of Democracy, and during the World War from 1914 to 1918 adopted and used the slogan: “This war will make the world safe for democracy.” That ruling power does not advocate the kingdom of God and hence is against The Theoceacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;">prophecy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Almighty God knew the end from the beginning and set down the words pertaining thereto, but hid the meaning thereof until his own due time to reveal the same. Mark well the Lord’s prophecy describing those two great ruling powers and the end thereof. More than two thousand years ago Jehovah dictated His prophecy to Daniel, the servant of God, and it is written in the Bible. It appears that the mean-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">COMFORT ALL THAT MOURN 11 </span><span class="font6">ing of divine prophecy is hidden from men until God’s due time for the same to be understandable. God’s due time is when He brings to pass events well known to all persons who desire to know, which events fit the prophecy, and the meaning of the prophecy is thereby made understandable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When God had completed the dictation of the prophecy here considered Daniel says: “And I heard, but I understood not; then said I, 0 my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. . . . [ThenJ the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.”—Daniel 12: 8-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The time of the end” is now here. The sure and unfailing promise of Jehovah God is that now the wise shall understand. “The wise” are those who fear Jehovah God, who devote themselves to him and who serve him and his kingdom faithfully and truly. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do his commandments; his praise endureth for ever.”—Psalm 111: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IDENTIFICATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prophecy of Daniel tells of two mighty opposing ruling powers: one designated therein as “the king of the north”, and the other designated as “the king of the south”. The identification of these two kings is essential to an understanding of the prophecy set out at Daniel 11:27-45. Those two kings are not mere men, but are world ruling powers, in which men play their parts as the servants of the wicked one, “the god of this world.” Both of such ruling powers are instruments of the organization created and employed by Satan to keep the people in ignorance of Jehovah and his great Theocratic Government, and Satan’s purpose is to turn the people away from Almighty God and lead them into destruction. This he does in his endeavor to carry out the wicked challenge flung into the face of Jehovah centuries ago. Satan is the ‘father of lies’ (John 8: 44), and hence he causes both of his ruling powers to resort to lies in order to blind them and to blind the people to the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The king of the north” is that ruling power which is totalitarian and dictatorial, which rules and claims the right to rule the nations of the earth, and which is violently opposed to The Theocratic Government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus, and opposes and persecutes those servants of God who proclaim the coming and universal rule of the kingdom of righteousness. Politics and religion are the chief elements of “the king of the north”. That ruling power began with Nimrod, the earth’s first political, religious dictator, who compelled the people to worship him and to obey his commandments. From time to time that power has prevailed in the earth and today is represented in the “Axis combine”, which seeks to rule the world and proclaims its purpose to set up once again the “Holy Roman Empire”. It violently opposes The Theocracy and persecutes those who support that righteous government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The king of the south” is the world ruling power which rules and claims the right to rule the nations of earth in the name of Democracy. The dominant elements of such power are commerce, politics and religion. It began with ancient Egypt, the first world power controlled by commerce, politics and religion. Today it is represented in the British Commonwealth of Nations and the nations supporting that empire. It does not advocate and support Jehovah’s Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and is therefore against the kingdom of God; as the King declared: “He that is not with me is against me.”—Matthew 12: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Due to the instructions received from their religious advisers both kings have false conclusions as to the Kingdom of God. Instead of recognizing Jehovah’s anointed King, Christ Jesus, who was enthroned in 1914, both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” set ' themselves against The Theocracy and their action is in fulfillment of God’s prophetic words, to wit: “The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his Anointed.” (Psalm 2:2) The Devil planted that ambitious desire in the minds of both kings to rule the earth, that he might bring about the destruction of the nations before Armageddon. Both strive for world domination. To that end they employ diplomacy and force, manifested particularly from 1914 to 1918 in the world. Then both sat at the same table to formulate a scheme to rule the world and the League of Nations was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At this point of the prophecy of Daniel (11:27), as it is. written, “both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While they speak lies to each other, their chief lie is that they deny that Jehovah God is the supreme power and that Christ Jesus is the rightful ruler of the world by reason of his appointment from the great Theocrat, Jehovah God, and that his kingdom has now come. The Word of God plainly says that the table around which they sat is “the table of demons” (1 Corinthians 10:21, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> and that the chief of demons is Satan, who is the father of lies. Then the religious instructors announced that the League of Nations is the instrument of God to rule the world. The League of Nations, to which both kings subscribed, stood up and in substance said: “We will rule the world, instead of Christ, Jehovah’s Anointed King.” That marks the beginning of the public manifestation of the “desolating abomination” mentioned by Daniel and the Lord Jesus. Now both “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” stand where they ought not to stand and boastfully claim the right to rule the world, and concerning which Jesus says: “But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains.” (Mark 13:14) Thus the Lord identifies the “abomination of desolation” and warns the people of good-will toward God that they must flee to the kingdom of God by Christ Jesus before the terrors of Armageddon fall upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Now all the world witnesses “the king of the north” and “the king of the south” in the deadly grip of war, to determine which shall rule the world. The prophecy says that the purpose of both kings is “to do mischief”, or wickedly, because they are both against Jehovah and Mis Kingdom by Christ Jesus. Then the prophecy adds: “It shall not prosper; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.” Their efforts shall not forestall Jehovah in establishing His government of righteousness. No power can successfully interfere with Jehovah in establishing his government of righteousness. No power can successfully interfere with Jehovah in carrying out his purpose. The Almighty God says: “I have purposed it, I will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) The great God of Eternity, who sits in the heavens, shall have and does have both of these kings in derision and laughs at their futile efforts.—Psalm 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophecy of Daniel, at the eleventh chapter, proceeds to detail the struggle between “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”, and definitely tells of the everlasting end of the totalitarian rule and that the Axis combine, the dictatorial rule, shall soon cease for ever. On this occasion it is not possible to relate the details of that prophecy, but, by the Lord’s grace, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font6"> will publish the same that the people of good-will may be enlightened and strengthened in hope for complete relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEUTRALITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Both of The kings’ fight desperately for world domination. They are working great destruction upon the nations, increasing the burdens of all and causing the people to mourn greatly. What is the attitude of Jehovah’s covenant people concerning this controversy ? Shall they take sides and fight either for “the king of the north” or for “the king of the south”? Almighty God commands that they must remain entirely neutral in the controversy. Because his covenant people are servants and representatives of The Theocracy they must hold themselves entirely aloof from warring factions of this world. (2 Corinthians 10: 3, 4) In neutrality Christ Jesus takes the lead and commands all of the faithful supporters of his kingdom to follow in his steps. (1 Peter 2:21) To his faithful followers Jesus says: We are not of the world, even as I am not of the world; because ye are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, you are opposed and hated by all nations for my name’s sake.’ (John 17:16; John 15:19; Matthew 24: 7-9) Jehovah’s covenant people are the representatives of The Theocracy and must hold fast their integrity toward God and his kingdom. To do otherwise means their destruction everlastingly. Jehovah’s covenant people are now engaged in a work of the greatest importance to mankind, to wit, the directing of the people to the only possible means of peace, comfort and life. This one thing they must do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophecy shows that in order to fight against the totalitarian forces of “the north” “the king of the south” becomes more and more dictatorial. Both adopt the same method or means, and as a result the burdens of the people greatly increase and they mourn bitterly. Such are the present-day experiences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">END</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What, then, shall be the end of this great distress and mourning? Shall the totalitarian dictators succeed in controlling the earth? God’s prophecy answers that to the full satisfaction of all who love righteousness. The prophecy tells that “the king of the north” receives information which proceeds from Jehovah God and Christ Jesus, and which greatly troubles the world powers, and “therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many. . . . Yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him”. (Daniel 11:44,45) That will mark the end of the rule of wickedness and will mean the end of mourning for the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">COMFORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By revealing to his covenant people the meaning of his prophecy Jehovah brings to them great comfort now. None have suffered more than those who have held fast their integrity toward God. They have suffered for righteousness’ sake. Because of their faithfulness to God and His King, Jehovah directs to his covenant people this message: “Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who coniforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.” (2 Corinthians 1:2-4) Thus Jehovah plainly commands what course the Christian must now take, and which is, to “comfort all that mourn”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Obeying God’s commandment, and desiring to aid and comfort those who are in trouble, Jehovah’s servants and witnesses now delight to call attention to the message of the Lord, which has brought them great comfort, and they bid those that mourn to give a hearing ear to that message because it is from the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again you are reminded of Jehovah’s emphatic words: ‘When the wicked bear rule, the people mourn.’ With the present, world-wide mourning of the people it must be apparent to all that the wicked now rule the nations of earth, and of which there could not be the slightest doubt. Furthermore, the present world powers offer no remedy for the betterment of the people. Jehovah’s remedy is certain and complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIGHTEOUS RULE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Following the wicked rule of the dictator Nimrod, God made known his purpose to raise up what the Scriptures speak of as “The Seed”, that is, His own King, and to set up his kingdom, through which all peoples of the earth might receive the blessings of peace, prosperity, joy, happiness and everlasting life. Jehovah’s purpose never fails. In his due time his expressed will must be done and shall be carried out.— Isaiah 55:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Kingdom, which Jehovah promised, is the kingdom for which Christians for centuries have prayed, as Jesus commanded: ‘Thy kingdom come ; thy will be done in earth as it is done in heaven.’ All the ways of Jehovah are righteous ; and when his will is done in the earth, that means the righteous rule or government of the earth, in which there shall be no sorrow or mourning among the people. With the end of the rule of dictators God’s kingdom of righteousness shall rule the people right here in the earth; and they shall then rejoice, because, it is written, “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice.”—Proverbs 29:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Repeatedly by his many prophets God has told of the coming of His kingdom, and those faithful prophets suffered martyrdom because of their faithfulness in advocating that coming kingdom. Then God sent into the earth his Son, Jesus, whom God anointed and made King. Before the Roman governor Jesus declared that He is the King. (John 18: 37) Jesus was put to death and by his lifeblood he has bought the race of men, all of whom had inherited condemnation of death. God raised Jesus out of death, and that great Spirit, exalted to heaven, is now the King and rightful Ruler of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God gives his unfailing promise that in due time Christ Jesus the King shall be enthroned and rule the world in righteousness. That promise is certain of fulfillment. Furthermore the Lord makes known by his Word that the setting up of the kingdom of righteousness will be attended by great trouble, war, famine, pestilence, oppression of the people, and intense distress of the nations. Such troubles and woes are now here, and are due to the fact that the Devil refuses to yield up the rulership of the world without a great struggle; hence the Devil brings ever increasing woes upon the people. (Revelation 12:12) These events have come to pass in the present time and are in fulfillment of the prophecies of God, and all the people may observe them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the two kings, “the king of the north” and “the king of the south”, engage in the most deadly and destructive war of all time, the God of heaven sets up his kingdom, as Jehovah by his prophecy of Daniel foretold</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">: “And</span><span class="font6"> in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.” —Daniel 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That kingdom has now come and the King is in action. His first work is to inform the people of what is taking place and that these presentday events will be quickly followed by the complete destruction of Satan’s rule to the end that righteousness may obtain in the easth for ever without interruption. During the past few years the Lord has sent forth his servants to bear witness before the people of and concerning his kingdom, and, this done, there shall follow quickly “the battle of that great day of God Almighty”, and which will be the greatest tribulation the world will ever have known. (Revelation 16:16; Matthew 24:14, 21) Such is precisely in fulfillment of the prophetic utterance of Jehovah set forth at Exodus 9:16. The power of the Lord at Armageddon, exercised against God’s enemies, will put an everlasting end to the “Axis powers” and to all similar powers of wickedness. All of such have forgotten and turned against God and his Kingdom, and the decree of the Almighty against them is written in these words: “The wicked shall he turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” (Psalm 9:17) The wicked all cleared out, then the Kingdom of God will be in full operation and His will shall then be done in the earth as in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THEOCRACY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">That righteous government is The Theocratic Government. It is the government of Jehovah by Christ Jesus. Concerning Christ Jesus it is written: “The government shall be upon his shoulder.” (Isaiah 9:6) That government of righteousness shall endure, and the King, as the official of Jehovah, shall administer life everlasting to all who obey Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If you believe God, and that the Bible contains His Word, then hear and rejoice in the emphatic statement thereof, to wit: “Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isaiah 32:1) The King, here mentioned, is Christ Jesus, the great Theocratic King, and his rule shall always be righteous and in righteousness. He is and forever will be invisible to human eyes; but on the earth, mingling amongst the joyful people, will be his visible representatives. Who are they?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">GOVERNORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Again note the prophecy of Daniel. When Jehovah gave Daniel the prophecy he did not understand it, and so states. Jehovah caused His angel then to appear to Daniel, who delivered from Jehovah this message: “But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.” (Daniel 12:13) Clearly this part of the prophecy means that Daniel died and since has rested in death, but at the end of the days of the prophecy Daniel shall be raised out of death as a perfect man and stand in his “lot”. The promise of God is that then the prophecy shall be understood. And now the prophecy is understood; which is proof that we confidently expect Daniel the prophet of God to soon stand amongst the peoples upon this earth and many will see him and rejoice. And what is Daniel’s “lot” ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">.Daniel, together with other faithful men of old from Abel to John the Baptist, when raised out of death to perfection as men, shall be the governors or visible representatives of The Theocratic Government on the earth. Heretofore they have been called “the fathers in Israel”, but when they come they shall be children and representatives of Christ the King, and thereafter be known as the “princes in all the earth”; as it is written: “Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.”—Psalm 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At the eleventh chapter of Hebrews a list appears of the names of many of those faithful men, which includes all the prophets, and therefore necessarily Daniel is one. All of those, the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">24 COMFORT ALL THAT MOURN </span><span class="font6">declares, shall constitute the princes or governors in the earth, and they “shall rule in judgment”, or justice. (Isaiah 32:1) They will put in force the judgments of the Lord, and all of their actions, in harmony with the Lord, will be in justice and righteousness. Then instead of mourning the people shall rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">BLESSINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rule of the earth by the “Axis powers” and the so-called “democracies” hold out to the people no hope of peace, security, life or happiness. Those desiring these blessings must now turn to The Theocracy. The Bible was written for the very purpose of furnishing the basis for the hope of such as love God and his Kingdom. (Bomans 15:4) The people must now gain a knowledge of the Bible, and thereby learn the way by which they can receive everlasting blessings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All the people of good-will desire peace. The 'Tattle of that great day of God Almighty” will for ever end the rule of selfishness and wickedness. That will mean the end of all war. There shall never be another time of tribulation, as the Lord has promised. (Matthew 24:21) The righteous Lord will teach the obedient people his way, and they will walk in the way of righteousness. No more will they make instruments of war, because, as the Lord declares, “nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (Micah 4:1-4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When in 1918 a temporary peace was declared the people rejoiced, even though that joy was of but short duration. When the people of goodwill learn that there will never be another war they will rejoice for evermore. Under The Theocratic Government peace, like a mighty river that never ceases to flow, will go on and endure to the endless comfort and joy of the people. —Psalm 72:7; Isaiah 48:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Theocratic Government, by Christ Jesus, will be wholly righteous and its laws administered at all times without partiality. The people will have no occasion to fear enemies, because none shall be permitted to exist. The people shall walk together in peace, lying down and sleeping in security, and none shall make them afraid.—Zephaniah 3:13; Micah 4:4; Ezekiel 34:25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">LIFE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rule of the wicked has brought upon the people indescribable suffering and the death of countless innocents, and the badge of mourning has marked every home. The rule of the wicked offers no hope of life. Why longer look in that direction? The righteous rule by Christ Jesus guarantees life everlasting to all obedient ones, as it is written: “This is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” .(John 17:3) Salvation belongs to Jehovah (Psalm 3:8), who administers life to the obedient ones by Christ Jesus, the King. (Romans 6:23) Under his reign obedient ones shall never die.-John 11:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Give heed to the comforting words published for those who give their entire devotion to The Theocracy. In symbol that government of righteousness is called “the Holy City”, because it is Jehovah’s organization. It constitutes the new heavens and new earth wherein dwells righteousness. (2 Peter 3:13) Concerning that kingdom the utterances at Revelation 21:1-4 are of great comfort to' all who believe them: “And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,-coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God. And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.” (Revelation 21:1-4) Those words of the Lord now’ give great comfort to all who hear and believe them. All who support and obey The Theocratic Government shall receive everlasting blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THEOCRACY HERE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The present is the worst of times because of the wicked rule. By faith we see the wicked rule now coming to an end. The present, therefore, is the best of times till now, because we see The Theocratic Government is coming in. It is therefore the time when all who put their trust in God should rejoice. The Kingdom, promised long centuries ago, has come and the day of deliverance is near, and concerning this Jesus says: &quot;And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your [deliverance] draweth nigh.”-Luke 21: 28; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Emphatic Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To the generation that seek the face of Jehovah, and who desire everlasting life, the Almighty God says: “Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.”—Psalm 24:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The only hope for peace and life rests in The Theocratic Government. All persons now on earth who expect or hope to live must flee to that righteous government, and all others shall be destroyed. To those who would live the great Theocrat says: “O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; fear before him, all the earth. Say among the [nations] that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord; for he cometh, for he</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">28 COMFORT ALL THAT MOURN </span><span class="font6">cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth,”—Psalm 96: 9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">TRANSITION ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The end of the rule of the wicked totalitarian powers is at hand. Soon the combined elements of wickedness will put forth their supreme effort in their final endeavor to destroy all who support The Theocracy. They shall fail, and none shall help them, because God has decreed it so. (Daniel ll:45)The Lord will literally destroy all of such wicked rule. Behold the righteous Theocratic Government, by Christ Jesus, taking possession and ruling the world in righteousness. He who is “the Prince of Peace”, “the Everlasting Father,” “the King of glory,” will have complete control from his throne in heaven. Daniel and other faithful men of old soon shall stand in their lot as the visible governors of the people and representatives of The Theocracy. Then the people will be comforted and greatly rejoice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">. Jehovah God has surely sent his witnesses to now deliver his message of comfort to the people of good-will. Those who hear and flee to The Theocracy and seek righteousness and meekness have Jehovah’s promise that they may be hid from the terrible storm of Armageddon and be safely carried over, even as Noah and his family were carried over the flood. Those survivors who obey the King will be granted the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">COMFORT ALL THAT MOURN 29 </span><span class="font6">unspeakable privilege of carrying out the divine mandate to “multiply and fill the earth” with a righteous people, and they will rejoice forever. Who will this day hear and understand these truths from Almighty God? Jehovah gave to Daniel the answer in these words: “None of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.” (Daniel 12:10) “The wise” are those who believe, fear and serve Almighty God and his beloved Son, Christ Jesus. (Psalm 25:12) Each one must make his choice. The opponents of The Theocracy will remain with the wicked and perish for ever. They that be wise will choose to serve the “King of glory” and receive the blessings of everlasting life. The wise will now receive great comfort from this message from the Word of Almighty God, who is “the Father of mercies’* and “'God of all comfort”, and “whose name alone is Jehovah”.—2 Corinthians 1:3; Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">[The multitude of Christians assembled, and who heard the foregoing address, unanimously agreed to send to the people the following message:]</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">T</span><span class="font2">O ALL PERSONS OF GOOD-WILL TOWARD</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">JEHOVAH and His King, Christ Jesus: Having received great comfort from Jehovah’s Word, and now enjoying the privilege of being His servants, we send you this message of comfort that you too may, in this hour of world distress, receive consolation and lay hold upon that which will bring you endless life and joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The unfailing promise of Jehovah, repeatedly stated in the Bible, is that soon He shall destroy all wickedness and wicked rule in the earth, to be followed by the rule of righteousness by Christ Jesus and His visible representatives on the earth, and which government shall afford boundless blessings to the people. The transition period is now here, evidenced by the world trouble, and which soon shall end with Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” The only place of safety is under The Theocracy, that righteous rule of Jehovah by Christ Jesus. All who oppose that government shall perish for ever. All who are of good-will toward Jehovah and His Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus, and who flee thereto, may find safety and life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The rulers of wickedness now stand where they ought not to stand, wrongfully claiming the right to rule the world contrary to Jehovah and His King. That totalitarian dictatorial rule the Lord declares to be the &quot;desolating abomination&quot; foretold by Daniel the prophet. (Mark 13:14) The Lord warns all persons of good-will to immediately flee to Jehovah’s Government by Christ Jesus, which is The Theocracy, and which is the only place of safety. Be wise, therefore, and obey the Lord’s warning and commandments and immediately take your stand on the side of The Theocracy, that you may have and enjoy the everlasting blessings from the Lord.</span></p>
