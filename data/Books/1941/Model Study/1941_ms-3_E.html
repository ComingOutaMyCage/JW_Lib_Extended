If it wrmn necessary or advisable to make dearer some statements made by the speaker on the record, portions of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font3"> may also be read. The reading of this booklet is not always necessary in I he final sum-up, as the material has been presented by the speaker originally on the records.

( Acts 17:26: Malachi 2:10) The hist paragraph appeals to “the Supreme Judge of the World” for rectitude. (Genesis 18:25; Hebrews 12:23) The concluding statement expresses &quot;a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence”. (Psalm 145: 16; Proverbs 2ft: 25) (The Bible is used in courts to solemnize oaths, and the first president, George Washington, at his inauguration, took his oath of office upon the Bible, as do presidents since.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Q, 7. What scriptures prove the existence of Satan, the Devil, and his angels or associate devils? What is the proof that he rules the world? (Page 5, fl 1)</span></p>

The physical facts prove that the Scriptures rightly eall him the &quot;god of this world”.—2 Corinthians 4:4; Galatians 1:4; John 14: 301 John 5: 19, A.R.V.; Luke 4:5,6; Matthew 25:41; Luke 9:1; Ephesians 2:2; 6:12; Revelation 12:9; Proverbs 29:2. rg. 12. fl 2; 18, fl 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Q. 12. How is Satan’s statement to Eve, &quot;Ye shall not surelv die,” associated with all religion? (Page 6, fl 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A. It is the basis of all formalistic, doctrinal and practical religion, as the claim is made that no one actually dies, but continues to live on after what appears to be death, whereas the Scriptures make the resurrection the basis or means of future life.—John 8:44; Romans 6:23; 1 Corinthians 15:13-21. s, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Q. 13. In what way did those who lived before and those after the flood turn to religion? (Page 6, fl 3; 7, fl 1, 2)</span></p>
