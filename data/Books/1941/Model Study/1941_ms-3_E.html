<p><span class="font3">All of Jehovah’s witnesses should be prepared to conduct model studies in the Bible.

Back-calls should be made wt these persons, answering various questions through other records we have, such as “The Bead” (Record P-8). “The Soul” (Record P-7), and then begin a model study on these series or any others as soon a® you possibly can.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Each one present should have a copy of ibis booklet. Run the record or group of records designated, read the questions, and let one (the chairman or someone else present who reads well) rend the answers. The scriptures cited should be looked up and read. References are made to other publications, which should also be on hand, and the paragraphs cited should be read as a concluding sum-tip. If it wrmn necessary or advisable to make dearer some statements made by the speaker on the record, portions of the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Conspiracy Against Democracy</span><span class="font3"> may also be read. The reading of this booklet is not always necessary in I he final sum-up, as the material has been presented by the speaker originally on the records. Proceed w-itb the study, taking up each question in order, and consider same in like manner, until an hour is occupied. If all points in the record or group of records run are covered before the honr is up, then take up the next record or group of records and follow as suggested above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All model study meetings should close promptly at the end of an hour. The call should be made once every week. If the individuals you are visiting wish to study another scries of records by themselves al their own home, lend them another set of records and another </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Model Study</span><span class="font3"> booklet. People of good-will should be given all the assistance possible to gain information concerning The Theocracy.</span></p>

( Acts 17:26: Malachi 2:10) The hist paragraph appeals to “the Supreme Judge of the World” for rectitude. (Genesis 18:25; Hebrews 12:23) The concluding statement expresses &quot;a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence”. (Psalm 145: 16; Proverbs 2ft: 25) (The Bible is used in courts to solemnize oaths, and the first president, George Washington, at his inauguration, took his oath of office upon the Bible, as do presidents since.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Q, 7. What scriptures prove the existence of Satan, the Devil, and his angels or associate devils? What is the proof that he rules the world? (Page 5, fl 1)</span></p>

The physical facts prove that the Scriptures rightly eall him the &quot;god of this world”.—2 Corinthians 4:4; Galatians 1:4; John 14: 301 John 5: 19, A.R.V.; Luke 4:5,6; Matthew 25:41; Luke 9:1; Ephesians 2:2; 6:12; Revelation 12:9; Proverbs 29:2. rg. 12. fl 2; 18, fl 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Q. 12. How is Satan’s statement to Eve, &quot;Ye shall not surelv die,” associated with all religion? (Page 6, fl 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A. It is the basis of all formalistic, doctrinal and practical religion, as the claim is made that no one actually dies, but continues to live on after what appears to be death, whereas the Scriptures make the resurrection the basis or means of future life.—John 8:44; Romans 6:23; 1 Corinthians 15:13-21. s, 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Q. 13. In what way did those who lived before and those after the flood turn to religion? (Page 6, fl 3; 7, fl 1, 2)</span></p>
