<h1><a name="beokmark0"></a><span class="font1"><a name="beokmark1"></a>JEHOVAH’S SERVANTS DEFENDED</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">I</span><span class="font5">N RECENT years, and especially since the fall of totalitarian spirit upon the rulers, it has become necessary that Jehovah God’s servants be defended in the courts of this land — America. Such would not have been dreamed of by the founders of this country, who fled from religious persecution during and after the Catholic Inquisition in Europe and wisely anchored and secured the liberties of the people in the fundamental law of the nation, the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every state of the Union, upward of three thousand servants of the Lord annually are falsely arrested and maliciously prosecuted because of their worship of Almighty God, Jehovah, and for their determined exercise of their right of freedom of press. Only and all those thus mistreated and arrested are Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For the sole purpose of aiding the persona concerned in insisting that justice be done, and to prevent malicious prosecutions and discarding the Constitution, this pamphlet is written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who are Jehovah’s witnesses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect, a cult or a religion. They are true and obedient servants of Almighty God, Jehovah, following exclusively in the footsteps of Christ Jesus. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font5"> is the doing of anything contrary to the will of Jehovah God. A </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">cult </span><span class="font5">is a system of religious belief practicing ceremonies and traditions of men in an organized bedy. A sect is a religious organization of persons who follow a particular creature in their belief and practice a specific religion based on the traditions of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are made up of persons who are entirely devoted to Jehovah God and His kingdom and who are diligent and faithful in carrying out His orders as commanded by the Most High by preaching the gospel of God’s kingdom by presenting to the people on the public streets and at the homes literature explaining the Bible prophecies, which are God’s revealed Word. This literature plainly shows that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font5"> is a snare employed by Satan through selfish men to prevent the people from seeing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the truth</span><span class="font5"> concerning Jehovah’s purposes toward mankind. It shows furthermore that the time is near as hand when Jehovah God is abeut to destroy Satan’s entire organisation, invisible and visible, including the commercial, political and ecclesiastical elements of the present world and all persons who willingly support said organizations. That such destructive work will be by Jehovah’s invisible forces at the battle of Armageddon and is to be followed by the complete establishment of a government to be ruled over by Christ Jesus known as The Theocracy, which will remain forever in the earth to bring peace, prosperity, happiness, and everlasting life unto all persons who willingly obey all the commands of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This work done by Jehovah’s witnesses is a kind warning to the people to abandon religion and Satan’s organization now and live, or remain and die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This work cannot be discontinued by Jehovah’s witnesses in any community, regardless of threats or interference of any kind, because if they refuse to preach the gospel and proclaim the warning the lives of those not warned will be required from the witness who refuses or fails to carry out the command to give the warning. Therefore they must obey God rather than men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many persons object to the position of Jehovah’s witnesses, “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5: 20) They refuse to obey the unconstitutional</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH’S SERVANTS DEFENDED 3 </span><span class="font5">commands of persons that they stop preaching the gospel; but such commands are not laws. Laws which conflict with the law of Almighty God are mentioned by Blackstone thus:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No human laws are of any validity if contrary to this [the Divine law] ... to be found only in the Holy Scriptures. ... No human laws should be suffered to contradict these.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">—Blackstone </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Commentaries,</span><span class="font4"> Chase 3d cd., pp. 5-7.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The American law writer, Cooley, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“No external authority is to place itself between the finite being and the Infinite when the former is seeking to render the homage that is due, and in a mode which commends itself to his conscience and judgment as being suitable for him to render, and acceptable to its object.”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">—Cooley, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Constitutional Limitations,</span><span class="font4"> Sth ed., p. 968.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Thus it is obvious that the fundamental law supports Jehovah’s witnesses in their stand in refusing to obey the whimsical commands of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are preaching the gospel, and this activity of preaching, although not practiced as do religionists, is clearly within the protection of the Constitution. It is generally understood, by almost everyone, that all associations of persons or organizations made up of God-fearing people who engage in study and worship are religious organizations. Within the meaning of the Constitution all such groups are considered religious organizations, but according to the Bible definition there is a difference. Any formal worship of a superior or supreme one by persons who rely upon traditional teachings of men, together with ceremonies, is a religious organization. A follower of Jesus Christ is one who strictly adheres to the Word of Almighty God, Jehovah, in spirit and in truth, and docs so without indulging in formal ceremonies. Christ Jesus was never a religionist; and his followers, therefore, are not religionists, within the Biblical meaning of that term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Accordingly, they follow in the footsteps of Christ Jesus in going from house to house.—Matthew 10:7, 12-14; Luke 8:1; Aets 20:20; 1 Peter 2:9,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But from the legal point of view all </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">religious</span><span class="font5"> organizations and also worshipers of Almighty God are put in the same class, and hence Jehovah’s witnesses are entitled to the benefit of the protection of the law. The laws do not contemplate and were never intended to interfere with any person^ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">way</span><span class="font5"> or means of worship, regardless of what way or means they employ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is the responsibility of Judicial officers under their oaths to uphold the Constitution and protect Jehovah’s witnesses from wrongful arrests and prosecutions by misguided persons. To aid them in the discharge of this duty the information herein contained is submitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The false charges which the judges have been and are now called upon to prevent being applied to Jehovah’s witnesses are “soliciting, peddling, canvassing, selling, hawking, and selling from house to house and on the streets without permit or license”, “trespassing,” &quot;offending and annoying people,&quot; “disorderly conduct,” “breach of the peace,&quot; “sedition,” &quot;vagrancy,&quot;, “distributing leaflets and pamphlets without a permit,” &quot;inciting riot,” &quot;violating the Sabbath laws,&quot; and many others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In every case the laws applied to Jehovah’s witnesses through the abeve charges have been held unconstitutional &lt;u </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">construed and applied,</span><span class="font5"> resulting in the charges being dismissed and Jehovah’s witnesses discharged from custody. Space does not permit quotation from every case discussing the matter. Accordingly, parts of the outstanding cases are here set forth and other cases cited only. An examination of the reports will disclose the entire opinion in each case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As construed and applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It should be kept in mind that it is the wrongful application of a valid ordinance or law that makes it unconstitutional and unenforceable as to Jehovah’s witnesses, whose work is lawful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Concordia Fire Insurance Co.</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Illinois</span><span class="font5"> (1934), 292 U.S. 535, 545, the Supreme Court of the United States said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Whether a statute is valid or invalid under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment often depends on how the statute is construed and applied. It may be valid when given a particular application and invalid when given another.'<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In other words, the validity of the statute depends on what set of facts it is applied to. If applied to Jehovah’s witnesses’ activity, protected and guaranteed by the Constitution, the law becomes unconstitutional and void to the extent applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Laws against distribution of pamphlets without a permit</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">City of Griffin</span><span class="font5"> (1938), 303 U. S. 444, one of Jehovah’s witnesses was convicted of violating an ordinance which prohibited distribution of literature, on the streets or from house to house, within the Georgia city of Griffin. She was going from house to house distributing literature printed by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society and receiving in exchange therefor contributions of money. The United States Supreme Court set aside her conviction and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We think that the ordinance is invalid on its face. Whatever the motive which induced its adoption, its character is such that it strikes at the very foundation of the freedom of the press by subjecting it to license and censorship. The struggle for the freedom of the press was primarily directed against the power of the licensor. It was against that power that John Milton directed his assault by his ’Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing’’. And the liberty of the press became initially a right to publish '■n'lhoul a license what formerly could be published only </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">with</span><span class="font4"> one.’ [See Wickwar, “The Struggle for the Freedom of the Press”, p. 15.] While this freedom from previous restraint upon publication cannot be regarded as exhausting the guaranty of liberty, the prevention of that restraint was a leading purpose in the adoption of the constitutional provision. See </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Patterson</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Colorado,</span><span class="font4"> 205 U. S. 454, 462; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Near</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Minnesota, </span><span class="font4">283 U. S. 697, 713-716; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Grosjean v. A meriean Press Company,</span><span class="font4"> 297 U. S. 233, 245, 246. Legislation of the type of the ordinance in question would restore the system of license and censorship in its baldest form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The liberty of the press is not confined to newspapers and periodicals. It necessarily embraces pamphlets and leaflets. These indeed have been historic weapons in the defense of liberty, as the pamphlets of Thomas Paine and others in our own history abundantly attest. The press in its historic connotation comprehends every sort of publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion. What wo have bad recent occasion to say with respect to the vital importance of protecting this essential liberty from every sort of infringement need not be repeated. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Near</span><span class="font4"> V. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Minnesota,</span><span class="font4"> supra; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Grosjean</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">American Press Company,</span><span class="font4"> supra; </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Do Jonge</span><span class="font4"> v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Oregon </span><span class="font4">[299 U. 8. 353, 364], supra.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Counsel for the City of Clearwater [Florida] in his brief defends the ordinance on the theory: (a) that the challenged ordinance is a war measure; (b) the chief of police by the terms of the. ordinance is without discretion in the issuance or withholding of permits; (e) the ordinance is designed to prohibit the teaching of all doctrines of disobedience to all civil laws; (d) the ordinance is designed to prohibit the teaching of anarehy and a refusal to salute the flag; (e) the regulation of the distribution of the pamphlets and literature under the terms of the ordinance is in harmony with and strengthens the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH’S SERVANTS DEFENDED 7 national defense program; (f) other patriotic arguments are advanced. We have examined the case of Schenek v. United Slates, 249 U. S. 47, 39 Sup. Ct. 247, 63 L Ed. 470, cited by counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“These several arguments offered in behalf of the challenged ordinance are weighty and if presented to a legislative bedy eonld not only be influential but convincing, or if made on the hustings, would be approved and ap-Slauded by the people, but a court in the discharge of uty under ottr system is required to be oblivious to public clamor, partisan demands, notoriety, or personal popularity and to interpret the law fearlessly and impartially so as to promote justice, inspire confidence and serve the public welfare. The liberty and freedom of the press under our fundamental law is not eonflned to newspapers and periodicals, but embraces pamphlets, leaflets and comprehends every publication which affords a vehicle of information and opinion. The perpetuity of democracies has as a foundation an informed, educated and intelligent citizenry. An unsubsidized press is essential to and a potent factor in instructive information and education of the people of a democracy, and a well informed people will perpetuate our constitutional liberties.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">“Wc must not overlook that the conduct alleged in the two criminal complaints does not amount to a breach of the peace, or engaging in a parade or procession upon the streets, or throwing literature broadcast in the streets. On the contrary it is an effort to distribute pamphlets or other printed matter npon the streets of the City and not elsewhere; which is alleged in the present complaint, to persuade a willing listener to voluntarily contribute by gift for the literature which it is claimed to be in the nature of religious views, to enable people to know Jehovah God and His purposes expressed in the Bible.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Laws requiring permits or licenses before selling articles or peddling on the streets or from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many cities and towns have peddling ordinances requiring permits and licenses for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">tale of</span><span class="font5"> goods, wares and merchandise upon the streets and from house to house within the municipality. Such licenses and permits cannot be required of one engaged in distribution of printed matter, cither for money contributions or free of charge. While such ordinances can rightly be applicable to persons selling ordinary items of merchandise or goods, they cannot be applied to one who is exercising his right of “free press”. Pamphlets and newspapers are not considered ‘ordinary merchandise or goods or wares’ and cannot be brought within the terms of such ordinances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">If the ordinance by its terms prohibits [reddling or selling of literature it is void on its face and unconstitutional.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The streets and the homes of the people are the natural and proper places for distribution of literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Peddling ordinances were outlawed and held unconstitutional as applied to Jehovah’s witnesses in the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Schneider</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Stale</span><span class="font5"> (Town of Irvington, New Jersey) (1939), 308 U.S. 147. Clara Schneider, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, was going from house to house in Irvington calling at the homes of the people, offering to them the Bible literature abeve described and received contributions therefor. She was arrested and charged with violating the local peddling ordinance which prohibited canvassing, soliciting, peddling, or distribution of any matter from house to house or on the streets in the town without a permit from the Chief of Police. The Supreme Court of the United States set aside her conviction and held the ordinance could not be constitutionally applied to her work, and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Although a municipality may enact regulations in the interest of the public safety, health, welfare or convenience, these may not abridge the individual liberties secured by the Constitution to those who wish to speak, write, print or circulate information or opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Municipal authorities, as trustees for the public, have the duty to keep their communities' streets open and available for movement of people and property, the primary purpose to which the streets are dedicated, , . ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In every case, therefore, where legislative abridgment of the rights is asserted, the courts should be astute to examine the effect of the challenged legislation. More legislative preferences or beliefs respecting matters of public convenience may well </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">support</span><span class="font4"> regulation directed al other personal activities, but be insufficient to justify such as diminishes the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance of democratic institutions. And so, as eases arise, the delicate and difficult task falls upon the courts to weigh the circumstances and to appraise the substantiality of the reasons advanced in support of the regulation of the free enjoyment of the rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;... Any burden imposed upon the eity authorities in denning and caring for the streets ns an indirect consequence of such distribution results from the constitutional protection of the freedom of speech and press....</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;... But, as we have said, the streets are natural and proper </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">places for the dissemination of information</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">opinion;</span><span class="font4"> and one is not to have the exeroieo of his lib erty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“As said in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell V. City of Griffin,</span><span class="font4"> supra, pamphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">And perhaps the most effective way of bringing them to the notice of</span><span class="font4"> individuals is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">their</span><span class="font4"> distribution al the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">homes of the people.</span><span class="font4"> On this method of communication the ordinance imposes censorship, abuse of which engendered the struggle in England which eventuated in the establishment of the doctrine of the freedom of the press embedied in our Constitution. To require a censorship through license which makes impossible the free and unhampered distribution of pamphlets strikes at the very heart of the constitutional guarantees.&quot; [Italics added]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Not peddlers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Semansky</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Stark</span><span class="font5"> (1940), 199 So. 129; 196 La. 307, involving one of Jehovah’s witnesses, the Louisiana Supreme Court set aside a judgment and held that Jehovah’s witnesses are not peddlers, and said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The plaintiff was distributing and selling beoks and pamphlets, propagating, and disseminating the doctrines of the religious sect of which he was a member and a minister. From n reading of the abeve quoted provision of the Act it would appear that it doos not contemplate trail mictions of this nature. ... In view of the nature of these transactions we uro of the opinion that the Legislature did not intend to require those engaged in disseminating the doctrines and principles of any religious sect, either by the distribution, or sale, of beoks or pamphlets pertaining to such, to pay a peddler’s license, or to classify them as peddlers.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The foregoing </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Semansky</span><span class="font5"> case also upholds definitely the right of Jehovah's witnesses to carry on their noncommercial, benevolent work and to use automobiles and other vehicles for that purpose without the need to have or apply for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">co</span><span class="font5">mnte</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">rcial vehicle license.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the Illinois case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Village of South Holland</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Stein</span><span class="font5"> (1940), 26 N. E. 2d 868; 373 III. 472, one of Jehovah's witnesses distributed the Watchtower mug azine and various beoks and beoklets and received money in exchange therefor, and was charged with a violation of an ordinance which required one soliciting to obtain a solicitor's permit, and making it unlawful to go to a private residence for the purpose of selling merchandise without obtaining a solicitor’s permit. The Illinois Supreme Court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to Jehovah’s witnesses, and voided the conviction. That court said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Thus the question is nut the formal interpretation of the ordinance but the application given to it. A statute or ordinance may be invalid as applied to one state of facts and yet valid as applied to another. IFMtnsy v. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">California, Zli</span><span class="font4"> U. S. 357, 71 L.

<p><span class="font4">“If the conviction was baaed on soliciting the subscription of a publication without a permit, it was error under the decisions of this court. If the conviction was baaed on giving or furnishing a beok or pamphlets ns disclosed by the stipulation, &gt;t violated beth the State and Federal constitutions. In cither event the ordinance would be void.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cincinnati</span><span class="font5"> v. .W</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">osier</span><span class="font5"> (1939), 22 N. E. 2d 418; 61 Ohio Am, 81, the Ohio Court of Appeals held that an ordinance requiring license for business of peddlers could no more apply to Jehovah’s witnesses than if attempted to apply it to an act performed outside of the state, county or eity. The ordinance in question provided that a license would be &quot;granted by the superintendent of the department of public welfare to peddlers selling goods carried by hand, upon the payment to the city treasurer by each applicant of a license fee of $25.00 per annum. . . . ” There the court further said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Wo spcciflcnlly hold the ordinance constitutional, just </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">iu</span><span class="font4"> we specifically find that the prosecution in the instant case was unwarranted in law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The ordinance itself in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Lovell</span><span class="font4"> case came into collision with the protections and inhibitions of the constitutional provisions. The ordinance in question here has no such infirmity On the other hand, it is apparent that it ean have no more application to the defendant for the acts charged in the affidavit than it could if it wen attempted to apply it for an net performed outside the State, county, or eity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The court should have rendered judgment for the defendant and dismissed him. The judgment is reversed and the defendant dismissed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">City of Atlanta</span><span class="font5"> (1939), 1 S. E. 2d 593; 59 Ga. App. 520, also involved one of Jehovah’s witnesses, who was convicted of violating an ordinance of the City of Atlanta, Georgia, providing that “any person whose duty it shall be to register their business and who shall fail and refuse to do so” shall be fined. The defendant was arrested while walking along the street and from he use to house with a phonograph, and was alleged to have sold and peddled literature to residents. He had not registered nor obtained a license, the same not being necessary to carry on his work of preaching the gospel. The Georgia Court of Appeals held:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“We do not think it is the duty of an ordained minister of the gospel to register his business with the eity. Neither is it peddling for sueh minister to go into homes and play a victrola, or to preach therein or to sell or distribute literature dealing with his faith. . . . The preaching and teaeh.ng of a minister ... is not such a business as may be required to register and obtain and pay for a license so to do. Neither is a sale by sueh minister of tracts or beoks connected with his faith a violation of a statute against peddling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Also the Supreme Court of South Carolina held, on July 1, 1941, that the “sale” of beoks and beoklets by Jehovah’s witnesses does not constitute peddling. In the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">State</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas Meredith, ___</span><span class="font5"> S. E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">2d___, the court said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The literature carried around by the defendant consisted of beoks or beoklets entitled ‘Refugees’, ‘Salvation’, and copies of the 'Watchtower* mngaaine, all of which are publications issued by the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society. The testimony shows that the main and primary purpose and occupation of the defendant was to preach and teach principles drawn from the Bible, in accordance with his faith, wherever one or two were gathered together and would listen to him. His was an evangelistic work, for which he received no material consideration, and to which be devoted bis life. The distribution of the beoks and pamphlets was but another method or channel through which he disseminated the religions opinions and beliefs of Jehovah’s witnesses. An examination of them shows that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">they contain nothing offensive to good morals </span><span class="font4">or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">hurtful to the general welfare. And it</span><span class="font4"> w </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">quite clear that the sale and distribution of the literature were merely incidental to defendant’s work of evangelism, and not related to any commercial enterprise conducted for personal profit.</span><span class="font4"> The record shown that the money paid by purchasers of the beoks and pamphlets was received as a contribution to the cense, and was devoted to the publication of other religious literature. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“This Section (7120) does not purport either to define the offense of hawking or peddling, or to enlarge its definition as heretofore recognised, but simply declares that ‘nu person shall, as hawker or peddler, expose for sale or sell any goods, wares, and merchandise in any county* without having first obtained a license from the Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Under the conceded facts of this case, the ‘sale’ of the beok by the defendant was merely collateral to the main purpose in which be was engaged, which was to preach and teach the tenets </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font4"> his religion. And in our opinion, it is not peddling, as that word is usually construed, nor a violation of the statute, for a minister, under the circumstances shown here, to visit the homes of the people, absent objection, and as a part of his preaching and teaching to offer to sell or sell religious literature explanatory of his faith, where no profit motive is involved. The sale of his beoks and pamphlets, as heretofore pointed out, was merely incidental to the chief purpose of the defendant,—which was the spreading of his religion. . . .</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">In acting as ordained ministers and preaching the gospel publicly and from house to house it cannot be properly said that such work by Jehovah’s witnesses does not constitute a proper worship or service of Almighty God. The testimony of Jehovah’s witnesses that they net as ordained ministers is un contra dieted and unimpeached and is therefore conclusive upon all concerned in this matter. Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has held that the individual alone is privileged to determine what he shall or shall not believe and how he shall worship or servo Almighty God. The law does not permit judges to settle differences of creed or confession and will not say that any point, doctrine or practice is too absurd to be believed.

<p><span class="font5">“Green River” type of ordinance prohibiting calls at residences without prior invitation or consent of householder is invalid as to work of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In some municipalities there are ordinances known as the “Green River” ordinance. This type of ordinance prohibits making calls at the homes of people by peddlers and itinerant merchants for the purpose of selling goods, wares or merchandise without the prior invitation or consent of the householder. This type of ordinance has been repeatedly held to be unconstitutional and void on its face.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#beokmark2">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such &quot;Green River” ordinance has also been he'.d invalid and unconstitutional as construed and applied to Jehovah’s witnesses, by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in its decision of April 25, 1941, in the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Zimmerman et al. v. Village of London et al.,__</span><span class="font5">F. Supp.__, where</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">an injunction was granted to Jehovah’s witnesses, and in which that court said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It follows therefore, that the restriction of the ordinance as enforced against these plaintiffs amounts to a denial of freedom of the press and of the right of free speech, rights guaranteed by the Constitution and protected against state infringement by the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the theory of the ordinance is purportedly trespass, the theory can give no sanction to the denial of fundamental rights under the Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Democracy rests upon the theory that all men are possessed of certain inalienable rights; these rights, if democracy is to survive, must be based upon mutual tolerance and understanding. They give to no class or gronp the right to dictate to another what his opinions or beliefs snail be. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It is the conclusion of this Court that the plaintiffs have a constitutional right to distribute their literature from door to door in an orderly manner, without interference by state authority. There being neither allegation nor showing that such literature is against public morals or in any way improper for distribution.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Because Jehovah’s witnesses are doing a work of charity and benevolence and are performing acts of worship by preaching the gospel, they do not come within the terms of statutes prohibiting work and business on Sunday and therefore cannot be guilty.

<p><span class="font5">Playing of phonograph records and distributing literature attacking religion as a snare is protected by the United States Constitution, and such does not amount to breach of peace or disorderly conduct</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This was expressly held in the case of Cantwell v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Connecticut</span><span class="font5"> (1940), 310 U.S. 296, where Newton Cantwell and his sons Jesse and Russell, ordained ministers, each one of Jehovah’s witnesses, while engaged in preaching the gospel from house to house, offering literature explaining the purposes of ALMIGHTY GOD as outlined in His Word, the Bible, and playing phonograph records containing Bible talks, were arrested in New Haven, Connecticut, and charged with statutory and common law offenses. Upon trial they were found guilty of violating a statute regulating ‘solicitation’ because they went from door to door and when persons obtained the literature the Cantwells accepted contributions therefor i further, Jesse was found guilty of ‘breach of the peace’ because of the playing of a phonograph record entitled &quot;Enemies”, describing a beok of the same name, and which record was disliked by two Catholic men because it exposed and attacked their &quot;religion”. The United States Supreme Court said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The record played by Cantwell embedies a general attack on all organized religious systems as instruments of Satan and injurious to man; it then singles out the Roman Catholic Church for strictures eouehed in terms which naturally would offend not only persons of that persuasion, but all others who respect the honestly held religious faith of their fellows. The hearers were in fact highly offended. One </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font4"> them said he felt like hitting Cantwell and the other that be was tempted to throw Cantwell off the street. The one who testified he felt like hitting Cantwell said, in answer to the question ‘Did you do anything else or have any other reaction?’ ‘No, sir, because he said he would take the victrola and he went.’ The other witness testified that be told Cantwell he had better get off the street before something happened to him and that was the end of the matter os Coqt-wcll picked up his beoks and walked up the street. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“In the realm of religious faith, and in that of political belief, sharp differences arise. In beth fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighber. To persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, os we know, at times, resorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or state, and even to false statement. But the people of this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The essential characteristic of these liberties is, that under their shield many types of life, character, opinion and belief can develop unmolested and unobstructed. No-where is this shield more necessary than in our own country for n people composed of many races and of many creeds. There are limits to the exercise of these liberties. The danger in these times from the coercive activities of those who in the delusion of racial or religious conceit would incite violence nnd breaches of the peace in order to deprive others of their equal right to the exorcise of their liberties, is emphasized by events familiar to ail. These and other transgressions of those limits the states appropriately may punish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . the petitioner’s communication, considered in the light of the constitutional guarantees, raised no such dear and present menace to public peace and order ns to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cantwell</span><span class="font5"> case the Court also held that a statute which required a permit as a condition precedent to soliciting funds for “a religious or charitable organization” was unconstitutional as applied to Jeho-vah’s witnesses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">vah's witnesses was accused of “disorderly conduct”. The South Carolina Supreme Court found and held in that case as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The appellant was one of twelve persons, men and women, who entered the city of Beaufort very early on Sunday morning, June 30, 1940, nnd nt abeut first daylight distributed religious pamphlets on the porches of the residents. Some of the latter complained of the disturbance to a policeman on duty who arrested the appellant and she was later tried in the Mayor<sup>1</sup>! Court and convicted of the violation of the following quoted ordinance;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">’Every person, who shall by provoking or insulting epithets, words, or gestures, attempt to provoke another shall be deemed guilty of disorderly conduct, and upon conviction thereof be fined in any sum not exceeding One Hundred Dollars or imprisonment, not exceeding Thirty days.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“ . . . We have carefully read the testimony, all of which is printed in the record, and we find none which would justify conviction of the appellant of a violation of the quoted ordinance under which she was prosecuted, convicted and sentenced, so the latter will be reversed....</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Tho judgment of the Circuit Court is reversed an is the conviction and sentence of the appellant by the City Court of Beaufort.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Vagrancy” sometimes is wrongfully laid as a “disorderly conduct” charge against Jehovah’s witnesses when unlawfully interrupted in the doing of their good work.

<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses was distributing literature which highly offended the religious susceptibilities of one Fowler, who attacked Putnam. Putnam resisted, standing his ground manfully and firmly defended the Kingdom interests in harmony with God-given instruction contained in the Bible. Putnam was prosecuted for assault upon his assailant. On trial Putnam, one of Jehovah’s witnesses, was convicted of violating an ordinance of the city, pertinent parts of which read as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Any person or persons creating any disturbing noises, or making, creating or engaging in any brawl, riot, affray; fighting or indulging in profane, obscene, abusive or vulgar language, . . . shall if found guilty, be sub-ject to a fine.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On hearing the case on appeal, the Supreme Court of South Carolina held that</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;the defendant was not guilty, in our opinion, of any assault, and it is dear that Fowler, who provoked tbs difficulty and was the physical aggressor throughout, had no reasonably well founded apprehension of bedily harm or danger to bis person. So that the real question presented by the appeal is whether the words concerning religion and Christianity, spoken under the circumstances abeve narrated [Putnam bad called out in a normal tone of voice: &quot;Religion is ruining the national Christianity will save the people’’!, addressed to the public at large, constituted of themselves sufficient legal justification for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the assault made by Fowler. It it plain that they do not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;In view of the fact that peaee and good order forbid that individuals shall right their own wrongs, we have announced the rule in numerous cases that in the abaer.ee of statute, mere words, no matter how abusive, insulting, vexatious or threatening they may be, will not justify an assault or battery, unless accompanied by an actual offer of physical violence,—although they may mitigate the punishment. State v. Cooler, 112 S. C. 95, 98 S. E. 845; State v. Workman, 39 8. C. 151, 17 8. E. 694; State v. Jacobs, 28 S. C. 29, 4 S. E. 709; State v. Jackson, 32 8. C. 27, 10 S. E. 769.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Nor ean it be successfully contended that in attempting to defend himself under the facta in this ease, Putnam was guilty of assault upon Fowler. Ono acting in selfdefense to repel an unlawful attack is not guilty of assault; be may repel force with force and continue his self -defense as long as the danger apparently continues.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This Supreme Court holding upheld Putnam’s right to have defended the interests of the Kingdom and clearly defined the religionist as in the wrong in attacking Putnam. Though he disliked the message Putnam was offering, he should have passed on.

<p><span class="font5">The work of Jehovah’s witnesses, or their statement that &quot;religion is a snare”, docs not constitute a breach of the peace or disorderly conduct even when done in the presence and hearing of those who are offended at the message. See</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">of Almighty God were wrongfully jailed and held without bend under false charges of sedition for almost three months, indicted and released on bail, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky granted a permanent injunction holding that the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses is not subversive, not seditious, and did not advocate the overthrow of the government by force; and that such prosecuting officials be restrained from interfering with the distribution by Jehovah’s witnesses of their Bible literature. The entire text of the decision appears in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine for July 9, 1941 (No. 569).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Refusal to salute a flag is not ground for interfering with Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to salute the flag of any nation, not because of disrespect, but solely because they are in a covenant with Jehovah God to do His will, and because His commandment written in the Bible is that His faithful servants must not bow down to or salute any emblem or symbel of any government or anything save and except Jehovah God. (Exodus 20:1-6) They respect the flag and the things for which it stands, and willingly obey all the laws of the land which are not in conflict with the laws of Almighty God, or which do not require them to violate their covenant with Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The courts have recognized the right of Jehovah’s witnesses to refuse to salute the flag, and grant them protection of the Constitution in this belief. In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds v. Raybern</span><span class="font5"> (April 25, 1938), 116 S. W. 2d 836, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals at Amarillo said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“The flag is emblematic of the justice, greatness and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">JEHOVAH'S SERVANTS DEPENDED 27 power of the United States—these, together, guarantee the political liberty of the citizen, but the flag is no less symbelic of the justice, greatness, and power of our country when they guarantee to the citizen freedom of conscience in religion—the right to worship his God according to the dictates of his conscience. Beyond my comprehension are the vagaries of people who claim and accept the protection of their government in order to worship God according to the dictates of their conscience, but refuse to salute their country's flag in recognition of such protection. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yet, however reprehensible to</span><span class="font4"> us </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">such conduct may be, their constitutional right must be held sacred;</span><span class="font4"> when this ceases, religious freedom ceases.” [Italics added]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To teach a child the commandments of Almighty God which prohibit the saluting of any flag does not constitute a violation of the laws. In </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">People</span><span class="font5"> v. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Sandstrom</span><span class="font5"> (1939), 279 N.Y. 523; 18 N. E. 2d 840, the New York Court of Appeals set aside the conviction of Jehovah's witnesses who had been charged with contributing to the truancy and delinquency of a minor. The basis of the charge was that the parents had taught the child to obey Jehovah God and because thereof she refused to salute the flag at school. The child was expelled from school. The court held that the parents were not guilty of violating any law in teaching their child that God’s law forbade the saluting of any flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In re Jones</span><span class="font5"> (1940), 24 N.Y. 3. 2d 10; 175 Mise. 451. the Jefferson County (New York) Children's Court set aside the conviction of one of Jehovah’s witnesses who had been prosecuted as a truant for not attending school because she was expelled for refusal to salute the flag. Her refusal was held not to be a violation of the law so as to warrant the conviction and the child was held not to be a delinquent under the statute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the case of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In re Reed</span><span class="font5"> (May 27, 1941), 28 N. Y. S. 2d 92, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, Fourth Department, sitting at Rochester, held that it was not unlawful for one of Jehovah's witnesses to refuse to salute the flag, and that court set aside a conviction of one of Jehovah’s witnesses under the delinquency law of New York. The bey had been also expelled from school for his refusal to salute a flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A like case is that of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">In re Roland Lefebvre and others</span><span class="font5"> (May 6, 1941}, 20 A. 2d 185. There the New Hampshire Supreme Court held that Jehovah’s witnesses were not acting contrary to the law when they refused to salute the flag. In this case the lower court had committed to the reform school three children of Jehovah's witnesses who had been expelled from public school for refusal to salute the flag. The Supreme Court held that such did not constitute delinquency or a violation of the law, and released the children. The court also said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“Loving parents who do their best for their children in support, nurture and admonition are of more worth than pecuniary means. Righteous and generous motives may be of more importance than notions that chime with majority opinions of what is good form or what is the best method of teaching patriotism. . . . But in view of the sacredness in which the State has always held freedom of religious conscience, it is impossible for ns to attribute to the legislature on intent to authorise the breaking up of family life for no other reason than because some of its members have conscientious religious scruples not shared by the majority of the community, at least provided those scruples are exercised in good faith, and their exercise is not tinged with immorality or marked by damage to the rights of others. The purity of the action of the children in these regards is admitted.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The abeve fifty cases involving Jehovah's witnesses, and the many others herein referred to, are just a few of the hundreds of favorable decisions rendered in behalf of Jehovah's witnesses by fair-minded, liberty-loving judges of the land of liberty. Such men are holding up the Constitution as a bulwark against the Roman Catholic Hierarehy’s movement as a ‘fifth column' to sabetage, hamstring, sandbag and destroy American constitutional rights and to suppress freedom of worship of Almighty Ood. Hierarehy-influenced judges would tolerate only those traditional religious practices that are approved by the Roman Catholic Hierarehy. They would allow only those human expressions that are perverted to conform to their devilish theories expounded, for example, in the Encyclical Letter (1832) of a reigning pontiff of the Hierarehy, Pope Gregory XVI, who wrote,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“That pest, of all others most to be dreaded in a state, unbridled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">liberty of opinion .. </span><span class="font4">. Hither tends that worst and never sufficiently to be execrated and detested LIBERTY OF THE PRESS, for tbe diffusion of all manner of writings, which some no loudly contend for, and so actively prutnote.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Many thousands of judges of the inferior courts of America have fallen under the evil influence of such totalitarian dictatorial movement and, cither will-ingly or unwittingly, have yielded to demonized leadership against liberty; have spinelessly joined the hue and cry of the Roman Catholic Hierarehy to ‘stop Jehovah’s witnesses’ and, in violation of their oaths of office, have wrongfully and without jurisdiction or justification &quot;convicted” Jehovah's witnesses, as foretold in Psalm 94:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Let such public officials notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Section 20 of the Federal Code (Title 18, Sections 51 and 52 of U. S. C. A.) makes it a felony for anyone, under color of any law or ordinance, to deprive any citizens of constitutional rights or privileges. And this statute applies to officials who seek to collect license fees from persons constitutionally exempt from payment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A police official or other officer, or persons actively participating in causing or making an arrest under a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">void ordinance,</span><span class="font5"> can be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">personally</span><span class="font5"> held for general and specific damage. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(Scott</span><span class="font5"> v, AfcPonald, 165 U, S. 58, 89) Violation of the abeve statute is punishable by a fine of several thousand dollars or several years’ imprisonment, or beth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Among the oldest cases bn the points herein set forth is the one recorded in the Bible beok of The Acts of the Apostles, chapter 5, beginning at verse twenty-six. Disciples of Jesus Christ were publicly informing the people, disseminating the truths of the Word of Almighty God in obedience to His command. Religionists were grieved and angered because God’s truth was being proclaimed. The clergy and other religionists conspired against the disciples who were publishing THE TRUTH. Those conspirators instigated the arrest of the disciples, who were haled into</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">JEHOVAH’S SERVANTS DEFENDED 81 the judgment hall. A high Roman court then sitting in Palestine heard that case. After hearing the evidence, one of the members of that court, Gamaliel, a learned counselor, arose and, addressing his fellow members of the court and all present, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:beld;">“Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for If this counsel or work be of man, It wilt coma to nought: but It It be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; Hat haply ya be found even to fight against God.*<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This temperate and salubrious principle all right-minded persons always follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Here it is well to remember, also, the Creator’s sure word to His humble servants: “They [haters of THE TRUTH] shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith JEHOVAH, to deliver thee.” (Jeremiah 1: 19, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Am.</span><span class="font5"> Rev. </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ver.)</span><span class="font5"> Any who are willing to hear, the Creator also counsels:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:beld;">'0« wl*e now therefore, o ye klngi: be Inatructod, ye judge* of the earth. Serve JEHOVAH with fear, and re* Joice with trembling. Kias Hie Son, THE KINO, left he be angry, and ya perleh from the way, when hie wrath Ie kin* died but a little. B leased are all they that put their truat In Him.’—Psalm 2:10-12.</span></p>
