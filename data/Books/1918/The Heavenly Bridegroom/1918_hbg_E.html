<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THE HEAVENLY BRIDEGROOM</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">That He is mine and I am His, Oh! wondrous thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I am so poor, so weak, so lowly, can there aught Of worthiness in me be found that He should love And seek me for His Bride ? I hear His voice, “My Dove, Thou art all fair, My Spouse, there is no spot in thee;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thy speech is comely, better is thy love to Me [flocks Than wine. Thine eyes as Heshbon’s fish-pools, and like Upon Mount Gilead are thy spiced and flower-decked locks. The winter’s past, My Dove, come, come with Me away! Far spent the night, make ready for thy nuptial day!” My heart responds, “Throughout the many-centuried night I’ve longed for Thee, I’ve waited for the dawning light; And I have laid Thee like sweet myrrh upon my breast, Thine arm beneath my weary head hath brought me rest. Thou whom my soul doth love, Thy countenance is fair To see within the secret places of the stair;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thy head is like fine gold, how beautiful Thy feet! Thine eyes as doves’ eyes, and Thy lips with honey sweet. I rise, my Lord, I leave my father’s house, behold My robe of righteousness, my raiment of wrought gold! Oh! wealth of love Divine, that claims me for Thine own, Oh! miracle of grace, to seat me on Thy throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Oh! glorious future hopes, Oh! bliss beyond compare, Through all eternity Thy love and work to share!”</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THIS TOO WILL PASS!</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Poor heart, break not, though cruel be thy wound,— This too will pass!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The weariest day will end in sunset light, And dawn must follow e’en the darkest night!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Nor drink too deeply of joy’s honeyed cup,— This too will pass!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Caressing hands will lose their loving touch,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And words mean nothing, that once meant so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ah, then, whate’er thy state, seek thou content,— This will not pass!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thy rest in God, He only knows and cares, His heart of love thine every sorrow shares!</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark5"></a>TRUE LOVE</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I’m waiting not till thou art dead, To weave my garlands round thy head, But while thou liv’st I’ll send a rose Or e’en the humblest flower that blows, ’Twill serve to tell thee of my love, Pure love that comes from Heaven above.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark7"></a>LONGING FOR HOME</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">As pants the hart for water brooks, So pants my soul for Thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Oh, when shall I behold Thy face, When wilt Thou call for me?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How oft at night I turn mine eyes Towards my heavenly home,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And long for that blest time when Thou, My Lord, shalt bid me, “Come!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And yet I know that only those Thy blessed face shall see,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Whose hearts from every stain of sin Are purified and free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And oh, my Master and my Lord, I know I’m far from meet</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With all Thy blessed saints in light To hold communion sweet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">I know that those who share Thy throne Must in Thy likeness be,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And all the Spirit’s precious fruits In them the Father see.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord, grant me grace more patiently To strive with my poor heart,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And bide Thy time to be with Thee And see Thee as Thou art!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—G. w. s.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark9"></a>“THERE WAS ALSO A STRIFE AMONG THEM”</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Luke 23:24)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Alas! that in His last, sad, sacred hours on earth, There should be strife among the Master’s chosen twelve, A strife to be the greatest, seeking selfish ends, Ignoring their sweet privilege to minister</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Unto their Lord, in this, His time of saddest need.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ah, me! that He, the Alpha and Omega, First</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And Last, in lowliness must wash their dust-stained feet, To show that he who serveth most is chief of all!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ah, then! shall we not daily watch and humbly pray That no defiling “root of bitterness” spring up!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall we seek selfish honours here, or rather wait Until we reach the other side, where He, our King, Shall seat us in His throne, exalt His lowly Bride! Dear Lord, oh, make us gentle, merciful and wise, Help us in honour each the other to prefer, Fulfilling thus the law of Christ, the law of Love!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—G. W. S.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark11"></a>GONE HOME!</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Gone home! To be forever with the Lord, White-robed and clothed with Immortality, Beholding face to face Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Gone home! All sorrow, tears and anguish left Behind. ’Tis finished, all the sacrifice, And, faithful unto death, he hears, “Well done, Come, enter thou into the promised joy!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">What message would “our shepherd” send to us, To us who wait this side the parting vail?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Be brave, be strong, weep not, have faith in God, The fields are white to harvest, go ye forth, And, even as our Master said, ‘Lo, I</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Am with you always, even to the end,’ So shall my loving presence go with you, Until ye too shall hear His sweet ‘Well done!’ Then there shall be one Shepherd and one flock, And all rejoice together with the Lord.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">November 1, 1916.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark13"></a>HAVE FAITH IN GOD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In days gone by I said, “My soul, ‘Another year, or more or less, And we have crossed the wilderness,’— Wilt falter now, so near the goal?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">And so I pressed along the way With heart aglow and step so light, ’Twas scarce by faith, ’twas almost sight,— Our coming King could not delay!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But now the days and years go by, And life seems but a mournful song. “The vision tarries, Lord, how long? Increase my faith, oh God,” I cry!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He hears my prayer, He calms my fears, He bids my restless soul be still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">My heart responds, “If ’tis Thy will, Lord, I can wait a thousand years!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">October 10, 1916.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark15"></a>REST</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The rest of faith! How wondrous sweet, Each trial and each grief to meet, Upheld by that sufficient grace, That trusts Him where it cannot trace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The rest of peace! With mind so stayed, That as the sea-birds, unafraid, Upon the stormy deep do sleep, My soul an inmost calm doth keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The rest of love! What holy bliss, That He is mine, and I am His!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It sweetens every bitter cup, It bids my tear-dimmed eyes look up;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It satisfies my hungry heart, And makes this life of Heaven a part. Oh! blessed rest of faith and peace, Oh! rest of love that ne’er shall cease.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark17"></a>JEHOVAH GOD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Eternal Lord, Almighty King, Who ruled ere aught that is was framed, When all was shaped unto Thy will, “He rules!” Creation’s voice proclaimed. Unimaged and beyond compare, From chance, from change, forever free; Through endless ages be adored Thy Power, Thine Infinite Majesty! My God. my Saviour, Thou, mine All, My Rock, my Tower, when woes befall, My Standard high, my Refuge nigh, Thou ever hearest when I call!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Into Thine hand my soul I trust, And sleeping, waking, know Thee near, And e’en in Death itself, Thou, Lord, Art with me—naught shall make me fear!</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark19"></a>FAITH</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To follow where an unseen Captain leads,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To heed commands unheard by mortal ear, To battle with a known, yet unseen foe— Ah! This is faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To choose the right when others think you wrong, To stand for Truth while Error laughs in scorn, To tread the lonely way unto the end—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Yes! This takes faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To wear a smile where you receive but frowns, To kiss the hand that wounds your poor heart so, And pray for those who fain your life would take— Ah! This is faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">To fix your eyes on that within the veil, Your heart’s devotion set on things above, To wait with patience till God calls you home—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Faith’s victory won!</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark21"></a>THE SANDAL-WOOD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">How strange the story of the Sandal-wood, That grows in distant lands, beyond the Sea! 'Tis said this curious tree perfumes the axe That lays it low, and from its riven heart There flows a wondrous fragrance, sweet and rare; Ofttimes to incense ground, and powdered fine, Its burning fills with languorous scent the room. And yet, for centuries the tree might stand, But yield no perfume on the tropic air;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It needs must fall, its very heart be crushed, The sweetness of its odours to reveal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Dear Lord, Oh! make me like the Sandal-wood, Oh! may I pour Love’s fragrance on the hand That wounds me so, and help me realize Without a bruised and humbled heart I’d be Unfitted for the Master Workman’s use! As Sandal-wood oft cools the fevered brow, Let me refresh and soothe the anguished mind; When fires burn fiercest, may my presence be Like sweetest incense on the evening breeze, Or like God’s angel in Gethsemane, To comfort, strengthen, calm, inspire and bless!</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark23"></a>IF THEY ONLY KNEW</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Jerusalem, Jerusalem, hadst thou but known Thy day of visitation, hadst thou recognized Messiah in thy midst, would not thy Pharisees, With scoffing priests and populace, have vied to do Him homage! Dost thou think the Master e’er had been Footsore and weary! Would there not have stood by day, By night, full threescore chariots ready at His call! Ah, me! If they had only known, dost think the Feast At Simon’s house had been the only one thus spread; Or would He e’er have need to say, “The birds have nests, The foxes of the earth have holes, but I, the Son Of Man, no place to lay My Head!’’ Jerusalem, Would not thy palace gates have opened wide to Him, The Alpha and Omega, Prophet, Priest and King!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Ah me! Had they but known, in all the centuries since, The chosen few who bravely followed in His steps, Dost think Earth’s great ones would have left them lonely, poor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Despised? Would they have driven proudly by in state, The while “His feet” pressed wearily the wayside dust? All ye who often long, like Mary, to have poured The precious ointment on His head, remember this: His words are true to-day as then, that, “Inasmuch Ab ye have done it unto one of these, the least Of Mine, it hath been done to Me!” Ah, yes! and e’en A cup of water shall not fail of its reward, Because ’twas given in the name of Christ, the Lord. Then, let us ever seek to find and humbly serve His “little ones,&quot; for thus we do it unto Him.</span></p>
