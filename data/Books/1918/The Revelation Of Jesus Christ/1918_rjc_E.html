<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font16"><a name="bookmark8"></a>NOTE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">The familiar wording of the King James version of our English Bible has been adhered to as closely as possible, being altered only when necessary, to make the reading correspond to the Sinaitic Manuscript of the Greek text. This text is the oldest and most perfect known, though it had not been discovered at the time the “authorized” translation was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Suggestive of the dignity and formality of the proclamations and acclamations, with which the book of Revelation abounds, we have put such utterances into measured lines. In a few passages this action has called for slight rearrangement of words, but not, we trust, with the effect of obscuring the meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The rather frequent Greek word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">anggelos </span><span class="font11">has been rendered by the usual transliteration </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">angel.</span><span class="font11"> But all should remember the words of the old Yorkshire woman, who said: “It be’n’t wings as makes angels.” The word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">anggelos</span><span class="font11"> usually means </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">messenger,</span><span class="font11"> but in the highly symbolic language of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Revelation </span><span class="font11">it occasionally has the significance of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">instrumentality—</span><span class="font11">especially when the word refers to inanimate things. Again, when the subject deals, with a composite instrumentality it would better be rendered by </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">agency.</span><span class="font11"> In view of this variety of significance and possible differences of opinion we have simply used the word </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">angel</span><span class="font11"> in all places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">The customary abbreviations for Bible, books are employed throughout. Other abbreviations are: A, B, C, D, E, F, for the six volumes of “Studies in the Scriptures”; B. S. M. for “The Bible Students Monthly”; H, “What say the Scriptures about Hell?” T, “Tabernacle Shadows”; S, “Spiritism” booklet; Z, “The Watch Tower,” followed by year and page; Weym., “Weymouth’s New Testament in Modern Speech.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark15"></a>The Author of the Messages</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Command to Write: I </span><span class="font11">John, who am </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">your brother, and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience in Jesus, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus. I was in the spirit on the Lord’s 10 day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, saying, What thou seest, 11 write in a book and send it unto the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Glorified Redeemer: </span><span class="font11">And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">turned to 12 see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks ; and in the midst of the seven 13 candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breast with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white 14 like wool, as white as snow: and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like 15 unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand 16 seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword; and his countenance shineth as the sun in his strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Victor over Death: </span><span class="font11">And when I saw him, 17 I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and was 18 dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore; and have the keys of death and the grave. Write, therefore, the things which thou 19 hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which must shortly come to pass hereafter; the mystery of the seven 20 stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark17"></a>The Messages to the Seven Churches</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Ephesus: By </span><span class="font11">the angel of the church </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font11">in Ephesus write: These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks: I know thy </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font11">works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which call themselves apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and hast con- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font11">stancy, and all afflictions, and hast borne for my name’s sake, and hast not fainted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, 4 because thou hast left thy first love. Re- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">member therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, aud do the first works; or else I will come unto thee, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent. But this thou hast, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">that thou hatest the deeds of the Nico-laitanes, which I also hate. He that hath </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Smyrna: </span><span class="font11">And by the angel of the 8 church in Smyrna write: These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive: I know thy works, &nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some 10 of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life. He that hath an 11 ear. let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Pergamos: </span><span class="font11">And by the angel of the 12 church in Pergamos write: These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges: I know ■where thou dwellest, 13 even where Satan’s seat is; and thou boldest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, -where Satan dwelleth. But I have 14 a few things, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication. So hast thou also them 15 that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes in like manner. Repent; or else I will 16 come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He that hath an ear, let him hear what 17 the Spirit saith unto the churches: To him that overcometh will I give of the hidden manna, and a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man know-eth saving he that receiveth it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Thyatira: </span><span class="font11">And by the angel of the 18 church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass; I know thy works, and 19 love, and faith, and constancy, and thy works, the last more than the first. Not- 20 withstanding I have much against thee, that thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which saith she is a prophetess and teach-eth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her space to re- 21 pent; and she will not repent of this fornication. Behold, I will cast her into 22 a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her deeds. And I will kill her 23 children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">But unto you I say, the rest in Thyatira, 24 as many as have not this doctrine, which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden; but that which ye have al- 25 ready, hold fast till I come. And he that 26 overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give the power of the nations; and he shall rule them with 27 a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers; even as I received of my Father. And I will give 28 him the morning star. He that hath an 29 ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Sardis: And by the angel of the </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">church in Sardis write: These things </span><span class="font11">saith he that hath the seven spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest. and art dead. Be watchful, and 2 strengthen the things which remain, that were ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect before my God. Re- 3 member how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not repent, I will come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee. But thou 4 hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white; for they are worthy. He that overcometh thus shall 5 be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">He that hath an ear, let him hear what </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Philadelphia: </span><span class="font11">And by the angel of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">church in Philadelphia write: These things saith he that is true, he that is holy, he that hath the key of David, and that openeth, and no man shall shut; and shutteth, and no man shall open: I know 8 thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, which no man can shut; for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name. Behold, I have made them of the syna- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">gogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and thou shalt know that I have loved thee. Because thou hast kept my 10 instructions on constancy, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. I come quickly : 11 hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. Him that overcom- 12 eth will I make a pillar to the temple of my God, and he shall not go out; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my new name. He that hath an 13 ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To Laodicea: </span><span class="font11">And by the angel of the 14 church in Laodicea write: These things saith the Amen, and the faithful and true witness, and the beginning of the church of God: I know thy works, that thou art 15 neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. Because thou art thus luke- 16 warm and neither hot nor cold, refrain thy mouth. Because thou sayest, I am 17 rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not thou thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel 18 thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as 19 I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold, I stand at 20 the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, I will both open the door and come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. To him that overcometh will 21 I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne. He that hath 22 an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark23"></a>God on His Throne</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Throne and the Elders: </span><span class="font11">After this I looked, and, behold a door was opened in heaven: and, behold, the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. Immediately </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">was in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font11">spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font11">he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And round 4 about the throne saw I four and twenty seats, and elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and on their heads crowns of gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Four Beings: </span><span class="font11">And out of the throne </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">proceeded lightnings and voices and thun-derings; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. And before the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">throne there was as a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beings full of eyes before and behind. And the first being was like a lion, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">and the second being like a calf, and the third being had a face like as a man, and the fourth being was like a flying eagle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the four beings had each of them </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they have no rest day and night, saying, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and is, And is to come,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Glory, Honor and Power: </span><span class="font11">And when </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">those beings give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, Amen, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font11">four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever. Amen, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Thou are worthy, O Lord, our Lord and God,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> 11 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">To receive glory and honor and power;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For thou hast created all things, And for thy pleasure were they made.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark25"></a>The Sealed Book and the Lamb</span></h3>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">None Found Worthy: </span><span class="font11">And I saw in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written in front and on the back side, sealed with seven seals. And I saw 2 a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? And no 3 man in heaven, nor in earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">One Prevailed: </span><span class="font11">And I wept much, be- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font11">cause no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith unto 5 me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, bath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lamb of God: </span><span class="font11">And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">beheld in the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">midst of the throne and of the four beings, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">book, the four beings and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And they sung a new song, saying &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Thou art -worthy to take the book, And to open the seals thereof: For thou wast slain, And hast redeemed to God By thy blood out of every kindred, And tongue, and people, and nation;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And hast made them unto our God</span><span class="font10"> 10 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A kingdom and a priesthood:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And they shall reign over the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Angels Proclaim His Glory: </span><span class="font11">And I heard </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font11">as it were the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beings, and the elders: and the number of them was ten</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">thousand </span><span class="font11">times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; saying with a loud 12 voice,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Worthy is the Lamb that was slain To receive power, and riches, and wisdom, And strength, and honor, and glory, And blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">All Creation, gives Praise: </span><span class="font11">And every 13 creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and those in the sea and everything in those places—I heard them saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The blessing; and honor, and glory</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Of the Almighty be unto him That sitteth upon the throne, And unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the four beings said, Amen. And 14 the elders fell down and worshipped.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">First Seal: </span><span class="font11">And I saw when the Lamb </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four beings say, as it were the noise of thunder, Come and see. And I 2 saw, and behold a white horse; and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him; and he went forth conquering, and he conquered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Second Seal: </span><span class="font11">And when he had opened 3 the second seal, I heard the second being say. Come and see. And I beheld, and, 4 lo, there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Third Seal: </span><span class="font11">And when he had opened the 5 third seal, I heard the third being say, Come and see. And I beheld, and, lo, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I 6 </span><span class="font11">heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four beings say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fourth Seal: </span><span class="font11">And when he had opened </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth being say, Come and see. And I 8 looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and the grave was in his train. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and famine, and death, and with the beasts of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fifth Seal: </span><span class="font11">And when he had opened the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of men that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held: And they cried with a loud voice, 10 saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, wilt thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ? And 11 there was given unto each of them a white robe; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed by them as they were, should be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sixth Seal: </span><span class="font11">And I beheld when he had 12 opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood; and the stars of 13 heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casting her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind. And the 14 heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and hill were moved out of the places. And 15 the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the chief captains, and the rich men, and the mighty men, and every bond man, and every free man. hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the 16 face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the 17 great day of their wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sealing of Elect: </span><span class="font11">And after this I saw 7 four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font11">the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. And I saw another angel ascending </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font11">from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried w’ith a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea, saying. Hurt 3 not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The 144,000: </span><span class="font11">And I heard the number of 4 them which were sealed; and there were sealed a hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve 5 thousand;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Aser tw’elve thousand; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Nephthalim twelve thousand ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; 7 Of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Zabulon twelve thousand; &nbsp;8</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand; Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Vast Throng: </span><span class="font11">After this </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">beheld, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands; and they cry with a loud 10 voice, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation to our God upon the throne, And unto the Lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And all the angels stood round about the 11 throne, and about the elders and the four beings, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God, saying, 12 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Amen, Blessing, and wisdom, thanksgiving, And honor, and power, and might Be unto our God for ever And ever. Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Out of Great Tribulation: </span><span class="font11">And one of the 13 elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? And I said 14 unto him. My Lord, thou knowest. And he said. These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before 15 the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he that sitteth on the throne knoweth them. They shall 16 not hunger, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the. Lamb which is in the 17 midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto fountains of waters of life; and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seventh Seal: </span><span class="font11">And when he had opened </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font15"><a name="bookmark31"></a>(2) The Seven Trumpets</span></h3></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven Angels: Angel and Censer: </span><span class="font11">And I 2 saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. And another angel came and stood 3 at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar before the throne. And the smoke of the in- 4 cense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand. And the angel took the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth; and there were thunderings, and voices, and lightnings, and an earthquake. And the seven angels </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">First Trumpet: </span><span class="font11">And the first sounded; 7 and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Second Trumpet: </span><span class="font11">And the second 8 sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood; and the third part of the creatures 9 which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships was destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Third Trumpet: </span><span class="font11">And the third angel 10 sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; and 11 the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fourth Trumpet: </span><span class="font11">And the fourth angel 12 sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Three Woes Announced: </span><span class="font11">And I beheld, 13 and heard an eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth By reason of the other voices Of the three angels, yet to sound.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fifth Trumpet: </span><span class="font11">And the fifth angel </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the pit of the abyss. And 2 he opened the pit of the abyss, and there arose a smoke over the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Locusts: </span><span class="font11">And there came out of the 3 smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was 4 commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any tree; but those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. And to 5 them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. And in those days </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. And the likenesses of the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. And they had 8 hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. And they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">had breastplates, as it were breastplates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. And they had tails </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font11">like unto scorpions, and stings; and in their tails was their power to hurt men five months. They have their king, the 11 angel of the abyss, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">One woe is past; and, behold, there come 12 two woes more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sixth Trumpet: </span><span class="font11">After these things the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">13 </span><span class="font11">sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the golden altar which is before God, saying to the sixth angel which had the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">14 </span><span class="font11">trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. And 15 the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a month, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">year, for to slay the third part of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font11">the number of the army of the horse- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">16 </span><span class="font11">men were two hundred thousand thousand: I heard the number of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Horses and Riders: </span><span class="font11">And thus I saw the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font11">horses in the vision, and them that sat upon them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the beads of the horses were as the heads </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. By these </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18 </span><span class="font11">plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and the smoke, and the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For the power of the horses is in their 19 mouth and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Rest of Men: </span><span class="font11">And the rest of the 20 men which were not killed by these their plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood; which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: neither repented they of their murders, 21 nor of their sorceries, nor of their wickedness, nor of their thefts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Glorious Angel: </span><span class="font11">And I saw another </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font11">mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and the hair upon his head, and his face was, as it were, the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire: and 2 having in his hand a little book open, he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud 3 voice, as when a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven Thunder Peals: </span><span class="font11">And whatsoever </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font11">the seven thunders had uttered, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up what things soever the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. And the angel which I saw </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">stand upon the sea and upon the earth </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">lifted up </span><span class="font11">his right hand to heaven, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, that there is time no longer; but in the days of the voice </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God was finished, as he hath declared to his servants and the prophets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Little Book: </span><span class="font11">And the voice which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I 8 </span><span class="font11">heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the angel, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out 10 of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey; and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was filled. And they say unto me, Thou must 11 prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Temple Measured: </span><span class="font11">And there was </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font11">given me a reed like unto a rod: and he saith, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. But the court which is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font11">within the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given also unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. And 3 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Two Witnesses: </span><span class="font11">These are the two </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font11">olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And if any man will hurt them, fire pro- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">ceedeth out of their mouth, and devour-eth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. These have power to shut heaven, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">that it rain not in the days of their prophecy ; and have power over waters to turn them to blood, to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Two Witnesses Inert: </span><span class="font11">And when they </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">shall have finished their testimony, the beast that then ascendeth out of the abyss, shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also the Lord was crucified. And they of the peo- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">pie and kindreds and tongues and nations see their dead body three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be put in a grave. And they that dwell upon 10 the earth rejoice over them, and make merry, and send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. And after 11 three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Revived, they ascend to Heaven: </span><span class="font11">And 12 they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. And the same 13 hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain names of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">heaven. The second woe is past; and, 14 behold, the third woe cometh quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Seventh Trumpet: </span><span class="font11">And the seventh 15 angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The kingdom of this world</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Is become the kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Of our Lord, and of his Christ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And he shall reign for ever and ever, Amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the elders, which sit before God on 16 their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">We give thee thanks, O Lord</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">God Almighty, which art, and wast;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">That thou hast taken to thee</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Thy great power, and hast reigned;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">That the nations were angry;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">That thy wrath and the time Of judging the dead is come;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And of giving reward to thy servants The prophets, and to the saints, And to them that fear thy name, Both small and great, And of destroying the corrupters of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the temple of God was opened in 19 heaven above, and there was seen in his temple the ark of the testament of God, and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font15">(3) Prosperity of the Church’s Foes </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Sun-clad Woman: </span><span class="font11">And there appeared </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">12 </span><span class="font11">a great wonder in heaven—a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: and being with child, 2 she crieth, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Red Dragon: </span><span class="font11">And there appeared an- 3 other wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And his tail drew the third part of the 4 stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. And she brought forth a man child, 5 who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God and unto his throne. And the woman 6 fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> thousand two hundred and threescore days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Dragon Humbled: </span><span class="font11">And there was war </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">in heaven: Michael and his angels, to war</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">with the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, but they prevailed not &nbsp;8</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">against him; neither was he then found any more in heaven. And the great &nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Michael Glorified: </span><span class="font11">And I heard a loud 10 voice saying in heaven,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Now is come salvation, and strength, And the kingdom of our God, and the power Of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren Is cast down, which accused them before Our God, day and night.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And they have gained the victory</span><span class="font10"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">By blood—that of the Lamb—and by the Statements of their witnesses;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Their lives loved they not unto death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For this reason be glad, O ye heavens,</span><span class="font10"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And ye that are resident in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Woe to the earth and the sea!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For the devil is come down to you, Having wrath, since he knoweth His time, once appointed, is short.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Dragon Persecutes the Woman: </span><span class="font11">And 13 when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. And 14 to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished both for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. And the serpent cast out of his 15 mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth helped 16 the woman; and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. And 17 the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">First Wild Beast: </span><span class="font11">And he stood upon the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">13 </span><span class="font11">sand of the sea, and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. And the beast which I saw 2 was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of lions; and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. And I saw one of his 3 heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed; and all the earth wondered after the beast. And 4 they worshipped the dragon because he gave the power unto the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? and who is able to make war with him? And there was given unto 5 him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and it was given unto him to do what he will forty and two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And he opened his mouth in blasphemies 6 against God, to blaspheme him and his tabernacle, them that dwell in heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And it was given unto him to make war 7 with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, and nations. And all that dwell upon the earth 8 shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Captors led Captive: </span><span class="font11">If any man have an </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">ear, let him hear. If anyone leadeth into 10 captivity he goeth into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the endurance and honesty [test] of the saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Second Wild Beast: </span><span class="font11">And I beheld an- 11 other beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. And he exerciseth 12 all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Image of Beast: </span><span class="font11">And he doeth great </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on 14 the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">the beast; saying to them that dwell </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font11">the earth, that they should also make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. And he had 15 power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. And he causeth all, 16 both small and great, poor and rich, free and bond, to give him a mark in their right hand, or in their forehead: That no 17 man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark of the beast or his name, or the number of his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Number of Beast: </span><span class="font11">Here is wisdom: Let 18 him that hath an ear count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; Six hundred threescore and six.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lamb with 144,000 on Mt. Zion: </span><span class="font11">And </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">14 </span><span class="font11">I looked, and behold, the Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred forty and four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from 2 heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of thunder, and the voice which I heard was as that of harpers harping with their harps: and they sing 3 a new song, and it was before the throne, and before the four beings, and before the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Firstfruits Faultless: </span><span class="font11">These are they 4 which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins, those who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">beginning unto God and in the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no false- 5 hood; for they are without fault.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">First loud-voiced Angel: </span><span class="font11">And I saw an 6 angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, [saying] with a loud voice, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Fear God and give glory to him;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For the hour of his judgment is come; Worship him that made heaven and earth, And the sea and the fountains of waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Second loud-voiced Angel: </span><span class="font11">And there fol- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">lowed another, a second, saying, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Fallen is Babylon the Great;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Because through the wine of Her passionate whorings All nations have fallen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Third loud-voiced Angel: </span><span class="font11">And another, a 9 third angel, followed them, saying with a loud voice,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">If any man worship the beast</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And his image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And receive his mark in the</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Into the cup of his great indignation;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And tormented with brimstone and</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Fire shall he be</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">In the presence of messengers saintly, And of the Lamb:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And the smoke of their torment</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Ascendeth for ever and ever:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">No rest have they daytime or night-time, Who worship the beast and his image, And who receiveth the mark of his title. Here is the endurance test of the holy,</span><span class="font11"> 12 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">That keep the commandments of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A Heavenly Voice: </span><span class="font11">And I heard a voice 13 from heaven saying. Write:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Blest are the dead ones who die in the Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">From henceforth, saith the Spirit, For they rest from their labors, Though their works follow after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Son of Man with Sickle: </span><span class="font11">And behold a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">14 </span><span class="font11">white cloud, and upon the cloud I saw one sitting like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. And another </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15 </span><span class="font11">angel came out of his temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come to reap; for the harvest </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">the earth is ripe. And he that sat on the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">16 </span><span class="font11">cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Vintage Gathered and Trodden: </span><span class="font11">And an- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font11">other angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. And another angel came out from </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18 </span><span class="font11">the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thrust in his </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">19 </span><span class="font11">sickle upon the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font11">the winepress was trodden without the city (and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles), by the space of a thousand and two hundred furlongs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven Plagues Mentioned: </span><span class="font11">And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">saw an- </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">15 </span><span class="font11">other sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Song of Moses and the Lamb: </span><span class="font11">And I saw </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font11">as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and his image, and over the number of his name, stand </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font11">the sea of glass, having the harps of the Lord God, and singing the song of Moses </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font11">the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Just and true thy ways, </span><span class="font11">7 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">thou king of nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Who shall not fear thee, O Lord,</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And glorify thy name?</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For thou alone art holy:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">All nations shall come and shall Worship before thee;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For thine acts of justice are Open before thee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven Plagues Produced: </span><span class="font11">And after that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">I looked, and the sanctuary of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened: and the seven angels came out of the 6 temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure bright linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">one of the four beings gave unto the seven angels golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever, Amen. And the temple was filled with 8 smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven Vials; Seven Plagues: </span><span class="font11">And I heard </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">16 </span><span class="font11">a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels. Go your ways, and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">First Plague: </span><span class="font11">And the first went, and 2 poured out his vial into the earth; and there fell a grievous and noisome sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Second Plague: </span><span class="font11">And the second poured 3 out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Third Plague: </span><span class="font11">And the third poured out 4 his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I 5 </span><span class="font11">heard the- angel of the waters say,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous art thou which art and wast, The holy, because thou thus hast judged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For they have shed the blood of saints</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And prophets, and thou givest them blood To drink; of that they're worthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Even so, O Lord, O God Almighty; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Righteous and true thy judgments are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fourth Plague: </span><span class="font11">And the fourth angel </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. And men were scorched with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues; and they repented not to give him glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fifth Plague: </span><span class="font11">And the fifth poured out </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font11">his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font11">blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains, and repented not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sixth Plague: </span><span class="font11">And the sixth poured </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">out 12 </span><span class="font11">his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up. that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. And I saw three unclean 13 spirits as it were frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are the spirits 14 of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Behold, I come as a 15 thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. And they gath- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">16 </span><span class="font11">ered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armagedon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seventh Plague: </span><span class="font11">And the seventh poured </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font11">out his vial upon the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of God, saying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">It is done &gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And there were thunders, and lightnings, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18 </span><span class="font11">and voices; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. And the great city was 19 divided into three parts, and the city of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of the wrath. And every island fled away, 20 and the mountains were not found. And 21 there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">An Angel addresses John: </span><span class="font11">And there came </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">17 </span><span class="font11">one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying, Come hither; I will show unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters; with whom the kings 2 of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her harlotry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great Harlot: </span><span class="font11">So he carried me away 3 in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the 4 woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthinesses of the fornication of her and of the earth. And upon her forehead, was </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font11">a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, The Mother of Harlots and Abominations of The Earth. And I saw the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great astonishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Vision Explained: </span><span class="font11">And the angel said </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font11">unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. The </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the abyss, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and shall again be present. And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9 </span><span class="font11">heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are seven </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10 </span><span class="font11">kings; five are fallen, one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">11 </span><span class="font11">beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. And the ten horns which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">12 </span><span class="font11">thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">These have one mind, and give their 13 power and strength unto the beast. These 14 shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them : for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are With him are called, and chosen, and faithful. And he said, These waters which 15 thou sawest, -where the whore sitteth, are both peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which 16 thou sawest and the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in 17 their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the woman which thou sawest is that </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18 </span><span class="font11">great city, which reigneth over the kingdoms of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Babylon’s Downfall Proclaimed: </span><span class="font11">After these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried with a mighty voice, 2 saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Fallen is Babylon the Great,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And is grown to be home for the demons, And the stronghold of every foul spirit, And a cage for birds filthy and hateful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For all nations have drunk of the wine</span><span class="font11"> 3 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Of her passionate whorings;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And the kings of the earth have played Harlotry with her; the merchants Of earth are waxed rich through her Fabulous luxury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s People Bidden to Leave: </span><span class="font11">And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">4 heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins cleaved 5 together unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font11">even as she rewarded, double unto her double according to her works: in her cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How much she 'hath glorified herself, and 7 lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Terror and Grief of her Priends: </span><span class="font11">There- </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">8 </span><span class="font11">fore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is God the Lord who judged her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the kings of the earth, who have 9 committed fornication with her, shall wail and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning, standing 10 afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city J for in one hour is thy judgment come. And the merchants of 11 the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more: the merchandise of gold, and sil- 12 ver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and cinnamon, and spice, and 13 odors, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the fruits that thy soul lusted after 14 are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly perished from thee, and they shall find them no more at all. The merchants of these 15 things, which were made rich by her. shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and -wailing, saying, Alas, alas, 16 that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">For in one hour so great riches are come 17 to nought. And every shipmaster, and every one who saileth by the place, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off, and cried when they saw 18 the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like unto this great city! And 19 they cast dust on their head, and cried, ■weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">her costliness! For in one hour is she made desolate. Rejoice over her, thou 20 heaven, and ye saints and apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The City’s Abject Ruin: </span><span class="font11">And an angel 21 took up a mighty stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and there shall be no more found in her the voice of 22 harpers and musicians, and of pipers and trumpeters; it shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman shall be found any more in thee; and the light of 23 a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee; for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived. And in her was 24 found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Heaven Jubilant: </span><span class="font11">After these things </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">19 </span><span class="font11">heard as it were a great voice of much people in heaven, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah; salvation and power</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Of our God:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For true and just are his judgments;</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For he hath judged the great whore, Which corrupted the earth with her harlotry,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And hath avenged the blood of her servants At her hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And again they said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. 4 And the twenty-four elders and the four beings fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Amen; Hallelujah!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And voices came out of the throne, saying, 5 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Praise our God, all ye his servants, Ye that fear him—small and great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And I heard as it were the voice of a 6 great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah: for God, our Lord</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Omnipotent reigneth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And give honor to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">For the marriage of the Lamb is come</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And his bride hath made herself ready.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And to her was granted that she should 8 be arrayed in fine linen, bright and clean;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, Write, 9 Blessed are they which are called unto the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These, my true sayings, are the sayings of God. And I fell at his feet to 10 worship him.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The White Horse Rider: </span><span class="font11">And I saw heaven 11 opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were a 12 flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he 13 was clothed with a vesture sprinkled with blood: and his name hath been called THE WORD OF GOD. And the armies 14 which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a 15 sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of the anger of Almighty God. And he hath on 16 his vesture and his thigh' a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ’s Triumph over Cardinal Foes: And 17 I </span><span class="font11">saw another angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Come, be gathered together to the Great supper of God;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">That ye may- eat the flesh of kings</span><span class="font11"> 18 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">And of captains and mighty men, And the flesh of horses and of Them that sit on them, And the flesh of all men, both free And bond, both small and great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And I saw the beast, and the kings of the 19 </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">35</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the 20 beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were 21 slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth; and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Devil Bound: </span><span class="font11">And I saw an angel </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">20 </span><span class="font11">come down, having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand. And he 2 laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, and cast him into 3 the abyss and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: after that he must be loosed a little season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Millennial Priests and Kings: </span><span class="font11">And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">saw </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font11">thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God. If any therefore had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their forehead and on their hand, they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and 5, 6 holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection ; on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">him a </span><span class="font11">thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan Freed and Destroyed: </span><span class="font11">And when the 7 thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, and shall go 8 out to deceive all the nations in the four corners, Gog and Magog, and to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they 9 went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them 10 was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and where the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Great White Throne: </span><span class="font11">And I saw </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a 11 </span><span class="font11">great white throne, and him that sat </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font11">it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, 12 both great and small, stand before the throne; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And the sea gave up the dead which were 13 in it; and death and the grave delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.

And 2 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Heavenly City: </span><span class="font11">And there came one 9 of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me. saying, Come hither. I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife. And he carried me away in the spirit to 10 a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory 11 from God : her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal. [She] had a wall great 12 and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and their names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: on the east three gates; and on the north 13 three gates; and on the south three gates;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">and on the west three gates. And the 14 wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve, apostles of the Lamb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The City a Cube: </span><span class="font11">And he that talked with 15 me had a measuring reed of gold to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. And the city lieth four- 16 square, and the length is as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">And he measured the wall thereof, a hun- 17 dred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. And the building of the wall of it 18 was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Gold and Gems of Priceless Worth: </span><span class="font11">And 19 the foundations of the city wall were arranged with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; and the second, sapphire; and the third, a chalcedony ; the fourth, an emerald; the fifth, 20 sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst. And the twelve gates were pearls; 21 every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The City’s Temple: </span><span class="font11">And I saw no temple 22 therein because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And 23 the city had no need of the sun. neither of the moon, to shine on it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof. And the nations shall walk 24 by the light thereof; and the kings of the earth do bring their glory into it. And 25 the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there. And 26 they shall bring the glory of the nations into it. And there shall in no 27 wise enter into it any thing vulgar, neither whosoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the book of the life of heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The River of Life: </span><span class="font11">And he showed me a </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">22 </span><span class="font11">river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font11">of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruits every month: and the leaves of the trees were for the healing of the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The All-Sufficient Light: </span><span class="font11">And there shall shall be no curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him: and they shall see his 4 face; and his name also shall be on their foreheads. And there shall be no more <span class="font11">night; and they need not the light of a candle and light of the sun; for the Lord God will give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</span></p>

From the time the Nicene Creed was promulgated and accepted, A. D. 325, there was practically no more Bible study for over twelve centuries.</span></p>

Will not repent: The 360 years from Waldo’s message in 1160 ended on the 15th of June, 1520. Forty-one propositions, extracted out of Luther’s works, were condemned as heretical, scandalous, and offensive to pious ears. All persons were forbidden to read his writings, upon pain of excommunication; he himself, if he did not within sixty days publicly recant his errors and burn his books, was pronounced an obstinate heretic, excommunicated and delivered to Satan. With the excommunication of Luther, “the fat was in the fire;” and it was useless for the Roman Catholic church to try to stem the tide of the Reformation.

Reins and hearts: In olden times the mind was supposed to be located in the reins (kidneys); and the prophecy assumes the same position. Thus David says, “My reins also instruct me in the night seasons;” “In the night his song shall be with me.” (Psa. 16:7; 42:8) “My reins within me are consumed with earnest desire for that day.” (Job 19:27, margin) The metaphor is appropriate to the theme.

<p><span class="font11">the first translation of the Bible into German. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He that is true: </span><span class="font11">The direct reference is to Christ (1 John 5:20): but characteristic of Luther was his great love of truth. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He that is holy: </span><span class="font11">See Mark 1: 24. Luther’s special message was “justification by faith” — </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">real </span><span class="font11">holiness. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The key of David: </span><span class="font11">“All power in heaven and earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">(Matt. 28:18; Luke 1:32) Luther’s theses were antagonistic to the system actually ruling all over the world. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And that openeth: </span><span class="font11">See Luke 24:32. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">No man shall shut: “No </span><span class="font11">doubt all the powers of Satan were exerted to close the door then opened; but ‘he that is true’ had said, ‘which </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font11">man can shut.’” (Z.’16-347; Isa. 22:22) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And shutteth: </span><span class="font11">The door of opportunity for the Roman Catholic Church to repent swung shut the day Luther was excommunicated.—Rev. 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:8. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I know thy works: A </span><span class="font11">striking feature of Luther’s character was his promptness to do whatever he saw to be the Lord's will. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">An open door: </span><span class="font11">See </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. </span><span class="font11">16:9; Acts 14:27. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">No man can shut: </span><span class="font11">“While the Roman pontiff thought everything safe and settled, and all pious and good men were nearly in despair of the religious reformation, so earnestly desired, a certain obscure and inconsiderable monk in Saxony, a province of Germany, suddenly opposed himself single-handed with incredible resolution to the power of Rome. This was Martin Luther.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A little strength:</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">“They knew that they had the truth, and they fully trusted the Giver.” (Z.’16-347) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Kept my Word: </span><span class="font11">“Whoso keepeth his Word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.” (1 John 2:5) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Denied my name: </span><span class="font11">“If we deny him, he also will deny us.”—2 Tim.2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:9. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Have made them: </span><span class="font11">The opponents of the reformers were </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">already</span><span class="font11"> of the synagogue of Satan. (Rev. 2:13) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Say they are Jews: </span><span class="font11">Spiritual Israelites. (Z.’99-68) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">But do lie: </span><span class="font11">Papacy, one of the two systems of rulership (imperial power being the other), is congenitally “spotted like a leopard,” as far as the truth is concerned. (Dan. 11:27; Rev. 13:2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Make them to come: </span><span class="font11">“All nations whom thou hast made shall come.” (Psa. 86:9) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Before thy feet: </span><span class="font11">“The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee; and all that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet.” (Isa. 60:14; 49: 23) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Thou shalt know: </span><span class="font11">See Eph. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:10. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">On constancy: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hupontonee.</span><span class="font11"> cheerful, constant endurance. (Z.’01-115) My patience-enjoining word. (Matt. 10:22: Lu. 8:15) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I also will keep thee: </span><span class="font11">We think possibly the Lord meant that some of the church of that epoch would live over into the present period, and that they would not be subjected to the special trials of this hour. (Z.’15-200) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hour of temptation: </span><span class="font11">The special trials of the harvest time, due to the prevalence of evolution theories. (Z.’01-205) The same conditions prevail today amongst Bible students which the Apostle pointed out to the elders of the church of Ephesus. (Acts 20:28-32; Z.’16-328) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Upon all the world: </span><span class="font11">This temptation to headiness and strife is spreading gradually in every direction. (Z.’16-327; Rev. 7:1-3; 16:14; Matt. 24:21) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Upon the earth: </span><span class="font11">All adherents of Satan’s empire. (Z.’16-327; Rev. 6:10; 8:13; 11:10; 13:8, 14) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I come quickly: To </span><span class="font11">Smyrna (73-325 A. D.) and Pergamos (325-1160 A. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">D.) </span><span class="font11">nothing was said about Christ’s second advent; to Thyatira (1160-1378) the message</span><span class="font10"> was, “Hold </span><span class="font11">fast till </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I come;” to</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Sardis (1378-1518) it was, “If therefore thou shalt not reform, I will come on thee as a thief;” to Philadelphia (1518-1874) it was, “Behold, I come </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">quickly.”</span><span class="font11"> How evident that these messages to the churches are epochs drawing nearer and nearer to the climax of history, the fifth universal empire, now come at last I</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:11. Hold that fast: “Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life.” (E398) Which thou hast: The truths due and appropriate to the Philadelphia epoch. (Z.’15-199) Which continued loyalty to the truth will make forever yours. (F123, 165) That no man take: The crowns are limited, and there are some who will lose theirs to those more faithful. (C225, 363; F95; 1 Sam. 16: 1; Rev. 2:10) Thy crown: When once the body of Christ is complete there will be no additions: in the type, none could fill the office of high priest if he had a superfluous finger or toe, etc.—T127.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:12. I make a pillar: “Ye also as lively stones are built up,” etc. (F125) “A part which cannot be removed while the structure exists.” (Z.’16-347; Gal. 2:9; 1 Kings 7:21, 22; Jer. 1:18; 1 Cor. 3:17; Eph. 2:1922) In the temple: The true Church, the Christ. (T70) Not go out: “During their trial state their names were cast out as evil.” (Z.’16-347) Will write upon him: Upon his forehead—intellect. (Rev. 14:1; 22:4) City of my God: “A city not forsaken.” (Isa. 62:12; Ezek. 48:35; Jer. 23: 6; 33:16) New Jerusalem: The Kingdom of God. (Rev. 21:2, 10, 24; A 295) Which cometh down: At first it will consist of only the bride of Christ. (A295; Heb. 12 :18-22) My new name: The name of the glorified Christ. (E45) “This is the name wherewith she shall be called. The Righteousness of Jehovah.”—Z.’07-105; T102; E45; Isa. 9:6; Jer. 23:6; 33:16; Rev. 2:17; 19:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:13. He that hath an ear: “Having ears, hear ye not?” (Mark 8:18) Let him hear: “Let these sayings sink down into your ears.”—Luke 9:44.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">3:14. And by the angel: Charles T. Russell. He took the place of Mr. Barbour, who became unfaithful and upon whom were fulfilled the prophecies of Matt. 24:4851 and Zech. 11:15-17. He was ordained by the only divine ordination and orthodox by the test of the infallible Word, as presented in 1 Cor. 3: 16, 17; Eph. 2:20; Gen. 28:14; Gal. 3:29; Rev. 15:5-8; 21:3; 3:14; Col. 1:15; John 1:3; Heb. 7:26; Phil. 2:9; John 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:3; 3:18; 2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15: 8; Acts 26:13-15; Heb. 2:9; John 1:9; 1 Tim. 2:5, 6; 1 John 3:2; John 17:24; Rom. 8: Eph. 4:12; Matt. 24: 14; Rev. 1:6; 20:6; Acts 3:19-23; Isa. 35. Church in Laodicea: Meaning “Justice for the people.” (Z.’80-6-7) The last stage of the great nominal Gospel Church of wheat and tares, now present. (D41) Apparently due to end for the little flock in 1918 and for the great company three and one-half years later, as shown by the subjugation of Judea in A. D. 73 and the exemplification of the half-week principle in the covenant with Abraham, the last observance of a typical jubilee, the beginning of the times of the Gentiles, the death of' Christ, and the awakening of the sleeping saints. The three days fruitless search for Elijah seems to confirm this view. (2 Kings 2:17, 18) Write: Pastor Russell was the most prolific writer of Biblical truth that ever lived. The Amen: The same word translated “Verily” in the gospels and so often used by our Lord as a solemn prefix to some important announcement. (Z.’83-7-4) And true witness: Who testified, I and my Father are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">two.</span><span class="font11"> (John 8:17, 18: Rev. 1:5; 19:11) Thebeginning: “And the ending,” “The only begotten.” (Z.’94-12)</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Because thou: </span><span class="font11">The nominal Christian church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Art lukewarm: </span><span class="font11">Merely retaining the Bible in name, but neglecting it in fact. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">(C167) Refrain thy mouth: </span><span class="font11">“If </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">God </span><span class="font11">spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.” (C180) No longer recognize you as a mouthpiece, nor spokesmen in any degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:17. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Because thou: </span><span class="font11">The nominal church in our day. (A287) I</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">-am rich: </span><span class="font11">In numbers and in prosperity. (Z.’01-56) I have all the spiritual light that exists in the world. “I have much goods laid up for many years;” “I sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow.” (Z.’83-7-4; Rev. 18:7; Hos. 12:8; 1 Cor. 4:8) “Return unto me and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return ?” (Z.’92-261) The mission of the Christ is to “preach the Gospel to the poor.” (Z.’00-55) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased with goods: </span><span class="font11">“Laodiceans count their numbers and their donations by millions.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">(Z.’01-56) Need of nothing: </span><span class="font11">“They will not own that they have departed from the right ways of the Lord.” (Mal. 3:7; Z.’92-261) That thou: Of </span><span class="font11">all others, so the Greek indicates. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Art wretched: </span><span class="font11">“There are twelve murders in New England to one in London; in California seventy-five to one; in Nevada 245 to one.” (Z.’08-83) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And miserable: </span><span class="font11">If we could bring all the heathen up to the standard of our most civilized nation it would mean that God’s will would be less done the world over than it is now. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And poor: </span><span class="font11">Possessing</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">little of the truth and the spirit of the truth. (Z.’01-56) And blind: “Cannot see afar off,” cannot see the lengths and breadths and heights and depths of divine love, cannot see the high calling for the church or restitution for the poor world. (Z.’98-28) “The god of this world hath blinded the minds.” And naked: Stripped of the robe of Christ’s righteousness by the clergy, in the name of higher criticism and evolution. (Z.’01-56) A condition of affairs in Protestantism revealed at the World’s Congress of Religions.—D210.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:18. I counsel thee: “Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me into glory.” (Psa. 73:24) To buy of me: “At the cost of entire consecration, or sacrifice of all that we have, to Christ.” (Z.’96-44; Prov. 23:33; Matt. 13:44) Gold: The true heavenly riches, the divine nature. (D42) Tried in the fire: Freed from earth’s alloys by fiery trials. “Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial that is to try you.” How can the dross be eliminated without the crucible and the flame? (Z.’96-44) Mayest be rich: “That ye through his poverty might be rich.” (2 Cor. 8:9; Prov. 10:22; Lu. 12:21; 1 Tim. 6:18; Jas. 2:5; Rev. 2:9) White raiment: The robe of Christ’s imputed righteousness now so frequently discarded. (D42) Mayest be clothed: “Not having spot, or wrinkle or any such thing.” (Eph. 5:27) Of thy nakedness: “Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame.” (Rev. 16:15; Matt. 22:11-13; Isa. 47:3) Anoint thine eye: The eyes of the understanding. (D611) With eye-salve: The eye-salve of meekness, consecration and submission to the divine will. (B189, D42) That thou mayest see: See the beauty of the divine plan.—D611; 2 Cor. 4:4; Eph. 2:2; Psa. 13: 3; 19:8; John 9:6, 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:19. As many as I love: As many as are at heart honest and loyal to God. (Z.’92-59) I rebuke: Reproach, disgrace, put to shame, dishonor. (Z.’83-7-4; Z.’96-44; Prov. 3:11, 12; Heb. 12:5-8; Job 5:17; Jas. 1:12) And chasten: Train or educate, like a child or youth. And repent: Avoid cultivating the ecclesiastical conscience. “It was this ecclesiastical conscience which crucified Jesus Christ. (Rt. Rev. Chas. D. Williams, Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Michigan.) ”■—Z.T5-339.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:2O. Stand at the door: I am present, unseen. (Z.’83-3-5) Some of the Scriptures which, when understood in their connections and significance, prove that the Lord’s second advent occurred in the fall of 1874 are: Gen. 25:24; Exod. 4:3-9; Lev. 25:9; Num. 9:11; 15:38; 2 Kings 2:11; 2 Chron. 35:19; 36:21; Ezra 1:1; 6:15; 7:6-8; Neh. 2:1; Job 40:15-23; 41:1-34; Psa. 25:14; 50: 4, 5; Isa. 13:2; 18:1; 19:19; 28:8; 33:7; 40: 2; 56:10; Jer. 8:14; 16:18; 31:8; Ezek. 1:15; 2:3, 9; 3:15; 4:5, 6; 7:19; 8:3; 9:2; 14:21; 21:15, 31; 24:16; 33:22; Dan. 12:4, 12; Nah. 2:4; Hab. 2:1; Hag. 2:7; Zech. 9:12; Mal. 3:1-3; 4:6; Matt. 7:27; 13:30, 48; 20:8; 22: 11, 13; 24: 14-16, 21, 23, 28, 29; 25:5, 19; Mark 3:26; 21:25; Luke 18:8; Acts 2:19; 7:23, 30, 36; 1 Thes. 5:4; 2 Thes. 2:8; 1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:1-7; 4:3, 4; 1 Peter 3: 21; 2 Peter 3:3; Rev. 4; 6, 10; 10:7; 11:18; 14:10, 20; 15:3; 18:4. And knock: By oral or printed evidence that the time prophecies are fulfilled. The servants are not to know in advance, but are to know at the time of arrival, and that without seeing. (Z.04-123) This knocking began in 1875 and still continues. “And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord, that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately.” (Z.’04-124) If any man: Not any church; the church nominal is not being fed. (Z.’83-3-5) Open the door: To joys we ne’er before knew! Come in to him: “We will come unto him, and make our abode with him.” (John 14:23) And will sup: Take the evening meal. (Lu. 12:37) With him: The Master himself is feasting on the same joys of the Father’s plan that delight our own hearts. And he with me: “This serving of the servants by the Master should be understood to be an individual work, and not merely a collective service and feast.”—Z.’04-124.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:21. To him: Of the sanctuary class. (C190) That overcometh: That overcometh love of self, popularity, worldly prosperity, human theories and systems. (D268) Will I grant: If he prove faithful unto death. (T89) To sit with me: There can be no kingdom until the King comes. (A288) In my throne: My reign over the earth for the purpose of converting it. (A91, 223) The kingdom is not merely a work of grace in the heart. (A285) Even as I also: “As the Father hath appointed unto me a kingdom, so I appoint unto you a kingdom.” (E41) In his throne: Evidently the church will enter into this greatest honor at the close of the Millennial age.—F69.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">3:22. That hath an ear: “Blessed are your ears, for they hear.” Let him hear: “For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.” (Matt. 13:17) Unto the churches: Unto the seven epochs, ending respectively in A. D. 73, 325, 1160, 1378, 1518, 1874 and 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:1. After this: After this first panorama of the seven stages of the church had passed. Opened in heaven: It is only as the Lord, who holds the key, opens the door to the understanding of heavenly things, that we are able to comprehend them. (Matt. 3:16; Ezek. 1:1; Rev. 19:11) The first voice: See comments on Rev. 1: 1;7:2. Come up hither: “The seer now obtains a higher spiritual standpoint.” Things which must be: The divine plan for the permission of evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:2. In the spirit: In a trance condition. (Acts 10:10; Rev. 1:10) Behold, a throne: The throne of the heavenly Father. (Isa. 6:1; Ezek. 1:26-28) Was set: Permanently established, as in Luke 2:34; Phil. 1:17. In heaven: “Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus.” (Heb. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6:20) And one: </span><span class="font11">Jehovah, “the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ” (1 Pet. 1:3), the Author of the divine plan for the permission of evil, in the recreation of a perfect human race, and in the creation of a race of gods, sons of himself. (A124) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sat on the throne: </span><span class="font11">Of the universe recognized as the Center of authority, wisdom, justice, love and power.—E57; Rev. 7:10; Dan. 7:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:3. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Like a jasper: </span><span class="font11">Supposed to refer to the modern rare and beautiful green-tinted diamond. The diamond is the hardest substance known, excelling in brilliancy and beautiful play of prismatic colors. The crystals of which it is composed are bounded by </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">eight</span><span class="font11"> equal equilateral triangles ; </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">twenty-four</span><span class="font11"> angles in all, constituting a perfect double pyramid, set base to base. The jasper seems especially to illustrate his glory, perfection and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">prescience. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A sardine stone: </span><span class="font11">A favorite stone for the engraver’s art. The sardius seems especially to illustrate God’s love, his memory of his creatures, and his purpose of a resurrection for all smitten in Adam and redeemed in Christ. (Isa. 49:15, 16) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A rainbow: </span><span class="font11">The rainbow is the bow of promise for mankind, the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">peace</span><span class="font11"> of God. It is his </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">plan.</span><span class="font11"> “He has the blessed satisfaction and peace of conscious moral perfection as well as inherent wisdom and power.” (Z.’95-153) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">About the throne: </span><span class="font11">He will recognize nothing short of perfection in any creature, and makes </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span><span class="font11"> the foundation of his throne.

<p><span class="font11">4:4. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">About the throne: </span><span class="font11">Encompassing it on all sides—always in mind—never out of sight. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Four and twenty seats: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Thronoi, </span><span class="font11">thrones, places of highest exaltation—the twenty-four angles (viewpoints) of the diamond. (Rev. 4:3, 10) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Elders sitting: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Personifications</span><span class="font11"> of the testimonies of Enoch, Jacob, Moses, Samuel, Job, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos. Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai. Zechariah, Malachi and John the Baptist. Not the prophets themselves are here referred to. They are not in heaven. (Dan. 12:2, 13; Acts 2:34; Heb. 11:40) In white raiment: All of these men considered themselves unworthy to be God’s mouthpieces. (Jer. 1:6; 1 Kings 3:7; Gen. 32:10; Matt. 3:14; Isa. 6:5; 2 Sam. 7:18; Exod. 3:11; 2 Tim. 2:19; Dan. 2:30) Crowns of gold: The glory of God—Love, God’s highest attribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:5. Proceeded lightnings: It is remarkable that these lightning flashes are continually calling attention to the Word of God, to the Golden Rule. (Z.’T6-339; Rev. 8:5; 16:18) And voices: “As a result of God’s lightning flashes which are enlightening the world, there are ominous mutterings of dissatisfaction, unrest.” (Z.’T0-340) And thunderings: “We hear the thunder tones of judgment that ‘call the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.’” (Z.’T6-340; Ex. 19:16; Psa. 50:1; Rev. 8:5; 11:19; 16:18) Spirits of God: Perfect knowledge.—Rev. 1:4; 3:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:6. Before the throne: Throughout the universe. (Rev. 5:6) A sea of glass: “The troubled surface which Daniel and Isaiah beheld (Dan. 7:2; Isa. 57:20) became white seen before the throne of God, calm and clear; reflecting as from a mirror, every fulfillment of the divine purposes.” (Rev. 21:18, 21; Ex. 24:10) The sea (godless conditions about them) has been a means of purifying earth’s future priests. (1 Ki. 7:23-26. 38, 39) Like unto crystal: Indicating that nothing escapes God’s notice; all is transparent. (Matt. 6:6: Heb. 4:13; Ezek. 1:22; Z.’96-27) Midst of the throne: Woven into its very fabric. About the throne: Completely encircling and enveloping it. Were four beings: “Living ones” </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott); </span><span class="font11">the four immortal attributes of Justice. Power, Love and Wisdom. (Ezek. 1:5, 6) Before and behind: Seeing clearly everything that will ever occur in the future, and everything that has ever transpired in the past.—Ezek. 10:4, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:7. The first being: Justice was the attribute first manifested toward our sinful race. lake a lion: The characteristics of the lion illustrate this attribute: he kills only when hungry or attacked, and not for the mere pleasure of killing. (Ezek. 1:10; 10:14) The second being: Power, exhibited in the Flood. (Z.’95-153; Ezek. 1: 10) Take a calf: With the Hebrews the calf (young ox) was the emblem of power. (Deut. 9:16-21, 29) The third being: Love, exhibited in the Father’s sending his only-begotten Son to die that we might live. Tike a man: The embodiment of love. Think of all the pictures of comparative health and beauty of human form and feature that you have ever seen, and know that perfect humanity will be of still surpassing loveliness. (A191; Ezek. 1:5) The fourth being: Wisdom, as exhibited in the Father’s plan, now unfolded before our delighted gaze. He is thoroughly acquainted with all the intricate subtleties of physical, moral and intellectual law, so that no problem could arise, the results of which are not manifest to his mind. (1 John 1:5) Like a flying eagle: Of all known birds, the eagle flies the highest and with the greatest rapidity.—Isa. 55:9; Matt. 24:28; 2 Pet. 1:9; Isa. 33:16, 17; Psa. 103:6; Z.’88-116; Z.’95-153.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:8. The four beings: Justice, Power, Love and Wisdom. Six wings about him: Six is a symbol of imperfection, and in the foregoing seems to refer to the six thousand years of the permission of evil. For the first two thousand years, God's face was almost entirely hidden from man. For the next two thousand years it was not apparent how his footstool should ever be made glorious. (Isa. 60:13; 66:1) But since then, for two thousand years his Love has been manifest to all. The wings operate in pairs. Full of eyes within: Nothing has transpired, or will ever transpire, without God’s knowledge. (Ezek. 10: 12) They have no rest: Not eternal idleness, but eternal work in the interest of others will be our reward. (John 5:17; 9: 4; Eph. 2:10; Phil. 2:13; 3:21; 2 Cor. 6:1; 1 Cor. 3:9) .Saying-, Holy, holy holy: The Sinaitic MS. repeats the word “holy” eight times. (See Rev. 4:3) In the seventh thousand-year day God will bring all things to perfection through the Christ, yet it is the eighth day that marks the complete separation from the old order of things. (Luke 1:59; Phil. 3:5; Exod. 22:30; Lev. 23:36, 39; F51) Lord God Almighty: Jehovah. This scene is located in heaven, where even the Son himself is subject unto the Father. (1 Cor. 15 :28) Which was: The great First Cause. And is: The great “I AM.” And is to come: And evermore shall be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:9. When those beings: Justice, Power, Love and Wisdom. Give: Shall eternally continue to give, so the Greek indicates. Thanks to him: Their united testimony to the perfection of his character in all its attributes. Who liveth for ever: And will forever use those attributes in the blessing of all the universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">4:10. The elders: The personifications of the messages of the twenty-four prophets. Fall down before him: Unitedly bear witness to his perfect ability to foretell the future. And worship him: Magnify his perfect Justice, Power, Love and Wisdom. And cast: Shall eternally continue to cast, so the Greek indicates.

The events to the end of the chapter have their fulfillment in the future. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">About the throne: </span><span class="font11">“In the circuit of heaven” (Job 22:14), the circle of the universe. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the beings: </span><span class="font11">Justice, Power, Love and Wisdom. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the elders: </span><span class="font11">The prophecies. (Rev. 4:10) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Number of them: </span><span class="font11">“Whose number no man knoweth.” (Rev.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:9) Times ten thousand: The number of the great company will apparently exceed one hundred millions.—T118,119; Dan. 7:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5:12. With a loud voice: The great company will be very enthusiastic workers on the other side of the vail. Worthy is the Lamb: Because of his fidelity to the Father and his law. (E134) Because of his humility and obedience unto death. (E411) To receive power: The great company class humbly realize that their faithfulness and zeal was not sufficient to warrant their own exaltation to power. And riches: They realize they did not lay up all the heavenly treasures they might have done, but hid their talents in earthly pursuits. And wisdom: They realize that they were unwise in seeking the praise of men and that the Christ company, though apparently fools for Christ’s sake, were really the wisest of the wise. And strength: They know that they used their own strength for the support and maintenance of institutions which really hindered rather than helped the bride to make herself ready. And honor: They know that, as a class, they sought and obtained the honor that cometh from men, but failed to seek properly the honor that cometh from God only. And glory: They know that they failed to meet the high conditions of selfsacrifice, and were therefore unworthy of the high reward. And blessing: They feel that the blessings which the Lord gave to them were thoughtlessly appropriated to themselves and their families, with hardly a serious thought about the needs of the Lord’s dear family; and that appropriately, the chiefest of all blessings, the privilege of extending God’s blessings to the needy world, should go to those who most earnestly “by patient perseverance in well doing (did) seek for glory, honor and immortality.” (Rom. 2:7) Thus they reverence the Lamb and his bride; for these are one.—Rev. 19:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5:13. And every creature: After the destruction of the incorrigible at the end of the Millennial age. Which is in heaven: “Let all the angels of God worship him.” (Heb. 1:6) And on the earth: All mankind. (1 Cor. 15:25) In the sea: Even their terminated existence will be to the praise of the One who died for them. All that are in them: “Of things in heaven, and things in earth.” (Phil. 2:10; Eph. 1:10; Col. 1:20) The blessing: The source of all their blessings. (Rom. 9:5) And honor: Of life on any plane. (1 Tim. 6:16) And glory: “One star differeth from another star in glory.” (1 Cor. 15:40. 41; Rom. 16:27; 1 Pet. 4:11; 5:11) Be': Be as-scribed to. For ever and ever: “For the ages of the ages,” Greek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">5:14. The four beings: Justice. Power, Love and Wisdom. Said Amen: Unitedly declare this to be the happy outcome. Elders worshipped: The prophecies plainly declare that neither men nor devils can in any wise thwart this perfect ending of the plan which began so strangely and still progresses—the perfection, through suffering, of the little flock, the great company and, indeed, the world of mankind itself.—Rev. 4:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">6:1. And I saw: If we would comprehend what is revealed within the scroll we must be sincerely desirous of knowing the details of God’s plan in order to an earnest cooperation with it. (Z.’02-332) When the Lamb opened: “The Master declared that as the Father revealed them unto him, so would he reveal them unto us.” (Z.’16-252; Rev. 5:5-9) The seven seals: “Each seal as it was loosed permitted the scroll as a whole to open a little wider.” (Z.’97-257) And I heard: The roar of a lion. One of the four beings: Justice, typified by the lion. (Rev. 4:7) Come and see: Come and see Infinite Justice permitting one of the greatest acts of injusticed ever allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">6:2. And I saw: John beheld in vision the first strange and wonderful feature of the divine plan for the permission of evil as it related to epochs of the church beyond his own epoch—that of Smyrna. A </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">white horse: </span><span class="font11">The doctrines, teachings </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">the Lord and the apostles recognized as the one and only rule of faith and practice of God’s church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He that sat on him: </span><span class="font11">The Bishop of Rome, the embryo pope. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Had a bow: </span><span class="font11">“They bend their tongues like their bow for lies.” (Jer. 9:3) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And a crown: </span><span class="font11">Great honor and authority in the church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Was given unto him: </span><span class="font11">“Under the reign of Constantine (who murdered his own son in the same year in which he convened the Council of Nice) the opposition of the empire to Christianity gave way to favor.” (B290) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And he conquered: </span><span class="font11">Apparently, God forsook his church, having jeopardized all its interests by placing the pow<sup>e</sup>er in the hands of a self-seeking ecclesiastical system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">6:3. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The second seal: </span><span class="font11">Revealing the second period of the history of the Antichrist. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The second being: </span><span class="font11">Infinite Power, See Rev. 4:7. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Come and see: </span><span class="font11">Come and see Infinite Power consenting to a thing apparently in victorious opposition to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">6:4. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Another horse: A </span><span class="font11">creed-horse. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">That was red: </span><span class="font11">The color of sin—imperfection. (Isa. 1:18) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Him that sat thereon: </span><span class="font11">The same rider, the Antichrist. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Peace from the earth: </span><span class="font11">To embroil in controversy those who were under religious restraint. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Kill one another: </span><span class="font11">Depose and destroy one another as teachers, by inveighing the Roman power against all offenders. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A great sword: </span><span class="font11">As the Lord has a great and powerful sword, the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God (Eph. 6:17) and as it is represented as coming out of his mouth, so the Papacy has a great and powerful sword, in opposition to the sword of the Spirit, and it, too, comes out of Papacy’s mouth. [The word here is different from Rev. 1:16 and refers to the butcher knife. (Gen. 22:6, 10)] In Daniel 7:8, 11, 25, and Rev. 13:5, 6, the mouth of Antichrist is brought specially to our notice as a leading characteristic. (B304) This period, extending from the year 325 A. D. to 539, was the period of formation of creeds—the well-known “Apostle’s Creed,” the Nicene, the Nicaeno-Constantinopolitan, the Chalcedon and the Athanasian. “Neither Luke in the Acts of the Apostles, nor any ecclesiastical writer before the fifth century, makes mention of an assembly of the apostles for the purpose of forming a creed. Had the apostles composed it, it would have been the same in all churches and ages. But it is quite otherwise.”</span></p><img src="1918_rjc_E_files/1918_rjc_E-13.png" alt="" style="width:211pt;height:305pt;">

(B139) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In the dens: </span><span class="font11">Secret societies. (See Isa. 2:19-21) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And in the rocks: </span><span class="font11">The fortresses of society, civil and ecclesiastical. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the mountains: </span><span class="font11">Governments of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">6:16. To the mountains: </span><span class="font11">Kingdoms. (A318) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And rocks: </span><span class="font11">Fortresses of society. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fall on us: </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Epi,</span><span class="font11"> over or about, to cover and protect. The common view that wicked men will get enough faith to pray for mountains to fall, is absurd. (B139; Jer. 3:23; Hos. 10:8) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">From the face; </span><span class="font11">Of Justice, now about to demand an accounting for their stewardship. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Wrath of the Lamb: </span><span class="font11">Whose followers they have falsely professed to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">6:17. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Their wrath is come: </span><span class="font11">The wrath of the Father, the Son, and the saints. (Rev. 2:26, 27; Isa. 13:6-19; Zeph. 1:14-18) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Be able to stand: </span><span class="font11">“Who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth ?” (Z.’06-309) “He that hath clean hands and a pure heart.” “The very elect” will not be deceived.—D582.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7:1. And after this: </span><span class="font11">But not signifying that further, more elaborate and final fulfillments on an immense scale will not take place later. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I saw four angels: </span><span class="font11">The little flock. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">On the four corners: </span><span class="font11">“They shall gather together his elect from the four winds.” (Matt. 24:31) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Holding the four winds: </span><span class="font11">These “powers of the air,” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font11">“winds,” are not powers of natural air, but are the powers referred to by St. Paul when he speaks of Satan as “the prince of the power of the air.” (Eph. 2:2; Z.T4-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">166) Should not blow: </span><span class="font11">If they had had unlimited power they would have wrecked the world long ago; but they have been restrained. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">On the earth: </span><span class="font11">Symbolically, the earth represents organized society. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Nor on the sea: </span><span class="font11">The sea represents the disorganized masses. (Dan. 7:2; Lu. 21:25; Rev. 10:2, 5) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Nor on any tree: </span><span class="font11">The trees represent the household of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:2. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Saw another angel: </span><span class="font11">The Messenger of the Covenant; our Lord Jesus at his second advent. (Mal. 3:1) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">From the east: </span><span class="font11">Scattering the shadows of sin, ignorance, superstition and death. (D653; Luke 1:78; Mal. 4:2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Having the seal: </span><span class="font11">The seventh seal. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With a loud voice: </span><span class="font11">Pastor Russell was the voice used. Beautiful voice of the Lord: strong, humble, wise, loving, gentle, just, merciful, faithful, self-sacrificing; one of the noblest, grandest characters of all history. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To the four angels: </span><span class="font11">The harvest workers. (Matt. 24:31) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To whom it was given: </span><span class="font11">By completing the harvest work and thus releasing the restraints on the evil spirits. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To hurt the earth: </span><span class="font11">Throw order-loving peoples into desperation. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the sea: </span><span class="font11">So enrage the masses, not under religious restraint, as to make it impossible to control them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:3. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hurt not the earth: Do </span><span class="font11">not complete the harvest work too soon, and thus allow the demons to invade the minds of men until the appointed time. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither the sea: </span><span class="font11">Maddened by the obsession of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font11">evil spirits, there are no lengths to which the godless will not presume to go. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Nor </span><span class="font11">the trees: “It may be something in connection with the saints that will constitute the test of these angels. This will be the key, the secret connected with the awful time of trouble which the Bible tells us will mark the conclusion of this age and which will constitute the forerunner or beginning of the new dispensation.” (Z.’11-359) Till we: You “four angels,” harvest workers in the flesh, and myself, the Lord of the harvest. Have sealed: Marked, separated, distinguished, (C165) In their foreheads: Given them an intellectual appreciation of the plan of God, with its time features, etc., as a comfort, shield, and mark, seal, or evidence of their sonship.—B169, C225, 303.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:4. I heard the number: The predestinated number. (E412) 144,000: The definite, fixed number of the elect. (F179) In the same chapter reference is made to another company, also spirit-begotten. Children of Israel: The Lord’s people. (2 Chron. 7:14; D654; Gal. 6:16; Rom. 9;6-8) In the meaning of the names of the children of Israel we may recognize certain of the qualities which make each overcomer precious in the Father’s sight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:5. Of the tribe of Juda: Juda signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Celebrated,</span><span class="font11"> lauded, praised. Nothing is more praiseworthy than justice, noble-mindedness, the doing to everybody as one would wish to be done by. Our Lord was the Just One of the tribe of Judah. Doubtless the brightest crowns will be worn by those that are wholly without self-love, either in heart or in life. (Gen. 38:12-26; 43:3-10; 44:14, 34 ; 46:28) Tribe of Reuben: Reuben’s name, signifying </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘See ye, a son, provided in my affliction,”</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">The Pity of God, </span><span class="font11">seems to refer to the five-talented brethren who make their calling and election sure. To be possessed of ability and means to get the fullest enjoyment out of life, and to sacrifice it all gladly, requires a standard of character so high that the Lord expressly states that not many attain it. (1 Cor. 1:26; Gen. 37:21, 22, 29, 30; 42:22, 37)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">A taint of love of the world (spiritual uncleanness) is all that prevents from attaining the very highest place. (Gen 35:22; 49:3, 4; 2 Cor. 7:1) Of the tribe of Gad: Gad’s name, signifying </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A troop of children cometh,</span><span class="font11"> seems to give the third highest honor to those faithful men and women who have been blessed of God in bringing many of their own descendants into the divine family. There is a family interest on the part of the heavenly Father in every family that rightly seeks his face.—Gen. 46:16; Num. 26 :15-18; Acts 2 :39; 1 Cor. 7:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:6. Of the tribe of Aser: Aser’s name signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Happy.</span><span class="font11"> Apparently the fourth highest place of honor goes to the happy Christians. (Gen. 30:13; Phil. 4:4; 3:1; 2 Chron. 20:22) Tribe of Nephtalim: Naphtali’s name signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Great wrestlings,</span><span class="font11"> and suggests that the fifth highest place will go to those who have especially sought the face of the Father in prayer. (Gen. 35:25; 49:21; Luke 11:5-13; James 1:5; 3:17) Tribe of Manasseh: Manasseh’s name signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Forgetting</span><span class="font11"> The sixth honor apparently refers to a class having naturally very strong human attachments, for the dear ones of their earthly families, and yet love the Lord still more.—Psa. 45:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:7. Tribe of Simeon: Simeon signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Hearing.</span><span class="font11"> “Because the Lord hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also.” (Gen. 29 :33) This suggests that the seventh place of honor is reserved for those who have been hated in their home circles because of faithfulness to the Word of the Lord. (Rom. 5:3; 8:17; Col. 1:11, 12; 1 Pet. 1:7; 4:12; 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:12; James 1:12) Of the tribe of Levi: Levi’s name signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">A joining.</span><span class="font11"> The next honor is apparently reserved for those who have literally sacrificed all their possessions in this &quot;world in order that they might be more closely joined to the Lord and his service. Levi had no inheritance in the land. Tribe of Issachar: “Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: and he saw that rest was</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear.” (Gen. 30:18; 49:14, 15) This seems to signify that the next honor goes to the zealous, those who joyfully undertake, in the Lord’s name and cause, to work hard for the glory of his name.—1 Cor. 15:58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:8. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Tribe of Zabulon: </span><span class="font11">Zebulun signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Habitation</span><span class="font11"> or </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Dwelling.</span><span class="font11"> It signifies the blessed satisfaction that comes to those who, like the Master, during their earthly pilgrimages have not known where to lay their heads; but, although they have wrestled with poverty throughout life’s little day, have nevertheless held faithfully to the Lord, serving him. with limited education, strength, talents and opportunities. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Tribe of Benjamin: </span><span class="font11">Benjamin signified </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Son of my Sorrow</span><span class="font11"> originally, but the name was changed to signify </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Son of the right hand.</span><span class="font11"> The youngest of Jacob’s children, he seems in some aspects to typify the great company class (Z.’81-l-7), but succeeds in gaining the higher reward, probably because of being the companions of those that occupy more advanced positions in the body. Thus the humble-minded and faithful servants and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">companions</span><span class="font11"> may and do fill up that -which is behind of the afflictions of Christ, even though their personal sufferings be slight. (Heb. 10:33) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Tribe of Joseph: </span><span class="font11">The Sinaitic MS. mentions Joseph last, with peculiar fitness. Joseph was one of the most beautiful characters of the Bible. His name signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Whom may God increase.</span><span class="font11"> He had so many virtues that it is inadvisable to attempt their enumeration, but the story is told at length in Gen. 37-50. He is one of the very few characters named in the Bible about whom nothing uncomplimentary is expressed. He well represents all the other members of the divine family, all of whom have attained the divine likeness in their hearts and given expression to that likeness as fully as the frailties and weaknesses of the flesh would permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:9. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A great multitude: A </span><span class="font11">larger com-</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">87</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">pany than the Christ company; sufficiently faithful and zealous to consecrate themselves to death, but not to court sacrifice in his service; loyal, but not promptly obedient; with zeal not according to knowledge. These, through fear and faintheartedness, fail to put or keep their sacrifices on the altar, become overcharged with the cares of this life and more or less contaminated with the world’s ideas and ways; they are nevertheless virgins, pure in their heart-intentions. (C364, D578, F127. 168) For a summary of Scriptures bearing upon this class </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">see especially</span><span class="font11"> Z. ’07-315. Typified by Benjamin. (Z.’81-l-7) Typified by certain grains which cling closely to the chaff. (Z.’84-l-4) Typified by the “vessels of silver” “in a great house” mentioned in 2 Tim. 2:20. (N.’O7-6-2) Typified by Elisha while with Elijah. (Z.’04-253) Typified by Rahab. (Z.’07-267) Branches in the vine that do not bear fruit. (T69) “Babes in Christ. Those who seek merely to do right, and to put in eight hours or so a day faithfully, after the manner of the world, will be judged from this standpoint; and they will merely obtain a place in the great company. They are not fulfilling the conditions of the covenant of sacrifice.” (Z.’14-71; ’07-27) Could number: Is able to tell; not a foreordained or fixed number; for no one was ever called to be of this company. (Z.’97-161) Before the throne: Not “in the throne,” as his bride and joint-heir. (A214) Before the Lamb: Perfection on a lower plane of spirit-being. (F169) With white robes: The robe of Christ’s righteousness. (E457) Palms in their hands: “The palm is especially the symbol of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">martyrdom. </span><span class="font11">Many of the martyrs of the dark ages were undoubtedlv of the great company.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:10. With a loud voice: In grand and happy chorus of exultant praise and thanksgiving over their final deliverance. (Rev. 19:1-3) Saying, Salvation: Our glorious and unmerited boon of life on so high a plane. To our God: Be ascribed to him as the author. (Psa. 3:8) And unto the Lamb: The Tower of the Flock, Christ as the instrument of salvation.—Micah 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:11. And all the angels: The beautiful sous of the morning, who shouted for joy in the dawn of earth’s creative week 48,000 years ago. (Job 38:7; Lu. 2:9-14; Matt. 4: 11; 28:2; F51) About the throne: With eager joy welcoming this new addition to the family of God. And about the elders: The prophecies, many of which have pointed out this second and greater company. And the four beings: Justice. Power, Love and Wisdom. On their faces: No wonder such humble characters “always behold the face of the Father.” (Matt. 18:10) And worshipped God: There is no self-seeking among the angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:12. Saying, Amen: So be it! We are not at all jealous. We are delighted to have these new helpers in the heavenly realm. Blessing: The praises and blessings of all who owe their existence to his goodness. And wisdom: To unfold continually and forever some new and wonderful features of goodness and grace tow’ards the work of his hands. And thanksgiving: From “every creature which is in heaven and on earth.” (Rev. 5:13) And honor: To the name so long and so unjustly and foully dishonored by the eternal torment theory. And power: Restrained for thousands of years, but now about to be exercised in man’s behalf. (Psa. 73:10) And might: The ability to accomplish fully all his purposes. (Isa. 55:11) Be unto our God: Be ascribed to Jehovah.—Rev. 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">7:13. And one of the elders: The prophecy of Isaiah 1:10-20. Saying unto me: Under symbolism of Sodom, because of their identification with spiritual Sodom’s work and hopes. (Rev. 11:8) What are these: Who are these of whom it is said. Wash you, make you clean? (Isa. 1:15, 16; Rev. 7:9) And whence came they: Why are they figuratively represented as stained with blood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span><span class="font11">:14. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">My Lord, thou knowest: </span><span class="font11">It is doubtless contained in your prophecy. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And he said unto me: </span><span class="font11">In Isa. 34:5, 6. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Out of: </span><span class="font11">Literally “under” or “through”. (Z.’79-10-1) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Great tribulation: </span><span class="font11">The tribulation, the great one—the twofold article being specially emphatic. See Rev. 3:10; 6:17; Matt. 24:21. The great time of trouble with which this age shall end, sent in special mercy, to effect in them a proper penitence for sin and a proper appreciation of the divine standard of truth and righteousness. (Z.’96-191; ’07-232, 233) The sufferings of the great company class are greater than those of the little flock. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Washed their robes: </span><span class="font11">Which had become sadly spotted and soiled by contact with the world. (Z.’97-161, 162) Not being of the class that are guided by his eye. (E254) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Blood of the Lamb: </span><span class="font11">In their sufferings they will learn to appreciate as never before their relationship to the Lamb of God and to his atoning merit, and by faith will be permitted to apply the same to their own cleansing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span><span class="font11">:15. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Therefore: </span><span class="font11">Because, in the final test, they suffered martyrdom and cleansed their robes rather than deny the Lord. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Before the throne: </span><span class="font11">“With the world in the next age, the Lord’s powder will be represented through the great company class, under the bride. They will be a great police force, looking out for the whole people.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Day and night: </span><span class="font11">Continually. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In his temple: </span><span class="font11">The church. (F127) But not of it. (T70) They ultimately reach a position next to the bride, on the spiritual plane. (A241) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Knoweth them: God </span><span class="font11">keeps a record of his friends (Mal. 3:16) but no record of his enemies; and therein lies their ruin. “I never </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">knew</span><span class="font11"> you; depart from me.”—Matt. 7:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7:16. They shall not hunger: </span><span class="font11">Poor things, how hungry they have been I </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither thirst any more: </span><span class="font11">“The waters of truth shall no longer be brackish with error.” (B26) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Nor any heat: </span><span class="font11">During the harvest time the Lord’s people, illuminated with the light of present truth, have been shining fortn not with any brilliancy of their own, but with much of the coming splendor of the “Sun of Righteousness.” Coming in contact with them, it has been inevitable that the great company class should frequently be singed, unable to answer the truth, and should feel much heat.—Isa. 28:19; Amos 5:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7 :17. For the Lamb: </span><span class="font11">Jesus Christ, their eternal friend. (Heb. 13:8) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Midst of the throne: </span><span class="font11">Authority, rulership. (A92; Rev. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5:6) Shall feed them: Be </span><span class="font11">their shepherd. (John 10:1-28; 21:16) They will not have immortality. Their lives will always require to be sustained, as in the case of the angels. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Waters of life: </span><span class="font11">The united wellsprings of the fountain and its 144,000 associates. (John 4:14; Rev. 22:1, 17; Ezekiel 47:1-5) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Wipe away all tears: </span><span class="font11">There will be tears at first that will require wiping away, when they see all they have missed. Nevertheless, “with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought into the King’s palace.”—Psa. 45:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:1. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And when he: </span><span class="font11">The Lord Jesus. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Opened the seventh seal: </span><span class="font11">“The seal of the living God.” (Rev. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7</span><span class="font11">:2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">There was silence: </span><span class="font11">“The clergy somehow realize that neither reason nor Scripture supports their false doctrines, and that the wisest method is to keep silent, in the shadow of old superstitions and under the protection </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">so-called Christian governments.” (C158; Jer. 8:14) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In heaven: </span><span class="font11">In the nominal ecclesiastical heavens. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Space of half an hour: On </span><span class="font11">the scale of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">year for a day this would mean but a week, and indicates that, as soon as the full number to complete the body of Christ were sealed with the present truth, persecution in a public way, and on an unprecedented scale, began almost immediately. (This verse should properly be included in Chapter 7.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:2. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And I saw: </span><span class="font11">As the next vision </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">the grand series. Something never seen until the seventh seal was broken and the mystery of God finished. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The seven angels: </span><span class="font11">Instrumentalities suitable for the work to be performed. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Which stood before God: </span><span class="font11">Featuring the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Reformation. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven trumpets: </span><span class="font11">Bugles with which to blow bugle-blasts of liberty from the oppressions of the Papacy.—Lev. 25:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:3. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And another angel: </span><span class="font11">The corporate body—the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, which Pastor Russell formed to finish his work. (Z.’17-22; Rev. 14:18; 19: 17) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Came and stood: </span><span class="font11">Waited before the Lord, after the Pastor’s death, ready to do the Master’s will. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">At the altar: </span><span class="font11">The Brazen Altar, the place of sacrifice. (Ex. 38:1-7; Lev. 16:12, 13) The fire for the sacrifice at the Golden Altar was obtained here and then carried to the Golden Altar,, where the incense was crumbled on it. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Having a golden censer: </span><span class="font11">Censers, or firepans, were of two forms, with handles and without. In this case the kind with the handle, used only on the Day of Atonement, is the one referred to. The incense ■was burnt while the high priest held the censer in his hand. Thus, in this prophecy, the great antitypical High Priest identifies himself with the work of the Society, and places in its care—holds in his hand—the fire-pans, the things that lead us to the place where we sacrifice ourselves. Thus seen, the censer represents teachings, understandings of the Word; for it is our understanding of the Word which leads us to offer up all we have in the Lord’s service. (Num. 16:6. 7) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Much incense: </span><span class="font11">The heart’s best endeavors of the faithful fellow-members of the body. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Should offer it: </span><span class="font11">To Jehovah, through the Son. (Rev. 5:8) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Prayers of all saints: </span><span class="font11">The Society is the only entity in the world answering to this description. It alone has offered on its behalf the prayers of so many saints, in harmony with the clause of their Vow which reads: “Daily will I remember at the throne of heavenly grace the general interests of the harvest w’ork —the dear co-laborers at the Brooklyn Tabernacle and Bethel, and everywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Before the throne: </span><span class="font11">The offerings take place “before the throne,” on this side the vail.—Rev. 1:4; 5:6; Ex. 30:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:4. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the smoke: </span><span class="font11">The fragrant, sweet perfume. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the incense: </span><span class="font11">Life’s dearest ties, sacrificed in the Master’s cause. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With the prayers: In </span><span class="font11">harmony with the Vow of faithfulness. (Psa. 141: 2; Luke 1:10; Acts 10:4) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Up before God: </span><span class="font11">“An odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.”—Phil. 4:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:5. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the angel: </span><span class="font11">The Watch Tower Society through its proper representatives. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Took the censer: </span><span class="font11">The Seventh Volume of Studies in the Scriptures, divinely provided. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fire of the altar: </span><span class="font11">Coals from the altar signify burning truths; and such the Lord’s prophecies always are, when rightly understood. (Isa. 6:5-8) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And cast it: </span><span class="font11">Greek, “Deliberately hurled it.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Into the earth: </span><span class="font11">Among order-loving people. (Ezek. 10:2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And thunderings: </span><span class="font11">Symbol of controversies. (Z.’84-l-5; Luke 12:49) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And voices: </span><span class="font11">“These voices have been circulated here and there throughout the whole civilized world, not by worldly agents, not through book-sellers, but by those who have themselves been blessed by the light.” (Z.’02-118) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And lightnings: </span><span class="font11">Diffusions of knowledge. (Z.’83-7-8; Rev. 4:5; 11:19; 16:18) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And an earthquake: A </span><span class="font11">revolution. (A336) Perhaps the symbolical earthquake will be accompanied by a literal one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:6. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The seven trumpets: </span><span class="font11">The seven trumpets of Revelation are symbolical and not literal. (Z.’02-116; Josh. 6:4) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To sound: </span><span class="font11">It is admitted that those that have already “sounded” have not been literal blasts of a bugle on the air.—Z.’02-116.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:7. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The first sounded: </span><span class="font11">The movement began, which later developed into the nineteen Lutheran sects. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">There followed hail: </span><span class="font11">Sharp, cutting, hard truth, contained in Luther's ninety</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">-five </span><span class="font11">theses. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And fire: De</span><span class="font11">structive judgments upon the Papacy. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Mingled with blood: </span><span class="font11">Blood is a symbol of death-dealing doctrine, and this teaches that Luther did not get entirely free from error. Earth was burned up: Luther’s teaching had the effect of transforming the order-loving German people into anarchists. And the third part: The German part. The Reformation particularly affected “three parts” of the papal dominion, Germany, England and France. (Rev. 8: 7-10) Of the trees: Trees are symbols of saints. (Z.’14-312; Isa. 61:3) Was burnt up: Hindered from standing alone, and absorbed into the Lutheran system. All green grass: Natural men of independent thought. (Isa. 40:6, 7) Was burnt up: Similarly absorbed into the Lutheran system, a welcome substitute for Papacy’s intolerable yoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:8. The second sounded: The Anglican church movement began. A great mountain: England in the time of Henry VIII. Mountains symbolize kingdoms. (Dan. 2: 35; Jer. 51:25) Burning with fire: Aflame with another great movement destructive to the Papacy, Cast into the sea: Suddenly thrown into a condition of isolation from the Papacy—no longer placed under religious restraint to it. Third part of the sea: The English part. Became blood: The much-married Henry VIII, founder of the Anglican church, and the second great sect-founder, has some slight blemishes on his escutcheon also. For details see any encyclopedia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:9. And the third part: The English part. Of the creatures: The clergy “apos-tolically” of the ( hurch of Rome, but actually doing business under Henry VIII. In the sea: No longer under religious restraint to the Papacy. And had life: The apostolic succession. Died: Were excommunicated by the pope, lost the-ir “apostolic (?) succession.” And the third part: The English part. Of the ships: Independent bodies of Christian worshippers called Lollards, followers of Wycliffe. (Z.’00-186) Was destroyed: Compelled to acknowledge Henry VIII as head of the church or lose their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:10. Third angel sounded: The Calvin -istic movement began, which later developed into the seventeen Presbyterian sects. A great star: Light-bearer, pulpit star (D591, 594) From heaven: The powers Of spiritual control. Burning as it were a lamp: The precipitation of the Calvinistic movement in France and Switzerland was as sudden as the Anglican movement had been in England or the Lutheran movement in Germany. Upon the third part: The French part. Of the rivers: Channels of religious instruction. (Z.’95-119) Fountains of waters: The Word of God.—D266.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:11. Name of the star: Calvin is entitled to the honor of having at one time been a papal star. He was from the first educated for the church. Is called Wormwood: What an ideal name for the doctrine which has caused more bitterness against God than any other doctrine ever taught I Part of the waters: Many portions of the Scriptures, misunderstood, misconstrued and misapplied. Became: Were made to appear in the eyes of many. Wormwood: Bitter as gall. “None now would justify Calvin’s course in sentencing Servetus to be burned. He was literally roasted alive, in horrible torture nearly five hours—in the name of God, of Jesus, of righteousness, truth, justice, love, Christianity and civilization.” (Jer. 9:15; 23: 15, 9-40; Deut. 29:18) And many men died: Lost their manhood, reason and common sense by becoming Calvinists. Were made bitter: The poison of bitter error, the doctrine of devils, having been mingled with the pure water of life, the truth of God’s Word.—C157.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:12. Fourth angel sounded: The Baptist sectarian movement began, resulting in the sixteen Baptist sects. The sun was smitten: Though not apparently so stated in any confession of faith, it is a prevalent view among Baptists that the Old Testament has been entirely fulfilled. Believing thus, they lose the force of a large part of the Gospel message, typified by the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Part of the moon: </span><span class="font11">Similarly, they do not see the force of the teachings of the Law dispensation, as in the Tabernacle arrangements, etc., in their application to the church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Part of the stars: </span><span class="font11">The teachings of the true light-bearers, the apostles, cannot be fully appreciated except in connection with the prophecies of the Old Testament. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Was darkened: </span><span class="font11">If pressed to estimate the relative worth to us as new creatures of the writings of the Old and New Testaments, we would admit that the writings of the New Testament are worth perhaps twice as much to us as those of the Old Testament because they contain the message addresed to the new creation, but </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">zve</span><span class="font11"> want all </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font11"> thirds of the Word. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the day: </span><span class="font11">The Scripture teaching of the coming Millennial day. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A third part of it: </span><span class="font11">At least a third of the light we get on the subject of the Lord’s Millennial reign is from the Old Testament. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The night likewise: </span><span class="font11">The same is true of the world’s dark night of sin and death, and the darkest feature of that night—the time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation. The Old Testament has much of light and instruction on this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">8:13. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Heard an eagle: </span><span class="font11">One of Pastor Russell’s humble followers (Matt. 24:28) apprehending correctly the significance of the three woes. See comments on Rev. 8:2 and 9:12 as to why this statement is appropriate in this place. This verse is a parenthesis, as is also Rev. 8 :3-5, which is synchronous with it. Both were seen by the Revelator </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font11"> the opening of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">seventh</span><span class="font11"> seal. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Midst of heaven: </span><span class="font11">Beginning with the papal heavens and then in their order of development, the Lutheran, Anglican, Calvinistic and Baptist heavens. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With a loud voice: </span><span class="font11">With considerable plainness of speech. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Woe, woe, woe: </span><span class="font11">Great distress and perplexity of mind. Inhab-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">iters of the earth: </span><span class="font11">All supporters </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">Satan’s empire. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The other voices: </span><span class="font11">Later movements in the ecclesiastical heavens described in Chapters 9 and 10. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the three angels: </span><span class="font11">Methodism, the Church Federation and the Truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:1. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fifth angel sounded: </span><span class="font11">The Wesleyan movement began, leading up to the fifteen Methodist sects. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And I saw a star: </span><span class="font11">John Wesley became a star in the Anglican heavens in 1728, at which time he was ordained a priest by Bishop Potter. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fall from heaven: </span><span class="font11">For many years Wesley had no thought of forming a sect; and yet unconsciously he began to do so from the time he was ordained. “The preachers in the South determined upon administration of the sacraments, and a committee was chosen who ordained themselves and others. Wesley perceived that the Society would disintegrate unless effective measures were speedily taken; and, aided by two presbyters of the Church of England (one of whom was James Creighton), early in 1784 he ordained Thomas Coke, a presbyter of that church, as superintendent. In 1787 the American Conference changed Mr. Coke’s title to “bishop.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the abyss: </span><span class="font11">Wesley was given the key to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">nothing </span><span class="font11">and to </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">nowhere;</span><span class="font11"> thus the symbolism indicates. See Rev. 11:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:2. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">There arose a smoke: </span><span class="font11">Confusion— a blinding haze. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Over the pit: </span><span class="font11">In the “air,” the ecclesiastical heavens. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of a great furnace: </span><span class="font11">Methodism was no ordinary smudge. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the sun: </span><span class="font11">The true Gospel. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the air: </span><span class="font11">The Anglican church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Were darkened: </span><span class="font11">Methodism damaged the Anglican communion as much as it did the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:3. Locusts: An immense number of followers. (Judges 7:12) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Upon the earth: </span><span class="font11">Among order-loving people. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Was given power: </span><span class="font11">To attend an old-time Methodist meeting and witness the “getting the power” was to see an interesting sight. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">As the scorpions: </span><span class="font11">“A well-known injurious insect of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">hot</span><span class="font11"> climates, which is shaped very much like a lobster. They are carnivorous in their habits, and move along in a threatening attitude with the tail elevated. The sting, which is situated at the ex-</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">tremity of the tail, has at its base a gland that secretes a poisonous fluid, which is discharged into the wound by two minute orifices at its extremity.”—McClintock and Strong’s Encyclopedia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:4. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Grass of the earth: </span><span class="font11">Men of independent thought. (Rev. 8:7) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Neither any tree: </span><span class="font11">Saint. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">But those men: </span><span class="font11">The unconverted. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The seal of God: </span><span class="font11">Methodists understand that to be converted from being a sinner means to have the seal of God in one’s forehead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:5. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Not kill them: </span><span class="font11">No such sane and merciful sentence as “the wages of sin is death” has any place in Methodist theology. Wesley was born at a time -when the original meaning of the word “hell” had become hidden. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Tormented five months: </span><span class="font11">In symbolic time, 150 years. (B65, 66, 91) Wesley became the first Methodist in 1728. (Rev. 9:1) When the Methodist denomination, with all the others, was cast off from favor in 1878 its power to torment men by preaching what Presbyterians describe as “Conscious misery, eternal in duration” came to an end legally, and to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">large extent actually. (Rev. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9:10) And their torment: </span><span class="font11">The torment of those tormented by the tormenting doctrine of torment. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Torment of a scorpion: </span><span class="font11">See V. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">10.</span></p><img src="1918_rjc_E_files/1918_rjc_E-14.png" alt="" style="width:214pt;height:151pt;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">METHODISM. (See Vs. 3-11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9 :6. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And in those days: </span><span class="font11">Throughout the 150 years of widely prevalent “Methodist hell-fire”. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall men seek death: </span><span class="font11">Would be glad to know that “The wages of sin </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">is </span><span class="font11">death.” (Rom. 6:23) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And shall not find it: </span><span class="font11">Because all the texts which plainly teach that “All the wicked will God destroy,” were perverted to mean “All the wicked will God immortalize in hell.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall desire to die: </span><span class="font11">Real men would prefer to die and stay dead rather than forever companion and worship the greatest devil of the universe. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And death shall flee: </span><span class="font11">They were told that men only seem to die, although touch, hearing, sight and smell all bear eloquent testimony to the contrary.—Rom. 6:23; Ezek. 18:4; Gen. 3:19; Psa. 115:17; 37:10, 20; Ecc. 3:19-21; 9:5; 1 Cor. 15:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">9:7. Prepared unto battle: </span><span class="font11">The battlecry of the old-time Methodist was: “All at it, and always at it.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">As it were crowns like gold: </span><span class="font11">Those born of the spirit, changed from human conditions and made like the Lord, have received the very highest blessing, the “crown of life,” the divine nature. Gold is a symbol of divinity. To receive a crown of gold is to be born of the spirit. All old-time Methodists felt certain that they were “born of the spirit” when converted, no begetting or quickening being necessary. But here is pointed out that these good people had “as-it-were” crowns instead of real ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:8. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The faces of men: </span><span class="font11">They were not “born of the spirit” as they supposed. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hair of women: </span><span class="font11">“If a woman have long hair it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.” (1 Cor. 11:15) The church’s glory is her wedding robe, the robe of Christ’s righteousness. It is to the credit of old-time Methodists that they trusted for salvation in the precious blood of Christ. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Teeth of lions: </span><span class="font11">Lions are able to chew and swallow almost anything. When the conference at Baltimore in 1787 turned John Wesley’s superintendent into a bishop, the Methodist people swallowed it all; and to this day most of them really believe that their clergy are a divinely appointed institution, despite the fraud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">:9. Had breastplates: </span><span class="font11">“Breastplates </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">righteousness.” (Eph. 6:14) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">As it were of iron: </span><span class="font11">An iron breastplate would be a good one but an “as-it-were” breastplate would need examination. It was not uncommon for old-time Methodists to deceive themselves into thinking they had not sinned for years. Those who had such breastplates wore the “as-it-were” variety. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound of their wings: </span><span class="font11">When engaged in “getting the power”. (Rev. 9:3) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sound of chariots: </span><span class="font11">The noisiest vehicles known in the Revelator’s day. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Running in battle: </span><span class="font11">The old-time Methodist hell-fire revival was in days gone by one of the noisiest places on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:10. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">They had tails: </span><span class="font11">Followers—classleaders. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Hike unto scorpions: </span><span class="font11">The oldtime class-leader was an invaluable adjunct of the Methodist church. Upon him devolved the duty of requiring each probationer to attend the class-meeting and report his spiritual progress weekly. After each report it was the class-leader’s duty to inject a little more of the poisonous doctrines from the two orifices referred to in comments on Rev. 9 :3. From the “heaven” orifice came the doctrine, “If you are good you will go to heaven when you die”—and from the “hell” orifice came the message, “If you are bad you will go to hell when you die.” It was all very simple. Everybody was simple in those days. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And stings: </span><span class="font11">Revivals in which the attendants were stung, doctrinally and financially. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Five months: </span><span class="font11">One hundred and fifty years, from Wesley’s ordination in 1728 to the casting off of Methodism in 1878.—Rev. 9:5; 2:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:11. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Have their king: </span><span class="font11">The same king as exercises general rulership over all the ecclesiastical affairs of this present evil world. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Angel of the abyss: </span><span class="font11">“The prince of the power of the air.” (Eph. 2:2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Abaddon: </span><span class="font11">And he is “a bad one,” sure enough. (2 Cor. 4:4) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Apollyon; </span><span class="font11">That is, Destroyer. But in plain English his name is Satan, the devil. As a means for preventing people from seeing the truth, Methodism has been as efficient as any of the five systems previously described, or any that follow. All have been sadly misled and deceived by our great and wily adversary ; “Taken captive by him at his will.”—2 Tim. 2:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:12. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">One woe is past: </span><span class="font11">Methodism was the first woe of the epoch leading up to and associated with “the time of the end”. It was a serious blow to the pretensions of the Papacy, but its days of usefulness have long since passed. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Two woes more: </span><span class="font11">One is outlined in the remainder of this chapter and one in Chapter 10. It was the discovery of Methodism as the first woe that led to an identification of the four movements of the Reformation proper which preceded it.—Rev. 8:7-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:13. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sixth angel sounded: </span><span class="font11">The Evangelical-Alliance-Spiritism movement began in 1846-1848, culminating in the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America. Their “faiths” are quite as varied as their names; but without exception they deny the central truth of the Scriptures (1 John 4:2, 3) that when Jesus Christ came to earth he came as a man only, devoid of immortality or divinity, that when he died he was as dead as though he never had lived, and that by that death he bought for Adam and his race the restitution of all things foretold by “the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3 :19-23) The common ground upon which they stand is this: their denial of the Ransom, their affirmation of spiritism, in some form, and their adherence to the principle of federation. (2 Tim. 4:3, 4; Deut. 18:10, 11; Isa. 8:9-22) The latter passage is full of the deepest significance at this time. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And I heard a voice: </span><span class="font11">William Miller, from </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A. D. </span><span class="font11">1829 to 1844. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The golden altar: </span><span class="font11">The consecrated church in the present sacrificing condition.—T120.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:14. Saying: By pointing to the near fulfillment of the 2300 days. (Dan. 8:14) To the sixth angel: The Evangelical-Alliance-Spiritism movement. The Alliance proper was organized Sept. 2, 1846, at the end of the 2300 years. The spiritism feature began in January, 1848. The two have been growing towards each other ever since, until now they are substantially one and the same thing. The four angels: Four errors in the nine fundamental principles of the Evangelical Alliance. Which are bound: Hindered from gaining fullest expression. River Euphrates: The world of mankind.—B208, D24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:15. The four angels: The four great errors of trinity, incarnation, immortality and lordship over God’s heritage. Were loosed: Given greater liberties than ever before. Which were prepared. Each sect for itself, and in its own time. For the hour: The hour of judgment, 1918. Month and year: Thirteen symbolic months, the 390 years of Protestantism's siege of the Papacy. (Ezek. 4:5) For to slay: To make nominal Christians of, to take away the manhood of. Third part of men: The total number of Christians in the world at the beginning of the twentieth century was 571400,000, of whom one-third, 177,300,000, were Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">9:16. And the number: In round numbers, at the time of identification. Heard the number: Heard, heeded, or noted, the count as given in the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font11"> Almanac, as correct.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">11:8. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Lie in the street: </span><span class="font11">France, then the very heart of Christendom, regarded as one of the most thoroughly Christian nations in the world: the nation which for a thousand years had been one of the chief bulwarks of Papacy. (D531) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the great city: </span><span class="font11">Babylon, Christendom. (D608; Rev. 14:8; 16:19; 17:9, 18; 18:2, 10, 16, 18, 19, 21) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Is called Sodom: </span><span class="font11">“Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed.” “Remember Lot’s wife.” (D607, 608; Rev: 17 5; Isa. 1:9, 10; 3:8, 9; Jer. 23:14; Ezek. 16:48, 41) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And Egypt: </span><span class="font11">Type of the world of mankind, full of vain philosophies, ignorant of the true light.

In another aspect France is identified with the death of the Lord. Anything done to the least of one of the Lord’s little ones is counted as done to himself. (Acts 9:4, 5; 22:7, 8;</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">26:14, 15) A plot was laid in France to destroy all the Protestants; and on Aug. 24, 1572, sixty thousand were murdered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:9. Of the people: The Protestant people. And nations: Of other parts of Europe. Their dead body: As if though silenced in death they were witnesses still.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:10. Upon the earth: The people of France, then infidels, without any hopes except for the present poor earth-life. Rejoice over them: Literally fulfilled when the Assembly proscribed the Scriptures. Gifts one to another: Literally fulfilled, the gifts being expressions of joy. (Neh. 8:10, 12; Esth. 9:19, 22) Prophets tormented: By continuing to proclaim the coming reign of Christ and his church. Dwelt on the earth: The classes whose hopes and destinies are earthly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:11. Three days and an half: Three years and one-half. Entered into them: In a symbolic sense they were “raised from the dead.” (Ezek. 37:5, 9, 13, 14) Stood upon their feet: See Ezek. 37:10. “In 1793, a decree passed the French Assembly suppressing the Bible. Just three years after, a resolution was introduced into the Assembly superseding the decree, and giving toleration to the Scriptures. That resolution lay on the table six months, when it was taken up, and passed without a dissenting vote.” Pear fell upon them: “Nothing but the appalling results of the rejection of the Bible could have induced France to take her hands off these witnesses.” The French Revolution is divinely provided as a picture of events now at hand, and we therefore expected the three and a half years of proscription of the truth, from the spring of 1918 to the fall of 1921, which has already begun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:12. A great voice: The voice last referred to—the Lord Jesus, the “voice,” the “Word,” of the heavenly Father. Come up hither: “The two witnesses of God, the Old and New Testaments, ascended to heaven, the place of honor and power, as the Scriptures symbolically represent the matter.” (Z.’15-199) To heaven: Nearly all the great Bible societies were established between 1803 and 1817, shortly after the close of the Reign of Terror. (C51) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In a cloud: </span><span class="font11">In a time of trouble. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Enemies beheld them: </span><span class="font11">As the enemies of the Word of God were compelled by the stern logic of events to consent to its restoration in the French time of trouble, so the Lord’s enemies, and the enemies of his church, will be compelled to submit to the reign of truth when their forces have been exhausted in the Battle of the great Day of God Almighty.—Luke 19:27; Isa. 54:11-17.</span></p>

(1 Kings 19:11, 12; Z. ’98-207, 208) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Part of the city: </span><span class="font11">The French part of Christendom; one of the ten toes of the image seen by Nebuchadnezzar; one of the ten horns of Daniel’s beast and John’s dragon. (Dan. 2:41-43; 7:24: Rev. 12:3) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seven </span><span class="font11">thousand: Seven thousand titles of men were abolished in that revolution. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Were affrighted: </span><span class="font11">Their work filled France with such scenes of blood, carnage, and horror as made even the infidels themselves tremble, and stand aghast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:14. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The second woe is past: </span><span class="font11">It is described in detail in Rev. 9:14-21. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The third woe: </span><span class="font11">The reign of the Lord begun, with its attendant upset of the present order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">11:15. And the seventh angel: Our </span><span class="font11">Lord, by his servant, Pastor Russell. See Rev. 3:14; 10:7. Sounded: The seventh trumpet, the trump of God, the last trump, the Jubilee trump of knowledge and liberty: it began soon after 1874 and will continue to the end of the Millennium. (A315, B146, 197, D601) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Great voices: </span><span class="font11">The widespread message </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">present truth, declaring the second presence of the Lord, particularly the volunteer literature, distributed in 1902. In heaven: In the symbolical heavens, the nominal church. (Z.’02-118, 119) For ever and ever: The end of the Millennium does not terminate the activities of the Christ.—Z.’80-12-2; Rev. 5:13; Dan. 2 :44; 7:14, 18, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:16. And the elders: The prophecies pertaining to the kingdom of God. (Rev. 4:10) Which sit before God: See Rev. 4:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:17. O Lord God Almighty: Represented in Christ. All things are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font11"> the Father, and all things are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">by</span><span class="font11"> the Son, his honored representative. (D624) Which art, and wast: See Rev. 1:4. Thy great power: “Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.” (Z.’02-12) And hast reigned: In a sense from 1878; actually, from 1914.—B87.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:18. And the nations: As a consequence of the reign begun. (D623) Were angry: Implying contention, world-wide war. (N.’04-2-21) They became so angry that they began to destroy each other even before their lease of power had expired. (Z.’14-328) Agitated with conflicting ideas, voices, theories and threats. (Z.’96-6) In the great time of trouble. (A324, 1579) Not converted at the time of the second advent, as many expect will be the case. (A94, B101) Judging the dead: The dead world of mankind. Is come: “God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness.” (Z.’02-117) The prophets: Who are therefore without their rewards until Christ’s second advent. (Heb. 11:39, 40) And to the saints: Who are therefore to be resurrected during the harvest time. (C234) Small and great: All other classes of believers, past, present and future. Destroying the corrupters of earth: The papal and protestant sects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">11:19. Temple of God: The true church. (1 Cor. 3:16) In heaven above: Revealed as in the ascendency over the nominal ecclesiastical heavens. Seen in his temple: Clearly revealed to his church. The ark: The repository of the sacred and hidden things of Revelation and Ezekiel. Testament of God: The secret—“the finished mystery.” (Psa. 25:14; Col. 1:27; Rev. 14:17; 16:1, 17) Were lightnings: Diffusions of knowledge. (Z.’83-7-8) And voices: Contentions for knowledge and liberty. (B146) And thun-derings: Symbol of controversy. (Z.’84-l-5) An earthquake: Social revolution. (A336) And great hail: Hard, distressing truth.—A303.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:1. A great wonder: Sign, Greek. (Rev. 1:1) In heaven: In the power of spiritual control. (A318; Eph. 2:4-6; Phil. 3:20) A woman: The early church, nominal Zion (D591) originally a chaste virgin. (2 Cor. 11:2; Matt. 9:15; 22:2; John 3:29 ; Eph. 5 :25, 32) Clothed with the sun: Resplendent in the full, clear light of the unclouded Gospel. (D591) Moon under her feet: The law which supports her is not the source of her light. Of twelve stars: Her divinely appointed and inspired teachers, the twelve apostles, the apostolic lights. (D544) Typified by the twelve w’ells of water at Elim. (Z.’07-184) A limited number: it is a great mistake for popes and bishops to regard themselves as successors of the apostles—stars also.— D594, E225.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:2. Being with child: As a result of the mystery of iniquity which was working within her. (2 Thes. 2:7) Travailing in birth: Felt the weight of the burden even in apostolic days. (Rev. 2:2) To be delivered: The birth of the Antichrist from the early church was a counterfeit of the birth of Christ from the virgin Mary.—John 16:21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:3. Wonder in heaven: Among the ecclesiastical powers of the same epoch. Great red dragon: Pagan Rome. (B288) Having seven heads: See Dan. 7:7, 20; Rev. 13:1; 17:3, 9-12; 5:6; 1 Sam. 2:10; Deut. 33:17; 1 Ki. 22:11. And ten horns: The five potential races in the East were the Greeks, Lombards, Ostrogoths. Heruli and Vandals; in the West, the Franks, Britons, Saxons, Visigoths and Suevi. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Crowns upon his heads: </span><span class="font11">In the Eastern Empire, corresponding to the present Turkey and the Balkans, and in Lombardy, corresponding to the present Austria, we may see the two horns which remained of the five Eastern powers after the Ostrogoths, Heruli and Vandals disappeared. And in the Visigothic Kingdom, corresponding to Spain; Suevia, corresponding to Portugal; the Kingdom of the Franks, corresponding to France and the Netherlands; Saxonia, corresponding to Germany and Scandinavia; and Brittania. corresponding to Great Britain, we may see the five horns which represented the five western powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">12:4. And his tail: </span><span class="font11">Constantine, last </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">the Roman emperors to maintain his capital at Rome. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The third part: </span><span class="font11">He called a council of all the bishops, numbering over 1000. Only a </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">third</span><span class="font11"> (384) came. But even they were unable to agree.

<p><span class="font11">peror’s power, was declared to </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be the </span><span class="font11">Christian faith. Thus was the mystery of trinity enshrined by a heathen emperor, not baptized—not even sprinkled. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Stars of heaven: </span><span class="font11">False stars, “wandering stars,” man-ordained lights of the nominal heavens. (D595) There the bishops became substitutes for the true apostolic stars. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To the earth: </span><span class="font11">The effort to gain favor with the world caused the teachers to lose their positions as light-bearers to the true church. (Z.’79-12-2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the dragon: </span><span class="font11">Imperial </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Rome. Before the woman: The </span><span class="font11">early Christian church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Devour her child: </span><span class="font11">Absorb it, make it a subordinate feature of the Roman system of government. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Soon as It was born: </span><span class="font11">As soon as the development of the clergy class made it impossible for them to be retained longer in the true church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:5. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">She brought forth: </span><span class="font11">In </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A. </span><span class="font11">D. 325. (Z.’79-12-2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A man child: </span><span class="font11">The Man of Sin, the Papacy. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To rule all nations: </span><span class="font11">During the dark ages. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Unto God: </span><span class="font11">To be a mighty one, the pope. (C40) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And to his throne: </span><span class="font11">Authority, rulership—as Christ’s vicegerent.—A92; B314; Dan. 7 :25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12 :6. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the woman: </span><span class="font11">The true church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Into the wilderness: </span><span class="font11">Into solitude, an outcast because of fidelity to the truth and the Lord. (B329) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">She hath a place: </span><span class="font11">“The secret place of the Most High.” (Psa. 91: 1) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">That they: </span><span class="font11">The antitypical ravens that fed the Elijah class. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Feed her there: </span><span class="font11">As Elijah was fed in the wilderness. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1260 days: “A </span><span class="font11">time, times and an half a time.” (C64) Fulfilled in 1260 literal years. (B91) Typified by Elijah’s 3% years in the wilderness, in which there was no rain.— B256.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:7. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">War in heaven: </span><span class="font11">Between the two ecclesiastical powers, pagan Rome and papal Rome. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Michael: </span><span class="font11">“Who as God,” the pope. (B275; C62) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And </span><span class="font11">his </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">angels: </span><span class="font11">The bishops. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With the dragon: </span><span class="font11">Attempted to get the temporal power away from the civil rulers. (Rev. 2:12) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The dragon fought: </span><span class="font11">Did everything possible to circumscribe the growing power of the Papacy.— B288; Kev. 12:3; 20:2; Z.’79-10-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:8. Prevailed not: The Papacy cam; out of the contest victorious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:9. Dragon was cast out: Verses 9 to 12 contain the rejoicings of the Papacy over their triumph. Called the devil: Rome, which, because of its bloody persecutions, certainly has been the most devilish of all governments. (A258) Deceiveth the whole world: By intimating that anybody in it except the pope has any right to say anything about how it should be run. He was cast out: We, the Papacy, are in control! Cast out with him: We, the cardinals, etc., have the positions of power once held by the priests of pagan Rome!</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:10. A loud voice: The boastful claims of the Papacy. (Z.’79-12-2) Kingdom of our God: The Papacy really believed that its exaltation to power was the exaltation of the kingdom of God in the earth. Power of his Christ: The pope really believes he is the vicar of Christ. Is cast down: It seemed to the Papacy that in undermining and supplanting Imperial Rome they had gained a great victory for Christ. Which accused them: Pagan Rome truthfully accused the Papacy of lying, simony, murder, adultery, and every crime on the calendar.—Rev. 2 :13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:11. Gained the victory: This is the way it looks to Catholics even to this day. Blood___of the Lamb: “By this sign [the</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">cross] conquer!” was the crusaders’ standard. Statements of their witnesses: But not by the testimony of history or of God’s Word, both of which show that “their testimony” (i.e., the testimony of the Papacy, in the forged decretals and otherwise) was one of continuous lies. (Dan. 11:27) Their lives loved they not: This was the Catholic viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:12. Ye heavens: Catholic heavens— popes, bishops and prelates. Are resident in them: “The under-priests of Papacy, not parts or members of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font11"> church or</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">hierarchy, but called ‘brothers’ ” &nbsp;(B303)</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Woe to the earth: It seemed to the Papacy as though the Millennium, and the great time of trouble which the Scriptures everywhere show is to precede it, were just at hand. (Rev. 7:1) Devil is come down: The papal thought that pagan Rome was a good representative of the devil is quite right; and the Scriptures return the compliment. Having wrath: Being very greatly angered at Papacy’s aggressions. His time is short: Had Papacy been able to bring it about it would surely, in time, have deprived all the rulers of the world of every particle of civil, social, ecclesiastical and financial power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:13. When the dragon: The civil powers of the old Roman Empire, under the control of the Papacy. Cast unto the earth: Deprived of the superstitious reverence now almost wholly absorbed by the Papacy. See B337, 338. He persecuted: Not on his own account, but under the orders and instructions and encouragements of the Papacy, and to win papal approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:14. And to the woman: The true church. Given the two wings: Old and New Testaments. Of the great eagle: Symbol of wisdom. (Rev. 4:7) “I bare you on eagle’s wings, and brought you unto myself.” (Ex. 19 :4; Deut. 32:11, 12) Into the wilderness: The place deserted, away from the world. (Z.’79-12-2) She is nourished: By divinely provided means, of which almost no records have been permitted to survive the ravages of papal persecution. A time, etc.: 1260 years. A. D. 539 to 1799. From: Safe from. The serpent: Satan himself, the real instigator of all persecutions from the Lord’s time even until now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:15. Out of his mouth: At the time of the French Revolution. Water as a flood: A great flood of truth regarding priestcraft and kingcraft. After the woman: The protesting church of God. To be carried away: &nbsp;&nbsp;Overwhelmed by the anarchy</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">which he expected would result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:16. And the earth: Order-loving peo-</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ple</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">pie. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Swallowed up: </span><span class="font11">Absorbed.—C65.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">12:17. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Dragon was wroth: </span><span class="font11">This will apply with great force shortly. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Remnant of her seed: </span><span class="font11">Not of the apostasy. (Z.’79-12-2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Commandments of God: </span><span class="font11">“The law is fulfilled in us.” (Rom. 8:4) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Have the testimony: </span><span class="font11">Have his word as the man of our counsel.—Rev. 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">13:1. Sand of the sea: The sea repre</span><span class="font11">sents the masses not under religious restraint. It is this symbolic sea that is to overturn and swallow up every system of iniquity in the great time of trouble. The proper undertanding of the vision is located down at the edge of this sea, near the time of trouble. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And I saw a beast: </span><span class="font11">The</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Antichrist, that Wicked One, the Man of Sin, the Mystery of Iniquity, the Son of Perdition, the Abomination of Desolation, the Little Horn, the Papacy. (B272. 277, S33) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Up out of the sea: </span><span class="font11">See Rev. 17:15; Psa. 65:7; 93:3, 4; Isa. 57: 20. At the time of Papacy’s birth the masses of the Roman people had ceased to have reverence for the ancient mythology of pagan Rome. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Having ten horns: </span><span class="font11">See Rev. 12:3; Dan. 7: 7, 20; Rev. 17:3, 9-12; 5:6; 1 Sam. 2:10;</span></p>

The bear hugs its prey to death with its paws. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Mouth of lions: </span><span class="font11">Papacy had a mouth of this sort; i.e., it claimed to be the kingdom over all kingdoms by divine right, the kingdom of God, which was to break in pieces and consume all others— a strong mouth. (Z.’79-12-2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the dragon: </span><span class="font11">Imperial Rome, represented by Constantine. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Gave him his power: </span><span class="font11">Gave the Papacy the power of pagan Rome.

Truth shall fall in the streets. (Isa. 59: 14) Righteousness will be unable to enter under the stress of the new order of things.

As Papacy established the priesthood over the church, so Protestantism has established the same, and there is no opportunity for the body to edify itself, every joint taking part.

(Z.'04-212) “To us the Scriptures indicate that the prosperity of the federated protestant ‘image’ will for a little time be so great, so pronounced, and its arrogance become so great, that the sympathy of the masses will be entirely alienated and turned into bitterness.” (Z.’10-309) “It may be objected that the church would have no part in the killing of their fellow worshippers, but ecclesiastics themselves have a better understanding of the ecclesiastical mind and ecclesiastical conscience. The following is from the pen of the Rt. Rev. Chas. D. Williams, Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Michigan: “ ‘It is an appalling thought that the Church should have bad a part in the crime of Calvary, and yet it did, and that the chief part. The ecclesiastical mind is a closed mind— and there is nothing it resents so much as being pried open to receive a new idea.’ ” (Z.’15-339) Tyndale and some of the others interested in the Bible suffered martyrdom, as enemies of the ‘apostolic bishops,’ and their creeds and institutions.—Z.’15-253.</span></p>

Politicians will quickly realize that their bread is buttered on that side, and be ready to enact legislation of any kind desired by the Federation.” (Z.’06-6) “The church nominal, in her false position would be anxious to stifle the reproofs and to destroy the reprovers, and the effect would be that the civil power would be induced to pass such legislation as would restrain the liberty of the faithful ones and hinder them from public utterances;—as John was hindered by imprisonment. Herodias’ daughter (united Protestantism) will become the tool for the destruction of the most loyal servants of God.” (Z.’98-95) Give him a mark: Of fear, sympathy or worship. (D623) In their right hand: By giving support with their influence and means : By contrast with Ex. 13:9; 28:26-38; Deut. 6:8; Z.’07-265; Rev. 7:3; 14:1; Ezek. 9:4-6. In their forehead: Intellects.

(Z.'80-1-2) That had the mark: The Evangelical or “orthodox” stamp of approval. (Z.’95-177) Of the beast: Protestants affiliated with the Federal Council of Churches—already “marked,” stamped O.

<p><span class="font11">13:18. Here is wisdom: Scope of ingenuity. Number of a man: The Man of Sin, the Papacy. (Rev. 19:20; 2 Thes. 2:3) “Here is scope for ingenuity. Let people of shrewd intelligence calculate the number of the wild beast; for it indicates a certain man, and his number is 666.” (Weymouth) Six hundred threescore and six: In the Greek this number is six hundred (represented by the Greek letter X*), plus sixty (represented by the Greek letter £’), plus six (represented by the Greek letter s’ ). On the pope’s crown in the Vatican museum is the recognized and most used title of the pope, VICARIVS FILII DEI (Vicar of the Son of God.) The word VICARIVS is on the top of the threefold crown. The word FILII is on the second circlet; and the words are made from dark, shining precious jewels. The word DEI is on the under part of the threefold crown and is made of 100 diamonds. The words VICARIVS FILII DEI are, it is said, also carved over the entrance to the Vatican. “The following extract on this point is from a work entitled The Reformation, bearing the date of 1832: ‘Mrs. A.,’ said Miss Emmons, ‘I saw a very curious fact the other day; I have dwelt upon it much, and will mention it.

(T18) And in his hand: The Lord is to be present as reaper during the time of harvest of the Gospel age, as typified by his presence as reaper during the time of harvest of the Jewish age.

<p><span class="font11">14 :16. That sat on the cloud: The Lord Jesus, during his Parousia, overruling and withholding the time of trouble. Earth was reaped: Reading verses 13-16 connectedly, we note that the resurrection of the sleeping saints is recorded, and is immediately followed by the harvest. This suggests that the harvest began in 1878.</span></p>

The great winepress: “The fruitage of the true Vine is love, and is precious to the Father; but the fruitage of the Vine of the earth is selfishness in various forms, and will be ultimately gathered into the great winepress of the wrath of God in the great time of trouble with which this age will close.” (F207; Rev. 19:15) “Though controversy and words of passion and arguments will be and are among the weapons used in this battle, especially in the beginning of it, yet it will not end with these. Every prophetic detail indicates that before it ends it will be most sanguinary, a fierce and terrible storm.”—D539; Jer. 25:26-38; Isa. 63:1-6.</span></p>

And the winepress: The work that will squeeze the juice out of the '“abominations of the earth.” Was trodden: First trodden—made ready for other “feet.” “The treading of the winepress is the last feature of harvest work. The reaping and gathering is all done first.” (D18) Without: At a distance from. The city: The I.B.S.A. Bethel, Lord’s appointed center for the harvest work. See Rev. 19: 15. And blood: Teachings which though truthful will be death-dealing and seem “bloody” (repulsive) to sectarianism. “And blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles” is a parenthetical clause. Without this parenthesis the verse reads: “And the winepress was trodden without the city by the distance of a thousand and two hundred furlongs.” The winepress: The exposition of the prophecies of Revelation and Ezekiel. The horse bridles: So deep as to strangle and drown the old false doctrinal hobbies so long ridden. Sectarianism will be the universal laughing-stock. Hundred furlongs: A furlong or stadium is 606% English ft.; 1200 stadii are 137.9 miles. The work on the prophe-</span></p>

We did not see that the Judgment Day is a day of “assurance to all men.”—Acts 17:31; Rom. 5:18; John 12:31, 47; 1 Tim. 5:24; 1 Cor. 11:31; 1 Pet. 4:17; Rom. 14:13; Matt. 7:1, 6, 15, 16; Prov. 15:3; Ecc. 12:14; Psa. 90:4; 2 Pet. 3:7, 8; Gen. 2:4; Heb. 3:8; 2 Cor. 6:2; Luke 12: 14; Acts 5:31; Judges 3:9; Isa. 1:26; 1 Cor. 6:2; Rev. 20:6; Isa. 2:4; 11:4; 26:9; 2 Thes. 1:7; Isa. 65:17; 1 Cor. 15:25; 1 Chron. 16: 31; Psa. 96:13; 98:1-9; 72:1-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15:5. And after that: </span><span class="font11">Another vision of the same thing. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the tabernacle: </span><span class="font11">Pastor Russell was given a clear, beautiful, complete comprehension of the plan of God as revealed in the Tabernacle arrangements and sacrifices. (Acts 7:44) This is the foundation of all his works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15:6. Out of the temple: The seven volumes of Scripture Studies emerged, all in harmony with the teachings of the Tabernacle, from which they proceeded. Seven last plagues: Though counted as plagues by ecclesiasticism, they are in reality blessings, destined to rid the earth of every obnoxious thing, not the least of which are the great whore and harlots, large and small, that have defiled the earth with their unclean doctrines. (Rev. 17:5; Z.’08-119) Clothed in: Printed upon. Bright linen: White paper. A different word from that in Rev. 19:8. The word here used is suitable as describing priestly attire and refers to ministrations on this side of the vail. The Scripture Studies, are servants of the church—righteous servants, clad in the Lord’s robe. (Rev. 1:13) Having their breasts: Front covers. Girded with golden girdles: Stamped with gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15:7. The four beings: Heavenly wisdom. (Rev. 4:7; Matt. 24:25; Jas. 1:5; 3: 17; Ezek. 10:2, 7) Golden vials: The message of present truth. “The vial was the shallow bowl in which they drew from the larger goblet.” (Psa. 79:6; Jer. 10:25; Zeph. 3:8) Wrath of God: Against all untruth, injustice and selfishness in organizations, civil, social, ecclesiastical and financial. Liveth for ever: Whereas all of those are to pass away.—Rev. 4:9, 10; 10:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">15:8. And the temple: The nominal church. Filled with smoke: Confusion, as the deformities of her errors were revealed. The glory of God: The glorious harmony and beauty of present truth. (Z.’82-9-7) And no man: No person of mature thought. The large proportion of new members, now received in the various denominations is from the Sunday School. (Z.’83-6-7) Were fulfilled: Until the seven volumes of Scripture Studies were written, published and circulated. Shortly afterward the true temple will be in readiness, wherein men, women and children of all races and ages will find their hearts’ hunger satisfied.— Hag. 2:6-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:1. A great voice: Pastor Russell was the voice of the Lord thus used. (Rev. 7: 2; 10:3) Out of the temple: He was of the true temple, and “out of” the nominal temple at the time these plagues were poured out. The seven angels: The seven volumes of Scripture Studies. See Rev. 8: 2-5 and 14:17-20. Go your ways: In the original prefaces to the several volumes of Scripture Studies such expressions abound as “I send forth this volume with prayers,” “and now it is sent forth in the faith,” etc., etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:2. Into the earth: Volume I was distributed among thinking, independent Christians. Noisome sore: The book seemed to ecclesiastics like an evil and malignant ulcer, a painful, running sore, which eats, corrupts and destroys. Upon the men: Roman Catholics. And upon them: Protestants affiliated with the Federal Council of Churches.—Rev. 13:11, 13, 14, 15; 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:13; 19:20; 20:10; Matt. 24:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:3. Upon the sea: Volume II, Scripture Studies, seemed to the beast and his image to reach and affect only the discontented, those who never were very subservient to the ruler of this present evil world or any of his system. Of a dead man: After death the blood separates into a watery liquid, called serum, and a solid substance termed clot. As soon as this separation takes places the clot begins to putrefy or corrupt. Thus it seemed to worshippers of the beast and his image that anybody that would accept the teachings of Volume II would be in a hopeless condition. Died in the sea: To the worshippers of the beast and his image it seemed as though such would be lost and would surely go to hell to be tormented forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:4. Fountains of waters: It seemed to the worshippers of the beast and his image that the teachings of Volume III of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scripture Studies had contaminated the Scriptures, the waters of life, at their very source, by extending the call to people to come out of Babylon while they were busy trying to get people in. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Became blood: </span><span class="font11">Seemed repulsive, undesirable, bloody.— Z.’07-279; Ex. 7:20; Rev. 14:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:5. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Angel of the waters: </span><span class="font11">Volume III, Scripture Studies.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Art, and wast: See </span><span class="font11">Rev. 1:4; 15:3; 19:2. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The holy: </span><span class="font11">The Lord, the Holy One, was present at the time Volume III was written. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Judged thus: </span><span class="font11">Made the beautiful Harvest truths appear “bloody” to those not consecrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:6. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Shed the blood: </span><span class="font11">Literally and figuratively. (Matt. 23:34, 35; Rev. 13:15; 18: 24) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">They are worthy: </span><span class="font11">See Rev. 14:20; Isa. 49:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:7. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The altar: </span><span class="font11">The “altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt” (Isa. 19 :19) at the time these plagues are being poured out upon the antitypical Egyptians, is the Great Pyramid, discussed in a separate section of Volume III. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord God Almighty: </span><span class="font11">The Lord Jesus. (Rev. 1:8; John 5:22; Matt. 28:18) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Thy judgments are: </span><span class="font11">The teaching of the Great Pyramid is in full accord with the rest of the book. See Rev. 14:15; C315.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:8. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Upon the sun: </span><span class="font11">Volume IV of Scripture Studies, as soon as published, was sent free to all clergy whose names could be obtained. They are taught, and teach others, that they are important luminaries in the heavens, suns, rivalling in brilliancy and wisdom the Lord himself. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">To scorch men: </span><span class="font11">Greek “the men,” i.e., the ■worshippers of the beast and his image. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With fire: </span><span class="font11">Perhaps some of the clergy became a trifle warm as they read Volume IV, as their later conduct seems to suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:9. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And men: </span><span class="font11">Greek, “the men;” the clergy. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With great heat: </span><span class="font11">Became warm, indignant at the Pastor’s kindly explanation of the whore and the harlots, and the plainly evident application to Papacy and Protestantism. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The name of God: “The </span><span class="font11">Greek </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">theos</span><span class="font11"> (god) does not invariably refer to Jehovah, but signifies </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a mighty one. </span><span class="font11">In the following texts the word god </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">(theos) </span><span class="font11">is used to refer to others than the one supreme being, Jehovah—viz.:—John 10: 34, 35; Acts 7:40, 43; 17:23; 1 Cor. 8:5.” (B274) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Over these plagues: </span><span class="font11">Misrepresented the name and character of the mighty one, Pastor Russell, to whom the Lord committed the task of presenting to his church this meat in due season. This misrepresentation burst like a storm after the publication of Volume IV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:10. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the fifth: </span><span class="font11">Volume V of Studies.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Seat of the beast: </span><span class="font11">Thoroughly and scripturally analyzing the subjects of trinity, human immortality and eternal torment, the foundation of all papal doctrine, as well as constituting </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font11"> large part of the stock in trade of the protestant aggregation. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Full of darkness: </span><span class="font11">Complete ignorance of the truths on these subjects as taught in the Bible. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Gnawed their tongues: </span><span class="font11">Chewn their words.—Z.'00-148.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:11. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And blasphemed: </span><span class="font11">Continued to slander and misrepresent. (Z.’00-148) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The God of heaven: </span><span class="font11">“In token of entire allegiance to the beast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:12. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the sixth: </span><span class="font11">Volume VI of Studies in the Scriptures.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> River Euphrates: </span><span class="font11">Seemed to the worshippers of the beast and his image to be instituting a new and horrible thing, a people’s church, in which there is no place for clergy, collections, church edifices, reverence for one day above another, or in fact any of the customs cherished in the nominal church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Was dried up: </span><span class="font11">Was turned aside; the people withdrew their support. (B209: D24; Z. ’09-83; Z.’14-133; Z.'10-324; Z.’10-373) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Way of the kings: </span><span class="font11">The little flock of jointheirs with Christ. (E487) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the East: </span><span class="font11">From which comes the Sun of Righteousness. (D653) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Might be prepared: </span><span class="font11">Cyrus, who with his army overthrew literal Babylon, was a figure or Illustration of Messiah. King of kings and Lord of lords. —Isa. 41:25; 44:28; 45:1-14; Z.’09-174.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:13. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Three unclean spirits: </span><span class="font11">Denoting doctrines of demoniacal origin. (E320, 295; Matt. 10:1; Mark 1:26; Luke 4:33) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">As frogs: </span><span class="font11">The croaking of the frog spirits, or doctrines, will gather the kings and princes, financial, political, religious and industrial into one great army. The spirit of fear, inspired by the croaking, will scourge the passions of otherwise good and reasonable men to fury—desperation. In their blind following of these evil spirits, evil doctrines, they will be ready to sacrifice life and everything on what they mistakenly suppose is the altar of justice, truth and righteousness under a divine arrangement. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the dragon: </span><span class="font11">The three fundamental truths of history are man’s fall, redemption and restoration. Stated in other language these three truths are the mortal nature of man, the Christ of God and his Millennial Kingdom. Standing opposite to these Satan has placed three great untruths: human immortality, the Antichrist and humanitarianism, as that term is used to represent moralistic self-regeneration. It is this last feature of Satan’s work that is mentioned first, because it deceives more people and turns them away from the hope of the Messianic kingdom. The thought that human nature is self-perfectable has its origin in conceit, and with conceit come intolerance, hate, murder and that false patriotism which has drenched the world with blood. Of course the object has always been “the betterment of the race.” Preachment of such “humanitarianism” has persistently proceeded from the mouth of the dragon, from Babylon’s day till now. Nowhere in the New Testament is hatred of other peoples encouraged. Everywhere and always it is forbidden; and yet, under one guise or another it has been encouraged for centuries by the clergy class who </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">should</span><span class="font11"> have been preaching the message delivered to them by the Prince of Peace. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the beast: </span><span class="font11">The Antichrist doctrine of the divine right of the clergy was the primary cause of Kaiserism. This frog has been coming out of the mouth of the papal beast for sixteen centuries. The Kaiser and his ancestors were mistaught by the clergy that they reigned by God’s appointment. This has led them to justify themselves in all the devilish things they have done. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the false prophet: </span><span class="font11">The one cardinal error upon which all protestant (false prophet) sects agree is the doctrine of human immortality, the original lie told in Eden. (Gen. 2:17; 3:4) In speaking of it our Lord says: “When he speaketh </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font11">lie, he speaketh of his own.” (John 8:44, Diaglott) Speaking of it again, the Apostle Paul says, of the worshippers of the</span></p><img src="1918_rjc_E_files/1918_rjc_E-19.png" alt="" style="width:217pt;height:287pt;">
<p><span class="font11">beast and his image, “They admitted not the love of the truth that they might be saved. And on this account God will send to them an energy of delusion, to their believing </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font11"> falsehood.” (2 Thes. 2:10, 11) In each case the Greek gives the definite article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:14. Spirits of devils: See Eph. 6:12. Working miracles: It is very possible that the strongest “proof” of the immortality of man will yet be obtained by the false prophet through materializations of evil spirits, perhaps first at preachers’ meetings, and afterwards in public. We will wait and see. Meantime, the mental invasions indicated in Rev. 7:3 and 2 Thes. 2: 11 seem to have abundantly manifested themselves. To the battle: Of which the present horrible European war is only the preliminary skirmish. (Rev. 17:14: 19:19) “This battle, which will end with the complete overthrow of earth's present rulership [Satan], has already begun. The gathering of the armies is plainly visible from the standpoint of God’s Word. The sword of truth, already sharpened, is to smite every evil system and custom—civil, social and ecclesiastical. The internal conflict is already fomenting. It will ere long break forth as a consuming fire; and human systems, and errors, which for centuries have fettered truth and oppressed the groaning creation, must melt before it. Yes. truth—and widespread and increasing knowledge of it—is the sword which is perplexing and wounding the heads over many countries.” (Psa. 110:6; B101) “The Lord’s saints are not to be in this battle at all. God’s consecrated people, longing at heart for Messiah’s kingdom and the glorious year of jubilee and restitution which it will inaugurate, will patiently abide the Lord’s time, and wait unmur-muringly for it. Anarchists, socialists, and hot-headed radicals of every school of reason and unreason, will be in the forefront of that battle.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:15. I come as a thief: Without noise or other demonstration to attract attention. (B142) The Lord will be present unseen while the plagues are being poured out. (Z.’83-7-7) A thief comes unexpectedly, for the purpose of securing jewels only. (Mal. 3:17; 2 Pet. 3:10; Rev. 3.3; Matt. 24:42-44; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font11">Thes. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5:2) That watch-eth: </span><span class="font11">For the revealment, uncovering, unvailing (as of a thing previously present but hidden). The name of the last book of the Bible is from the same root— Apocalypse or Revelation. (Z.’92-92; 1 Cor. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:7; Lu. 17:29, 30) Keep-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">eth his garments: </span><span class="font11">Holds fast to his pledge of consecration even unto death. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Lest he walk naked: </span><span class="font11">As the nominal churches are doing. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">See his shame: </span><span class="font11">(Rev. 3:18) “The exposure to the world that they lack what constitutes the Christian state.”—Matt. 5: 43, 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:16. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">They gathered them: </span><span class="font11">The three unclean spirits do the gathering. (Rev. 19:19) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Together: </span><span class="font11">The very thing which they sought to avert by their union, federation, etc., will be the very thing that they will hasten. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Armagedon: </span><span class="font11">Meaning “Mount of Destruction”, indicating what will be the end of all systems of oppression when they shortly unite in one cause against the masses of the people and their liberties. (Z.’83-7-7) What we are to expect as the fulfillment of this would seem to be, that there will be some mustering of strength—some rallying of forces—some opposition made to the kingdom of God in the gospel by the powers here referred to which would be </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">decisive</span><span class="font11"> in its character. Had God lifted the vail of ignorance a thousand years sooner, the world would have lined up for Armageddon a thousand years sooner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:17. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the seventh: </span><span class="font11">Volume VII, Scripture Studies.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Upon the air: </span><span class="font11">Seemed to the clergy and their henchmen to be directed against the ruling powers. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A great voice: </span><span class="font11">An earnest and vigorous setting forth of this prophecy and that of Ezekiel. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Out of the temple: </span><span class="font11">The true church. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Saying, It is done: </span><span class="font11">See title of </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Volume VII.—</span><span class="font11">Ezek. 9:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:18. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">There were thunders: </span><span class="font11">Seven </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">them—indicating wide-spread interest in the Scripture Studies; also some thundering by the esteemed clergy. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And lightnings: </span><span class="font11">A good lighting up of the dark places of the ecclesiastical firmament. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And voices: </span><span class="font11">The “voices” of the great </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">com</span><span class="font11">pany, who, after the little flock have gone beyond, will display unparalleled energy and faithfulness amid unparalleled difficulty. (Rev. 11:15; 8:5) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A great earthquake: </span><span class="font11">The same mentioned in Rev. 8:5; 11:19 and 1 Kings 19:11, 12, following the war. For a brief time, as we understand the Scriptures, the combined forces of Armageddon will triumph. Free speech, free mails, and other liberties which have come to be the very breath of the masses in our day, will be ruthlessly shut off on the plea of </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">necessity,</span><span class="font11"> the glory of God, the commands of the church, etc. The safetyvalve will be sat upon, and thus will cease to annoy earth’s kings with the sound of escaping steam; and all will seem to be serene—until the great social explosion described in the Revelation as an </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">earthquake </span><span class="font11">will take place. In symbolic language an earthquake signifies social revolution, and the Scriptural declaration is that none like it ever before occurred. (Rev. 16:18, 19) See our Lord’s reference to it in Matt. 24: 21. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And so great: </span><span class="font11">World-wide socialism, an unprecedented and sure-to-fail experiment in government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:19. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Into three parts: </span><span class="font11">Christendom is now divided into three parts: Socialistic Russia, imperial Teutonia, and the representative governments of the West; but we think a religious division is coming: The Greek church, the Papacy and the False-Prophet-Protestant aggregation, all under papal control. Or the city of Rev. 14:20, may be meant. (2 Ki. 2:10, 12, 15) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">City of the nations: </span><span class="font11">The reference is to Rome, the “city” mentioned in Rev. 17:18. By Rome is meant the Papacy. All other kings have already drunk deeply of the wrath of God and Sheshach’s turn has come. (Jer. 25:26; Rev. 14:8) Before God: “The fall of Babylon will astonish the entire world, so complete is the illusion that Christendom represents the throne and government of Messiah among men.” Cup of the wine: Of the vine of the earth.— Rev. 14:17-20; 18:6; Isa. 51:17-20; Jer. 8: 14; 25:26-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:20. Island fled away: Even ungodly elements in republics will disappear. Mountains were not found: Every kingdom of earth will pass away, be swallowed up in anarchy. Fell upon men: Greek, “the men,” the worshippers of the beast and his image, i.e., the clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">16:21. A great hail: Truth, compacted, coming with crushing force. A concluding statement of how the seventh volume of Scripture Studies appears to the worshippers of the beast and his image. (Rev. 11:19; Isa. 28:17; 30:30; Ezek. 13:11; Joshua 10:11) Weight of a talent: 113 lbs. (Mal. 3:10) Blasphemed God: Apparently, the book will be unpopular for a time. Was exceeding great: Especially the cartoons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17:1. One of the seven angels: Volume VII, Studies in the Scriptures. The seven vials: An explanation of the plagues upon symbolic Babylon. Talked with me: The John class, the church in the flesh. Shew unto thee: In the Sth, 9th, 16th and 18th chapters of Revelation, and throughout the Book of Ezekiel. (Nahum 3:3, 4) Of the great whore: The apostate church of Rome. (A268, D25; Rev. 19:2) Upon many waters: Peoples. (B209) “O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come.”—Z.’92-59; Jer. 51:13; Rev. 17:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17:2. Fornication: “The kingdoms of Europe today claim to be Christian kingdoms, and announce that their sovereigns reign ‘by the grace of God.’ </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font11"> through appointment of either Papacy or some of the Protestant sects.” (A268; C156: Rev. 18:3, 6; Isa. 1:21; Isa. 65:4; Jer. 2:20-24; 3:6; 51:7-9; Ezek. 16:15) </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Been made </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">drunk: </span><span class="font11">Intoxicated and deceived. (C104) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With the wine: </span><span class="font11">The spirit of her erroneous doctrines. (A268, D266) The mixed doctrines, part truth and part error, that originally led to the union of church and state,—the spiritual harlotry. (Jer. 5:7; Rev . 2:20; 17:5-; 18:3; 19 :2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of her fornication: </span><span class="font11">Worldly affiliation.—C164.</span></p>

(Rev. 17:11) On the earth: All independent Christians, not entangled in the systems of either the beast or the image. See Rev. 13:13, 14. Shall wonder: Be astounded, perplexed and dismayed.

<p><span class="font11">17:9. Hath wisdom: A problem requiring the aid of the Lord. (Rev. 13:18) Are seven mountains: The kingdoms enumerated in Rev. 12:3. The following shows the physical explanation of this text which would most appeal to the unconsecrated. The common name of Rome in St. John’s day was “the seven-hilled city”. Every Latin poet of note during a period of 500 years alludes to Rome’s seven hills, and the medals and coins of the day represent Rome as a woman sitting upon seven hills. (Z.’83-4-0) The woman sitteth: Over which she once reigned in plenitude of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17:10. Seven kings: Seven forms of government of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Roman Empire,</span><span class="font11"> the devil’s own particular pattern of government. Five are fallen: (1) The Regal period, from 753 B. C. to 510 B. C. (2) The Republic, from 509 to 451 B. C. and from 448 to 60 B. C. (3) The Decemvirate, a rule of ten men, from 451 to 449 B. C. (4) The Triumvirate, a rule of three men. from 59 to 49 B. C. and from 43 to 28 B. C. (5) The Dictatorship of Caesar, 48 to 44 B. C. All of these forms of the old Holy Roman Empire have completely passed away. One is: The dragon, still represented in the warring powers of Europe. (See comments on Rev. 12:3, 4, 7, 9, 13. 16, 17; 13:2, 4, 11; 16:13) The rulership of Papacy during the dark ages, both directly in its temporal power, and through the governments which it controlled or nfluenced, and still influences, was—as aas been shown—merely another aspect of the government of pagan Rome, generally styled the empire, but in Revelation called the dragon, and the devil and Satan. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the other: </span><span class="font11">The final form of director (whatever be the official title). </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Is not yet come: </span><span class="font11">Had not, prior to March 14, 1918. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A short space: </span><span class="font11">The language is indefinite, the words “must continue” alone being emphatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17:11. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Beast that was: </span><span class="font11">That once exercised temporal dominion and, through influence of the European governments, once actually ruled the world. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And is not: </span><span class="font11">Does not now have nominal temporal dominion. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">He is the eighth: </span><span class="font11">The eighth horn which took the place of the three plucked up (Rev. 12:3); also the final form of the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">Holy Roman Empire.</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"> Is of the seven: </span><span class="font11">“Cometh of the seven,” Greek. Grew up by the plucking of the three. The Papacy is either the seventh or the eighth form, depending upon how the matter is viewed. If it be viewed as having reigned separately from the dragon during the dark ages (as it did, when it exercised temporal power), then in its new guise it is the eighth form, its separate rulership during the dark ages being counted as the seventh. But if it be viewed as having been a copartner of the dragon during the dark ages, then its latest manifestation will be the seventh form. In any event the eighth form is one of the seven forms. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Goeth into perdition: </span><span class="font11">The destruction of the remnants of the old Roman Empire is caused by the mistaken zeal of Roman Catholic secret orders and by the misleading influence of Papacy’s continued bombastic utterances, even after its dominion is gone.—C68; 2 Thes. 2:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">17:12. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The ten horns: </span><span class="font11">Three of which were originally plucked up to make room for the growth of the Papacy.

<p><span class="font11">17:14. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">War with the Lamb: </span><span class="font11">Endeavor to suppress the message of present truth.

Her consecration is unto death, and her privilege is to prove her faithfulness.” (Matt. 10: 24, 25) Although the exact time of the deliverance or “change” of the last members of the body of Christ is not stated, the approximate time is nevertheless clearly manifest, as shortly after the “door” is shut. (Matt. 25:10; C231) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">King of kings: </span><span class="font11">Has the entire situation under perfect control—is the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">real</span><span class="font11"> pope. (1 Tim. 6:15; Rev. 19:16) This presentation in the harvest of the Gospel age was typified by the triumphal entry into Jerusalem in the harvest of the Jewish age.

When they hear, understand and heed the message of complete consecration even unto death. (Rev. 19:9) This clause, in the Greek, indicates that these also, as well as the Lamb, shall overcome them. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And chosen: </span><span class="font11">Elected as soon as they comply with the conditions, provided there are any vacancies. Adopted as sons of God, after they have first received the spirit of adoption at the time of their consecration. “Many are called, but few are chosen,” because few of the justified make the necessary covenant of consecration. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And faithful: </span><span class="font11">The “door of opportunity to engage, with Christ our Lord, in the work of the Gospel age, will be closed when ‘the night cometh wherein no man can work.’ And all who have not previously, by faithful service, developed the necessary character and proved their sympathy, devotion, love and zeal for the Lord and his truth (Matt. 10:37; Mark 8:38), will then be too late to do so. The great company class is called and chosen but is not sufficiently </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">faith full</span><span class="font11"> to win the great reward.”-—Z.’07-315.</span></p>

And his bride: The one who is to bear his new name.

Supper of the Lamb: The Marriage Supper (Luke 14:15) will be like all the other feasts the church has had, not of physical food, but of truths divine. That will be the time when the Lord, the Head of the family, will explain to us every part of every verse in all his holy Word. We shall have perfect memories then, in which to treasure every word he utters, and perfect bodies, too, in which to perform to the full all God’s holy will.

This utter destruction of these systems is the beginning of the annihilation of everything out of harmony with God’s righteous arrangements. It was typified by the valley of Gehenna, just outside of Jerusalem. By the aid of brimstone the bodies of specially detestable criminals were there burned with the other refuse of Jerusalem. Standing upon the edge of this valley at night it had the appearance of a lake burning with fire and brimstone. Burning brimstone is the most deadly agent known, and symbolizes utter destructiveness.— Dan. 7:11.</span></p>

Here is a system of superstition and crime two thousand years old, and the praise and service of it ingrained into nearly every human being. All literature is poisoned with it. Public opinion is for it. The educated, the refined, the wealthy, the powerful, are all for it and all against any change that would give the lower strata of society a fair chance. To overcome conditions like this is a task for divinity itself. And a great chain: The TRUTH, as contained in the Seven Volumes of Scripture Studies. This chain of truth has been forged, link by link, over a period of forty years. Each volume has made it more certain that old systems can never hope to stand against it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">C57) “Those who lived next to the apostles, and the whole church for 300 years, understood the ‘thousand years’ in the plain literal sense.” According to Jewish theology, as collected from the Talmud, Messiah is to gather in from the dispersion all the scattered descendants of the tribes, to discomfit their foreign oppressors, and from Jerusalem as a centre to rule over the whole earth, which is to be a scene of temporal enjoyment and prosperity. Thus R. Salomon writes: “It is fixed that the world shall stand for 6000 years, according to the number of the days of the week; but on the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">seventh,</span><span class="font11"> day is the sabbath, and during the </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">seventh</span><span class="font11"> Millennium the world has rest.” The year A.

(Acts 16:6, 9) The Gospel was sent into Europe that it might be demonstrated that God could call and make into Christlike characters representatives of even the most cruel, bloodthirsty, quarrelsome, rapacious people on earth. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Together to battle: </span><span class="font11">All armed with complete knowledge and experience and hence fully able to stand the test.

(A303) Who have even sympathy for sin, though outwardly obedient. (D645) Typified by the Jew who offered a peace offering and then touched an unclean thing. (T98) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Compassed: </span><span class="font11">“Just as in Great Britain, the people have gone to Parliament to protest, so the rebellious faction </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">mankind will protest against their faithful princes.” </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The camp: </span><span class="font11">“The separation of the ancient worthies from the rest of the world seems to imply that God has some special purpose in respect to them. The term camp itself implies that theirs is only a temporary condition or arrangement, and that God has some better thing in store for them.” (Z.’13-53) St. Stephen said that God never gave Abraham so much as a foot of the promised land (Acts </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">7:5); </span><span class="font11">but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font11">implied that Abraham will </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">yet</span></p>

(Z. ’82-3-8) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Holy city Jerusalem: </span><span class="font11">Christ’s government, the established kingdom of God, typified by natural Jerusalem. (A296, D25, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">H23) Out of heaven: </span><span class="font11">If we went up </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font11">heaven, it would not be found there. If Rev. 21 is to be literally interpreted, then the whole surface of Palestine is far from sufficient to hold a city of this size. Besides, its height, length and breadth were to be equal.—Rev. 21:2.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">21:14. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Twelve foundations: </span><span class="font11">An apostle would in the divine plan and order have a larger importance than any other “living stone” as a “petros” is larger than a “lithos.” “He looked for a city which hath foundations.” (Z.’79-9-4) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The twelve apostles: </span><span class="font11">“The apostles whom he had chosen.” (F204) Typified by the twelve sons </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font11">Jacob.

<p><span class="font11">21:19. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Precious stones: </span><span class="font11">The Lord’s jewels, represented by the twelve jewels worn in the high priest’s breastplate. (T36) In selecting and polishing the 144,000 gems and putting them in place in the temple God is preparing a beautiful harmony of characters in infinite variety that will delight the hearts of all his creatures to all eternity. (1 Chron. 29:2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Was jasper: </span><span class="font11">Likeness to the Father. See comments on Rev. 4:3. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Second, sapphire: </span><span class="font11">Faithfulness. The modern lapiz lazuli, or azure stone, of fine blue color, which has the appearance of being spotted with gold dust. (Job 28: 6) The brilliant spots in the deep blue matrix invite comparison -with the stars in the firmament. The crystals form into units having twelve equal sides. The blue is the color of faithfulness, the gold sho-ws the faithfulness towards God; the star-like appearance shows the faithfulness towards all the heavenly beings—angels, archangels, and the great company: the crystalline formation shows the faithfulness towards the symbolical and actual twelve tribes of Israel, w’hich, in the last analysis, include all who shall become heirs of salvation. Those who gain the prize of the high calling can be trusted. (1 Cor. 4:2; Luke 16:10-12) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Third, a chalcedony: </span><span class="font11">Obedience; Submission. A green quartz, found in the copper mines of Chalcedon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">It crystallizes in the twelve-sided and twenty-four sided forms of cubic crystalline formation. In the twelve-sided crystals each side is a surface of five equal sides and angles. The church’s obedience is perfect towards God as indicated in the faces of the crystals, five being a symbol of Divinity. It is operative towards the brethren as in the twelve-faced crystals, and towards both phases of the kingdom,</span></p><img src="1918_rjc_E_files/1918_rjc_E-23.png" alt="" style="width:218pt;height:294pt;">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">FOUNDATION STONES</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">as in the twenty-four-sided crystals. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Fourth, an emerald: </span><span class="font11">Deathlessness. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">One </span><span class="font11">of the most beautiful of gems, of a bright green color without any mixture, crystallizing in long, hexagonal (six-sided) crystals. The stone loses color when strongly heated. From those originally imperfect (as shown in the six-sided crystals) God is creating a race of deathless ones. Nevertheless, though begotten to the divine nature, should they cling to the dross of their fleshly natures too determinedly, so great fires may be applied to burn away the dross as will destroy the value of the gem. This gem, too, represents the church’s power to bestow life upon the dead world. The crystals may be broken or split crosswise. The everlasting life for the world, which may be made continuous, is nevertheless susceptible of being broken off at any time for disobedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">21:20. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The fifth, sardonyx: </span><span class="font11">Humility; purity; martyrdom. An ornamental stone much used for seals and cameos. It was considered by ancient oriental authorities that a fine oriental sardonyx should have at least three strata, a black base, a white intermediate center, and a superficial layer of red; these colors typifying the three cardinal virtues—humility, black; chastity, white; modesty or martyrdom, red. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Sixth, sardius: </span><span class="font11">Loyalty to Christ. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font11">reddish stone much used by the ancients as a gem stone; it has been in all ages the commonest of the stones used by the gem engraver. (Rev. 4:3) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seventh, chrysolyte: </span><span class="font11">Heavenly Wisdom. Greek, </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">chrysos,</span><span class="font11"> gold, and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">lithos,</span><span class="font11"> stone. The meaning of the term makes it the golden stone. It is a gem of a golden color, lightly tinted with green. It is very transparent. “The wisdom that is from above is first pure.” (Jas. 3:17) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Eighth, beryl: </span><span class="font11">Love of the Father. A pellucid gem of a bluish green color, much prized as a gem stone by the ancients. It crystallizes in the hexagonal system, with sixty-six sides of various sizes and shapes. On each of the six principal sides are diamond-shaped marks, alternately five and eight marks to a side, with four marks at the end. The sixty-six sides represent the sixty-six books of the Bible; the two ends represent the Old and New Testaments; the diamond-shaped marks represent the heavenly Father; the three groups of eight each represent the twenty-four prophecies of the kingdom; five is a symbol of Divinity, and four represents Justice, Power, </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Wisdom and Love. Ninth, topaz: Benevo</span><span class="font11">lence. The modern “noble olivine.” It is </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">dark, decidedly green-colored mineral. It crystallizes in twenty-six-sided figures. In some views—i.e., when the great company or the classes that are to be destroyed are taken into consideration—the tribes of Israel number thirteen; and when Spiritual and Fleshly Israel are considered separately, the total number is twenty-six. It is not the wish of the heavenly Father that any of these should perish, and it is the wish of the church to do all humanly and divinely possible to save the unworthy from the final consequences of their own wilfulness. This spirit will be exercised to the last limit of love. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Tenth, chrysoprasus: </span><span class="font11">Constant, cheerful endurance. The modern chrysoberyl is a yellow or green gem stone, remarkable for its hardness, being exceeded in this respect only by the diamond and the jacinth. It is not infrequently cloudy, due to microscopic cavities. The hardness signifies ability to “endure hardness as good soldiers,” and the clouds signify difficulties, troubles, to be overcome. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Eleventh, jacinth: </span><span class="font11">Unchangeableness. The modern sapphire, next to the diamond in hardness; </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font11">beautiful blue stone. Many of the crystals are parti-colored, the blue being distributed in patches in a colorless stone; but by skilful cutting the deep-colored portion may be caused to impart color to the entire gem. This stone crystallizes in the most beautiful and wonderful pattern conceivable, consisting of a six-sided pyramid at either end, separated by three different sets of surfaces of six each and two different sets of surfaces of three each. We may think of the two ends as representing the teachings of the twelve apostles, and the twenty-four surfaces between as representing the twenty-four elders (prophecies pertaining to the kingdom of God). God is unchangeable, although the different operations of his plan, in different ages, make him seem changeable to mankind. But the perfected plan will be the adoration of all his creatures. This gem also shows how God can take characters whose conduct may have been very irregular, and by skilful cutting make them copies of himself. Twelfth, an amethyst: Royalty. A stone of a violet color, bordering on purple, composed of a strong blue and a deep red. The name is derived from the Greek </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font11"> not, and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">methyskein,</span><span class="font11"> to intoxicate, expressing the old belief that the stone protected its owner from strong drink. It was held that wine drunk out of a cup of amethyst would not intoxicate. It crystallizes in double pyramids (base to base) of three sides on each pyramid. Amethyst was Pastor Russell's birth-stone; and behold how perfect its application ’ He was true blue in his faithfulness, and fully loyal to the blood of Christ, as shown by the red. He has the royalty now, thank God I The cup which he poured never intoxicated with error those who drank its life-giving draughts from the fountain of all truth, our Father’s Word. The six-sided crystallization represents his six volumes of Scripture Studies, and the Seventh, a summary of all, represents the stone as a whole. There are over ninety varieties of crystals in nature. Surely &quot;the fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.”</span></p>

Was of one pearl: “The peculiar lustre of a pearl is dependent on the fact that the surface is not perfectly smooth, but covered with the Irregularly sinuous edges of innumeraole layers of inconceivable thinness, deposited one over the other.

The successive layers are the additions made to it, “precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little and there a little.” (Isa. 28:13) Street of the city: There will be but one street in that city, the street which has been in process of construction throughout the age. The prophets tell us of it.—Prov. 16:17; Isa. 40:3; 49:11; 35:8; 62:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">21:22. No temple therein: No special place of worship, for the use and benefit of the little flock. Are the temple of it: The bride’s whole life is completely wrapped up in the Father and the Son. Her one consuming wish is to glorify the Lord’s dear name. Of what need is any special place of worship for one who can say, “For to me to live is [for] Christ [to live] ?”—Phil. 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">21:23. And the city: The glorious kingdom class. (Z.’01-201, 2) No need of the sun: The preaching of the Gospel. Neither of the moon: Light of the Mosaic law. (D590) Did lighten it: The church will be so filled -with the glory of God that from her, as the sun of righteousness, shall proceed the light of the glory of God which shall heal and bless the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">21:24. Nations shall walk: As parts of the only holy nation, the kingdom of God. (Z.’97-304; Z.’16-394; Isa. 60:3, 5) By the light thereof: Receive the light which the church gives. “Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun”. “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” (Z.’79-8-6) And the kings: Particularly the ancient worthies, “Princes in all the earth.” When mankind reach perfection at the close of the Millennial age, they will be given the entire control of earth as at first designed—each man a sovereign, a king. (A296) Do bring: In this verse the ancient worthies are </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">directly</span><span class="font11"> referred to; while in verse 26 the rest of mankind are referred</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">to. Notice the tenses of the verbs &quot;do bring” and </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">‘‘shall</span><span class="font11"> bring”—present and future—in the Millennium and after. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Then-glory into it: </span><span class="font11">Acknowledging the heavenly kingdom with tributes of praise, thanks, worship and obedience to it as God’s agency.—Z.’01-202.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">21:25. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the gates: </span><span class="font11">The ancient worthies, through w-hose instrumentality all may enter the kingdom. (Z.’92-16) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">By day: </span><span class="font11">Throughout the long Millennial day of a thousand years all who will may seek and find salvation through the broad gates of the city of God that will then be wide open. (Isa. 60:11) Now, “narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.” (Matt. 7:14) No night </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">there: </span><span class="font11">The Psalmist explains how the smile of the Father was turned away from mankind. He describes mankind as “such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron; because they rebelled against the words of God [by disobedience of his express command] and contemned [set at naught] the counsels of the Most High. Therefore he brought down their heart with labor [each sex with its own peculiar kind]; they fell down, and there was none to help.” (Psa. 107:10-12) This disobedience brought our entire race into the valley of the shadow of death (Psa. 23:4); but the prophets encouraged us to hope for a watchman who would tell us of the coming of the day. (Isa. 21:12) Later, the Apostle Paul declared the night was far spent, being then more than two-thirds gone. (Rom. 13:12) The event that is to bring in the day is the rising of the Sun of Righteousness. (Mal. 4:2) When here at the first advent Christ was the light of the world (John 8:12) ; and the people in his immediate neighborhood saw a great light, shadowing forth his coming glory. (Isa. 9:2) He declared that we, too, should be lights in the world. (Matt. 5:14) The sun rises quietly, like a thief. (1 Thes. 5:2) When the morning comes, the first work is banishing the works of the night. (Ezek. 7: 7-12) Next comes the opening of the spiritually blind eyes of those that have physical sight. (Amos 5:18) Surely, the best time for a great oculist to open the eyes of the blind is in the day time. (Isa. 35:5) Now matters are more or less obscured (1 Cor. 13:12) ; but the time is coming when the blind shall be shown a way of life they have not hitherto known. (Isa. 42:16) Will the Lord show wonders in the dark? (Psa. 88:12) He will indeed; and when the nations come forth from the tomb, they will seek him that turneth the shadow of death into the morning. (Amos 5:8; Isa. 42:6, 7) “And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.” (Rev. 21:4) “For there shall be no night there.” “Weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”—Psa. 30:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">21:26. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The glory: </span><span class="font11">This rendering of glory to the Kingdom will continue throughout the Millennium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">21:27. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Anything vulgar: </span><span class="font11">No one who could or would contaminate others by speech or example, will ever find a place in that city. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Worketh abomination: </span><span class="font11">Nor anything tending in the direction of pride or sectarianism. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Or maketh a lie: </span><span class="font11">Nor anything countenancing the teaching of error for pleasure or profit.

<p><span class="font11">22:4. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">See his face: </span><span class="font11">There will be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">no </span><span class="font11">earth-born cloud between, no hindrance to the Father’s love and favor. (Z.’05-172) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">On their foreheads: </span><span class="font11">Intellects.—B169.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:5. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Be no more night: </span><span class="font11">No reign of sin and death. (A9) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Light of the sun: </span><span class="font11">Preaching of the Gospel. (D590) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And they: </span><span class="font11">The overcomers of the Millennial age. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall reign: </span><span class="font11">Over paradise restored. Forever and ever: “Thou hast put all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen, with the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air and the fish of the sea.”—Z.’05-172, 173.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:6. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And he: </span><span class="font11">The same angel mentioned in Rev. 1:1; 19:9, 10; representing Pastor Russell, beyond the vail. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Said unto me: </span><span class="font11">The John class, in the flesh. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Faithful and true: </span><span class="font11">“There hath not failed one word of all his good promise.” (1 Kings 8:56) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Spirits of the prophets: It </span><span class="font11">is still possible to have the same spirit as filled the prophets of old, even though the prophecies themselves have ceased to be miraculously uttered or interpreted. (1 Cor. 13:8) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Shortly be done: </span><span class="font11">Especially the events of the immediate future.—Rev. 1:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:7. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I come quickly: </span><span class="font11">Intimating that when the time has come that the book of Revelation can be understood, we are to understand that the establishment of his kingdom is close at hand. (Z.’05-173; Rev. 16:15; 22:10, 12, 20) Jesus is the speaker. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Blessed is he: </span><span class="font11">The Elijah class. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of this hook: Who </span><span class="font11">see its clear import and accept the responsibilities implied.—Rev. 1: 3; 3:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:8. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And I John: </span><span class="font11">Representing the church in the harvest of the Gospel age. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And heard them: </span><span class="font11">Understood them. (Rev. 1:3) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the angel: </span><span class="font11">The special messenger appointed by the Lord to speak forth the message of present truth. (Z.’05-173) “'Blessed is that servant.” (D163) “The angel of the church of the Laodiceans.” (Z.’05-170) “The man that is my fellow.” (Z.’06-226) Typified by King Josiah.—Z. '05-180.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:9. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">See thou do it not; </span><span class="font11">Do not worship me; I am not the author of this plan. (Z.’05-173) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Thy fellow servant: </span><span class="font11">Not thy Lord and Master. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of thy brethren: </span><span class="font11">The fellow-servant of thy brethren. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The prophets: </span><span class="font11">All true teachers or mouthpieces of God. (Z.’95-217) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And of them: </span><span class="font11">And the fellow-servant of them. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Worship God: </span><span class="font11">The source 'from which come all these blessings and all this light.—Z.’96-305.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:10. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Seal not the sayings: </span><span class="font11">When the time comes for a full understanding of the book of Revelation, the church is not to hide the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:11. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Unjust still: </span><span class="font11">The proclamation of the message of present truth is not expected or intended to convert the world. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Righteousness: </span><span class="font11">The message of present truth applies only to those who are righteously inclined. (Z.’05-173) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Be holy still: </span><span class="font11">“The word seems to denote development and crystallization of character, immediately preceding the coming of the great Judge of all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:12. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I come quickly: </span><span class="font11">See Rev. 16:15; 22:7, 10, 20. The Lord himself becomes the speaker. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Reward is with me: </span><span class="font11">And will not be given until I come. (F665) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Every man: </span><span class="font11">Every man in Christ. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">As his work is: </span><span class="font11">The church’s work is practically fin</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">ished. </span><span class="font11">The reward is given on the basis of the work already done, in character development and in the natural outgrowth of that development—works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:13. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the end: </span><span class="font11">Of the direct creation of God.—Z.’93-115.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:14. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Wash their robes: </span><span class="font11">The great company class. (Rev. 7:14) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The Tree of Life:  </span><span class="font11">(Rev. 22:2) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Into the City: “Whose </span><span class="font11">builder and maker is God.” (Heb. 11:10) To these dear brethren we would say, The object of your trials is to remove the dross (Ex. 30:7; Mal. 3:2) that you may be fit companions of the Christ. (Ex. 12:8; Heb. 2:17; Rom. 5:3; Col. 1:11) Do not think it strange. (James 1:12; 1 Pet. 1:7; 4:12; 5:10) When you get the right viewpoint, you will rejoice in your sufferings. (Deut. 13:3; Psa. 23 :4; 119: 67) The trials will not last forever (Psa. 39:1); and in them all you may hear the songs of deliverance. (Psa. 32:6. 7) There is nothing to turn back to (Heb. 10:38); but there is joy untold to look forward to, and it is nigh.”— Rev. 19:9; Psa. 45:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:15. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Without are dogs: </span><span class="font11">Idlers, breeders of spiritual contagion, self-seeking, biting and devouring, treacherously lying in wait to deceive. (Z.’94-216) The word used refers to the wild dogs which roam Palestine and which are pests; not the pet house dogs mentioned by our Lord in his remark to the Syro-Phcenician woman. (Z.’00-191) There will be no clergy class, as such, in the kingdom. (Isa. 56:10: Phil. 3:2: 2 Tim. 3:8, 9) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Murderers, and idolaters: </span><span class="font11">See Rev. 21:8. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And loveth a lie: </span><span class="font11">The old lies will die hard; and some may try to carry them far into the time of trouble. Ere long, however, the truth will be so manifest that all must give way before it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:16. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">In the churches: </span><span class="font11">All down the age the church has had this message: all down the age holy men of God have sought to understand its mysteries: all down the age it has remained a closed book. But now the Mystery of God is </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">finished:</span><span class="font11"> and the object of keeping the book closed is accomplished. God wished the world to know when the time for the complete removal of error and for the establishment of his kingdom would come; and so he enables the last members of his church to give the message. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I am the root: </span><span class="font11">Origin, source of life, by virtue of my purchase of David’s liferights. No longer a branch out of the root of Jesse and David. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the offspring: </span><span class="font11">Through Nathan’s line. (E150) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And morning star: </span><span class="font11">“And </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font11">will give him the morning star.” (Rev. 2:28) Christ’s gift of himself to the bride is the greatest of all gifts.—Job 38:7; Psa. 118:22-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:17. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And the bride: </span><span class="font11">The bride does not say Come, until there is a bride, following the marriage of the Lamb. (A98; E226: F336) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Him that is athirst: </span><span class="font11">“Blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled.” (Matt. 5:6; Isa. 55:1) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">And whosoever will: </span><span class="font11">And whosoever will receive it. (D198) During the Millennial age. (A97) The water of life will not be forced on any. Now, “no man can come to me except the Father which sent me draw him.” (Z.’05-171 </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The water of life: </span><span class="font11">Restitution blessings; truth, clear as crystal. (D655: E179: H47) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Freely: </span><span class="font11">“Ho. every one that thirsteth; come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money.”— Isa. 55:1; Z.’05-217.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:18. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Of this book: </span><span class="font11">To all who ever understand it. Add </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">unto these things: </span><span class="font11">As was done in many instances during the dark ages, even in this very verse. (Deut. 4:2: 12:32; Prov. 30:5, 6) </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Unto him the plagues: </span><span class="font11">His penalty will be. when he comes forth from the tomb in the times of restitution, that he will have to read the seven volumes of Scripture Studies, and get the matter straightened out in his own mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:19. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Shall take awav: </span><span class="font11">Shall seek to nullify or minimize its teachings, now that the time has come for it to be understood. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The tree of life: </span><span class="font11">He will not be a part of the life-giving tree described in Rev. 22:2; not a part of the little flock. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">The holy city: </span><span class="font11">He will not be one of the Lord’s jewels, counted worthy of a place in the New Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:20. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">I come quickly: </span><span class="font11">The second advent of the Lord is thus shown to be beyond Pentecost and beyond the destruction of Jerusalem; for John wrote these words long after both of these events had transpired. (A90) The </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;">apokalupsis</span><span class="font11"> is at hand! See Rev. 16:15. Come. Lord Jesus: The union with the Bridegroom draweth nigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">22:21. </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">With the saints: </span><span class="font11">The first of the saints to whom will be extended the unmerited favor of a raising up out of death to perfection will be the little flock; the next class of saints to be reached will be the great company; next in order will come forth the ancient worthies; and finally the thousands of millions of mankind, until at last Adam himself shall come forth from the prison-house in which he has lain so long, and mav. if he will, receive again by the will of God. as a favor or grace at the hands of Christ, the unspeakable boon of eternal life.</span></p><img src="1918_rjc_E_files/1918_rjc_E-25.png" alt="" style="width:206pt;height:152pt;">
