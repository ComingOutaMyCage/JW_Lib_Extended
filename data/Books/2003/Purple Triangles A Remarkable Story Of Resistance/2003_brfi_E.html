<p><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font9">By the end of 2002, about 600,000 visitors —many young people among them—have seen the traveling exhibition about the persecution of the prisoners with the “purple triangle” and other Jehovah’s Witnesses in the “Third Reich.” The exhibition was staged at memorial museums of former concentration camps, such as Mauthausen, Moringen, Neuengamme, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, and Bergen-Belsen, as well as in adult-education centers and other educational institutions. This effort was important and instrumental in saving these “forgotten victims,” as German historians call them, from oblivion. What further benefit comes from the presentation of such an exhibition to the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">On January 27, 1998, the annual commemoration day for the victims of National Socialism, the Memorial Museum at Sachsenhausen camp dedicated the day to Jehovah’s Witness victims. Speaking at this occasion, Steffen Reiche, Minister of Culture and Science in Brandenburg, stated: “The behavior of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the camps and prisons embodies virtues which, today and in the past, are essential to the continued existence of a democratic constitutional state founded on the rule of law: namely their firm stand against the SS and the consideration toward their fellow inmates. Given the increasing brutality toward aliens and towards persons having a different political or philosophical outlook, these virtues are a must for every citizen in our country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This comment emphasizes the fact that exhibitions of this kind do far more than just inform about the facts of the bitter and fateful persecution of a religious minority under the Nazi regime, and it shows the value and necessity of documenting the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the exhibition was staged in Hamburg in October 1997, a renowned weekly commented on the exhibition: “It achieves what such exhibitions should always aim for: out of the plain statistics of harassed people, of persons fired from their jobs, of inmates, of people tortured and murdered, it draws attention to the ordeals of individuals.”—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Die Zeit, </span><span class="font9">October 10, 1997, p. 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At the opening of the exhibition sponsored by the State Center for Political Education of Lower Saxony at the Memorial site of the Bergen-Belsen camp, one speaker said: “All persons depicted can only be mentioned on behalf of the many who were persecuted, imprisoned, and tormented because they firmly held to their religious convictions and did not adapt to the National Socialist surroundings. They are no remote and untouchable heroes but ordinary people, mortal like everybody else, who followed their conscience, stood up boldly for their convictions, and hence became good examples for our everyday life.”— </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung, </span><span class="font9">April 20, 1998, p. 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Three sets of this exhibition exist with about 50 panels each, and they can be shown publicly under the following titles: “Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault” (as an accompanying exhibition for the public presentation of the video documentary with the same title, produced by the Watch Tower Society, or with other films about this topic produced by non-Witnesses), “Forgotten Victims,” (so far historians have been referring to Jehovah’s Witnesses as “forgotten victims of the Nazi regime”) and “Spiritual Resistance Out of Christian Conviction” (as was done as an accompanying exhibition of scientific forums with the same titles in Wewelsburg, Hamburg, and Frankfurt am Main in October 1997).</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The basic idea for the exhibition panels stems from the French exhibition of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Cercle europeen des Ttemoins de Jehovah anciens deportes et internes </span><span class="font9">(European Society of Jehovah’s Witnesses Former Concentration Camp Inmates), founded in Paris in 1990. However, the contents of the German panels have been revised and expanded. On November 6, 1996, the exhibition was displayed at the world premiere of the German video documentary </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah’s Witnesses Stand Firm Against Nazi Assault</span><span class="font9"> at the Ravensbruck Camp Memorial Museum. The prime minister of the State of Brandenburg wrote for that occasion: “The presentation of your film is an important step on the way to informing the public about the role of your religious association under the Nazi regime.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Over 500 similar public showings of this video documentary have taken place in Germany since then; over 300 events being accompanied by the</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">exhibition. On January 23, 1998, at the opening of the exhibition in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, Siegfried Schiele, director of the State Center for Political Education of Baden-Wurttemberg, stated: “All who resisted the Nazi regime—for whatever motive—deserve deep appreciation. And an important group among them are Jehovah’s Witnesses to whom we owe respect, respect which was somehow underexposed for a long time. Therefore, I am happy about this exhibition that can help compensate deficiencies. I was already able to get a first positive impression when touring the exhibition. I can also recommend the video documentary highly that I have already seen. History cannot be a quarry from which we pick whatever suits us. Jehovah’s Witnesses have a definite and exemplary place in the chapter which otherwise is the saddest chapter of our history.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As the need arose, the Watchtower Society in Germany produced additional panels, with references to the locality of the exhibition, for example, for the city of Stuttgart and for the Bautzen Memorial Museum. (Some memorial museums received extra panels on permanent loan.) The panels were also copied in full size for the premiere of the Russian </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Stand Firm</span><span class="font9"> version, held on May 15, 1997, at the World Trade Center in Moscow, as well as for the premiere in Austria and the special exhibition “The Forgotten Victims,” on June 18, 1997, at the Mauthausen Camp Memorial Museum. The branch offices of the Watch Tower Society in Sweden, Denmark, and Norway made electronic copies of some exhibition panels and presented them at the Nordisk Museum in the center of Stockholm on January 14, 1998, and in Copenhagen on March 30, 1998. In these countries the panels were used and shown as a traveling exhibition in various cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">This brochure only presents a selection of pictures and documents from the 50 three-dimensional panels. However, a new collection of panels has been selected to be computerized and offered free of charge as a valuable set of computer print-outs for public presentations and classroom use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We desire this exhibition to continue contributing to the formation of unbiased opinions on the part of all citizens.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“The extent of loyalty towards the state was the criterion for initiating persecution. . .. The ‘International Association of Earnest Bible Students,’ the ‘Watchtower Bible and Tract Society,’ were the first religious association to be hit by the Nazis, and they were hit the hardest. Hardly an analysis has been made, or any memoirs written about the concentration camps, which do not include a description of the strong faith, the diligence, the helpfulness, and the fanatical martyrdom of the Earnest Bible Students.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Kirchenkampf in Deutschland 1933</span><span class="font9">—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">1945,</span><span class="font9"> by Friedrich Zipfel, Berlin, 1965, p. 175.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">“The distribution of the ‘Resolution’ [on December 12, 1936] and of the ‘Open Letter’ [on June 20, 1937] were not only a very spectacular, but also were a new way of public preaching . .. [These were] campaigns throughout the ‘Reich’ which were so well coordinated that they could take place all over Germany on the same day and at the same time. . . . Throughout the whole Nazi era in Germany, there was no other resistance organization that took comparable initiatives.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Widerstand “von unten.” Widerstand und Dissens aus den Reihen der Arbeiterbewe-gung und der Zeugen Jehovas in Lubeck und Schleswig-Holstein 1933—1945,</span><span class="font9"> by Elke Im-berger, Neumunster, 1991, p. 345.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Being a ‘total state’ claiming the entire person, taking God’s place, and demanding the whole ‘Volkskorper’ [entire population] to be concordant with their ‘Fuehrer,’ the Nazi regime left no room at all for people who lived according to the commandments of the Bible Students’ doctrine. Thus, ‘resisting’ had to became a requirement for keeping the self-esteem and identity of the religious community.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Zwisch-en Widerstand und Martyrium.

<p><span class="font9">“As early as in the Weimar Republic, Jehovah’s Witnesses were exposed to the hostilities of racial-nationalistic forces, of the church, and to the first legal measures from the state. .. . Although in 1933 the IBV [International Bible Students Association] tried to adapt to the new situation and declared their strictly nonpolitical and anti-communist nature, harsh conflicts with the government agencies soon followed. Already the spring 1933 saw heavy persecution, confiscations, and bans of publishing, preaching, and organizing.”—</span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Widerstand und Emigration.

<p><span class="font9">“The first thing we can learn from the attitude of Jehovah’s Witnesses under the ‘Third Reich’ is that a small group of people in Germany, relying on their faith and the solid unity among them, succeeded in drawing away from the Nazi regime’s totalitarian reach, although at a high price. . .. Second, it should be an obligation for us, the [later] generations . .. to ensure that people will never again have to die in order to remain true to their conscience/—Hubert Roser, in: </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">„Am mutigsten waren immer wieder die Zeugen Jehovas.&quot; Ver-folgung und Widerstand der Zeugen Jehovas im Nationalsozialismus,</span><span class="font9"> published by Hans Hesse, Bremen, 1998 and 2000, p. 253.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font5">As early as 1933, their refusal to participate in elections and to give the Hitler salute, and their religious activities in spite of governmental bans, resulted in the first repressive measures for Jehovah’s Witnesses and even detention in concentration camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font5">On October 7, 1934, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany and in 50 other countries sent about 20,000 letters and telegrams to the German government protesting the persecution. The telegrams from abroad read as follows: “Hitler government, Berlin, Germany. Your ill-treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses shocks all good people of earth and dishonors God’s name. Refrain from further persecuting Jehovah’s witnesses; otherwise God will destroy you and your national party. Signed, JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES [city or community].”</span></p>

Konrad was taken to the camps at Osthofen (1933), Sachsenburg (1934), and Sachsenhausen (1936 —1945), whereas his father, Max, was in Sachsenburg (1934) and Buchenwald (as from 1935).</span></p>

In February 1940, she was sentenced to three and a half years of prison, which she spent in solitary confinement. The judiciary set her free in 1943 after her Catholic parents pleaded for clemency.

His father was forced to hand his son over to the officials. Berthold, who met his parents again in 1945 when he was 15 years old, remembers: “The Nazis entrusted me to the care of a childless couple that lived on a small farm. In the morning I went to school, and in the afternoon I worked on the farm. Until 1943 I was allowed to write to my parents only once every six months. Then, all correspondence was forbidden.”</span></p>

The older children had to do hard work in the house and in the garden. She recalls: “We never played. We had no personal belongings, and speaking was forbidden. If a pupil was caught, he was severely beaten on his fingers with a stick.”</span></p>

When new Witnesses came, they were immediately taken to the “penal labor unit,” where the hardest and dirtiest work had to be done for 10 to 12 hours a day, including Sundays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">13 </span><span class="font5">The Bible Students (Jehovah’s Witnesses) constituted a separate category of prisoners, and were stigmatized with a purple triangle. Their firm stand exposed them to special cruelty by the SS guards and the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">kapos</span><span class="font5"> (inmates serving as overseers), and they were at their mercy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">14</span><span class="font5"> As one of many punishments, the prisoner was tied and with iron rods beaten on the naked backside.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">15</span><span class="font5"> Regardless of the weather, the prisoners often had to stand lined up for hours at the roll-call squares (here at Sachsenhausen). On September 15, 1939, at this very place the SS had conscientious objector August Dickmann executed in the presence of the entire camp.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">16</span><span class="font5"> The camp inmates could be punished for trivial “offenses,” for example, by hanging them on a stake, the so-called “tree hanging,” an extremely painful measure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">17</span><span class="font5"> In addition to the degrading conditions, the camps were extremely overloaded. Jehovah’s Witnesses were permitted to share barracks with their fellow believers, but because they held religious meetings, the SS later separated them. However, since they now preached more to other inmates, the SS put the Witnesses together again. Commented an observer: “One cannot escape the impression that, psychologically speaking, the </span><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;">sS</span><span class="font5"> were never quite equal to the challenge offered them by Jehovah’s Witnesses.”—Eugen Kogon.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">18</span><span class="font5"> Due to poor feeding, many died or suffered from malnutrition and diseases, such as hunger-related typhus.</span></p></li>

During the three and a half years to come (at Buchenwald—where the Witnesses made up the greatest number of prisoners in the “penal labor unit”—even until the end of the war), they were not allowed to write to their relatives more than 25 words once a month.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">21</span><span class="font5"> The following text was stamped or printed on the camp stationery: “The prisoner remains, as before, a stubborn Bible Student and refuses to reject the Bible Students’ false teachings. For this reason the usual privileges of correspondence have been denied him.”</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">22</span><span class="font5"> The SS would often present to the Witnesses a “declaration.” By signing this and renouncing their faith, the Witnesses could have been set free. Yet, only few signed it.</span></p></li>

In January 1945, she experienced the “evacuation” transports from camp to camp: to GroB-Rosen, Mauthausen, Bergen-Belsen, and Dora-Nordhausen, where she was freed.</span></p>

After the dissolution of the Niederhagen concentration camp (1939—1943; for some time the camp was under the jurisdiction of the Sachsenhausen camp) a “remaining labor group,” consisting almost entirely of Jehovah’s Witnesses, stayed at Wewels-burg. Theodor Sponsel was one of them.—(Group picture taken shortly after liberation in 1945.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">33 </span><span class="font5">Max Hollweg recalls how the SS tried to work 26 conscientious objectors to death (1942). They did not succeed because other Witnesses secretly gave them food and support.</span></p>

In 1944, while at Wewelsburg camp, he managed to have a cello be built for him. The SS conceded, because Jehovah’s Witnesses had no prospect of being released anyway. However, the musical instrument never came to be used in a prisoners’ orchestra, and Georg Klohe only occasionally played it after work.</span></p>

Between October 1939 and July 1943, he was sent to the camps at Buchenwald, Wewelsburg, and Ravensbruck. Upon arrival in the camp he was so severely beaten on the head that he kept painful long-term injuries. After his release he had to report to the police. In spring 1945 he escaped, thus avoiding being drafted into the army.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font5">Paul Rehwald from Konigsberg was also among those who experienced the death march from Sachsenhausen. When the German front line collapsed and Allied forces freed the camps, the regime of terror came to its end after 12 years. Like the prisoners shown in this photograph, many Witnesses-most of them after many years of detention-headed home.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">4 </span><span class="font5">The SS moved 9,000 prisoners from Neuengamme camp to the Baltic Sea and packed them onto the ships </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Cap Ar-cona, Thielbeck,</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Athen. </span><span class="font5">On May 3, 1945, after a British fighter plane attack, two ships sunk, and only a few prisoners survived.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font5">The SS also ordered the “evacuation” of the Stutthof camp, near Danzig, by way of land and sea. Together with about 1,900 prisoners, Feliks Borys from Chojnice (Poland), along with nine other Witnesses, had to march to Slupsk. “[Soon] only about 800 of us were left,” he recalls. By carrying Wilhelm Scheider (Poland), he helped him survive. After his liberation Borys headed home on foot, where he arrived two months later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font4">Before the Gestapo arrested and tortured him cruelly, Erich Frost from Leipzig had supervised the underground work in 1936/37. He was put under permanent arrest (1937 —1945). In the Sachsenhausen camp, with the fellow Witnesses in mind, he composed a song that found its way outside the camps and strengthened his fellow believers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">6 </span><span class="font4">In 1935, Arthur Winkler from Bonn experienced the cruel treatment in the Esterwegen camp. Later he directed the underground work in Germany from the Netherlands. The Gestapo sought to arrest him after Germany had occupied Holland (May 1940), but he was not captured until October 1941. He survived the death march from Sachsenhausen with the help of fellow Witnesses, because they transported him in a cart belonging to the SS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">7 </span><span class="font4">Joseph Rehwald from Konigsberg was first sent to Stuhm prison (East Prussia) and then to Sachsenhausen camp, because he refused military service.

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1933 </span><span class="font5">Following the Reichstag fire, the emergency presidential decree for the “prevention of Communist violent acts against state security” suspends many fundamental civil rights (February 28). Bans on Jehovah’s Witnesses in most states of the Reich based on false accusations; a petition, addressed to the Reich Chancellor and to officials, remains unsuccessful (April and June). Confiscations of congregation property, burning of Watch Tower literature, and first imprisonments of Witnesses in concentration camps (July).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1934 </span><span class="font5">Jehovah’s Witnesses duplicate Watch Tower publications underground, since the police check their mail in order to stop the importation from abroad. By March, some 4,000 house searches, 1,000 arrests (400 of them were sent to concentration camps) and 200 cases of maltreatment are registered. Many Witnesses in civil service are fired (as of June). On October 7, a flood of protest telegrams reaches Hitler who shouts hysterically: “This brood will be exterminated in Germany!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1935 </span><span class="font5">General ban of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Reich with the aim of removing them from civil service (April 1). Special Courts sentence countless Witnesses to long prison sentences and heavy fines because they held Christian meetings and distributed their publications. Disregarding the given legislation, the Gestapo arbitrarily order protective custody for Jehovah’s Witnesses and send them to concentration camps (June 17 and September 9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1936 </span><span class="font5">The Minister of the Interior of the Reich prohibits the Witnesses’ selling of “Bibles or other religious publications, which usually are not offensive;” this leads to even more imprisonments (January 30). The authorities are allowed to withhold unemployment benefits and old-age pensions (as from February 2) from Jehovah’s Witnesses. Many Witnesses have to endure abuse or public humiliation because of not participating in the “Reichstag elections” (March 29). The Gestapo and the Criminal Police form special units, the Special Courts set up special departments, in order to investigate Jehovah’s Witnesses and to sentence them (June). Despite massive arrests (August 28), Jehovah’s Witnesses succeed in distributing the Lucerne protest resolution all over the Reich (December 12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1937 </span><span class="font5">Police and the courts are instructed to “use the harshest measures” against Jehovah’s Witnesses. The court sentences grow longer. After having completed their sentence in prison, the Witnesses are often sent to concentration camps or back to prison. About 4,000 Witnesses are arrested, and often groups of them are sentenced at “Bible Students trials,” about which the newspapers report openly. The family and probate courts successfully initiate lawsuits to isolate children from their parents. Jehovah’s Witnesses organize a second tract campaign all over the Reich in order to draw people’s attention to the Gestapo terror (June 20).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1938 </span><span class="font5">About 5 to 10 percent of the concentration camp inmates in the pre-war time are Jehovah’s Witnesses. They are kept “isolated” in special barracks, surrounded by barbed wire, (in some camps even earlier) and for nine months they are not allowed to send or receive any mail (March). In Switzerland the Witnesses document the persecution in Germany in the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity </span><span class="font5">and mentioned that “now already 6,000 ... suffer in prisons and concentration camps” (May). In a speech held in New York and broadcast by 60 radio stations, J.F. Rutherford, then president of the Watch Tower Society, condemns Hitler and the persecution of the Jews with explicit statements (October 8).</span></p>
<div><img src="2003_brfi_E_files/2003_brfi_E-62.jpg" alt="" style="width:443pt;height:73pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1939 </span><span class="font5">As the first conscientious objector of the war to be sentenced to death by police judiciary, August Dickmann is publicly shot at Sachsenhausen camp, (September 15) and the succeeding days this is publicized in broadcasts and press releases. With the outbreak of the war, the abuses of imprisoned Witnesses have increased. During the severe winter, 100 out of the 400 Witnesses in Sachsenhausen die from maltreatment, hunger, or exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1940 </span><span class="font5">State police order the arrest of all Witnesses in the Reich at a set time; on June 12, Witness homes are raided. In July, Swiss authorities confiscate the book </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Crusade Against Christianity</span><span class="font5"> (up to September 1944). The German judiciary has already sentenced to death 112 conscientious objectors who are Jehovah’s Witnesses (August). (By the end of the war, the number of executed Witnesses will reach about 270, among them 50 Austrians.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1941 </span><span class="font5">Ludwig Cyranek, who secretly forwarded Watch Tower literature in Germany and Austria during 1939 and 1940, is sentenced to death (March) and executed in Dresden (July 3). Julius Engelhard and others continue his work (1939 until April 1943).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1942 </span><span class="font5">The “Newsletter of the German Distribution Center of the Watchtower” and other items circulate among Jehovah’s Witnesses inside and outside the camps. The brutal torture of Witnesses in pretrial detention is officially allowed to continue. Hitler insists that the Bible Students have to be “exterminated” (August). However, the extreme situation of the Witnesses in the camps eases somewhat because the SS come to value the labor force of the camp inmates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1943 </span><span class="font5">In many places in Germany and Austria, Jehovah’s Witnesses are supplied with Watch Tower literature from the underground, and letters are smuggled out of the concentration camps. The SS have to recognize that Jehovah’s Witnesses are standing firm despite their “isolation” in the camps, and they disperse the Witnesses to the other barracks (September). At Ravensbruck camp, </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Asoziale </span><span class="font5">(inmates considered “antisocial”) are put into one barrack (block) with the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Bibelforscher (Bible Students).</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1944 </span><span class="font5">Himmler orders surprise police raids within various concentration camps, and large quantities of Watch Tower literature are found (April). Outside the camps, the Gestapo also breaks up underground networks, and 254 Witnesses are arrested. Julius Engelhard and Auguste Hetkamp are sentenced to death (June) and executed in Brandenburg (August). Nevertheless, underground work continues in different places, and Watch Tower literature is duplicated even in the Wewelsburg camp. The Military Court of the Reich, which is “overloaded”, delegates processes against conscientious objectors—numerous cases involve Jehovah’s Witnesses—to subordinate courts (August). Death sentences have by now become a pure formality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">1945 </span><span class="font5">Liberation of Auschwitz (January 27). During the forced evacuations of the concentration camps and on the “death marches” south and west, the inmates with the “purple triangle“ (Jehovah’s Witnesses) help each other in order to avoid being shot by the SS. Liberation of the camps Buchenwald (April 11), Bergen-Belsen (April 15), Sachsenhausen (April 22), Dachau (April 29), and Ravensbruck (April 30), as well as of the penitentiaries in Brandenburg (April 27), Waldheim (May 6), and of other detention centers. All 230 Witnesses survive the “death march” to Schwerin (May 3). The surviving Witnesses from the Stutthof concentration camp go ashore on the Danish isle of M0n (May 5). Capitulation—the German Reich ceases to exist (May 8)! Jehovah’s Witnesses begin their German postwar history with 7,000 members.</span></p><img src="2003_brfi_E_files/2003_brfi_E-63.jpg" alt="" style="width:504pt;height:648pt;">

<p><span class="font6">“The religious community numbering 25,000 souls in Germany was banned in 1933. About half of them continued their ‘preaching work’ underground. Jehovah’s Witnesses refused to give the Hitler salute and especially refused to perform military service. They were persecuted mercilessly. About 10,000 were arrested. The resistance of this group, which also tried to inform the population about the criminal character of the Nazi state by distributing leaflets in the years 1936/37 and thus acted against the regime of injustice beyond their own interests, cost them about 1,200 lives.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Informationen zur politischen Bildung,</span><span class="font6"> no. 243, (1994): </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Deutscher Widerstand 1933—1945, </span><span class="font6">p. 21.</span></p>
