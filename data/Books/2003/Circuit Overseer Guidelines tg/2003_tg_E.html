At such time as he should cease to serve in that capacity, his copy of the manual must be handed over to the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc., since this publication is the Society’s property.

<p><span class="font6">4. WEEDING FILES: Before moving to a new assignment, traveling overseers should weed the file of unnecessary items. Unless otherwise specified, routine correspondence can generally be discarded after five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">two elders could inform the third elder on the committee of the conversations they had with the imprisoned wrongdoer. In that way the judicial committee could render a decision based on an actual meeting with the individual It would not be proper for a judicial committee to handle the case over the telephone with a conference-line arrangement. If it is not possible to meet with the wrongdoer, the elders should write to the Society for direction.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">8. APPEAL COMMITTEES: Individuals have a right to an appeal when disfellowshipped. It is necessary for judicial committees to wait seven days before announcing a disfellow’shipping, even if the individual says he will not appeal. People sometimes change their minds. If the individual appealed the decision after the announcement was made but before the seven days expired and then the disfellowshipping was rescinded, it could raise unnecessary questions in the minds of some.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">9. If an appeal is made, an appeal hearing should be arranged for, even if the basis for it is questionable. The judicial committee chairman should promptly contact the circuit overseer, since he is the one authorized to designate elders to serve on the appeal committee. The circuit overseer will also designate who should serve as chairman. If possible, elders selected by the circuit overseer for hearing the appeal should not be from the same congregation as the original committee.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ks91</span><span class="font6"> 124-5.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">10. When the circuit overseer selects elders to serve on an appeal committee, he should remind them to review before and during their deliberations pertinent information in the Kingdom Ministry School textbook and on the reverse side of the Notification of Disfellowshipping or Disassociation (S-77) form.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">11. JUDICIAL RECORDS: In some cases elders have been very lax about keeping records of judicial proceedings. If later it becomes necessary to reopen a case or present information to an appeal committee and the elders cannot recall what was said or decided, this can be a problem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">12. The congregation’s confidential file should be accessible only to the elders. Notes of the proceedings of a case should be kept in a sealed envelope. This is true in cases of reproof as well as when disfellowshipping action has been taken. Usually only the elders who handled the judicial case or a committee selected to hear a request for reinstatement would open the envelope. When circuit overseers check the congregation file, it would be good for them to make sure judicial matters are being properly filed. However, traveling overseers should not open sealed envelopes.—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">km</span><span class="font6"> 2/74 8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">13. If an individual is reinstated, the records should be kept for five years following reinstatement or longer if deemed advisable, In cases involving child molestation, all records should be marked “Do Not Destroy” and should be kept indefinitely.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">selves and the congregation before they can be reappointed. This involves building up a convincing record of righteousness that serves to counterbalance the effect of the past wrong. Depending upon the gravity of the wrongdoing, this might take five, ten, or more years. In cases of great scandal, he might not live it down sufficiently in his lifetime so as to qualify as an elder or a ministerial servant.—Titus 1:6,7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">16. A brother who enters into an adulterous marriage would not qualify to serve as an elder or a ministerial servant at least until the death or remarriage of his former mate, if ever. Thus, if a brother was divorced in the past, a clear description of the circumstances surrounding the divorce must always be included with the recommendation for his appointment. How long ago did it occur? Was it before or after his baptism? Was it </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> Scriptural divorce? Who committed the adultery? What responsibility did the brother have for the breakup of his marriage? Did he remarry? If so, when? Are love and devotion evident within his new marriage? Does he have the full respect of the congregation?—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">ks91</span><span class="font6"> 135-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">17. Extreme caution should be exercised if a former child molester is being considered for recommendation as an elder or ministerial servant Those who are appointed to privileges of service in the congregation are put in a position of trust and are judged by others as being worthy of trust The congregation would, therefore, be left unprotected if someone who had been a child abuser was prematurely appointed. If one had engaged in this kind of sexual wrongdoing or had been disfellowshipped for such an offense, it would be many years, if ever, before he could be recommended for further privileges. To be considered also is the loss the Society could suffer. Court officials and lawyers will hold responsible any organization that knowingly appoints former child abusers to positions of trust if one of these thereafter commits a further act of child abuse. This could result in costly lawsuits, involving dedicated funds that should be used to further the Kingdom work. So, legal considerations must be weighed, as well as the degree of notoriety, the extent of the misconduct, the number of years that have passed since the sin occurred, and how the brother is now viewed by the congregation and people in the community, including those he victimized. In all such cases, the Society should be fully informed of the person’s background and all the factors involved.—See the Society’s March 14,1997, letter to elders.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">18. If there is any doubt about a man’s qualifications, it is better to wait until the circuit overseer and the body of elders are sure.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">19. RECOMMENDING PRESIDING OVERSEERS: Any change in presiding overseer that has been made between visits of the circuit overseer is temporary until a presiding overseer is recommended at the time of the circuit overseer’s visit and an appointment is made by the Society.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">20. If consideration is being given to recommending a new presiding overseer, the circuit overseer should read tire Society’s April 15, 1983, letter to traveling overseers in its entirety to the body of elders. This should be done early in the week of his visit, preferably on Tuesday evening following the congregation meetings that night The letter should again be read to the elders later in the week when actually considering recommendations with them. This letter should not be loaned out but is kept in the possession of the circuit overseer.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">disfellowshippings </span><span class="font8">of those being recommended to the Society for appointment. If a brother is being recommended who was reproved during the last three years or reinstated during the last five years, the following information should be provided: (1) the action taken; (2) the date of the action; (3) whether an announcement was made to the congregation (in the case of a reproof) and the degree of notoriety involved; (4) when the last restriction was removed; and (5) whether the brother has regained the respect of the congregation.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ks91</span><span class="font8">131.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">16. Traveling overseers need to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">be careful about recommending </span><span class="font8">brothers for appointment too soon after their being removed as elders or ministerial servants because of wrongdoing. A quick reappointment under those circumstances tends to minimize the seriousness of the wrongdoing in the eyes of the wrongdoer and may be disturbing to those who remember his bad course. (ITim. 5:22) Brothers removed for wrongdoing have to live down the reproach they brought on themselves and the congregation before they can be reappointed. This involves building up a convincing record of righteousness that serves to counterbalance the effect of the past wrong. Depending upon the gravity of the wrongdoing, this might take five, ten, or more years.

<p><span class="font2">This manual is the property of the Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses. A copy is issued to each appointed traveling overseer, and he may retain it as long as he continues to serve in that capacity. At such time as he should cease to serve in that capacity, his copy of the manual must be handed over to the Christian Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses. No copies are to be made of any part of this publication. Neither is it to be converted into any electronic format.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Traveling Overseer Guidelines </span><span class="font0">For United States of America English (tg-E Us) </span><span class="font8">should be men who are experienced, spiritual, balanced, impartial, up-to-date in reading and studying Christian publications, able to deal with others in a kindly way, having high respect for the Bible and its principles, and capable of making wise decisions. If possible, the elders selected by the circuit overseer for hearing the appeal </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">should not be from the same congregation </span><span class="font8">as the original committee. They should not be related to or have a special relationship with either the elders on the original committee or the one making the appeal.—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ks91</span><span class="font8"> 124-5, 149-50.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">10. When the circuit overseer selects elders to serve on an appeal committee, he should remind them to review before and during their deliberations pertinent information in the Kingdom Ministry School textbook and on the reverse side of the Notification of Disfellowshipping or Disassociation (S-77) form, as well as any other relevant direction provided by the branch office.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">11. JUDICIAL RECORDS: In some cases elders have been very lax about keeping records of judicial proceedings. If later it becomes necessary to reopen a case or present information to an appeal committee and the elders cannot recall what was said or decided, this can be a problem.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">12. The congregation’s </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">confidential file </span><span class="font8">should be accessible only to the elders. Notes of the proceedings of a case should be kept in a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sealed envelope. </span><span class="font8">This is true in cases of reproof as well as when disfellowshipping action has been taken. Usually only the elders who handled the judicial case or a committee selected to hear a request for reinstatement would open the envelope. When circuit overseers check the congregation file, it would be good for them to make sure judicial matters are being properly filed. However, traveling overseers should not open sealed envelopes.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">13. If an individual is reinstated, the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">records should be kept </span><span class="font8">for five years following reinstatement or longer if deemed advisable. In cases involving child molestation, all records should be marked “Do Not Destroy” and should be kept indefinitely.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8">wrongdoing in the eyes of the wrongdoer and may be disturbing to those who remember his bad course. (1 Tim. 5:22) Brothers removed for wrongdoing have to live down the reproach they brought on themselves and the congregation before they can be reappointed. This involves building up a convincing record of righteousness that serves to counterbalance the effect of the past wrong. Depending upon the gravity of the wrongdoing, this might take five, ten, or more years. In cases of great scandal, he might not live it down sufficiently in his lifetime so as to qualify as an elder or a ministerial servant.—Titus 1:6, 7.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">18. A brother who enters into an </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">adulterous marriage </span><span class="font8">would not qualify to serve as an elder or a ministerial servant at least until the death or remarriage of his former mate, if ever. Thus, if a brother was divorced in the past, a clear description of the circumstances surrounding the divorce must always be included with the recommendation for his appointment. How long ago did it occur? Was it before or after his baptism? Was it a Scriptural divorce? Who committed the adultery? What responsibility did the brother have for the breakup of his marriage? Who initiated the divorce, and did the spouse agree to the divorce? (wOO 12/15 28-9) Did he remarry? If so, when? Are love and devotion evident within his new marriage? Does he have the full respect of the congregation?—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ks91 1</span><span class="font8">35-6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">19. Extreme caution should be exercised if a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">former child molester </span><span class="font8">is being considered for recommendation as an elder or ministerial servant. Those who are appointed to privileges of service in the congregation are put in a position of trust and are judged by others as being worthy of trust. If one had engaged in this kind of sexual wrongdoing or had been disfellowshipped for such an offense, it would be many years, if ever, before he could be recommended for further privileges. Also, legal considerations must be weighed, as well as the degree of notoriety, the extent of the misconduct, the number of years that have passed since the sin occurred, and how the brother is now viewed by the congregation and people in the community, including those he victimized. In all such cases, the branch office should be fully informed of the person’s background and all the factors involved.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">20. If there is any doubt about a man's qualifications, it is better to wait until the circuit overseer and the body of elders are sure.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font8">21. RECOMMENDING PRESIDING OVERSEERS: Any change in presiding overseer that has been made </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">between visits </span><span class="font8">of the circuit overseer is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">temporary </span><span class="font8">until a presiding overseer is recommended at the time of the circuit overseer’s visit and an appointment is made by the branch office.</span></p></li></ul>
