<h1><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Why Make a Will?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">A professionally drawn will is the best way of ensuring that your wishes regarding what you own are known and followed after you die. It helps prevent disputes over your estate.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Consult a Solicitor</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">Even if your wishes are simple, if you are leaving money to the worldwide work, we strongly recommend that the will be drawn up by a solicitor or professional will writer. The fee they charge is worth the safeguard against mistakes that could invalidate your will.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Who Should Witness the Will?</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">Because of the complexities associated with the preparation of a will, it is imperative that professional advice be sought when taking this step. A solicitor should be well equipped to provide guidance on the witnessing of a will.</span></p>
