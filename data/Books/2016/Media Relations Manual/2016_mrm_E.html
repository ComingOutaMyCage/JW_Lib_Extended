</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark8"></a>Contacting the Media</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Prepare information about the convention and send it to the media, preferably for the attention of a specific contact. It is not necessary to wait to get the Media Relations Manual before trying to contact the media. If the media is informed far in advance of the event, it will have bigger and better coverage. Some media outlets have a web page with contact information; however this may not be up-to-date. Therefore, it may be better to contact the editor-in-chief or chief editor of local section. You can ask this person who is in charge of topics like education, human rights, social issues, family and religion; it all depends on the theme you want to portray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Here is a suggestion on how to approach the topic: “I have news worthy information about a Jehovah’s Witness convention that will be held here. There will be thousands attending from this and neighboring states. Who handles news stories at your station/channel/paper? Get the person’s email address.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Keep in mind that on weekends there may be a different editor-in-chief and journalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Make a detailed list of all media outlets in the convention’s region. This list should include the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> News channels.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Newspapers (including small communities and weeklies)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Radio stations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> State or regional offices of national television or radio networks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Independent newspapers</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">For each media outlet, make a list of contacts containing the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Name of outlet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Address (including web site address).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Name of contact.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Telephone numbers (office &amp;&nbsp;cell, if possible)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">•</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Email address.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">The most common way to come into contact with someone is through email or phone. If possible, ask or otherwise find out the person’s contact preference. Attempt to contact everyone on your list. Keep detailed notes or logs about the most useful contacts. Also, save any reports that the journalist may have produced about us or our conventions. If you can contact the same journalist the following year chances are better that the outlet will once again produce a story about the convention.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Preparing the media spokesperson</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">A journalist may want to speak with an authorized representative that will make official statements about the convention. The convention’s media spokesperson must be prepared for this task. If a journalist wants to interview other brothers, for example the Regional Convention Committee Coordinator or the program overseer, these brothers should inform themselves so that they can represent the organization in a dignified way. It is expected that these brothers dress appropriately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other suggestions:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">• Keep in mind a key message that can be expressed in 2 or 3 sentences. Emphasize key ideas by repeating them in various ways.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• Answer questions with simple sentences.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• Avoid words or theocratic expressions that those who are not Witnesses will not understand.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• If you do not understand a question, ask for it to be repeated.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• If you are doing a televised interview, avoid fancy clothes or accessories, as this can distract the audience. Make moderate gestures. Look at the interviewer, not at the camera.</span></p></li></ul>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Negative situations</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">If a question is asked about negative or controversial topics, it is best to avoid using the phrase: “No comment”. Usually, people conclude that one who gives such an answer is guilty. If you do not know the answer, say with sincerity, “I do not know”. And if they make a negative statement, do not repeat it. Respond positively with a brief comment and then return to the topic that you want to emphasize.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Example 1. A reporter asks: “Why do so many dislike the Jehovah’s Witnesses?” A positive response would be: “Jehovah’s Witnesses are peace-loving, law-abiding people and we try to be model citizens and good neighbors in our communities. Although some may not agree with our beliefs, we imitate Jesus by sharing with them our positive message, and the conventions’ program will explain the reasons”.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Example 2. A reporter asks: “What can you tell us about some former members of the religion that are protesting outside?”. The best answer is something positive like: “We respect the rights of others to their own opinion. But we are meeting here to learn how to strengthen our personal relationship with God.” After giving this response, steer the conversation back to the convention.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Example 3. If asked about 1975, you could say: &quot;Jehovah's Witnesses look forward to the fulfillment of biblical prophecies. And although we recognize that we do not know the exact date when these events occur, we remain on the lookout, because that is what Jesus advised his disciples”. Then the brother can direct the conversation back to the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the interviewer asks or talks about anyone involved in any congregation judicial cases, you should never comment about them, nor should you give any opinions on hypothetical situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Be wary of programs that have the public calling in and/or informal interview programs. Be quick to notice if an interview is becoming argumentative or the facts are being twisted, which might project a negative image about us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Finally, remember Philippians 4:5: “Let your reasonableness become known to all men. The Lord is near”. At all times be patient, honest, friendly and positive.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Preparing other Brothers for interviews</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">After getting official statements, most journalists will like a human touch to their reports. The following is a list of what they may be interested in:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">• Candidates for baptism, especially the young and old (visual effect).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• Entire families (with their members singing and sitting together).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• Children, teens and young adults interested in spiritual topics (and why they came to the convention).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• Dramatic representation (visual appeal of the costumes).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• Sessions in foreign languages.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0">If the journalist asks to interview someone, tell him/her that you know someone that he/she can interview. The selected Brothers for interviews must be exemplary. They should be trained or prepared for interviews without telling them exactly what to say. By selecting someone in advance, you can avoid having the journalist pick someone else that does not meet the requirements to be interviewed, or that will not represent the organization well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No one should be forced into an interview. Only willing brothers and sisters should be interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Get familiar with the convention venue. Think about good places for interviews. We have a bigger impact if, in the background, you have the platform, big screens, the baptism pools, volunteers working or convention attendees entering the venue. Do not take the interview to private offices or isolated areas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The spokesperson and the brothers being interviewed should avoid harsh, critical or self-righteous comments, particularly with regard to those that are not Witnesses. For example, non-Witnesses should not be called “worldly”; expressions that denigrate other religions should avoided, and no one should make disparaging remarks about the city where the assembly is held, hotels and administration or restaurants.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>General Suggestions</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Designate at least one capable elder - and with authority to access convenient locations - to accompany the news team, answer questions, etc. Such a brother must keep in mind that anything he says can be recorded, even if they assure him that it will not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Freely use press releases, informational videos and other resources that appear on jw.org. Come regularly to the Press section of jw.org to see the latest updates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the news team does not have a photographer, you can give them photos you may have of the convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When speaking with journalists, do not use a tone that may imply that they are being preached to. We must understand the difference between answering questions in the field ministry versus answering a journalist’s questions. Be wary with offering publications to journalists; avoid giving the impression that an attempt is being made to &quot;convert&quot; them. The following can be useful as a guide:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">When in field service</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">When we report</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The way to communicate is more expressive, because the intent is to convey objectivity.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">The purpose of the conversation is to touch on our activities and beliefs objectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We wish to eliminate prejudice and have positive objective news reports on us. This will make it likely that people will accept the good news when we visit them in the ministry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">PREPARING FOR THE INTERVIEW</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT NOT TO DO</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font0">• Before answering any questions, ask for the journalist's name and ask for a business card. (The journalist catches you off-guard and tries to provoke a confrontation that may lead you to make an unfortunate comment. Ask for a name and a business card, thereby focusing the attention on the journalist. This will eliminate the element of surprise. This will give you time to think.)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">• Tell him/her that you’ll take the interview at a more convenient time.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">• Do not stop and talk.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">• Do not feel obligated to answer any questions.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">• Do not attempt to grab or block the camera.</span></p></li></ul>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0">• Keep walking.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0">• Keep calm and be polite.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font0">• If the journalist and his team insist, politely ask them to leave.</span></p>
