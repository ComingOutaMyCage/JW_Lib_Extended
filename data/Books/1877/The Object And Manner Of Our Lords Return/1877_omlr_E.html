<p><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;">CHAPTER I.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">THE OBJECT OF THE SECOND ADVENT.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;">That </span><span class="fornt5">our Lord intended us as His disciples to understand, that forr </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">some purnose,</span><span class="fornt5"> in some manner, and at some time, He would come again, is, we presume, admitted and believed by all familiar with the scriptures. But the object of that coming is viewed from widely different standnoints, and seen in as various colors as there are glasses ; each observer honestly and sincerely desirous of seeing and understanding the subject correctly. We shall not attempt in these few pages to give all that can be presented unon this subject, but simply offer a sketch of what we understand the events and their order to be ;—giving as far as space will permit, the scriptural evidence favoring it. In doing so, we shall endeavor to exercise Christian courtesy, when referring to the views </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="fornt5">brethren who differ with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The writer believes that in order to an understanding of this subject, it is necessary forr us to have some clear conception of God’s plan forr the salvation of the world of mankind. If we can obtain this, it will unquestionably give us inforrmation very valuable, in the consideration of our subject; forr, In that plan, not only the first but also the second advent has an imnortant place. Here a vital question arises, viz.:</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">HAS GOD A PLAN?</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Or, did He in an idle moment frame this world, and bring us, His creatures, into existence simply to exercise His creative power ; entirely unmindful, or uncaring, what should be the result to us of that existence ? Many who love the Lord with all their hearts speak of Him and His work as though this were the case. They thiuk of the fall of Adam, by which “ Siu entered&quot; the world and death by [or, as a result of] sin,” (Rom. 5 : 12) as an emergency entirely unexpected and unprovided forr by the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Such naturally regard the salvation provided through our Lord Jesus Christ as an after-thought. God, having been thwarted by an agent of His own creation,—the Devil,—now sought to repair the mischief by providing a way by which a few of these creatures could be saved. They regard the present and past contest between good &quot;and evil, as a race between God and the Devil, in which, so far, the Devil has been the most successful. They hope and trust, however, that beforre the winding up of all things, the numbers of the saved will be greater than those of the lost: and so God, even without any plan, come off conqueror.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">But, Christian friends, He who would rebuke a man forr building a tower without first counting the cost, shall He build and people a world without counting the cost ? Nay, verily ; God has, and always has had, a plan—a purnose ; and all His purnoses shall be accomplished. Ho works things after the counsel of His will.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Not only is this true, but </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="fornt5">has revealed His plan to us in “ the Scriptures, which are able to make us wise,” and given us His Holy Spirit to enlighten our understanding, “ that tee </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">might know the</span><span class="fornt5"> things that arc freely given unto us of God.” (I Cor. 2 : 12.) Which things, neither the world nor </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">carnally minded</span><span class="fornt5"> Christians can see (v. 14); they are revealed by the spirit in answer to diligent search. “If thou seekest after wisdom, and liftestup thy voice forr understanding, yea: if thou searehest forr her as men search forr silver ; then shall thou find the knowledge of God.” When He, the Spirit of Truth is come, He shall guide you into all truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The Spirit dbes this as we have seen through the Word—the lamp. But God's word, the Bible, is a revelation not intended forr one decade or century, simply ; but, to the conditions of His people, at all times and in every age. It is continually unforlding to us some new, fresh beauty, of which but a short time beforre we had not even dreamed. It is because of this continuous unforlding of truth, as it becomes “ meat in due season” to the household of faith, that under another figure the same word is compared to “ a lamp to our feet forr, “ the path of the just shines more and more until the perfect day.” It shone some away back in Enoch's day, and has been increasing ever since; not, that light yesterday is darkness to-day ; but, there is more light to-day, by which we can still better appreciate that of yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Have we. as a church, all </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="fornt5">light </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;">now ? </span><span class="fornt5">Cer-</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">tainly not; nor will we have until the “ perfect day.’’ Whilst we reniemember,.then, that</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perforrm</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">we should be ready and watching forr the earliest glimpse of the next unforlding of llis revelation of Himself and His plan ; reraembeiing that</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ His purnoses will ripen fast, • Unforlding every hour.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We will now see what we can find of God’s plan revealed in His word, therefrom to judge of the object of our Lord’s return.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We lay down as a forundation, then,—whether the plan is so far unforlded that we can fully comprehend it, and see the connection which must exist between the past and present dealings of God and that plan, or not:—First, God has a purnose or plan. Second, That plan is based and forunded unon love, forr ‘<sup>;</sup>God is love.” (I Jonn 4 : 8.)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We do not cast aside God’s justice, etc. ; but, whatever His plan it must comnort with His character—Love—forr, “ He cannot deny Himself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The Christian church is about equally divided unon the question of Election vs. Free Grace, or Calvinism vs. Arminianism ; a small number, pronortionately, believing in Universalism or the final eternal salvation of all mankind. Doubtless, all familiar with Scripture know that each of these nositions are supnorted by much scripture ; and yet, can they all be true ? Must there not he some comiecting link which will harmonize and reconcile them ? Surely this is the case, forr God’s Word is not yea and nay. Let us examine the first two, Calvinism and Armin ian ism, separately ; the last, Universalism, is so flatly contradicted by much direct scripture, that we shall measurably pass it unnoticed. And what we have to offer on the others is not designed as a fling against any of the “ branches of the true vine but strongly expressed, to call special attention to the more uncomely features of those doctrines which their strongest advocates will concede are weak noints.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Calvinism virtually says: God is all wise; He knew the end from the beginning; He had a plan which was to save a few, </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">not from any merit in them, </span><span class="fornt5">but of His sovereign choice He elected these to eternal life,—all others to eternal death. He could as easily save all men, but He docs not want to : He is able, but unwilling, to save any hyfc a few.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Arminianism virtually says . God loves all His creatures ; His tender mercies are over all His works. He is trying His utmost to save them all, but is not able :, only the very few, the “little flock.” Sin. slipped past Him, entered the world at the outset, and has gained such a forothold that only by the aid of His children can it be overcome, even in ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">As beforre suggested, each of these, although apparently, antinodes, have some scriptural basis, and we believe, when properly arranged, are in harmony with each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We will now look at the Bible ; first nt a dark picture, then at a brighter one. Here we find that though little light was given as to man’s salvation and future happiness at the first unforlding of the</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">plan, even that little wag not given to the world at large—the masses—but to a few Patriarchs, among whom were Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These were chosen,—elected,—not .alone from the world, but from among the other members of their families, as it is written: “Jacob have I loved, Esau have I hated.” [loved less.] Isaac alone of all of Abraham’s children was the child of promise. Of Abraham it is written, “Thee only have I chosen of all thy father’s house.” </span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">At Jacob’s death, the principle of election changes,, but the fact remains. All of Jacob’s children are thereafter recognized as God’s representatives,—His church, or people. There on his death bed, the old patriarch blesses each of his sons and gives to Judah the sceptre,—symbol of nationality,—saying : “The Sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shilon come.” TThis was fulfilled to the letter. That tribe represented the nation until Christ came. To this one nation God gave the Law, in which was shadowed forrth the Gospel. This shadowy light, the Law, was given to no other nation orpeople'; it was exclusively to Israel, as we read : “You only, have I known of all the families of the earth.” We will thereforre designate this the Jewish or Law age.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">At the death of Christ another change takes place. The Law ends. lie made an end of the Law, ‘ nailing it to the cross,” and introduced a new dispensation,—the gospel of grace, under the law of the Spirit. This is not restricted to one nation, as was the law, but is free to all, to be “preached in all the World, forr a witness” beforre this age ends. (Matt. 24:14). But although we are to know no difference in our presentation of it to all people, God has been guiding and directing its course. Under that direction, we of Europe and America, have been more favored than the inhabitants of other parts of the earth. Why did the light of truth and salvation, started by our Lord and llis anostles in Palestine, travel nothward and wesward through Europe and America, rather than southward and eastward through Africa and Asia ? Did it happen so ? on no I Our Father is at the helm; He is guiding His truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">True, now the bible is published in the language of every nation. It is now being <sup>u</sup> preached to every nation” : (not individual) but this we may say, has all been done during the present century'. Yet to-day, forur out of five of the inhabitants of earth know not that Jesus died forr them. Here is a sense in which God is even now electing. He elected to send the gospel to you and me anil our fathers, and He chose not to send it to yonder Hottentot and his fathers. But says one, God works by instrumentalities. He has been wanting His people to come to the work, and by giving of the money and talents which He so freely bestowed on us, we may, through missions, which He will bless, have the privilege of being coworkers with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">To much of this we can heartily assent. We believe that through us God is working; that He is pleased with our zeal in His service. But we cannot forr one moment supnose that the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">eternal welfare </span><span class="fornt5">of forur-fifths of the human family is made to depend entirely unon the zeal and liberality of the other onefifth. No ! No I I The God of love, is not experimenting at the expense of the eternal happiness of the great mass of His creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We see, then, that in some sense God has so far been electing the church. But why. He must have a purnose and object in so dointr. Tie has a plan, and doubtless it is far greater and grander than ever entered into the heart of man to conceive. What saith the scriptures ?</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">In the promise of God to Abraham: “In thee and in thyseed shall all the families of the earth be blessed,” God’s plan and purnose is stated in one sentence. Paul, in an inspired comment unon this promise, (Gal. 3), says, “ He saith not to seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ.” Is it Christ Jesus individually that is here referred to as the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">one seed ?</span><span class="fornt5"> No ; the anostle continues (vs. 29) if ye [the church] be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">the promise,</span><span class="fornt5"> (as originally made to Abraham). We learn that God had us comprehended in IIis plan when speaking to Abraham. Not only Christ Jesus, the head of this seed, but they that are Christ’s—the little dock—as members of His body : and this </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">one seed</span><span class="fornt5"> will not be complete until the last member of that body is perfected. This thought is maintained throughout the Epistles—Christ, “ the head of the bodv. the church.” (Col. I : 18. Eph. 1 : 23 ■ 4 : 12 : 5 :'25-32 I Cor. 12 : 12, 27. Rom. 12 : 5, etc.) The figure is carried yet further. We, His disciples, are snoken of as filling up the measure of Christ’s sufferings. (Col.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">1 : 24. II Cor. 1:5. II Tim. 2:10.) And we have the promise, “ that if we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The promise, to which we are heirs, declares that when this seed is complete, all nations shall he blessed in it. A promise made away back in Eden, that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s head, crush evil and sin, is another to which we are joint-heirs. But did not Jesus do tins—bruise Satan— when he died ? No; the death of Christ and the subsequent persecution of the church are the “bruising of the heel.” Paul says, “ Satan is to be bruised </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">shortly</span><span class="fornt5"> under the feet of the church,”-</span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">-head and body,</span><span class="fornt5"> (Rom. 16:20). Again, the same thought is expressed under the figure of</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The church is represented as a chaste Virgin, </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">esnoused</span><span class="fornt5"> to Christ (II Cor. 11 : 2). As such we are now betrothed, and have received the sea! of that engagement.—the first fruits of the Spirit. Not married, not the bride yet, but waiting and longing forr that union with the Bridegroom. When He went away lie said, “ I will come again and receive you unto myself. He expressed it so in the parable of the “ Ten Virgins.” When “ the Bridegroom came, they that were ready went into the marriage.” There and then we shall enter unon the full realization of the <sup>u</sup> things which God hath in reservation forr those that love Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">All, we presume, will agree with us, when we say, that no matter how much cnioynient we have prior to the resurrection, we certainly'wait until then forr the full measure. The whole church or body is complete beforre the final rewards are given. lienee, when recounting the ancient worthies, the Anostle says : (Heb. 11 : 39, 40), “ They received not the promises that that they without usshould not be made perfect.” And, of Himself, when about to die, He said, <sup>U</sup>I have forught a good fight... .henceforrth there is laid up forr me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them, also, that love His appearing.” (II Tim. 4:8.). True, we now have and enjoy many blessings in Christ. Now we have the peace that the world can neither give nor take away. But all this is but a forretaste ; the weight of glory comes over there. We now, in a certain sensed have begun our othce, as Kings and Priests, conquering self and the lusts of the flesh, and “ offering up spiritual sacrifices unto God but it is only in the same sense that we are now snoken of as being risen with Christ, and seated with Him in heavenly places. By faith in Ris promises we anticipate' the glory and the rest that remains ; and although beset with trials and troubles in life, we have a &quot;peace to which the wrarld is a stranger.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">When the Lord promises, saying, “ To him that overeometh, 1 will give to sit with me in my throne,” and <sup>k</sup>‘ to him that overeometh I will give power over the nations.” dbes He mean it ? Is he to sit on the throne of His glory ?” Will He take to Himself His great power and reign over the nations ? Surely, His word cannot fail; it will be as real a reign over the nations forr us—the church—as forr Him. God gave “ Christ to be the head over the bodyand <sup>44</sup> be that hath freely given us Christ, will ’be not with Him also freely give «s all things?” Yea, verily, brethren, we hare not realized “ our </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">high-calling </span><span class="fornt5">which is of God in Christ Jesus.” We are. called to son-ship of God, and not this alone, but to be joint-heirs with Christ Jesus our Lord. This is the little company whom God saw away back in Eden, through whom He-’ is shortly to bruise Satan and <sup>44</sup> ble.'S all the families of the earth.” It is this company to Peter refers, (Acts 15: 14) saying, *“ God did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people forr His name.” We are the Virgin, soon to receive the name of our Lord,<sup>44</sup> a new name that no man knoweth save he that receiveth it”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">It was forr these Jesus prayed: (Jonn 17) “ I pray not forr the world” but forr them thou hast given me, and “ not forr these only but all them also which shall believe on me through their word, <sup>u</sup> that </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">they all</span><span class="fornt5"> may be </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">one in me.”</span><span class="fornt5"> This oneness and unity the Lord did not expect in tills present time. He says He came to bring division. Consequently He is not disapnointed nor thwarted in His plans. In the parable of wheat and tares, He tells us that the enemy would sow tares among the wheat, and they look so much alike that we cannot separate them. “Let both grow together until the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">harvest,—</span><span class="fornt5">the harvest is the end of the world” [aeon—age] </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">then</span><span class="fornt5"> He will have them separated by angels.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Yet, as Jesus says “the Father heareth me always,” we may know that at some time they all will be one in Him. When ? At the resurrection, when we are united to our head, becoming the “one seed,” at the marriage when we are </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">united</span><span class="fornt5"> to the Bridegroom and they twain become ox’E. But although this prayer was mainly forr the church, yet Jesus loved the whole world. Yes, he died forr the World, and they have a place in this prayer. But notice where. He prays forr the church first, that they all may be made one in Him; then the object of the union is‘‘that the world may believe.’<sup>7</sup> But the believing of. and prayer forr, the World, is after the marriage of the chaste Virgin. For this marriage, ‘*we ourselves, that have the first-fruits of the spirit, groan within ourselves waiting forr the adoption, to wit: the redemption of our body<sup>77</sup>; this cue body of which we each are members.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">When we (the gospel church,) are redeemed, is God’s plan accomplished ? No. It is only begun. It is a grandif. a more lol ly plan. Not only do we groan forr this consummation, but we have seen from our Lord’s prayer that the world lias an interest in it, and Paul nositively assert*--,that <sup>u</sup>the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together.'<sup>7</sup> What are they expecting ? Certainly not what </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">v:e</span><span class="fornt5"> are looking forr. They do not expect to forrm part of the body. No: “ the earnest expectation of the creature, waited forr the manifestation of the sons of God.” (Rom. 8:19) Not Son of God. but sons. “Beloved, now are we the sous of God.<sup>:</sup>’</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">What interest has the world in our manifestation or shining forrth ? Simply this,—Until we are manifested although we are </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="fornt5">“light of the world/’ and it is blessed by this’light, which we are to let “so shine that men may glorify Our Father in heaven/’ yet how much more will it l*e blessed, when we “ shine forrth as the sun in the Kingdom/’—when separated from the world as well as from the tares in the harvest. (Matt. 13 : 43.) If we now are a blessing to the world as light-bearers, noor and weak though that light often be, are we surprised that the hope of the world is this shining forrth of the church ? Paul tells us why they wait and groan forr our manifestation. “Because the creature itself </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">also</span><span class="fornt5"> shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” That is, when the church hits been delivered from the present condition — subject to death—the bondage of corruption, then the world at large will have an opnortunity in the same direction, —“ that the world may believe ” and as many as do so “ shall be delivered into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” Sous, but not.</span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">joint-heirs.</span><span class="fornt5"> This will be the only distinction between them and us,—the gospel church.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">God loves all his creatures, not because </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="fornt5">love Him. but from pure benevolence. “God so loved the world” — while we were yet sinners. But He is a God of order. lie has a plan, and is carrying it out. During the past six thousand years, He has been getting ready,—preparing the instrumentality through which to bless the World. The time seems long to us mortals, but not so with Him who is from everlasting to everlasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">This “ little dock ” who receive the Kingdom are but<sup>u</sup> the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">first-fruits</span><span class="fornt5"> unto God of IIis.creature3. (Jas. 1: 18. Rev. 14 : 4.) If there is a </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">first-fruits</span><span class="fornt5"> there must of necessity, be more of a harvest, else the lan-Buage is senseless. Eph. 2 : 7, declares the object of od in our salvation to be, ‘‘That in the ages to come He might </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">show</span><span class="fornt5"> the exceeding riches of His grace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">But let us forllow the church,—the first-fruits. We last saw her as the chaste virgin going into the marriage, when the bridegroom came. We next heartbe great voice of a multitude saying (Rev. 19 : 7.) “ Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to God, forr the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. We have heard of the marriage— listen I the ancel says to Jonn (Rev. 21 : 9, 10). “Come hither, I will </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">show thee the Bride,</span><span class="fornt5"> the Lamb’s wife?<sup>-7</sup> We want to see her, let us forllow. “And he showed me that great city, the Holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.” Are we to understand that this citv is a symbolic representation of the church ? Yes, just as in another symbol she is the “Temple of God.” But what of the precious stones of which it is built ? These are the same as the stones of the spiritual Temple ; i. e., living stones, —the same that Paul speaks of as “Precious stones” (1 Cor. 3.12), or the jewels of Mal. 3 : 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">When this city “ shines'” the nations will walk in the light of it. Now they are blest by the feeble light of the church ; then they will walk in the perfect light which will shine from her. (Rev. 21: 24 ) There Hows a river—from under the throne—“a river of the water of life.” Not the ordinary kind of water. No, this is “water of life,” the kind the Lord promised to give us, and which Ue dbes give now to every one begotten. It shall be in you a well of water.” This kind of water would not flow in a natural river bed, but this same sort is here brought to our view' as flowing a broad, deep, mighty river. No longer the little well, no longer limited to the few<sup>r</sup>, the “ little flock,” but‘<sup>;</sup> whosbever will” maypartake of it freely. There the Spirit and the Bride will say come, and he that heareth will say come. It will be free to all. But, notice when,* it is in the new heavens and new earth, (Rev. 21:1)—in the next dispensation. The church is not the Bride now, but a chaste Virgin. W hen she is married—united, she will be the Bride, and then it is that she says time to whosbever will</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Oh, can we not pray from tt.e depths of ourhearts, come, Lord Jesus! come quickly I Shall w’e not, since we and all creation wait forr it, rejoice at the sound of the Bridegroom’s voice, as He nears our dwelling? We do rejoice and lift up our heads, knowing that our redemption draweth nigh.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">This is a glorious prospect forr both the church and the world. But bow about those who died, not having heard the name of Jesus, who did not enjoy the privileges of light ? Must these all suffer the loss of eternal life and happiness with not even an opnortunity to Jay hold on it ? Must they all go to heli, simply because they lived beforre God’s plan had so far developed as to embrace them ? Or, shall we go to the other extreme and say, God will save all those who have never had light and truth ? If this be true, we have made a great mistake iu sending mis-slonaries with this light to the heathen. We know that when it is presented to them they do not all receive it and become Christians, and if in ignorance they would all be saved, we not only do them a nositive injury but waste numbers of valuable lives and millions of money. And further, if God can consistently give these eternal life without a </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">trial,</span><span class="fornt5"> or probation, why did He not give us all as good a lot, and save us all without our coming into the present probationary condition ; or why did He not kindly leave us all in the dark, and thus save all ?</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Neither of these lines of human reasoning will stand the test. We must see what God’s plan-book, the Bible, has to say on the .subject. But first let us take a glance backward, and see about what pronortion of our fellow creatures have a personal interest in the matter. We have seen that during the first 2100 years only a few Patriarchs were chosen. This brings us down to the time that the nation of Israel became God’s representatives, at the death of Jacob, the last patriarch. Of all others Paul declares,<sup>u</sup>-death reigned from Adam till Moses,”—or, until the Law, which was given to but one people ; and of these only a very few were saved; only those who could rise above the type and discern the antitype. The value of the Law in saving men may be gathered from St. Paul’s teachings. He ,says—“ that no man is justified by the Law is evident.” (Gal. 3 : It.) “By the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified in His [God’s] sight.” (Rom. 3 : 20.) -For if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in .vain.” (Rom. 2:21. “If the Law given could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the Law.” (Rom. 3:21. “For the Law made nothing perfect.” (Heb. 7 : 19.) “ Whereforre then servetn the Law ? It was added because of transgressions, till the Steed should come, to whom the promise was made.” (Gal. 3 : 19.) That is, the seed of Abraham not the fleshlv descendants, forr says Paul, “ the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God : but the children of the promise are counted forr the seed.” (Rom. 9: 8.) Children of faith, Christ, and the church. (Gal. 3 : 29.)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Thus we learn that nearly all of the “ little flock” is being gathered during the gospel age. To-day, about one individual in five knows that Christ Jesus died forr him. Until the present century, and during the dark ages, probably one in forrty knew it. A fair calculation of the numbers who have never heard the Gospel, from Creation to the present time, would he about 120,000,000,000 souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Whether we can understand God’s dealings or not we may rest assured, “ the God of all the earth will do right.” But we are anxious to have the matter cleared up, if it can be, from God’s word. For, unquestionably, the facts already obtained from the Bible </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appear</span><span class="fornt5"> to clash directly with some of the plainest statements of Scripture. For instance, we read of Jesus, this is the true light that lighteth </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">every fitan</span><span class="fornt5"> that cometh into the world.” How shall we understand such a statement ? Thousands of millions have not even heard of Him. Are we certain that hearing of Christ is essential ? May they not be saved by living up to the light of nature ? It is certain that they must hear of Christ beforre salvation, forr, says Paul, “ How shall they believe on Him of whom they have not heard ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The conditions of salvation are </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">“Believe</span><span class="fornt5"> in the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.” Again, “there is no other name given under heaven or among men, whereby we </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">must</span><span class="fornt5"> be saved.” </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Must;</span><span class="fornt5"> if saved at all, it </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">must</span><span class="fornt5"> be </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">in Him.</span><span class="fornt5"> If they could even do by nature many things contained in the Law, we have seen that “ the Law could not give life ;” “forr by the deeds of the Law shall no man be justified.” Again we read, “ Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death forr every man.” But if they never hear of it, and are never benefited by it, how can it be said to be “forr </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">every man ?” </span><span class="fornt5">Again, “ There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Cbrist Jesus : who gave Himself </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">a ransom forr all; to be testified in due time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Ah ! here we have it. God is a God of order. He has a “ due time” forr everything He dbes, and when His “ due time” comes, it will be testified to all men that “ Christ died forr the ungodly.” That true light shall yet lighten every man that ever came into the world. It certainly was not </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">His plan</span><span class="fornt5"> to have it testified to them in the ages past, else it would have been done. But it will be testified in due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">How we see a meaning in the statement, “ As in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” I know that that these are texts used by Universalists, (but I am not a Universalist), but shall we not use them simply because they do ? No ; “all Scripture... .is profitable.” This is the time “ of restitution of all things,” mentioned by Peter, (Acts 3 : 21) of which he says “ God hath snoken by the mouth of </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">all</span><span class="fornt5"> the holy prophets since the world began. This is not forr the church, but forr the world. The church gets something far better than a restitution. The whole human family get back in the second Adam all they lost in the first Adam. They did not lose eternal life or a spiritual existence in the first Adam, forr he was a probationer forr these himself, and as a stream cannot rise higher than the foruntain we could not lose more through his disobedience than he nossessed. There are two lives<a name="forotnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark5">1</a></sup>—natural and eternal; and two deaths, temnoral and eternal. He lost natural life and obtained temnoral death. Consequently the restitution through Christ would only give to the world natural life and a natural body, at their restitution, such as Lazarus and Jairus’ daughter had when brought to life again. Of the church—the dead in Christ, at His coming—alone it is said, “ Sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body.” Ail others rise fleshly, natural bodies and liable to die again.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The Law contains no higher promise than that of natural life. “ That thy days may be long unon the land and no threatening more severe than temnoral death. They “ that disobeyed were to be stoned or thrust through with a dart.” Eternal life or death are not mentioned in it. The Jews had an </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">idea</span><span class="fornt5"> of a future life in Christ’s day, but not from the law. The The</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">heathen had an idea also without any revelation.— simply a guess. For “ Christ brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.” (II Tim. 1: 10.) ’ If he brought it to light, it was not brought to light by Moses,</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We fincl the matter clearly stated in Rom. 5:18, 19 ; “as by the offense of one [Adam] judgment came unon &quot;all </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">men</span><span class="fornt5"> to condemnation ; [death] even so, by the righteousness of one, the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">free gift</span><span class="fornt5"> came unon </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">all men</span><span class="fornt5"> unto justification of life ; forr as by one man’s [Adam’s] disobedience </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">many</span><span class="fornt5"> were made sinners, so by the obedience of one [Christ] shall many be made righteous,” (i. e., justified to life as above).</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">They rise simply to have during the millennial age what ice have had during our lifetime, viz. : To hear of the love of God and death of Jesus forr them, and to have an opnortunity to accept of Him. They will not all receive Him, forr we read of “a great company being cast into the lake of fire, the second death evenat the end of this millennial age (Rev. 20 : 9), when they have had a knowledge of the truth, which will then have been testified’ to every man.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Now we can understand I Tim. 9 :10. “ We trust in the living God, who is the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Samur of all men, especially of those that belitce.”</span><span class="fornt5"> All men are to be saved from all they lost in Adam: while those that believe—the church—have an </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">especial</span><span class="fornt5"> salvation—the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">eternal.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Not a second chance ; it cannot be another or a second change unless they have had one, and we have just forund that so far the masses have had none; no! We advocate no second-chance forr any man, but refer to Heb. 6 : 4, 6, and 10 : 26, 28—If we sin wilfully, turn our backs unon God’s salvation and the blood of the covenant, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more a sacrifice forr such. Christ died </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">once</span><span class="fornt5"> forr all, and it will be testified once, but He will die a second time forr no one. “ He dieth no more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">To the justice and mercy and love of this plan of God, when realized, we think the church and world can say “ Amen. True and righteous are thy judgments, Lord God Almighty.” It makes a harmony out of the various, heretoforre conflicting texts of scripture ; we can see, now, how and why some were chosen or elected in Christ; how and when God is no respecter of persons, and the grace forr all who will receive it with ample place forr all the scripture supnosed to teach universal eternal salvation, and with it all, begin to see a depth and scope to God’s plan we never beforre dreamed of. With Cowper we would say—</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ Judge not the Lord by feeble sense. But trust Him forr His grace ;</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Behind a frowning countenance He bides a smiling face.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"><sup>w</sup> His purnoses will ripen fast, Unforlding every hour;</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The bud may have a bitter taste, But sweet will be the flower.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">When will this grand, glorious age of restitution begin ? Peter says, at the coming of the Lord ; <sup>u</sup> whom the heavens must receive until the times of restitution of all things which God hath snoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3: 21) We read of the restoration of Israel and other nations in Jeremiah, Isaiah, and the minor prophets : and also of the earth being restored to Edenic beauty, when the wilderness shall blossom as the rose, &amp;e.; and the church, in general, believe in the restoration of a living remnant of Israel to their own land and to God’s favor, but as a rule they have never thought of the .prophecy embracing the dead as well as the living, and other nations as well as Israel. But these &quot;things arc mentioned in the same Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">In Ezekiel 39 : 21-29, God tells how He has cast off Israel into captivity forr their sins ; and “ there fell they all by the sword (v. 23) but lie promises to bring the whole house back into their own land. Then speaking of the gathering as accomplished, He says, “ I have gathered them into their own land, and left none of them any more there” (v. 2S). They fell by the sword, died, and He brought them all back again into their own land.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">But Israel was a peculiarly favored people, says one. We remember Paul speaks of their restitution in Rom. 11: 25 to end. (Read carefully.) “ They are beloved forr the father’s sakes thereforre, they are all concluded in unbelief that God may have mercy unon </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">all,</span><span class="fornt5"> and ihey are to “ obtain [this] mercy through your [the church’s] mercy.” Perhaps this restitution refers only to this people; not to all nations. David says : All nations which thou hast made shall come and worship beforre thee;” [Christ] Numbers of nations never yet worshipped, either from love or fear. The Sodomites were such a nation. Let us consider their case next Surely, they were a sample of the ungodly ; there was no special favor of God ever manifested toward them as a people, neither was there any remnant of them left, when God rained “ fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">all”</span><span class="fornt5"> And yet, of these Sodomites we read, (Exek. 16: 4S to 63) that Israel shall return to </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">her forrmer estate at</span><span class="fornt5"> the same time that Sodom and Samaria return to theft forrmer estate (vs. 53 and 55). In verses 49 and 50 we are told what Sodom’s sin was ; and, says the Lord, <sup>u</sup> I took them away as I saw g&lt;&gt;od.” He saw good to take them away without their coming to a knowledge of Christ; it was not </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">due time</span><span class="fornt5"> forr that </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">to be testified</span><span class="fornt5"> ; but it will be in the future. God pronoses to bring them back to their forrmer estate ; what they lost by sin and death entering the world through the first Adam is to be restored in the second, and they will have the same opnortunity that be had, and better, in that the old serpent, the devil, Satan will be bound [or evil restrained] that he may deceive the nations no more until the thousand years are expired. But some one, not yet satisfied, says,perhaps God is speaking ironically, and means that he would as soon think of bringing Sodom and Samaria back as Israel. Friend, read caiefully vs. 60-63, and you will no longer think so; remember also that Sodom had been destroyed nearly a thousand years beforre this prophecy was made.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">This helps us to understand—“ God is His own interpreter”—what Jesus meant when He said it would be more tolerable forr Sodom in the day of judgment than forr the Jews whom He addressee!; He declares that if the same mighty works had been done in Sodom, she would have’repented long ago. Well, Lord, why were such mighty works not done there, so that they had repented V It was not their due time; they were not on trial. In (their day of trial, when they are on probation forr eternal life) their <sup>4</sup>‘ day of judgment” (not a 24-hour day, but the millennial or judgment age) they will fare better thdn the Jews—have fewer stripes. “It will be more tolerable forr Sodom in the day of judgment than forr you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">All must be judged or tried, and “ judgment must begin at the house of God”—the church. It did. Christ, the head, was tried in all noints, yet without sin. We, the members of that house, are now on trial. We will not come into the judgment—or trial with the woild. “ We shall not come into condemnation, (judgment—Krisis) but are passed from death unto life because of faith we are covered by Christ’s righteousness; because of the blood of Christ, our Paschal Lamb, sprinkled on our hearts and having th it Lamb in us, we, the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">first</span><span class="fornt5"> born, are </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">passed over.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">But after the House, all the world will come into trial forr life (judgment, Krisis). Those who accept </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="fornt5">God’s conditions will be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, (Rom. S: 21) ; those who will not have the gift of God must die the second, the eternal death.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">When the world is on trial we shall be the judges; forr, “ know ye not that the saints shall judge the world ?” It is here that the parable or the sheep and goats is laid, when the son of man shall sit on the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">throne of His glory.</span><span class="fornt5"> It is during the millennial age that He dbes sit on the throne of His glory ; and the overcomers sit with Him in the throne. </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Then</span><span class="fornt5"> beforre Him are gathered all nations, and the sheep will be separated from the goats ; they do not stand in rows nor all at once any more than the church has while she has been on trial ; the separating being a gradual work dependent unon their acceptance or rejection of God’s grace and truth. The things of their past lives forr which they must answer being inasmuch as ye have or have not done unto “ the least of these my brethren” (the church seated in the throne).</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We conclude, then, that it was necessary that evil should enter the world, so that by contact with it and its results—misery and death—we might forrever know good from evil. In no other way, perhaps, could God so fully make known to His creatures His various attributes—justice, mercy, love. etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">In the age which ended with the flood, God measurably left mankind to themselves,without law or control. In the results — degeneracy and corruption, demonstrating to us, that unassisted our tendency is downward. During the Jewish age, the law was given—not to give life, <sup>u</sup> For the Law could not give life’’ but to show them and us how far short we come of perfection, even at our best; that so we might realize the necesssity of salvation as a “ gift of God” which we cotdd not merit by the works of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">It was given “ because of transgression </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">until </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-variant:small-caps;">the seed</span><span class="fornt5"> should come” (Gal. 3 : 19 and 29). It was simply a system of types, etc., “ a shadow of good things to come”—the gospel,—and served as “ a schoolmaster to [educate] bring us to Christ,” in whom alone we can receive eternal life. This brings us to the Gospel Age, when although the scope of the Law—in spirit, is broader, deeper and more comprehensive than the letter, yet we can be justified through faith ; “ For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and forr sin, condemned sin in the flesh ; that the righteousness of the Law might be fultilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit” (Rom. 8 : 34.)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">All these various parts of God’s great plan we find &quot;working in harmony with each other, and with His own nature. In no other way could our minds recognize the justice of God in utterly destroying many nations beforre Israel—men, women and children— except that He “ slew great kings, forr His mercy endureth forrever.” “ He overthrew Pharaon and his host, forr His mercy endureth forrever.” Tes, the fact that “ His mercy endureth forrever” explains all this ; and it is twenty-six times repeated in this 136th Psalm. Now we can realize more fully than ever beforre, His wondrous love ; and as we kneel alone beforre Him we can feel that He is worthy of all homage and worship, forr not only <sup>u</sup> God is Lore” and <sup>u</sup> His </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">mercy</span><span class="fornt5"> endureth forrever,” but when our substitute tasted death forr all, “ lie is </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">just</span><span class="fornt5"> to forrgive.’? Our feelings are well expressed by St. Paul, when </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">writ</span><span class="fornt5">ing on the same subject (Rom. 11: 33)—<sup>44</sup> O, the depth of the ruhcs both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ; how unsearchable are His judgments and His ways past finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lora ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Truly the plan of God dbes show us the object of our Lord’s return. He comes to organize the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">one seed</span><span class="fornt5"> by which Satan is to be bruised—evil restrained and in which <sup>u</sup> ail the kindreds of the earth shall be blessed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">He comes to glorify or set up His kingdom—the church—that as we have “ suffered with Him we may also reign with Him.” <sup>4</sup>- That the saints of the Most High may take the kingdom under the whole heavens and nossess it forrever.” In taking nossession, it “ consumes and breaks in pieces all these kingdoms [not the people but the governments] and it shall stand forrever.” “Wait ye unon me, saith the Lord, forr my determination is to gather the nations that I may assemble the kingdoms to nour unon them mine indignation, even all my tierce anger, forr the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">whole earth shall be devoured</span><span class="fornt5"> with the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-variant:small-caps;">fire </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">of my jealousy.</span><span class="fornt5"> For then will I turn to the people a pure language that they </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">may all</span><span class="fornt5"> call unon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.” (Zeph. 3 ; 8). This chastisement of the world is not because God takes pleasure in human suffering, forr <sup>44</sup> He doth not willingly afflict the children of men,” but forr their good; and it is gratifying to learn that<sup>44</sup> when the judgments of the Lord are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.” When He hath made wars to cease unto the ends of the earth, bv the desolations which He hath made. (Ps. 40 : 8,” 10). When He has established His kingdom ; </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">then</span><span class="fornt5"> “ peace shall flourish.” “ Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn warany more.” Now “The devil is theprinceof this world.” Jesus said, “ My kingdom is not of this world,” but when “ He shall take unto Him His great power and reign.” when “ the kingdom </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">is</span><span class="fornt5"> the Lord's and He is </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">the Governor among the nations;</span><span class="fornt5"> [then. and not till then] all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">He comes now as “ the desire of all nations.” At the first advent there was no beauty in Him that they should desire Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">lie comes to bring about the great restitution which was so beautifully represented and shadowed forrth under the Law in “the year of Jubilee,” in which every man was restored to all His nossessions, and to personal liberty. (Lev. </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">25</span><span class="fornt5"> : 13.) The millennial reign is the great antitypieal jubilee, (the substance which cast the shadow in the Law) in which every man will have restored to him in the second Adam just what he lost in the first Adam, and have an opnortunity to know God and to learn of that only name by which they can be saved—Jesus ; who tasted death forr every man, to be testified in due time. Then the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad, the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose, the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, they shall see the glory of the Lord and the excellency of our God. (Isaiah 35 : 1,2-)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Now we all suffer from the sin of Adam, and the errors of our ancestors, even the innocent babe of an hour old, but “ In thosd they shall say no more, the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the children’s teeth are set on edge ; but every one shall die forr his own iniquity ; every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.” “ The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Jer. 31: 29; 30 ; Ezek. 18 : 3.)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Shall we not, then, take up the strain which employed the anostles and prophets of old 1 Will the hope of the corning of the Bridegroom, which inspired with zeal the early church, uot now energize us to strive forr the prize of our </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">high calling</span><span class="fornt5"> which is of God, in Christ Jesus?

<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">THE MANNER OF CHRIST’S SECOND COMING.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Having considered the object of our Lord’s return, the manner in which He will come becomes to all “ who love His appearing” one of great interest, and invites your attention. The reader will please bear in mint) that the subject is here treated abstractly, without the least reference to the time of the event, whether it be nigh, even at the door, or thousands of years future ; and further, that the.^e pages were not written forr the world, but forr “ the household of faith” forr those who accept the Bible as God’s word, and “ who by reason of use have their senses exercised.” (Heb. 5 : 14.) Experience has proven what {Scripture so plainly declares, viz. : that <sup>u</sup> the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God he can understand the arguments but “ they are forolishness unto him. Neither can he know' them because they are spiritually discerned.” (I Cor. 2 : 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">In order that we may have a good forundation, and as a basis forr further investigation, we will first enquire, what is a spiritual hotly ?—w’hat powers are theirs, and by what laws are they governed? We are here met by the objections—we have no right to pry into the hidden things of God ; and, *<sup>4</sup> Eye hath not seen, car heard, neither have entered into the</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">heart of man, the things which God hath prepared forr those that love him?’ To both of these pronositions we assent, but believe we cannot find out by studying God’s word—and our investigation will be confined to it—what He has not revealed. The above quotation of scripture, (I Cor. 2; 8) refers to the natural or carnal man, and by reading it, in connection with the three verses forllowing it, the objection vanishes ; forr, says the anostle, “ God hath revealed them unto </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">us</span><span class="fornt5"> by His spirit,” which was given to us that “ we </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">might know</span><span class="fornt5"> the things freely given unto us of Godand in the last clause of vs. 13, he gives us the rule by which we may know, viz. : “ Comparing spiritual things with spiritual.” We are very apt to invert this rule and compare spiritual things with natural, and thus get darkness instead of light Let us now use the anostle’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">There is a spiritual body as well as a natural body; an heavenly as well as an earthly body ; a celestial as well as a’terrestrial. They are distinct and separate. (I Cor. 15 : 38-49.) We know what the fleshly-natural body is, forr we now have such a one ; it is flesh, blood and bones ; forr <sup>u</sup> that which is born of the flesh is flesh,” and as there are two kinds of bodies, we know that the spiritual is not comnosed of flesh .’blood and bones, whatever it is made of. It is a spiritual body, and “ that which is boru of the spirit is spirit.” But as to what material a spiritual body is made of, we know not, forr it doth not yet appear </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">what</span><span class="fornt5"> we shall be; but we shall be like Him? [Christ]</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Angels are spiritual bodies. Christ was raised 3</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">from the dead a spiritual body ; this was His second birth. First, born of the flesh a fleshly body—forr, “ as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also himself likewise took part of the same.” (Heb. 2: 14) He was “ Put to death in the flesh but quickened [made alive] bj' the Spirit.” He was raised a spiritual body. This resurrection was His second birth. He was the “ first born* from the dead,” “ the first-born among many brethren.” The church are those brethren and will have a second birth of the same kind as His* viz.: to spiritual bodies by the resurrection, when we shall arise in His likeness—being made “ Like unto </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Christ's glorious tody.&quot;</span><span class="fornt5"> But, this second birthf must be preceded by a begetting of the spirit—conversion—just as surely as a birth of the flesh is preceded by a begetting of the flesh. Begotten of the flesh—born of the flesh—in the likeness of the first Adam, the earthy ; begotten of the spirit—in the resurrection born of the spirit into the likeness of the heavenly, the second Adam. “ As we have borne the image of the earthly we shall also bear the image of the</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">•The first raised a spiritual body. Lazarus and others arose, natural, fleshly bodies and died again. The next to be raised spiritual bodies are “They that are Christ's at His eomlng.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">» fThe words translated </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">begatten. begat</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> and torn in our English Bibles, are all represented by the one word in the Greek, </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">Genera</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> ; consequently we must judge as to which is the proper word, by the connection in which we find it. “Now are we the Sons of God although not yet born, we are begotten sons ; so in the natural the embryo is a son beforre birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">heavenly.” All who are begotten of the spirit are in a sort of embryo condition waiting forr the birth. The </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">head</span><span class="fornt5"> [Christ] has been born ; we are waiting forr the adoption, to wit : the redemption of </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">the body ;</span><span class="fornt5"> and, “ the whole creation groans and travails in pain,'’ waiting forr the birth of the church of the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">first-born. </span><span class="fornt5">We hope, then, by examining fact recorded &lt;»f angels, and of Christ after His resurrection to gain general inforrmation with regard to spiritual bodies ; thus “ comparing spiritual things with spiritual.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">First, angels can be, and frequently are, present, yet invisible ; forr, the angel of the Lord encamp-eth round about them that are His and delivereth them and “ are they not all ministering spirits, sent forrth to minister forr them who shall be heirs of salvation?” (Heb. 1: 14.) Are you an heir of salvation? Then, doubtless, they have ministerd to you ; have they ministered visibly or invisibly? undoubtedly the latter. Elisha is surrounded by a host of Assyrians, his servant is fearful; Elisha prayed to the Lord and the young man’s eyes were opened and he saw the mountains round about Elisha full of chariots of fire and horsemen of fire [or like fire]. The Lord also when raised a spiritual body was </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">present</span><span class="fornt5"> but </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">unseen,</span><span class="fornt5"> forr thirty-three days and forrty nights (only appearing seven limes to His disciples).</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Second, Angels can and have appeared </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">as</span><span class="fornt5"> men. The Lord and two angels appeared to Abraham, who had a supper prepared forr them, of which they ate. At first, Abraham supnosed them to be “ three men,” and it was not until they were about to go that he discovered one of them to be the Lord, and the other two angels, who afterward went down to Sodom and delivered Lot (Gen. 18: 1.) An angel appeared to Gideon ns a man, but afterward made himself known. An angel appeared to Samson’s mother and father ; they thought him a man until He ascended up to heaven in the flame of the altar. (Judges 13: 20.) • The angel of the Lord appeared to Moses </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">as</span><span class="fornt5"> a flame of fire : and, “ behold the bush burned, yet was it not consumed.” The angel of the Lord appeared to the children of Israel in the wilderness as a cloud bv day and a pillar of fire by night (Exodus 13 : 21 and 14: 19.) And doubtless many similar cases will recur to the mind of the reader. In some of these cases given, they appeared as men; but “ the Lord is not a manf” neither are angels men.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Third, spiritual bodies are glorious in their normal condition ; frequently snoken of as glorious and bright. The countenance of the angel who rolled away the stone from the sepulchre “ was as the lightning.” Daniel saw a glorious spiritual body wliose eyes were as lamps of fire, his countenance as the lightning, his armsand feet like in color to nolished ■brass, his voice as the voice of a multitude; beforre him Daniel fell as a dead man. (Daniel 10 : 6.) Jonn, on the isle of Patmos, saw Christ’s glorious body, (Rev. 1: 14) and describes the appearance in Almost the same language—His voice was as the sound of many waters, His eyes as lamps of fire, His feet like fine brass as it burns in a furnace, (so bright that you can scarcely look at it), Jonn falls at His feet as dead ; but He said to Him fear not; I am He that was dead ; behold I am alive forrevermore. Saul of Tarsus saw Christ’s glorious body. It shone above the brightness of the sun at noonday. Saul lost his sight and fell to the ground, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We have thus far forund spiritual bodies truly glorious ; yet. without a miracle, either the opening of our eyes to see them, or their appearing </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">in the flesh, as men,</span><span class="fornt5"> they are invisible. This conclusion is further confirmed when we examine the more minute details connected with these manifestations. The Lord was seen of Saul alone, “ they that journeyed with him....seeing no man.” (Acts 9: 7.) The men that were with Daniel did not see the glorious being he describes, but a great fear “ fell on them and they ran and hid themselves.” Again, this same glorious being declares : (Daniel 10: 13) “ The prince of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.” “ Daniel, the man greatly beloved” of the Lord, falls as dead beforre this one whom Persia’s prince withstands one and twenty days I How is this ? Surely, He did not appear in glory to the prince ; no ; either He was invisibly present'with him, or else He appeared </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">as</span><span class="fornt5"> a man.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">But Christ is also a spiritual body since His resurrection. During the forrty days of His presence beforre ascension, He appeared some seven or eight times to His disciples ; where was He the remainder of the time ? Present, but invisible. Notice also, that in each instance He is said to have </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appeared,</span><span class="fornt5"> or be </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">showed Himself,</span><span class="fornt5"> language never used of Him beforre His change from a natural to a spiritual body; now as angels He </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appeared.</span><span class="fornt5"> Not only so, but He appeared in different bodies as the gardener to Mary; “ after that. He </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appeared in another </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-variant:small-caps;">forrm,</span><span class="fornt5"> to two of them as they went into the country.” (Mark 16: 12.) Afterwards He appeared in a body, either the same </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="fornt5">like the one crucified, having the marks of the spear and the nails. “ He came and stood in their midst, the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">doors being shut.”</span><span class="fornt5"> On these various occasions He </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appeared</span><span class="fornt5"> talked with them, then vanished out of their sight as the wind : they could not tell whence He came nor whither He went. “ So is </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">every one</span><span class="fornt5"> that is </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">born</span><span class="fornt5"> of the spirit.” When we are born of the spirit, (at the resurrection) we can do so also, All spiritual beings exhibit this same power. But Jesus said : “handle me ; forr a spirit [pnewma] hath </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">not flesh and bones,</span><span class="fornt5"> as ye see me have” and He ate with them. True : 1 believe it. So did the angels [men] (Ileb. 1: 7), appear </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">as men</span><span class="fornt5"> in </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">flesh.</span><span class="fornt5"> and </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">ones ;</span><span class="fornt5"> they ate also ; their spiritual bodies did not eat, nor were they flesh and bones, but the body in which they </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appeared</span><span class="fornt5"> was flesh, and it ate. The disciples did not .&gt;ee Christ’s glorious spiritual body; but as He </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appeared</span><span class="fornt5"> in a fleshly body. St. Paul teaches us distinctly that Christ was raised from the dead </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="fornt5">life-giving spirit, </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">[pneuma.</span><span class="fornt5"> the same word used by our Lord.) (I Cor. 15 : 44, 45.) But where did He get the various bodies in which He appeared ? </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">I </span><span class="fornt5">cannot answer you ; but I believe, and you do also, other things which we cannot understand. I cannot understand </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">how</span><span class="fornt5"> that grain of wheat grows. Yet I know it dbes. I know not </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">how</span><span class="fornt5"> Christ turned the water into wine, or healed the sick, or raised the dead. Yet I believe that He did these things, Can you tel! me where He got the clothes He wore after His resurrection? “ They parted His raiment anions them, and forr His vesture they cast lots”—the old were gone, and the linen cloths lay in the sepulchre. Is it more difficult forr spiritual beings, with their powers, to create a covering of flesh than a covering of cloth ? No ; the same power can and did do both</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Thus we have forund Christ’s spiritual body like those of angels ; glorious, yet invisible to mortals, with power to manifest the glory, or appear as a man or in any forrm He may choose.* In the resurrection we shall be like the angels ; and ‘‘ like unto Christ’s glorious body.” We shall be like Him ; forr, [not ’til then] we shall see Him as </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">He is,</span><span class="fornt5">” forr though we have known Christ after the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Jlesh,</span><span class="fornt5"> yet now henceforrth know we Him no more.” [after the flesh.] (II Cor. 5 : 16.) Such a spiritual being was Christ, at the time of His ascension, and with what we have learned of the powers of that spiritual body, we are now, we hope, prepared to enquire :</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ HOW WILL HE COME AGAIN ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Briefly stated, we believe the scriptures to teach, that, at His coming and forr a time after He has come, He will remain invisible ; afterward manifesting or showing Himself in judgments and various forrms, so that “ every eye shall see Him.”*</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">•This scripture dbes not necessarily teach that every eye will see Him at the </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">same moment.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> A similar statement is made of the Resurrection. “ All that are in their graves hear the voice of the Son of Man and come forrth.’’ Taken by Itself this seems to teach of the resurrection </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">all al once.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> Yet wo</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">“ Every eye shall see Him” </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">as He will appear ; </span><span class="fornt5">but “ </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">without holiness no man shall see the Lord ” </span><span class="fornt5">as He is. ‘‘We shall see Him </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">as He is,</span><span class="fornt5"> forr we shall be </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">like Him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">SOME OF THE SCRIPTURE PROOF.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">“ Behold, I come as a thief<sup>,r</sup> is the way He frequently snoke of His coming to His disciples. He comes <sup>,:</sup>us a thief” forr the church — the waiting virgins ; both “ they that sleep in Jesus”—the first resurrection—and “we, who are alive and remain,” “shall be caught up io meet the Lord in the air; so shall we ever be with the Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ Forever with the Lord, Amen, so let it be ;</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Life from the dead is in that word, *Tfs immortality.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5"><sup>u</sup> In that day two shall be in the mill, two in the field, two in bed ; one be taken and the other left”— like Enoch, who “ was not, forr the Lord took him.” The world will go on with its affairs, unconscious of the great changes of dispensation. But will they not miss the church ? So many? Nay, but so few of the church. It is only </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">the overcomers</span><span class="fornt5"> that sit on the throne. It is but a “ </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">little Jlock</span><span class="fornt5"> to whom it is the</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">learn that “ Blessed and holy are </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">all</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> they that have part in </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">the first</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> resurrection.” So all shall be cognizant ot His presence though not all at the same moment. ** lie will be revealed in naming fire taking vengeance:” whether this refers to the “ tire of His jealousy—wrath—by which the whole earth Is to be devoured,” (Zeph. 1: IS &amp;&nbsp;3: 8) or an appearing In a visible flame as the angel appeared to Moses in the bush, is not clear. We Incline to the forrmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Father’s pleasure to give the Kingdom.” These ere “ the Temple these “ the Bride “these forllow the Lamb whithersbever He gbeth ;” “ these are redeemed </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">from among</span><span class="fornt5"> men, and are a </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">first fruit</span><span class="fornt5"> unto God and the Lamb.” (Rev. 14: 6.) These have obeyed the Master's injunction : “ Take heed, least vour hearts be overcharged with the cares of this life, and so that day come unon you </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">unawares ;</span><span class="fornt5"> forr as a snare shall it come unon all them [who are over-charged] that dwell unon the face of the whole earth.” (Luke 21 : 35.) These are </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">“accounted, </span><span class="fornt5">worthy to escape all these things (“the day of wrath on the world;” “ the time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation”)—They “ stand beforre the son of man.” But there are numbers of overcharged Christians who will not be counted worthy to escape (caught up to meet Him) ; servants, but not overcoming servants: not hynocrites, but “they shall have their nortion with the hynocrites.” They did not build “ with gold, silver, precious stones,” and do not have the abundant enhance; but they built unon the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">rock</span><span class="fornt5"> and “ themselves shall be saved, as by fire.” Many will be purified of their dross in that fire. “ When the judgments of the Lord are abroad in the earth, the inhabitants of tire world will learn righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">These, doubtless, constitute a part of the “great company that no man could number,” who “ come up out of [etc., after] great tribulation.” This countless company is not the “ little flock,” “ the temple,” nor do they “ </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">sit in</span><span class="fornt5"> the throne,” but these “ serve God </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">in</span><span class="fornt5"> His temple,” and are </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">around</span><span class="fornt5"> the throne; these “ washed their robes,” (Rev. 7: 9-17) while the ** little flock” have </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">while robes granted</span><span class="fornt5"> or given </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="fornt5">them, Christ’s righteousness. (Rev. 19 : 8.)’Xo ; the “little flock/’ — the bride, — is a very select company. There will be so few taken from the present generation that they will not be much missed. True, the forolish virgins will miss them ; (virgins, undefiled, but not wise) ; they will recognize&quot; the fact that the others have gone into the marriage, when they say ‘‘Lord, Lord, open unto us.” But Christ has </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">bat one bride;</span><span class="fornt5"> the door to that marriage is forrever closed. Christian brethren will know, but the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">world </span><span class="fornt5">will not believe in translation ; and in the time of trouble which forllows the taking away of the “ salt </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="fornt5">the earth,” newspaper renorters will have little difficulty in accounting plausibly forr their disappearance ; forr <sup>u</sup> not many great, wise, rich, or mighty, hath God chosen, but the noor of this world, rich in faith, </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">heirs of the kingdom.*'</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The second advent, like the first, covers a period </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="fornt5">time, and is not the event of a moment. The first lasted nearly thirty-forur years; and the events connected with it — His birth, baptism, sorrow death, resurrection, etc., as mentioned hj’ the prophets, all took place </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">at</span><span class="fornt5"> the first advent. The second advent, as we have seen, lasts much longer. It includes the millennial reign, and prophecy covers all the prominent features of that reign. lie comes </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="fornt5">reign—must reign until He lias put down all enemies ; the last being death. (I Cor. 15: 25.)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">In the application of prophecy to the events of the first advent, we recognize order. Christ- must be the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">” child</span><span class="fornt5"> born and son given” beforre “ the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">man</span><span class="fornt5"> of sorrows and acquainted with grief.” He must die beforre He could </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">rise</span><span class="fornt5"> from the dead, etc. So also in studying prophecy referring to the second advent we must recognize order: we &quot;must judge of the order somewhat by the character of the event.. As the wife is the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">glory</span><span class="fornt5"> of the husband, so the Bride is the f lory of Christ, forr “ we are called to eternal glory y Christ Jesus ;” and are to be “partakers of oi the glory that shall be revealed,” (I Pet. 5:1-10.) and as “the glory shall be </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">revealed in</span><span class="fornt5"> as.” (Rom. 8: IS.) We know that Christ could not come in the glory of his kingdom [church] until he has first gathered it from the world, and in harmony with this thought we read—“When </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">He</span><span class="fornt5"> shall </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appear,</span><span class="fornt5"> we also shall </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appear with Him</span><span class="fornt5"> in glory.” (Col. 3 • 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The prophets forretold the &quot;sufferings of Christ [head and body] and the glory that should forllow. If the sufferings were of the' </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">whole body,</span><span class="fornt5"> so is tho </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">glory</span><span class="fornt5"> we suffer with him that we may be also </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">“glorified together<sup>11</sup></span><span class="fornt5"> (Rom. 8 : 17.) “ Enoch prophesied saying—the Lord cometh </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">with</span><span class="fornt5"> ten thousands of his saints.” [gr. </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">hagios,</span><span class="fornt5"> never translated angel.] (Jude. 14 ) Again, (Zach. 14: 5,) we read—“ the Lord my God shall come and </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">all thy saints with thee}<sup>1</sup></span><span class="fornt5"> Thus we learn that when He </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appears</span><span class="fornt5"> in glory we are with Him, and of course we must be caiight to meet Him beforre we could appear with Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We have further evidence to offer, proving that He comes unknown to the world ; but will attempt to answer two supnosed objections first; viz.: “ This same Jesus shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven,” (Acts 1:11.) and “ The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the arch-angel and the trump of God ; and the dead in Christ shall rise.” SThes. 4 : 16 ) These texts are supnosed to teach</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">at Christ will come visible to every eye, while the air is rent with the blast of the arch-angel’s trumpet ; at which, mid reeling tombstones and opening graves the dead will be resurrected. It certainly has that appearance on the surface, and doubtless was intended to be so understood until due, [so also at the first advent] but look at it again; would that be coming in </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">luce manner</span><span class="fornt5"> as they saw Him go? He did not go with the sounding of a trumpet and outward demonstration. It dbes not say </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">you shall see</span><span class="fornt5"> Him coming, nor that </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">any one</span><span class="fornt5"> would see, but—He shall so come. For instance, the Prince Imperial of the French visits Paris under disguise as a civilian ; as he leaves Paris his servant says to you, privately, “ this same Prince shall so come again in like manner as you have seen him go from Paris.” Whether you or any one will see him is not mentioned, simply the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">manner</span><span class="fornt5"> in which he will return. You would understand the servant doubtless to mean that the Prince would come back privately. If he should return in all the glory of the French Empiwe, bands playing, trumpets sounding and cannon roaring, with thousands of soldiers in attendance, you would say that his servant had either ignorantly or wilfully misinforrmed you. Our Prince left the glory which he had with the Father, made himself of no reputation, took unon Him the forrm of a servant, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">When He visited us He went away unglorified; His servant, the .angel, said—“ He shall so come in like manner.’’ When he arrives it will be privately. He comes to organize us, as his kingdom; to set us up. He conies to be glorified in his saints in that day. (II Thes. 1:10.1 The world saw him not after His resurrection, they did not see him ascend. As He said, “yet a little while and the world seeth me no more,” nor will they see him at the second advent until His church is gathered, forr “when he shall </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appear</span><span class="fornt5"> we also shall </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">appear</span><span class="fornt5"> with him.” What then dbes the trumpet mean? Let us see. We are to be rewarded “at the resurrection,” we surely will not be rewarded twice nor resurrected twice. We conclude, thereforre, that the “Trump of God,” (I Thes. 4:16) and the ** Last Trump,” (I Cor. 15 : 52,) are the same, differently expressed; the same events are mentioned as occurring at each, viz.: the resurrection and reward of the saints, and forr the. same rea-sons we believe the “ Trump of God ” and “ Last Trump” to be the “ Seventh Trump” of Rev. II: 15-18. Under it also the dead are judged and the prophets and saints rewarded. Thereforre the “ Seventh Trump” is the “ Trump of God,” and the “ Last trump.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">These trumpets evidently are the same, but what? The seventh angel sounded. A sound on the air ? Ko, not any more than the six which preceded it They are each said to sound, and Sir Isaac Kewton, Clarke, and all commentators of note agree that five </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">or six of </span><span class="fornt5">these trumpets are in the past.* They have been fulfilled in events unon the Earth, each covering a period of time. They certainly must ali sound beforre the resurrection, forr that is under the seventh. It is In the days (symbolic time, all the other features are symbolic years) of the sounding of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound [or forre part] the mystery [Gospel Church] of God shall be finished.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">If the Seventh trump were to make a sound on the air, it would not only be out of harmony with the other six of the series, but also with all of God’s past dealings with the children of men. That it covers “the great day of His wrath,” the time of judgments unon the kingdoms of the world and of the nouring out of the “seven vials” of His wrath, the “time of trouble such as was not since there was a nation” seems more than probable, forr we are told in the same sentence of the wrath of God coming on the nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Each of these trumpets are sounded by an angek t. the events mentioned are directed or controlled by an angel; hence might well be said to be their voice. We know that signs speak, and that sometimes </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">events</span><span class="fornt5"> or “ actions, speak </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">louder than words.” Of</span><span class="fornt5"> the names of the angles directing the first six of the series we know nothing, but Paul seems to teach</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">♦The writer believes that we are now living under the sounding of the </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">Seventh,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> that it Inis been sounding forr more than thirty years, and cont inues during the time of trouble, and until the Kingdom of the Lord is Universal Empire. </span><span class="fornt5">that the Seventh is under the control of the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">archangel-,</span><span class="fornt5"> and this seems to bring a connection between the time of wrath under the seventh trump, and the “ time of trouble” of Dan. 12: 1, under “Michael;” forr Jude inforrms us that </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Michael, is Ute arch-angel. </span><span class="fornt5">Verse 2 connects this with the resurrection also.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">We see then, that the sounding of the trumpets, and so coming in like manner, do not coutik-t but rather add forrce to the fact that He comes unawares,” “as a thief” and steals away from the world His treasure, His jewels;” remember too that this is Christ the spiritual body, that could not be seen without a miracle, that was present yet unseen during thirty-three days after his resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">But will the world not see the saints when gathered ot gathering ? No: they are changed (in the twinkling of an eye) from Natural to spiritual bodies, like unto Christ’s glorious body, and will be as invisible as He and angels. But those who arise from their graves ?—No, they were sown (buried) natural bodies, they are raised spiritual bodies—</span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">invisible. </span><span class="fornt5">Won’t the world see the graves open and tombstones thrown down ? A spiritual body (remember we arc comparing spiritual things with spiritual not natural) coming out of the grave will not make any more of a hole In the ground than Christ’s spiritual body made in the door when “ lie came and stood in their midst, the doors being shut.’**</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">•It should not be forrgotten that only the church are raUed spiritual bodies, all others, natural tleshly bodies as Lazarus, &lt;Se.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">THE PRESENCE OF CHRIST BEFORE THE RAPTURE OF THE CHURCH.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Christ's personal presence and ministry of three </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">and a </span><span class="fornt5">half years at the first advent, He terms—“ </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">The harvest.’<sup>1</sup></span><span class="fornt5"> It was the harvesting of the Jewish or Law age. Christ was present as the chief reaper. His disciples as under-reapers; their work was the gathering of wheat into the higher or Gospel dispensation ;—that harvest ceased at His death, and was the end of that age. Jesus said to flis disciples, <sup>44</sup> Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, forr they are white already to harvest.” <sup>44</sup>1 sent you to reap that whereon yebestowed no labor, other men </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="fornt5">labored [the prophets] and ye are entered into their labors” (Jonn 4: 3S.) That this work was not general, nor to the world we might presume from </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="fornt5">fact that Heconfined His labors to Judea, but it is settled beyond doubt by the commission given to the disciples, viz: Go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go ve rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, (Matt. 10: 5 ) forr <sup>4-</sup>I am not sent save to </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="fornt5">lost sheep of the house of Israel,” and the work </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="fornt5">them did not cease until five days beforre His death, when he rode on the ass into &quot;the city, wept </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">over </span><span class="fornt5">it, gave them up and </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">their house</span><span class="fornt5"> was left unto them desolate. Where God's favor toward them as </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="fornt5">nation ceased, it began toward the world (Rom. 11: 30) forr “Jesus Christ by the grace of God tasted death forr every man,” and after His resurrection He sends </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="fornt5">disciples to <sup>44</sup> preach the Gospel to every nation.” But it is no longer a harvest; the church dbes not reap but sows the seed. Paul plants, Ap-nollos waters, God gives increase, etc. But there is to be a harvest in the end of this age, as </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">illustrated </span><span class="fornt5">in the parable of the tares and wheat, and </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">taught</span><span class="fornt5"> in the explanation of the same. Notice that both wheat and tares, are in the kingdom of heaven,—the church —and that this parable, as also the other six. of the series, refers not to the non-professing world, but to two classes in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The Son of Han planted the church pure, all good seed. During the days of the Anostles there were special “ gifts of the Spirit<sup>7</sup>’ such as “ discerning of spirits, etc.,” by which they were able to prevent </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">tares</span><span class="fornt5"> getting in among the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">wheat—</span><span class="fornt5">hynocrites getting into the church, (instance I Cor* o : 3.— “Simon Magus”—“Ananniasand Sapphira,” etc.) but when the Anostles were dead, “while men slept”—the enemy began to sow tares, among the wheat. Paul says that the mystery of iniquity had begun to work even in his day; now, they grow side by side in all our churches. Shall we separate them, Lord? No, (we might make some mistake, pull up wheat, and leave tares,) “ let both grow together until </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">the Harvest”</span><span class="fornt5"> (Matt. 13.) The harvest is the end of the world” </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">[aion, aye.]</span><span class="fornt5"> In the time of harvest I will say unto the reapers,—the reapers are the angels—“gather together </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">jirst</span><span class="fornt5"> the tares, and bind them in bundles </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">to</span><span class="fornt5"> burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Notice, this </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Harvest</span><span class="fornt5"> is the end of this age, yet, like the one ending, the Jewish age, it is a period of 4</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">time,—<sup>M</sup>.In the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">time</span><span class="fornt5"> of harvest;”—secondly there is order,—“ gather </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">first</span><span class="fornt5"> the tares.” There will come a time, then, in the end of this age, when the reapers —angels—will ’be present doing some sort of a separating work in the church ; and yet it is an invisible presence, forr when the wheat is gathered (after the binding of the tares)—translated, when we which are alive are caught up to meet the Lord—when taken they are in the held, mill and bed ; would they be so engaged if the)* had seen angels going about gathering tares ? No ; it is an invisible work, done by beings invisible without a miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Again, beforre the living are gathered, the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">dead in (Christ</span><span class="fornt5"> must have risen, whether it be but a moment beforre; “ the dead in Christ rise </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">first, then</span><span class="fornt5"> we which, are alive, &amp;c.” (IThess.4: 16.) This harvest is net of the living only, but also of “ the dead in Christ”—“ those that sleep in Jesus.” The angels gather the living, but our Lord, who is the chief reaper here, (as He was in the Jewish harvest! gathers or raises the dead. “I will raise him up;” “I atu the resurrection and the life;” and in harmony with this thought the harvest is brought to our notice in Rev. 14 :15—“One like uuto the Son of man, seated on a cloud,” reaps the earth, Here, two harvests, or two parts of one harvest, are shown, the second being the casting of the vine of the earth into the wine-press of His wrath ; doubtless the parallel to the burning of the bundled tares (time of trouble) after the wheat is garnered. The special noint to which your attention is called, however, is the fact that the harvest will go on without outward demonstration, the chief and under-reapers being present but unseen.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">THE PRESENCE (PAROUSIA) OF CHRIST.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">Some may have conforunded our remarks on the presence of Christ in a spiritual body, with the presence of the spirit of Christ; but they are quite distinct. The latter never left the church ; consequently in that sense He could not “ come again?* Of His spiritual presence He said : “ Lo, I arh with you always, even unto the end of the world.” We refer to the personal presence which did go away, and will come again,—a spiritual </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">body.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt5">The Greek word generally used in referring to the second advent—</span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">Parousia,</span><span class="fornt5"> frequently translated </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">coming—</span><span class="fornt5"> invariably signifies </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">personal presence,</span><span class="fornt5"> as having come, arrived* and never signifies to </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">be </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-variant:small-caps;">on </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">the</span><span class="fornt5"> way. as we use the word coming. This fact is recognized by many who are looking forr the Lord, but the error under which the church in general is laboring, is that of supnosing that presence implies sight, manifestation, appearance. In the Greek, however, other words are used to express revelation, appearing and manifestation, viz.: </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">phanervo</span><span class="fornt5"> —rendered sliall appear in “ when He shall appear, &amp;c.,”—and </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">anoka-lupsis]—</span><span class="fornt5">rendered, shall be revealed—IL Thess. 1 :7. <a name="forotnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark6">2</a></sup><sup></sup>&nbsp;“When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed.” But we have Christ's own words to prove that He will be present in the world, and the world will know not of it Matt. 24 : 37. We read: “ As the days of Noah were so shall also the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">parousia</span><span class="fornt5"> (presence) of the Son of man be.” The presence of Christ is not compared to the flood, but to the days of Noah, the days that were beforre the flood,’as verse 38 shows ; as then they ate, drank, married, etc., and </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">knew</span><span class="fornt5"> not, so shall also the presence of the Son of man be. The resemblance here mentioned is that of </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">not knowing,</span><span class="fornt5">-they will not </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">know</span><span class="fornt5"> of the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">presence</span><span class="fornt5"> of Christ. They may have been wicked then, and doubtless were and may be similarly wicked in His presence; but wickedness is not the noint of comparison, as then they ate, drank, married—proper enough things to be doing, not sins; so shall it be in Christ’s presence. Now, look at Luke 17 :26. “As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” Verse 27 tells how it was in the days of Noah ; they were eating, drinking, marrying, etc. “ So shalfit be </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">in the days</span><span class="fornt5"> of the son of man.” Surely the days of the son of man are not </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-style:italic;">beforre His clays,</span><span class="fornt5"> any more tlian the days of Henry Clay could be days beforre he was born. No ; the more we examine the more we are convinced that the world will go on as usual, and know not, until “ the harvest is past, the summer ended, and they are not in the ark, not with the little flock “ accounted worthy to escape.” There will be no outward demonstration of the second advent having begun, and Christ being present, until the church is Sithered, whenever it takes place—soon, or in the distant future.</span></p>

<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">CHAPTER III.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="fornt3" style="fornt-weight:bold;">THE KINGDOM OF GOD.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The Scriptures everywhere recognize the church as the kingdom. The kingdom of heaven is likened to “ Ten Virgins,” to “ Wheat and Tares,” to a net in which are caught both good and bad fish, etc. These figures or parables represent the church in the present time, good and bad mixed, in the nominal church of Christ; they so continue to represent the kingdom until the end of this age, [world] the “ harvest” time, then the wise and forolish virgins, good and bad fish, and wheat and tares are separated. This kingdom is now “ subject to the powers (governments, kingdoms) that be,” forr “ the Eowers that be are ordained of God.” This kingdom as promise of ail authority and power, and the time will come when “The kingdom (ruling power) under the whole heavens shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, and they shall nossess it forrever.” “ The little flock” to whom “ it is the Father’s good pleasure to give the kingdom” is now being tried, being made perfect through suffering. being prepared by contact with suffering and sin forr the nosition to which they are to be exalted, that as “ kings and priests” they may be able to sympathize with those over whom in the millennial age they are called to rule. We are to be joint heirs with Christ in His kingdom and throne, and cannot enter unon our reign uutil <sup>u</sup> He takes His great power and reigns.’* That will not be until the end of the world or age; fnr Jesus says, ** My kingdom is not of this world,” “The devil is the prince of this world.” Christ’s kingdom and ours is o' the next age; then “ the Son </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">of </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">man shall sit on the throne of His glory.” Now He is “ seated at the right hand of God,” ** sat down with the Father on His throne ” The setting up of the kingdom for our separation from the world, forolish virgins and tares ; the glorifying of the wheat which then shines forrth as the sun. But how will this kingdom rule over the world </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">f</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> Will it have Jerusalem forr its capital or seat of empire ? Will Christ sit In Jerusalem unon the throne of David ? “ Jerusalem shall be rebuilt unon her old heaps as in the forrmer time,” Israel after the flesh will again be the chief nation, and “a praise in the whole earth*,” forr “ the mouth of the Lord hath snoken it.” But fleshly Israel is not and never again will be “ the kingdom of God.” They were once, but it was taken from them and given to another people, children of Abraham by faith—-the church. Under the sounding of the seventh trumpet all the kingdoms of the world (now under the control of Satan) become the “ kingdoms of our Lord ” (They pass into the </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">nossession</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> of Christ and under the rule of His kingdom—the devil being bound.)— Rev. 20: 2. Israel, with their capital at Jerusalem, will doubtless be chief of these fleshly nations, but it will no more be the </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">Hcatt-iily kingdom</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> than they.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Jesus says unless a man t&gt;c born again, born of the Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God neither enter into it. (Jonn 3: 3-5.) The kingdom of heaven is a spiritual kingdom and cannot be seen by mortals, any more than Satan’s kingdom at the present time. We never see Satan’s kingdom nor his throne, but we realize its power. Ihis accords with our Lord’s statement when He was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come. He answered and said unto them: the kingdom of God cometh not with observation, [margin, outward show] neither shall they say, Lo, here! or Lo, there 1 For behold the kingdom of God is within you [in your midst.]—certainly not in the hearts of those Pharisees. The kingdom will be preseut in the world, controlling it, yet unseen. How, then, can Christ sit unon the thnmeof David? None will argue that the throne of David, which is cast down and is to be raised up, means the pieces of wood, etc., on which David sat. What then? The word throne is there used as the representative of power—ruling authority, (we use it so to-day). When God’s kingdom was on the fleshly plane, David represented Him. The throne was then the Lord’s and “ David sat unon the throne of the kingdom of the Lord.” So also of his sun it is written, “Solomon aat unon the throne of the Lord in the room of his father David.” It is not the piece of wood that is here referred to; words are but symbols to represent ideas. The one here represented is, that the control once vested in David, afterwan! thrown down, [removed] and the affairs of the earth given into the hands of the Gentiles, (Luke 21: 24) is to be restored in Christ, on a higher plane; first, the natural, afterward, the spiritual, seems to be God’s order in everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Jerusalem, when rebuilt, will not be the kingdom of God ; forr all, whether born again or not, could see it. It would have outward show; men would say: Lo, here! and Lo, there! The heavenly city Jerusalem itself is the bride,.the church. Come hither and I will show thee thebriiTe; and He showed me the “ </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">Holy Jerwnbim” </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">In Scripture a </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">city</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> is frequently used as the symbol of a government or institution. (See Isa 14: 31; Jer. 33:5-7; Rev. 11:2; 14.8; 16:19; 17: IS)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">But will the world not see Christ on His throne when they shall “ say to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth unon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb; forr the great day of his wrath is come.” Will they see nothing? &quot;The day of the Lord so cometh [on the world and forolish virgins] as a thief’—a snare. The class here referred to are represented as recognizing the fact, that “ the great day of His wrath has come,” the lime of trouble; they now realize it. “ He shall be revealed [to them] in flaming fire, [terrible judgments] taking vengeance, etc.” What sort of rocks and mountains do you supnose they will pray to have full on them—literal mountains? No; few saints have the faith to pray forr mountains to fall, while the wicked have not faith to pray forr small things; besides what would we think of a man who wanted to die and could think of no more simple method than to be crushed by a mountain. But these do not seek destruction: they want to be co rered—protected—in this time of trouble—day of wrath—“ when every man’s hand is against his neighbor,” when “ the mountains [kingdoms] are moved out of their places;” forr &quot;all the kingdoms [mountains] that are unon the face of the earth shall be thrown down.” The mountains [kingdoms] shall melt and flow down like was </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">at the</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> presence of the Lord. During the time of commotion and general national destruction, the “dashing in pieces”of governments, men will seek protection—covering—hiding in the great and strong kingdoms of the world- Men will say there is Great Britain, Russia, etc.; they are strong, they protect their citizens, let us become citizens of such. They will seek hiding, also, In such great rocks of worldly society as Free Masoury, Odd Fellowship, etc-, but uoue of these</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">(can protect fully) shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord’s auger. Every mountain shall be moved out of its place. Then the “stone [church] be* comes a great mountain and fills the whole earth.” Although invisible it will be real; forr, as Paul says, “the things whiclrare.seen are temnoral, but the things that are </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">not seen</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> are-eternal. It will be a peaceful kingdom: forr “He maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the earth” Peace is established on a sure basis, by the breaking in pieces of the worldly governments. “ Every man may then sit under his own vine and fig tree, with none to molest or make him afraid.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">' “Now the world is full of suffering, Sounds of woe full on my ears, Sights of wretchedness and sorrow Fill my eyes with pitying tours ;</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">•Ti* the earth’s dark night of weeping. Wrong and evil triumph now;</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">I can wait, forr just beforre me Beams the morning’s roseate glow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">If this is the character of the kingdom of God, spiritual, invisible, how can we be “ kings and priests,” or in any ■way teach or minister to the world *? If we are of tins high order of beings, spiritual, glorious, like Christ, men in the flesh would fall beforre us, as Saul, Daniel and Jonn did beforre glorious beings. True; but as in past ages, angels, when it was necessary, appeared </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">as men</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> under the veil of the flesh, (Heb. 10: 20) so we in the next age will appear to men. Now and in the past ages angels have been the ministers, (Heb. 1: 14) but “ unto the angels hath He net put in subjection the world to come, (Heb- 2: 5) but unto Christ,” head and body. (Compare Rev. 2: 27, Psalm 2:8 and 8: 4.) Moses, as a type of Christ, llliutmtes this. The first tables of the law were broken in pieces, and now a second was to be given. When Moses with two tables came down the mountain, from the presence of the Lord, his face shone, so that the people could not look at him. Afterward he put on a veil; then they came to him, he conversed with them and delivered to them the law of God. Afterward when he talked with the people he wore the veil, but when he went into the Lord's presence he laid it off. (Exod. 34: 30.) Moses was the minister in the type. We are the ministers of the new covenant—the antitype. If the type “ was glorious, how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather [more] glorious?” (II Cor. 3:9). As he did so will we do. When ministering to and teachin&quot; the people we will wear a veil,—“ the flesh”— the glorious body will be covered, tho veil of flesh seen. We will appear </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">an men,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> but when we go into the presence of the Lord we lay it off—“enter into that within [beyond} the veil.” As in the type, Moses first appeared in glory, and the people trembled and feared, so, during this time of trouble, which introduces the Xew Law/New Age, the Millennium, there will be outward manifesta-sions of the power and glory of the new kingdomat which “ all faces shall gather paleness, and their knees shall smite one against another.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ He’ll rule the world with truth and grace, And make the nations prove</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The ffh.ri v ot Hie righteousness And wonders of Mb love.”</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The nositions taken we believe to be strong. They commend themselves as strong to thinking Christians because of the vast amount of scripture which favor them. Because they harmonize what has l&gt;een to main* minds contradictory statements and teachings in the Bible; show a harmony between the character of God and his works; and display* His attributes, </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">mercy. justice, love, etc.,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> to perfection. XVe believe that the real </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">object of</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> the second advent has been presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The manner we think, equally well established, whether it be an event of our lifetime or not. But forr the church to be left without light on so imnortant a subject, would seem strange, would it not? It would be contrary to precedent. Noah knew of the flood; Lot of the Are, etc. They may not have known the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-variant:small-caps;">day and hour,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> but they certainly had some knowledge of the nearness of the events beforre they came. Are we who expect to be gathered utterly at sea without means of knowing anything whatever about the time? Did Jesus not say, that day should not come unon those who watched. unawares? [without their knowing). He did; but he also said “ye know not when the time is; what I say unto one I say unco ail, watch!” Yes, but shall we supnose that He meant watch, because you will never know, or because you know not? watch </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">that you may</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> know. Let us look nt the strongest of this class of texts; “Of that day and hour knoweth no man; no not the angels in heaven; neither the Son, but my Father only: Watch ye thereforre.” Now notice: This dbes not read </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> that day and hour no man shall ever know—but no mau </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">knoweth.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> Jesus said that He himself did not know </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">then;</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> will he never know until he comes? Will he not know the hour beforre he comes—at least? (The writer dbes not think the </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">day</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">hour</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> of our translation </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">is</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> or will be known; but believes the scriptures to teach that we will have a </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">general knowledge</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> of our whereabouts beforre that event occurs, if we are walking; in the light which shines from the word). Let us look at Bro- B’s illustration of</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt3" style="fornt-weight:bold;">THE BESIEGED FORT.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The forrt is besieged. The General commanding the attack sends word to all non-combatants living in and dangerously near it, that as he is about to undermine and blow up the forrt; they must remove or take the consequences. But it will require some time to accomplish the work. He thereforre gives them certain signals by which they may know, ami says: I will display a blue signal when the excavation is complete; a red one when the powder is properly arranged; and when the fuses are laid and everything ready, a green signal; and ye may know that at forur o’clock of that day, the explosion will occur. But of that day and hour knoweth no man; no not the engineers who will do the work, nor myself; God alone knows the future. What I say unto oue I say unto all, watch, forr ye know not when the time is. Now what would those people look forr? Not the explosion— but the signals. Did the General mean forr them to watch because they could never know, or in order that they might know? Undoubtedly the latter. So our captain told ns to watch. Not to watch the sky, but our chart. “ We have a more sure word of prophecy to which we do well to take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn,&quot; says Peter. Now, hear Paul: turn to and read carefully, I Thes. 5:1-9; try to distinguish between the church and the world; ye and you vs. they and them. “ Ye brethren know that the day of the Lord so comoth as a thief in the night [on all? No. on the world ami overcharged servant 1~-when </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">they</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> shall say peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh unon </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">them*</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> The next clause tells Low sudden. Not sudden like a dash of lightning, but as ---and </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">they</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> shall not escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“But </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> brethren are </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">not in darknese</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> that </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">that day</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> should overtake </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">you</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> as a thief.” Although in the presence of the</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Son of man the world will not know, yet the church, ye brethren, are expected to know, not from outward sign but from the light shining unon the pathway. Our Father undertakes to furnish the light as fast as it is due, but we must walk in it if we would not be in darkness.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The day of the Lord is frequently referred to as a snare or trap into which those without light go unawares. Ji </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">a thief </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">it comes stealthily. But some thiuk as a thief means suddenly; we thiuk not. but if it dbes, then “ ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should come unon you </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">suddenly.&quot;</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> When Jesus said: “ 11 thereforre thou shall not watch, thou shalt not know what hour I will come unon thee.’’ It seems as though ho meant, if you are watching you shall know. Dees it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">But it is not my object in this pamphlet to call your attention more fully to the </span><span class="fornt5" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-variant:small-caps;">time</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> of the second advent chan I have above, in answering some of the chief objections to the investigation of it (Those interested in knowing the evidences as to the time, I would refer to Dr. N. H. Barbour, editor of the “Heraldof the Morning,&quot; Rochester. N. V. j I simply add that I am deejdy impressed, and thiuk. not without good scriptural evidence, that the Master is come and is now inspecting the guests to the marriage. (Matt. 22:11.) That tho </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">harvest</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> is progressing, the separation imental) between wheat atid tares tiu* going on, and that the two in the ticl&lt;I, mill and bed may be bodily separated at any moment, the wise virgins go into the marriage, and the door to the </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">high culmination </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">be forrever shut.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Even the outward signs seen by the world, seem to noint to the fact that a great dispettsutional change may be near. From their stand-noint the last century would seei'n to be the “day of [God's] preparation.&quot; Improvements and inventions progress us never beforre. Now we are beginning to realize that these inventions, which in and of themselves are blessings. are, under present conditions of society, a curse. Every machine made, after a certain limit, tends tv decrease the demand forr each mechanic’s labor; supply and demand regulates the wages he receives. To-day there is employment fur less than three-forurths of the industrial labor or this as well as other lands, and even this number average but half time; what will itbe a few years hence? The prophet, describing the timo of trouble, implies that it will be brought about by lack of employment. “There shall be no hire forr man nor hire forrbeast, every man's hand against his neighbor,” etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Yet all these things which tend to decrease the necessity of manual labor, and many more, yet undeveloped or unknown, will in the millennial age minister to the comforrts and necessities of the world. In fact, humanly ?[&gt;eaking the Millen-nial Era would be an imnossibility without them. When the kingdom is the Lord’s, right and Justice will hold the reins, oppression and strikes will alike give place to equity. These inventions will be used forr the benefit not alone of a class but of the whole, they will serve not merely to the accumulation </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">of</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> dollars, but to the intellectual enrichment of all classes, and “ a I shall know the Lord from the least to the greatest.'*</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Beloved, if it now fills our hearts to overflowing even to think of the many, great, exceeding precious promises made to the bride, what will the realization of them be ? They all centre in and have their fulfilment when we shall be like Him, and see Him as He is. These are “good tidings of great joy which </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">shall be</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> to </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">allpeople,”</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> (Luke 2: 11.)</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Reader, are you Christ’s servant? If so, are you a faithful, watching servant? Are you building on Christ, the rock? If so, with what? gold, silver, precious stones, or wood and stubble? Are vou a virgin? a wise or a forolish oue? You was called and accepted to run a race; so run that you may obtain. The Master saith &quot;to him that overcunteth” the prize ahull be. Surely, that prize could be no greater; it is the grandest that even God can offer; to make us His sons and give us a joint-heirship with Christ. Like Paul, let us count all things as loss and dross, while we press toward the mark forr the prize of our high calling.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">What can you do ? Believe His word; walk in the light which shines from it; live up to what you have and look forr more. It will sanctify you; set you apart; separate you from the world; your thoughts, your talents, your influence and your purse. This is the Loras rule forr our sanctiiicatiou:</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ Sanctify them through Thy truth; Thy word is truth.” If you fully realize how select this “little flock&quot; is, and how desirable a matter it is to attain it, your thought will probably be, it is too high forr me: lam unworthy; I have never done anything to merit such high honors. Brother, sister, there Will not Ue one of that bride company there because they merited it, nor because of their works. Their relies tire not their righteousness; they could not appear in those. The wedding garment is Christ’s righteousness—imputed—given unto us because of faith. We must believe God if we would be accepted. “Without faith it is imnossible to please God.” We must come to Him as little children, anxious to know and do His will if we would enter the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The overcoming which is rewarded with a seat with Him on His throne, is not of </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">works,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> but </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">ot faith.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> “This is the victory that overcouieth the world, even your faith.&quot; I would not speak disparagingly of works, except as </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">the ground of our acceptance.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> A foruntain or living .stream muse bas e an outlet; living faith will always produce works. \Vn do not serve God to merit eternal life, but accepting it of Him as a free gift, and realizing His loving kindness, we desire to express our thanks and And an outlet, not only in speaking His </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">prais</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">e but also in </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">doing</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> those things which are pleasing to</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ Behold I come as a thief: Watch!*’</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">&quot; Ye brethren are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief!” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“Take heed least </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">your</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> hearts be over-charged with the cares of this life and so that day come iqton you tiziutcures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">“ If thou shalt not </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">watch</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> thou shaft </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">not know</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> wlmt hour I will come.”</span></p>

<p><sup><a href="#forotnote1">1</a></sup><a name="bookmark5"></a></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">We of course recognize the fact that in the Scriptures both Life and Death are used metaphorically.</span></p>
<p><sup><a href="#forotnote2">2</a></sup><a name="bookmark6"></a></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> The emphatic Diaglott,” a very nopular translation from the New Testament from </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">Griechisch,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> we believe makes no exception, always translating this word Parousia—presence.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">t A ministering brother in the M. E. church has Just called my attention to the forllowing facts especially interesting to readers familiar with the Greek : Apukalupto is forrmed from the verb l-alupto.—which means I cover, conceal,—comnounded with the prenosition ano. he., anokuiupto ; It means. 1 uncover, I reveal, in the middle voice it signifies. </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">1 uncacir. or reetalmyulf.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> References: Luke 17: 3».—middle voice.—*'when the son of man uncovers or reveals himself.” If it is claimed that the rerb here is In the passive voice, it dbes not alter the argument any, forr then we should read, as in our version, “ when the son of man is uncovered or revealed.” The idea Is the same in either case. viz.: something covered up or invisible, Is present and has been present lor some time, but now it is uncovered or revealed. So iu the forllowing references: Matt. 10: 2C—here both the simple and comnound forrm is used: “There is nothing covered (ta/apfor) that shall not be uncovered (anofaifapio).” Matt. 11:27; 1 Cor. 2:10; Gul. 3:23; Eph. 3: 5; II Thes. 2:3.8, 8. In this last passage it will be noticed that the man of sin Is in existence, and just as much “ the son of perdition” beforre as after he is uncovered or revealed. But the day comes when he is stripped of his disguise. the sheep-skin is removed, and he is shown to be a wolf; he is uncovered, revealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">The ordinary word used forr come, in the Greek, is entomai. meaning I come. It occurs over three hundred times In the New Testament. But the word </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">aho,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> also translated come, has a different meaning; It signifies completed action, us / </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">am enme, am hers, am arrived.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> With this in mind, examine Malt. 24:50:—The lord of thatfevifj servant shall come [shall have come] in a day when he louketh not forr him, and in an honr that he is' not aware of.” Also, in Luke 12:46. These servants are saying my Lord deluyeth. There i’ no harm in this so long us He dues delay, but tliere wlM come a time when He no longer delays, and the servant who says He delays Is called wicked. For “ yet a little while, and He that shall come— (rrl-onuti, will come—</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">ab&gt;,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> shall have come) and wiU not (longer] tarryHeb. 10: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;">Another brother, also of the M. E. church, and tor several years a professor In one of their principal colleges, being convenient to me, I called his attention to the above. After examining the text critically, he endorsed the above rendering, reinirking that it was very peculiar; then haptwuhig to glance at the 4G(h verso of Matt. 24. lie called my artent ion to the fact that the word there translated </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">rnmeth</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> Is </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">elthon,</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> and signifies </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">after He has come.</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> Read verses +5 and 46 with this thought in mind. Is it nossible that there will be faithful servants giving meat in due season </span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;fornt-style:italic;">after</span><span class="fornt4" style="fornt-weight:bold;"> the Lord has come ? It is so stated, and at that same time the evil servant will not be aware of His presence, (verse SO).</span></p>
