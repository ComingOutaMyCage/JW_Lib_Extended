<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Convention Report—1939</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">J</span><span class="font7">EHOVAH’S KINGDOM is functioning in the earth today. The King Christ Jesus is present, ruling in the midst of His enemies. He is using the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, a company of Christians whose lives are devoted to proclaiming the honor of God’s name, and who are God's witnesses— Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses are not like any others in the world, either in purpose or in scope. Their purpose is to do God’s will, and His will at this time is that the Day of Vengeance shall be declared throughout the earth, the proclamation that Armageddon is at the doors.</span></p>
<div><img src="1939_tm_E_files/1939_tm_E-3.jpg" alt="" style="width:201pt;height:253pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Arrival of Judge Rutherford at the auditorium</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">Every convention of Jehovah’s witnesses has this in view: that the earth is about to be cleansed by removing from it every disturbing element, root and branch, and that following its cleansing there will be on this earth the reign of justice, peace, truth and love for which Jesus told His followers to pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Theocracy, God’s government, is in operation in the earth and is most noticeable at these conventions of Jehovah’s witnesses. None of the proceedings are secret. All who love God are welcome at the point at which the speaking is done, and at all the scores or hundreds of places over the planet where the voice of the speaker is heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Those who read this Report will have the evidence presented to them of vast assemblies meeting in such far-separated points as London, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles' to listen to the truths of God’s Word and of His kingdom, as they went forth by radio’beam, and by wire connections to all the earth. They will take note that in lands where English is not spoken there was provision that swift reporters translated simultaneously or took in shorthand and reproduced the lectures for the benefit of the listeners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Opposition to God’s Kingdom Is it possible that any human creatures could be fallen so low as to oppose the establishment in the earth of the perfect conditions which are foretold by all the holy prophets since the world began? It seems incredible, does it not? But docs it not also seem incredible that the Son of God was crucified as a malefactor in Jerusalem in A.D. 33, and that it was done at the instance of those who claimed to be God’s own special representatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It will be seen in this Report that Catholic Action today is as active against Jehovah’s witnesses as the Jewish hierarchy of Jesus’ day was against Him. To be sure, it is not only in this day that Catholic Action has been opposed to better conditions for humanity. It has always heen so opposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is an established policy of the Roman Catholic Church to claim ultra-patriotism in every land in which it is established. In America today this takes the form, not of regard for American institutions, but of ostentatious flagwaving, to cover a hatred of liberty and free speech so deep that it would gladly put to death those who cherish the heritage passed down to them by their forefathers, if only it bad the power. Admissions to that effect have heen made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The spur of necessity has compelled Spain, Germany in Luther’s day, France in the Revolution, England, Russia. Mexico and many other countries to unhorse the clericals and give the people a chance to breathe. What of America ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The whole world knows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy hacked and still backs Hitler, Mussolini and Franco in their destruction of the liberties of many people, and that these men stand for exactly the opposite of American ideas and ideals. Who is so foolish as to believe that the men who tire their arms waving the flags of these dictators, and tire their mouths shouting “Heil Hitler”, “Viva il Duce” or “Viva Franco”, are sincere when they pretend to accord honor to the American* flag? The Hierarchy makes much of Jehovah’s witnesses’ refusal to salute any flag of any nation, as ascribing salvation to a man-made object, but one glance into the history of America will prove that flaunting hand-service of the American flag is merely a bit of hypocritical musclewasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The American flag was intended by the forefathers of this land to he a symbol of liberty. It was the symbol of a nation that had emancipated itself from oppression by all foreign powers, especially that of the Vatican. Of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence only one was a Catholic, and he did not favor Americans’ yielding to the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What of that great liberty - loving empire called the “Lone Star State”? Were the Catholic Hierarchy the leaders in this break from Mexico? Read the Texas Declaration of Independence, which appears in full on pages 25-29 of this issue. Note the words that have been underlined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also, take note of the fact that at this moment the Coughlinites. definitely committed to the overthrow of American institutions, are advised by their leaders to carry flags of the Stars and Stripes when doing their hoodlum work of breaking up lawful assemblies. Such men are not patriots; they are the worst of traitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Of what avail is all the talk of the Press about patriotism when it is notorious that it is under the control of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy? It merely serves as a smoke screen to cover up the Hierarchy’s treacherous course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic Press itself is still more reprehensible. It claims to be ultra-patriotic, yet it knows that Judge Rutherford, an innocent man, was denied bail by Judge Man ton, and was deprived of his liberty nine months because of that fact, while Manton himself, tenth in line of American judiciary, is one of the mast reprehensible criminals that ever lived. And it knows that it never hesitates to refer to Judge Rutherford as an “ex-convict”, well knowing that he never was a convict, while it is entirely silent about the man who sold justice as a farmer would sell potatoes or pigs. Meantime Manton, on bail, lives in luxury in his Long Island palace, and of his crookedness the Catholic Press is silent.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark5"></a>World-wide Convention Centering in New York</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">The most important feature of the Worldwide Convention of .Jehovah’s witnesses centering in New York, June 23-25, 1939, were the addresses of Judge Rutherford on “Victory”, June 24, and on “Government and Peace”, June 25, with the release of the book </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation, </span><span class="font7">a guide to truth and life for the Jonadabs who would escape Armageddon. This book can now be obtained on a contribution of 25 cents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Both of Judge Rutherford’s addresses were broadcast over the world by radio stations. Neither of these addresses is available for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger,</span><span class="font7"> though obtainable otherwise. A concluding announcement respecting “Government and Peace” was: “You will desire to study the points made in the speech. For that purpose it will be printed, and you may have a copy upon request made to Watchtower, Brooklyn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The address on “Victory” will be obtainable in due time, and announcement to that effect will be made in due course by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society. However, it is possible to “purloin” for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> one little taste out of this address, which will surely reach some before they have opportunity to read the whole discourse. Surely this is enough to stir the interest of any person who loves Goh’s Word :</span></p>
<div><img src="1939_tm_E_files/1939_tm_E-4.jpg" alt="" style="width:200pt;height:177pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Delivering “Government and Peace&quot;</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah is now using his witnesses to carry on his strange work in the earth, and he not only likens them unto locusts, but he calls them “my great army&quot;. (Joel 2:25) That army God now sends out against the religious element of '‘Christendom'’, and their faithful service is a torment, to religious leaders. Locusts do not kill human creatures, but they do destroy the food supply. Jehovah’s witnesses do not prosecute a war against men with carnal weapons. but they do destroy the provender which religionists have dished up for the people and which Is poisonous; therefore the people of good will flee from religion, lie-cause it is a deadly thing. Mark now God’s description in symbol of his witnesses, his &quot;groat army&quot;, which he sends among ‘’Christendom&quot;. He describes his witnesses as a &quot;holy nation”, because wholly devoted to Gcal’s kingdom. (1 Peter 2:9) As it is written, locusts have no earthly king, yet they go forth by bands. (Proverbs 30: 27) Likewise Jehovah's witnesses have no earthly king or leader. Christ Jesus is their King and Leader. Of them God’s prophet says: &quot;Whose teeth are the teeth of a lioli, and . . . [jawj teeth of a great lion.&quot; (Joel 1:6) Their Leader. Christ Jesus, is the groat &quot;Lion of the tribe of Juda”, and they follow his lead and utter his message, which bites and stings opponents. Locusts enter into the houses and even eat the varnish off the furniture. Jehovah's witnesses enter into the houses of the people and take away the veneer of religion that has been smeared over the people to keep them in darkness Their Leader. Christ Jesus, the great Lion, reduces religion to shreds, completely chewing it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">While, therefore, neither of the above addresses appears in this issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger, </span><span class="font7">the concluding’words of the lecture “Government and Peace” are quoted, so that all may have a taste of the thrill that went round the world when 18,000 persons at Madison Square Garden shouted “Aye”. One of the shouters was a Catholic woman in the balcony who had come to be one of the disturbers of the meeting. At first she had booed when the others booed. Warned to desist, she remained quiet till , the .close, when she apologized to the usher and remarked that she had been helped. As the concluding words of that lecture she heard the following Warning, which is enough to make anv person stop and think of his relation to God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To the Vatican. Hierarchy and religious supporters I address these words: You’ acknowledge yourselves as part of the dictator governments which cruelly persecute Jews and Christians; hence you oppose The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For fifteen centuries you have blasphemed Jehovah God’s name, disturbed the peace of the world, fomented and prosecuted wars of conquest, caused the untimely death of countless innocents, clothed their chief killer in robes of glory and held him up io the world as an example of virtue; Spain being among your more recent scenes of violence. Therefore G&lt;xi declares to you : 'Upon your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor Innocents.’—Jeremiah 2:34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By putting the people in fear you have kept many In ignorance, and now you Incite the ignorant to commit for you assaults upon Christians. You have destroyed freedom of speech and of worship, and now you would take away all liberties of the people. Heretofore you have crushed every movement for truth and righteousness; but Ik* Informed that, you cannot succeed In your opposition to The Theocracy. Jehovah's witnesses do not fear you. because God is with us. (Jeremiah 1: 19) Your end has come. The divine judgment is written against you. declaring your destruction, and yon are going to die, and, further, that the memory of you shall perish for ever.— Psalm 145:20; Proverbs 10: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To AU. ORDER-LOVING CATHOLICS, JEWS AND PROTESTANTS I address these words of hope: Heretofore you have followed the lead of unrighteous men. permitting them to think for you. if you would escape disaster and find salvation to life you must forsake religion and choose and serve Jehovah God and Christ his King. All who do not stand for God and His kingdom by Christ remain in opposition and will be destroyed. Those of good will toward God will choose His government under Christ. Those now hearing and who desire that righteous government and peace, say Aye.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark7"></a>.Awakening of the Jews</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">A remarkable thing about the World-wide Convention, centering in New York, is the awakening of the Jews to the fact that God’s Kingdom is their only hope. In an early issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> magazine will be published a letter from a prominent Jewish oculist appealing to Judge Rutherford to strike a blow for liberty at the Madison Square Garden which would help these people now in such dire distress over the world as a result of the persecutions with which Europe is now aflame. That letter was read at the convention, and created a stir. And since the convention the friendliness of many of the Jewish people in New York city is noteworthy. The following are certain selected paragraphs from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Der Tog (The Day),</span><span class="font7"> leading Yiddish newspaper of the world, published in New York July 2:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were numerous cases in Danzig where members of the same organization (Jehovah’s witnesses] defended Jews against assaults by Nazis, or when those upright women of the common people intentionally patronized Jewish stores just when Hitlerites picketed those Jewish shops. Only a half year ago when like an epidemic all kinds of food stores began to post the well-known signs &quot;Juden unerwiinscht” (Jews not wanted), the same German women have regarded it its a sacred duty to provide their Jewish neighbors or mere acquaintances with food or milk without asking any reward for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To us, Jews, the members of that organization are true &quot;fellow sufferers”, brethren in distress. When one meets such a man or woman they are the ones who comfort the Jews. They quote various Bible texts and endeavor to prove to the Jews that a time of happiness is impending. In a time of moral depression and total absence of rights, of hopelessness and desperation, when one does not know what the morrow will bring, the active work of the widespread religious society of the &quot;International Bible Students Association&quot; and &quot;Jehovah’s Witnesses&quot; Is evidence that we still have a very great number of friends amongst the German common people who literally weep over the great disaster which has befallen the German people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore we ought also here, upon American soil, create a closer contact with these very important non-Jowish groups, whose members are our sincere friends. Let us manifest toward them the well deserved sympathy; and when they organize mass meetings to fight against Nazism and anti-Semitism. the American Jews ought to show them open friendship in order to fight, jointly with them, the common foe.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Convention Music</span></h6>
<div><img src="1939_tm_E_files/1939_tm_E-5.jpg" alt="" style="width:103pt;height:159pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">The music at the convention was excellent. Artists from all over the country assisted the regular Watchtower orchestra of WBBR. One of the sweetest sights at the Sunday morning session in the Madison Square Garden was to see a little girl, not over 11 years of age, Wilmazee Whitener, of Kansas, two braids hanging down her back, modestly but skillfully playing a piano-accordion, and very evidently making sweet music two ways, one with her instrument, and the other with her heart to the Lord. God grant that she may pass unscathed through Armageddon.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Resurrection of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font7">N THE early part of 1918 the Watchtower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society published three issues of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font7"> and circulated them widely. The circulation of these papers exposed the duplicity of the clergy so completely that one intelligent person said of Judge Rutherford, ‘‘That is the last thing he will ever write.” What he meant was that the hypocrites would be so infuriated that they would cause him to be put to death. They did indeed attempt it, but failed, and since then almost </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">three hundred million</span><span class="font7"> copies of his books have been placed in the hands of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is extremely interesting that the misdeeds of the clergy and their followers led to the publication of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font7"> Numbers 1,2 and 3; and it is also extremely interesting, and significant too, that, after a lapse of 21 years, conditions in connection with Judge Rutherford’s address at Madison Square Garden made it manifestly God’s will to publish </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom, News </span><span class="font7">No. 4, which is shown on the next four pages in slightly reduced facsimile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font7"> No. 4 appears the best statement of what took place at Madison Square Garden. July 25, 1939. You will find it in Judge Rutherford’s “Open Letter to Mayor La Guardia”, and, just so that the'mayor would not be left in any doubt that the matters therein brought io his notice deserve his attention. Jehovah’s witnesses placed a million copies in the hands of the citizens of Greater New York between July 15 and the 25th. Not another organization on earth could do it.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>THE FACTS</span></h2>
<p><span class="font5">On Sunday June 25, at Madison Square Garden, New York, a great multitude of persons of good will met to hear the principal address of a three-day convention. The Garden assembly was linked by wire and wireless to dozens of similar assemblies throughout North America and other continents. At the same time also scores of stations broadcast that address. For a few minutes during that one-hour meeting some misguided fanatics, directed by the Hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, tried to drown out the speaker’s voice and break up the assembly by starting a chorus of boos, howls and shouts of “Viva Franco” and “Heil Hitler”, in the top balcony. That short but unlawful disturbance the press of New York and the entire nation snatched up as “news fit to print”, falsely characterizing it as a “riot” that “broke up the meeting” “in darkness” in a “bloody free-for-all fight”. All- present at the Garden and the thousands or millions who heard the whole speech on the radio know what occurred. Falsehoods printed as “news” are unanswerably contradicted by THE FACTS searched out by </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font5"> magazine and its attorneys. Sincere people who love honesty know that they cannot rely upon the associated press and newspaper publishers who prefer to print what helps to sell papers. In the public interest, therefore. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kingdom News</span><span class="font5"> presents THE FACTS as found and sent to the Mayor of New York, who also was misled by the false press reports. More facts, in another open letter sent to the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York by a member of the New York Bar, are also published here, together with other information for the careful consideration of every order-loving person in this world’s greatest city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">FACTS: June 23-25 was the occasion of a peaceable assembly of thousands of Christian people in convention within the City of New York for the study of Gods Word, the Bible. On the 25th Madison Square Garden was the key assembly for many other like public assemblies of Christians in America, Canada, Great Britain and Australia, all of which assemblies were tied together by wire and wireless equipment, thus making it one tremendous lawful Christian assembly. The people were there at that time to listen to *an address on GOVERNMENT AND PEACE delivered from 4 to 5 o’clock P.M. In addition thereto seventy-five radio stations broadcast the speech. More than eighteen thousand persons were orderly and lawfully assembled at the Garden to worship Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic clergyman Charles E. Coughlin had his followers picketing a certain radio station in the city. Those and other fanatical Catholics had repeatedly on previous occasions threatened to break</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">up the Madison Square Garden meeting, and other meetings tied together with it. Due notice of this threatened unlawful action was given to the police officials of the City of New York, as well as other cities. About 4 P.M. three Catholic priests took seats in the gallery of the Garden and about the same time 200 or more Coughlin Catholic pickets, led by an agitator well known to the police, marched into the same gallery immediately back of the speaker’s platform. They came there for the expressed purpose of breaking up that meeting, and this is shown by an abundance of evidence. About twenty minutes after the speech began, and at a given signal from some one of them in the gallery, that company of fanatical persons began a loud disturbance of yelling, shouting and cursing. Ushers called upon the police to quell the disturbance, to which de-ma nd the police officer in charge replied: “That is your job.” This statement was made in the face of the facts that the policemen at the time were hearing and seeing the unlawful action of the disturbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ushers lawfully in charge of the meeting hurriedly rushed to the point of disturbance and demanded of the disturbers that they cease interruption or else leave the meeting place. Instead of obeying, the Catholic fanatical disturbers violently assaulted a number of the ushers, and some of the ushers in turn defended themselves. The police did not even attempt to arrest anyone for unlawfully disturbing that lawful assembly, but they did arrest several of the ushers who were acting lawfully in the performance of their duty. Two weeks have passed and no one of the dis-turbers has been arrested for an attempt to break up a lawful assembly. Law-abiding citizens have been arrested for doing what the police are sworn to do but which they failed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">PRESS: The public press and a few radio stations announced that the meeting at Madison Square Garden was broken up by rioters and that the riot spread to every part of the Garden and that ushers had been arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The meeting was not broken up. The entire proceedings were simultaneously recorded by electrical means and that transcription clearly proves the untruthful statements made by the public press and certain radio stations. For one hour every word of the speaker was transmitted to the English-speaking world above mentioned, was clearly heard, and was transmitted by wire to the recording studio, all of which is unquestionably</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The MESSENGER </span><span class="font5">proven by the recorded speech and by the many cablegrams received and publicly read that same night at the Madison Square Garden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">YOUR STATEMENT: On June 29th the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune </span><span class="font5">quotes you, the Mayor, as follows: “I call your attention, gentlemen, to an incident of a few days ago, when another group, seemingly and ostensibly pretended to be for the good things of life, openly attacked people of your faith.” The paper then adds: “The remark was taken-to be a reference to the •Government and Peace’ meeting of the International Bible Students Association at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, at which a riot started after charges by Joseph F. Rutherford that the Roman Catholic Church backed Chancellor Hitler in Germany.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In complete contradiction of this statement attributed to you, that “Another group openly attacked the people of your [Catholic] faith”, I submit the complete text of the speech, also the transcription record thereof, which will be furnished at your request. At the point of the speech where the disturbance began nothing had been said against the Catholic faith and no reference to Catholics, except a quotation from </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The name of Hitler was not mentioned once. There was no occasion at that time to mention his name. In view of these facts the public is misled by the press and by quotations of high officials, who were not present, all of which the thousands of orderly people who were present well know are contrary to the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">QUESTIONS: In behalf of a great number of honest, sincere Catholics and non-Catholics of the City of New York, as well as elsewhere, I respectfully propound to you. Mr. Mayor, the following questions which the people have a right to demand of their Mayor shall be answered:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(1) Section 1470 of ttve Penal Law of New York says: “A person who, without authority of law wilfully disturbs any assembly or meeting, not unlawful in its character, is guilty of a misdemeanor?’ Are you in favor of enforcing that law’</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(2) The assembly at Madison Square Garden was a lawful one. A crowd of gangsters, openly claiming to be Catholic Coughlinitcs, willfully disturbed that meeting, having come there deliberately for that purpose. Police officers there present saw such flagrant violation of the law. Why did not the police arrest and prosecute those willful law-breakers? Do you approve of the action of the police in refusing to arrest the rioters and at the same time arresting ushers who were there by right and acting in the performance of their lawful duty?</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">The speech &quot;Government and Peace”, given on June 25 at Madison Square Garden by Judge Rutherford. It shows what JEHOVAH, the Protector of all upright persons, purposes to do very soon against organized religion. His enemy and the destructive foe of all honest people. It shows how JEHOVAH, the Almighty God of the Hebrews, will govern the entire world forever through His King, Christ Jesus, the Messiah, who is the Prince of Peace, when every religions Institution and system is swept from the earth by H18 irresistible power.

<p><span class="font4">117 Adama St, Brooklyn. N. Y.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(3) Is the statement published in the aforementioned newspaper, to wit: “Another group (meaning those Christians lawfully assembled at the Garden for worship of Almighty God J openly attacked the people of your (Catholio) faith,” fully approved by you us Mayor or not, and if yes. upon what do you base that statement?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(4) AS Mayor do you favor and approve the action of the Catholic Coughlinitcs in willfully attempting to break up a peaceable and lawful assembly even though those disturbers did not agree with the statements made by the speaker?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(5) You have publicly denounced Hitler on many occasions, and properly so. I did not mention Hitler. But even if I had, was that any excuse for Catholic Coughlinitcs to attempt to break up a lawful assembly?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(6) There is a vast difference between the common people of the Catholic faith, who honestly and sincerely follow that faith, and those who compose “The Catholic Hierarchy of Authority”. Do you favor the Hierarchy, which is desperately attempting to make America Fascist, or do you favor and support the common people of the Catholic and all other faiths who desire to honestly and peaceably assemble, and who desire a government where men may worship God according to the Constitutional guarantee?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(7) In the light of more than fifteen centuries of history, showing that the Hierarchy has constantly persecuted Jews, do you now think for one moment that the Hierarchy of Authority is honestly and sincerely in favor of permitting Jews to live peaceably in America like other people, as the press has stated?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(8) The &quot;Catholic Action&quot; operated by the Hierarchy of Authority has repeatedly attempted to break up lawful assemblies of Christian people in America. The same Hierarchy and its agents tried to do the same thing at our convention on June 25th at London and other British cities, but Scotland Yard prevented the same because they did their duty. Do you approve of such &quot;Catholic Action&quot; or do you favor freedom of speech and freedom of worship in America by and for</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BROADCAST: Tum In WBBR (1X0 ke.) Sunday. 4 to B PM. July 23. 30. and Aupuet 6, for broadcast of RCCORDKO SPCKCH &quot;Govern. ment and Pe»co“, which prove* the pre** did not publish tho truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Catholics, Protestants, Jews and all others alike?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">(9) You cannot close your eyes to the fact that Fascism or Nazism is rapidly spreading throughout America, and the further fact that “Catholic Action&quot; is not only sympathetic but openly supporting that Totalitarian movement. As Mayor of this city which side of that question do you take?</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">(10) Refusal to salute flags, hail and bow down to men is seized upon as an excuse or justification to punish Christians. That fanaticism had its birth in Nazi Germany and is employed by Totalitarian rulers as a method of coercing and regimenting the people. That religious fanaticism has been brought into America recently, although Americans for 150 years have respected the flag and obeyed the law for which it stands without being compelled to worship it. Christians do not salute the flag of any country nor hail nor bow down to any man, for the sole reason that Almighty God has commanded that they shall not do so and live. They do obey God rather than men because God's law is supreme, and they arc also diligent to obey every law of the land that is not in contravention of God’s law. Shall Christians be compelled to violate God's law in order to please men? is it better to obey tho law of which, the flag is a symbol, and decline to worship the flag, or is it better to indulge- in the ceremony of saluting the flag and then straightway with impunity and approval of officials, willfully violate the law of the land?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses do not ask favors of you as mayor, but they do demand that their Constitutional rights be respected. Jehovah’s witnesses are not asking for a defense, because they' need none. They trust in Ged and in Christ, who defend them. Jehovah’s witnesses do have the right, however, to. demand that public officials respect and impartially administer tho law of the land by seeing to it that the peoples of all faiths and all. classes have the right to exercise without hindrance the freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship of God when such freedom does not endanger the public welfare.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mr. Mayor, ds official representative of millions of people in this great city, you owe to them and to the public generally throughout the earth a plain statement of what exactly is your stand and what is your answer to the foregoing questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very respectfully submitted,</span></p>

An electrical transcription of the entire address was made, and it Is available tn confirmation of my statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For some months past a large gong of Roman Catholic and allied patriots have &quot;demonstrated&quot; before Radio Station WMCA In &quot;protest against denial of free siieech&quot; to u Rev. Coughlin. On the Sunday afternoon mentioned, &quot;the entire demonstration line moved over from WMCA to the Garden,&quot; some 500 strong, arriving there after the address had been under way for some twenty minutes. They marched down the balcony corridors and ganged Into an unoccupied section of seats behind the speaker's platform: this I saw. A Roman Catholic priest, whom I did not see. sat In the front row. Upon a sudden flash of electric lights, the entire mob broke out Into howls and wild disorder and staged what their witnesses term a &quot;riot&quot; which also I saw, and numerous brawls and fights occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The self-evident purpose of the &quot;Cough-llnitc&quot; Invasion of the Garden was to &quot;break up the meeting” and prevent the exercise of the &quot;right of tree speech&quot; by the speaker; this attempt was premeditated. mullclous and criminal; it resulted</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">This case presents such a unique record of perjury on the part of the zealous Catholic complainants that, with the stenographic reports before me. I cite its more signal mendacity to you. One of the plck-cter mob which “moved over from WMCA to the Garden&quot; and who made and swore to the complaint was one. Philip May; his .associate complainant was a young Cathoik- girl, Agnes Walton. Roth of them were &quot;rioting&quot; vociferously. Both swore, with much circumstantial detail and immwi-re contradictions, that the defendant usher, Joseph Roth, after first striking an &quot;unknown woman&quot; with his cane, then punched Agnes with the ferrule end of his cane, then &quot;raised his cane and struck her on the head. Agnes was knocked unconscious from the force of the blow. Some of Agnes' friends then escorted her from the Garden as soon as she had received the blow that way&quot;. None of this hnppetwd, Agnes was not touched, as the sequel will show.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A witness for the defendant testified that he overheard May tell Agues to Ue down on the floor as If knocked down, and then make a charge to the police that she had been struck by an usher and knocked unconscious. To &quot;rebut&quot; this damaging testimony, the complainants brought in u new witness who had not heard the previous testimony about Roth's nttuck on Agues; this witness &quot;rebutted” too much. He swore that be had escorted Agni's, her sister and other women to the meeting and sat with them in the section referred to; Agnes had sworn that she had not been in that section; her friend then swore that when the riot broke out. he and his pro-</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Uffvn</span><span class="font4"> started to leave the Garden, he guiding Agi&gt;es and her sister by the arm; that as I hey paxiwM be saw an usher (Russell Kuneu. who was stationed w-crnl sections away from Roth’s station, where the other witnesses swore tbd Incident occurred l strike the &quot;unknown woman&quot; with his cane; that no one struck Aitnos. but that Agnes lay down on the floor at his feet, and was carried out by friend*, and that he hud taken &quot;moving pictures” of the carrying out scene. This rebuttal witness thus rebut tod the entire story of alleged assault on Annes by Roth or by anyone and proved that May. Agnes and tlieir other Catholic witnesses bad little practical regard for “Catholic Truth.” The defendant- was acquitted, and tlte complainants were admonished against making a further complaint for &quot;assault&quot; as a waste of Court (Iroe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These arc summary details of this outrage against civil rights on the part of some of your Faithful and of their guilty effort to make capital and credit out of their own crime against public order and right of free speech.

<p><span class="font4">This latest Catholic outrage against the persons and rights of &quot;Jehovah’s witnesses&quot; (I am not one) is simply the lust one so fur of a long and disgraceful scries of Roman Catholic outrages against these respectable and law-abiding people In lawless attempts to suppress mid destroy them and their legal anti constitutional rights.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">City Magistrate Finds Usher “Not Guilty’</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">The Law of the Most High God provide* that 'at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall the matter be established’. (Deuteronomy IP: 15) The spirit of that law is fulfilled by the testimony which follows City Magistrate Peter Abeles. Seventh District. Borough of Manhattan, listened for two days to the rase of an usher. Joseph Roth, falsely accused of having part in the Madison Square Garden &quot;riot” on June 25. This is the usher mentioned In the letter to tbi- Catholic archbishop, reproduced In this paper. The just judge, Peter Abeles, upon henring the testimony in the cas«e against Roth, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">“It would seem reasonable that the defendant was an usher. There Is no denial of that. There was need for somebody to keep order. Apparently the police left It to the people that ran the 'show' to keep order there. With »o many thousands of people In a place like that somebody has to keep order, and use the force necessary to preserve order. They may have to</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesuits and Catholic Moguls Disagree on Methods</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font4">Embarrassment, confusion and disunity, say Eugene Pacelli’s Jesuits, result .from unauthorized use of the term “Catholic&quot; by groups of Catholics who actually oppose the general sense and intent of Catholicism in this country. In America (June 24, 1939). their official magazine. Jesuits appeal for restricted use of the term. Bishops ought to control most strictly the use of the name &quot;Catholic&quot;, say the Jesuits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">J. Noll, a bishop whose diocese centers at Fort Wayne, Ind., allowed his official newspaper, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor</span><span class="font4"> (June 25, 1939), to print boldly on its front page: &quot;Rutherford should be refuted. We'd be much wiser to devote our time to answering the arguments. Deprive your enemies of free speech, and your enemies will some day deprive you of your rights. Certainly Rutherford is making capital of Catholic attempts to have him silenced. Fortunately wo seem to have given up our misguided efforts along those lines, but there, is still a bitter after taste from the previous mistakes. We can prove our claims as the supporters of liberty only by helping protect the liberty even of those with whom we disagree.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Disagreeing, Pacelli's “hot&quot; radio priest, Charles Coughlin of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Social Justice</span><span class="font4"> and its &quot;purgatory&quot; racket, prefers the new broadcasters' code under which he says “anti-Catholic and anti-religious broadcasts, of the Rutherford type, would be barred&quot;. In the priest's broadcast July 9 he is said to have included the falsehood that ‘Jehovah's witnesses arc against everything and everybody’ and that ‘if patriotic Americans would rise up and stand on their hind legs and come out of their holes, Jehovah’s witnesses could be destroyed in one day*.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Coolest suggestion, perhaps, is John Harney's. He, os head of Pacelli's 'Society of Missionary Jesuits’ (also called “Paulist Fathers”) at New York, hold* that ‘heretics may rightly be killed' by Catholics whenever Catholics nrc strong enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So also at Philadelphia, Pacelli's eminent aide, Dennis Dougherty, cardinal archbishop, insists stoutly that he and his stooges “will take further and more drasuse </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">reasonable</span><span class="font4"> force. No one has a right to be there and create a disturbance That Is how I understand It. The people running the meeting had a right to eject nny who were lawless. So far as the disorderly conduct charge I* concerned I will find Roth not guilty. Now on the matter of assault: I think that on this charge In Special Sessions the defendant Roth, with nil the evidence that has come before me. would get the benefit of the doubt. I think it would be a waste of time of the Court of Special Sessions to present thl* mutter there.” You have had as full and complete bearing here as anybody could have in a case like this. I have no patience with anybody who disturbs any public meeting, whether of Father Coughlin or anybody else. Agnes [Walton) was not hurt. That sticks in wy mind. So I dismiss the complaint against Roth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Magistrate Abelee Is hereby publicly commended for bls ability to judge between facts and Action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">tic action if the broadcasting of Judge Rutherford is permitted to continue”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Likewise Pacelli’s archbishops and bishop* who at Washington direct hi* National Catholic Welfare Conference cause its news bureau to give readers of Catholic-controlled newspaper* throughout the United States the advice of their monsignor P. Wynhoven, of New Orleans, in whose syndicated article they read: ‘First o’f all give Jehovah's witnesses strong argument.* when they call at your doors; and if that proves ineffective, call the police station or the sheriff, not the priest-house.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Pacclli personally endorse* the campaign now being pushed nation-wide against Jehovah’* witnesses by the Benedictine priest Richard Felix, of Missouri, and his 'Defenders of Catholic Faith’, with aid of the Knight* of ColumbUs, for the sworn purpose that Judge Rutherford. &quot;shall once more, God willing, wear the stripes of a convict”, even though the pope's Knight of St. Gregory, Martin Thomas Manton (who during the World War wrongfully denied them bail and held Judge Rutherford and his companions in the Federal penitentiary for nine months), now vainly tries to save himself the need to don the zebra garb and take up his residence in the Federal penitentiary for “selling justice'<sup>1</sup> (not </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Social Juctict)</span><span class="font4"> while serving as the “tenth old man” of the United States judiciary.

<p><span class="font7">In New York, in front of Jian hattan Center, a rejiorter for </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger</span><span class="font7"> said to a policeman, “Row do vou find this bunch?’’ He replied, “They are the easiest collection of people to handle we’ve ever had here. There is no argument with them. They do whatever you ask them to do. You can see that they are a God-fearing lot. Look at their faces. That speaks plainly enough.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">A Theocratic sound-ear</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">In front of Manhattan Center on another occasion a boy of twelve, with one of his hands gripping one policeman and the other another, was giving them a witness efficiently and alertly, and in the’ presence of their sergeant. Presently he said, “Well, boys, I’ve got to go and get another earful, but 1’11 lie back to see you in about an hour. So long!” As he left, the gray-haired, kindly-faced sergeant and the two officers said in one breath, “If that kid hasn’t got some head on his shoulders!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Infected by the evidences of brotherly love, all around Manhattan Center, one policeman walked up to his colleague, put his arm around his shoulder, and was heard to say, “Well, brother, how are you today?” The captain of police in this precinct, name unknown, manifested considerable concern over the large number of information marches going out, for fear the marchers would not be properly escorted and protected. lie was informed that he need not worn- about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A tile of information marchers was moving northward on Eighth Avenue, New York. A</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">man, approaching, rushed over to a policeman in the street, saying loudly: '‘What the h---- does this</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">mean anyway? Everywhere you go you meet ’em!” The policeman was heard to say: “It’s a conspiracy ...” But the information march moved on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After Judge Rutherford’s speech, one policeman at the Madison</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Square Garden was heard to say, “From now on I’m going to tell those priests something!” In Chicago, while advertising the Sunday speech and giving a witness to a woman, one of the publishers heard someone come up behind him. After placing a booklet with the woman, he turned, and found a policeman standing there. “What do you get for those books?” the officer asked. “These books are not sold, but peo-le of good will (and hope you are one) like to contribute a little so that more can be printed and distributed,” he was told. He remarked, “You people have something. 1 am a Catholic, but I’m satisfied the whole thing is a racket. I hope you work all these buildings; for I know a lot of good Catholics living here that think and feel as 1 do. May I have some of that literature?” He took </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom, Face the Facts,</span><span class="font7"> and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Enemies.</span><span class="font7"> “Good luck to you!” he said as he walked away with Iris literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Denver ‘police were temporarily embarrassed Friday, June 23, when the chief gangster of the city, “Right Reverend Father” Hugh L. McMenamin, temporarily took charge. Whereas for several days previous information marches had been in progress, on that day the police</span></p>
<div><img src="1939_tm_E_files/1939_tm_E-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:414pt;height:163pt;">
<p><span class="font5">Six thousand listening in Alexandra Palace, London</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">bravely arrested one six-year-old child and seventy-two other persons, some of them before they had time to get out of their automobiles, on the ground that the signs which they bore were likely to frighten horses quietly enjoying their feed bags on the grass-lined streets. What they really meant was that the jackasses were already frightened, so that even their collars were twisted around backwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Denver chief, after a bystander had remarked to him that he had taken to arresting school children (a wheelchair pioneer was in the haul), shouted to the witnesses that if they would take off their signs they could go. Nobody took off any signs. One policeman said he knew the arrests should not have been made. The desk sergeant said it was a good publicity stunt. After two hours the witnesses were released and the next, morning over two hundred marchers thoroughly covered the city without molestation. The chief was probably sleeping off the drinks some<sup>-</sup> noticed he appeared to have had the day previous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After McAfenamin took charge of Denver the police revoked a sound-car permit granted eight days previously, on the ground that they had received complaints about its operation, whereas the facts were that the sound-car had not yet operated and would not be operating for yet another hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One Denver policeman, who arrested some witnesses for marching in such a way ‘as to scare Denvers horses’, said they had been arrested because they had been parading. When asked how close together people must be to make a parade, he said he did not know. It seems that for several hours the brains of most of the Denver police were under the control of the pontiff operating from Vatican City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Mobile, where 1,600 people were assembled at one time, there was not one police officer present, and none was needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Portland, Oregon, pressure from some source (guess the source) was brought to bear on the Portland police department against information marches. Police officials were notified of the Supreme Court decision and the number of marchers was increased from 200 to 950. One policeman smiled on a group and said, “How do you do?” Another said, “The time is certainly short for the damned old pope, isn’t it?” Asked how he knew what was coming, he replied, “By the grapevine method.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Learning in advance of plans for Catholic action by thirty youths from a Jesuit College at Winnipeg, the police of the city posted four officers with a cruiser car outside of the theater. A few signs were torn off and one car window was broken, for which the parents of the youngsters paid, but. all together, the gangsters accomplished nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The London police showed a splendid spirit. Whenever a Fascist or suspicious person entered the great Alexandra Palace a man was sent to sit near him and to watch him. The police of Scotland Yard take no chances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Los Angeles pressure on the,police caused a demand that no information marches be held, but a friendly officer advised the marchers to keep fifty feet apart. This was done with nine hundred marchers, representing approximately nine miles, with the result that at certain times every block in downtown Ijos Angeles had from five to ten marchers in it.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>From the Convention Address of Martin Harbeck</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font7">UCH of the material in M. C. Harbeck’s address was taken from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font7"> articles on the “Drama of Vindication”, published in issues of February 1 to May 1, 1939, and much of it will be in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> magazine, which will contain a digest of his address, over WBBR. But a few additional paragraphs are new, and appear herewith:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I nder the direction of the president of the Society, the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Kingdom the Hope of the World</span><span class="font5"> was translated into many European languages. including the Italian language. One half million copies were printed at Milan and then quickly distributed until the Hierarchy interfered. At Rome I was told by the chief in Mussolini's cabinet that they (the Fascist government) were married to the Hierarchy and had to consider her wishes, though the marriage was merely for convenience. From 1930 to 1933 a number of European radio stations regularly broadcast the message. The most thorough witness was given in Germany and Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Then in the January 1,1933, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> appeared the emphatic statement, “The tight is on, and will continue until the Lord destroys his enemies at Armageddon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In January, 1933, Hitler became chancellor with the help of the Hierarchy. On February 27 Hitler’s own party set Are to the Reichstag building, and then the next day a law was passed giving to Hitler and the police dictatorial powers. That same law was then applied against Jehovah's witnesses, although on the face of it it was directed against acts of violence and Communists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On April second of the same year the pope proclaimed his &quot;holy year”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">April 4 an order was issued forbidding the operation of the Watchtower Society in Germany; later the property was seized a number of times, but finally released.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In July of that year the Vatican, acting by Cardinal Pacelli, the present pope, concluded a concordat with Germany for the benefit of the Catholics in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In August thousands of books. Bibles and pictures were publicly burned by the Nazis on the outskirts of the city of Magdeburg. Photos of this bonfire were given to the American ambassador at Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thereafter the persecution, the arrests of thousands of brethren and the murder of a number of them, began, and it has continued to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A detailed report of the persecutions of our brethren in Germany was recently published in the German language by the ‘&quot;Europa Publishers&quot; at Ziirich, Switzerland. The same book is now also published in the French language by the &quot;University Press” at Paris. France. The title of this book Is “Crusade against Christianity”. The foreword contains the following: “The fact that about six thousand of these Christians are withstanding courageously the Nazi terror in the prisons, penitentiaries and concentration camps, and continue to maintain their Christian faith, is worthy of ad</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font5">miration by everyone who stands for liberty of faith and conscience.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From the prophetic picture of the conquest of the city Ai we have learned that the Lord's army on earth is apparently at a disadvantage for a time and hard pressed by the enemy, until the invisible army in ambush enter the conflict.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Some to their own hurt have criticized the explanations of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> on these three points: evidence of the conspiracy between the Hierarchy and the Fascist and Nazi and Communist element; evidence that the Lord Is beginning to put it into the minds of these radical elements and rulers to &quot;hate the whore and burn her flesh with fire': evidence concerning the great multitude and God's mandate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Right after the World War a number of new republics were created. All of these republics stood for freedom of speech and freedom of the press. This was not in the interest of the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Germany, which is largely populated by Protestants, was betrayed by Catholic Italy, her ally at the beginning of the war. Once before Germany was down and out. when the Catholic thirty-year war was lost by the Catholic forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore, as the popes had done in the past. Catholic priests and writers in 1922*1925 preached a crusade against Jews, Freemasons. Communists and Bible Students and pacifists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have the evidence that Hitler himself had contact with such priests in Bavaria and Austria, which are the most Catholic sections of the present Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These crusaders preached the resurrection of the •Holy Roman Empire’ of the German nation and stressed the superiority of the Aryan race. They wrote that Hitler’s greatness was shown by the fact that he led the national movement into the Prussian, militaristic channel, which is expressed by the formation of the Storm Troopers. These are mostly very young men taken chiefly from Catholic families. They wear black uniforms, and. on their hideous helmets as Insignia, skull and crossbones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic bishops in Germany, in Austria, In Czechoslovakia and in Switzerland have time and again requested the governments to suppress the activity of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Hitler aud his bagholders undoubtedly read Catholic books and papers filled with vile lies about Jehovah’s witnesses. Hitler personally tried to break up a meeting of Jehovah's witnesses in Vienna years before he came to power in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently one of the most important newspapers in Germany, on the front page, carried a number of photos, probably taken from the rogues’ gallery, all Jewlsh-looking, and then stated: These are the leaders of Jehovah's witnesses In Germany. Not one single picture was true; every one a fraud of the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently*a number of the new booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font5"> were taken into Germany and are being distributed right now. Moreover the brethren in these countries are Informed regarding Brother Rutherford’s lecture on Sunday, and some of them will be able to tune in and receive great comfort thereby.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">By the Lord's grace we were able to protect and safeguard the Society's property and other Kingdom interests in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. Some of the printing machines from Germany were sent to Berne. Switzerland. The Society’s property in Vienna. Austria, was sold and the money taken out of the country a short time before Hitler marched In. The printing machines at Prague were also quickly dismantled and everything was cleaned out the day before the secret German police entered our offices and found nothing to confiscate, except a few German Bibles. The branch servant there, whom they wanted to arrest, had left Prague secretly the night before, as directed. The machines are now set up in another country and are printing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span><span class="font5"> The retreat was well organized. Literature was stored and is now being distributed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Four brethren in Czechoslovakia, for refusing to take the uniform and bear arms, were sentenced by military court to be shot. Their last request was that the whole regiment should l&gt;e present at their execution and that they should have an opportunity to tell why they were to Im* shot. This, of course, did not fit their program. The proceedings were stopped, just before the execution: and later, when an officer again asked one of the brethren to take arms, they replied: “We are supposed to have been shot, and we cannot obey your orders now.” Thereupon all brethren were released and sent home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Several of the brothers who worked in the Society's factory at Prague, after some very interesting experiences, passing borders at night in storm and rain, safely arrived at their destination and are back on their old Jobs, printing </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While here I received information from our own secret channel of communication, that the branch servant in Germany, after four years of imprisonment. has been released, also a number of other brethren were released from the concentration camp Buchenwald. In Switzerland, Holland and Belgium some of the government officials have been very kind to our refugee-pioneer brethren and have freely expressed that our brethren are welcome in these countries, and the mayor of a Swiss town even wrote an official Invitation and said he hoped that our brethren in his community may And the rest and peace which they have need of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore, as instructed by the president of the Society, farms were bought In Switzerland, where about thirty refugee-pioneers are temporarily provided for and whore they now prepare themselves for oversea lands. Over thirty of such brethren expelled from totalitarian states have already sojourned on these farms and have been sent to Australia and to South American countries at the expense of the Society and with the help of the brethren in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The slogan of Catholic Action in Europe is to make Europe Catholic by 1940. I could relate a number of most severe attacks against the Society and Its representatives made by Catholic Action, but which failed and which only served to bring the truth with greater force to the attention of the people of good will. In two cases the Supreme Court of Switzerland canceled the decrees of Cantonal Catholic authorities forbidding our activity. Against much opposition also, the booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom</span><span class="font5"> had a wide distribution in Lucerne. Switzerland, where they tried to Interfere with Brother Rutherford's public meetings in 19.36. We constantly have a large number of cases pending in the courts, particularly in Poland and Switzerland. but we think nothing of this interference and the many arrests of our brethren, which are Invariably caused by the Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can sop clearly that the lx&gt;rd is holding back the enemy until the “great multitude” is gathered out and assembled before the throne of our King. Now at every large service convention we have immersion privileges for the Jonadabs. In France. Belgium and Holland the number of publishers is constantly increasing and it became necessary to provide larger meeting places. We note also that a large number of children and young people are taking their stand on the Lord’s side. In Holland we have publishers at the age of five who take part in the house-to-house service and who have a clear knowledge of the truth. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> has shown us from the Scriptures, and now we have the ever-increasing evidence that the &quot;great multitude&quot; Is coming forth in Europe as well as over here. Both the faithful of the remnant and the faithful Jonadabs are demonstrating that they love the Lord and the truth more than anything else in the world. In Germany, brethren, at the risk of their lives or imprisonment, obtain </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower.</span><span class="font5"> Do you appreciate </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font5"> as much as that?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font7">BOUT ten o’clock in the evening of the first day of the Convention a very intelligent-looking lady came into the Manhattan Center, New York, and asked if she could obtain some information about the organization. She was told to come back in the morning and she would be welcome to attend all the sessions. When she replied with anxiety, “Must I wait until the morning? Can you not give me something to read tonight?’’ the witness on duty gave her some literature, even though he had to take it from an unidentified publisher’s bag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On the same day, Friday, a refined gentleman approached a group of marchers and said, “1 have been watching you people. You are true Americans, and I want to have a part in this work.” He was handed a package of literature and took the lead in one of the processions, distributing the circulars. At the end of the march he asked if he couldn't join with the marchers on Saturday also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the conclusion of Judge Rutherford’s speech on &quot;Government and Peace” a Jewish man opened his pocketbook and took out some bills, which he held in his hand while the announcer made his statement. Then, when the judge again rose and told how the Biblical record shows that when the .Jews had strayed away from God and returned and again kept Jehovah’s commandments. He always abundantly blessed them, a big smile spread over the face of this natural descendant of Abraham, and he took some more bills out of his purse. At the conclusion of the meeting he went straight to the contribution box and stuffed in the bills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">On June 25, the day Judge Rutherford gave his lecture on &quot;Government and Peace”, an officer in the United States Army, stationed in Brooklyn, wrote that his duties had made it impossible for him to attend the lecture at Madison Square Garden, but that he had listened over the radio. He said, &quot;I fake this opportunity to express my appreciation for the wonderful opportunity offered me through the courtesy of your station. In my time I have listened to various speakers of divers shades of opinion, but have yet to hear anything the like of which I had the pleasure to listen to from 4 to 5 p.m. today. Judge Rutherford’s remarks were so timely and well placeri and spoken with an earnestness and honesty unparalleled in this day and age and, in connection with this, I intend to get all your literature in the future and get better acquainted with this remarkable man, who is as yet too little appreciated by the public.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Catholic lady, with tears in her eyes, said that she had never seen such courage in all her life as was manifested at the Madison Square Garden, and now is determined to understand the Truth. She was particularly impressed by the foolish attempt and failure of Catholic Fascists to prevent honest people from hearing the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The day after the lecture one of the witnesses called at a home in Brooklyn. The head of the home invited him in and said, &quot;I am a member of the American Legion and was at Madison Square Garden last Sunday to hear Judge Rutherford, and I agree with every word he said. Furthermore, Monday the American Legion had a meeting and our commander told me that he was also at Madison Square Garden. He was so impressed with the message by J udge Rutherford that he said, T pray to God there will be more men like Judge Rutherford in the United States who have the courage to tell the truth as he does!’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Al Birmingham, England, a Roman Catholic confided to one of Jehovah’s witnesses at the public meeting that he had read Judge Rutherford’s booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Cure,</span><span class="font7"> and he had debunked religion for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Wettingen (Aargau), Switzerland, a stenographer wrote down Judge Rutherford’s talk in shorthand and then translated it to the con-ventioners. Similar service was rendered, apparently, at Luxemburg, where the address was heard well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Honolulu, Hawaii, the great multitude were indeed coming from every nation, kindred, tongue and people; for in the information marches there were Spanish, Korean. Japanese. Filipino, Scotch and American.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One gentleman at the London, England, reception of the address &quot;Government and Peace” was so impressed that he contributed five gold sovereigns ($25) to an usher, to be used in the Kingdom work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Hull, England, a gentleman had eagerly acquired a copy of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Salvation,</span><span class="font7"> Author’s Edition, at the contribution of Iwo shillings. When he heard another man ask if he could have one for a one-shilling contribution, and the reply that the contribution was two shillings, and&quot; then the response that he could not afford more than one shilling, the first gentleman intervened, &quot;Oh, but you must have it. I will give the other shilling; for everyone needs this information.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Columbia convention two witnesses spent much time making back-calls telling the people of good will that cars were being provided to bring them to the meetings. One place repaid all efforts. Both man and woman were crippled and poverty-stricken. Tears of joy came into their eyes when they were told they would be taken to the auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Also at Columbia a man in a parked car beckoned to some witnesses in an information march and asked, &quot;When did you say the meeting was going to be?” His attention was called to the place and time as shown on the folder. He commented, “I believe in the work you people are doing. I have a stack of your books this big” (holding*his hands about two feet apart). Every time a representative comes by I get some of those books. I always said if there are any of God’s people on earth, you are the people. You’re the happiest-Iooking people. Whenever one of you comes to my door I can just see Christ in you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the same place two marchers were approached on the street by two young ladies saying, “Could we buy those signs? We'd love to get in this.” The answer can be imagined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A man and woman, at Houston, evidently Catholics, in bitter profanity, denounced the judge to each other as he poured it on that system. They decided to go, but the woman said, “I can't get up”—after a second attempt to rise. And she could not leave. They stayed and quieted down to real and apparently sympathetic interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A Houston witness handing out circulars from door to door was called back by a lady, where she had just left one. She said&quot;, “Please come in and talk to me for a minute. I feel like Paul. I have fought you people for years, but last week I read that little booklet </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Warning, </span><span class="font7">and now I see the light. Xo more going to church for me or my children, and you good workers will always receive a warm welcome and a cup of cold water at my house.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Los Angeles, on June 24, a lady, known to be a Seventh-Day Adventist, was brought to the meeting, and, after the “Victory” address, she said, “I do not want to be selfish. I love the Lord. I want to do something for Jehovah. May I march with you?” And she did.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Oklahoma City one elderly man that attended the public lecture remarked to some witnesses at the door that he was a member of the Church of Christ denomination but had come to hear the lecture because ‘‘you people are the only ones that are not afraid to tell the truth now’’. He added further that he believes that many of the clergy know these things as well as Jehovah’s witnesses but that they love popularity too much to speak concerning them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">A poor tramp in Portland was counting on his fingers trying to figure out whether he could manage to stay in Portland until he “could hear another’good lecture by this man of God”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">After the lecture “Government and Peace” a woman said, “I have been in San Diego fifteen years and this is the best talk I have ever heard.” Another said, “I am not one of you, but I am 100 percent behind you.” Another stepped over to one of the contribution boxes, snook the money out of his pocket into the box, and said, “This work needs my money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A young woman who attended a </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Watchtower </span><span class="font7">study for the first time, in March, in Saskatoon, was one of the information marchers in that city advertising the New York hookup of June 25. Another Saskatoon witness walked in a pouring rain to take part in the information march. Her only shoes literally fell apart. She could not afford to have them repaired, but the next morning a neighbor brought her a gift of a pair of shoes of the same size.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Experiences with Religionists</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font7">T New York convention an information marcher was riding to his appointment via subway. A clergyman accompanied by a friend entered, and as he took his seat his eyes fell full upon the sign ‘‘Religion is a snare and a racket”. His face red with fury, he started to speak to his companion, saying, so as to be heard clearly, “I wonder if that b---- would</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">like a punch in the nose.” As he started to speak, the witness deftly turned the sign, so that the clergyman’s friend saw only the words, “Serve God and Christ.” The friend then accused the clergyman of having lingered too long with the flowing bowl. Thereupon the clergyman rose and left the car, saying. &quot;Damn it all; I am </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font7"> drunk ; I don't want to ride on the same train with that pack of b----.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">An item showing that some were uneasy after their failure to interrupt the convention seems indicated by the remark of a priest at the Grand Central station at 9:45 p.m., June 25. Asked by his mother (apparently) where he was going, he replied, “No, 1 will not tell you where I am going until<sup>-</sup> this thing has quieted down, and then I will write a long letter.” Why did not this priest want even his mother to know where he went?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Chicago a female clergyman with a huge cross on her breast and dressed in the customary black Mother Hubbard maternity gown said to a gray-haired old witness: “You and your message are just as dirty as the sidewalk where you are walking,” and her face was white with rage as she hissed him. The witness responded, “Woman, the Lord made me out of the dust of tile ground. I am not claiming to be much myself, and you yourself an* nothing but a pile of mud.” The woman waddled off to find a policeman, but never came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Columbia. South Carolina, convention a Catholic woman who had promised to rent rooms to the conventioners canceled the assignment through fear of the priest. When asked if she did not think the priests should come out in the open and clear themselves if they could, she replied, “I will have to ask Father Murphy before I can answer that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A church member in Columbia said he heard one of the prominent ministers of the city say, “Judge Rutherford should be hung and no mercy shown him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Denver, Colorado, the gangster clergyman, “Right Reverend” Hugh L. McMenamin, demanded that the Rainbow Gardens contract with Jehovah’s witnesses be abrogated. When the timid Rainbow manager, Orlof K. Farr, tried to stand him off and protect his own rights and those of Jehovah’s witnesses, the gangster chief sent him the following telegram:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">1 was anxious to confer a favor upon you because I believed you did not know the nature of the group to whom you rented the Rainbow. You were insulting in your telephone manners. I would advise that you contact me and discuss the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The “reverend” thereupon took charge of the city of Denver, including its police department. Farr yielded to the gangsters and Jehovah’s witnesses rented the Mammoth Gardens instead. No sooner had they cleaned the huge structure than the gangster organization undertook to break that contract also, but the manager was an American, and a man, and they did not succeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The &quot;reverend” made a bad move. The Rainbow Gardens were several miles from his cathedral ; the Mammoth Gardens were only six blocks away from his church, and also only a few blocks from the headquarters of the Knights of Columbus. After the convention the manager of Mammoth Gardens called Jehovah’s witnesses the finest people he ever dealt with and said they left the Gardens in better condition than any other group that had ever rented il. He invited them to come back again, and said he would he pleased to rent them the Gardens at any time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Houston, Texas, when the head gangster of the Diocese of Galveston insisted that the manager of the Scottish Rite Cathedral cancel their contract with Jehovah’s witnesses, the manager stood his ground, ami said afterwards that they had never had a gathering in the building that was as orderly, or that gave as little trouble, as that of Jehovah’s witnesses. The assistant manager said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Young Jonadab being immersed at Mobile, Ala.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">I woke up at six o'clock this morning worrying where I was going to get a bunch of men to clean Up this 75-foot by KiO-foot room, find here we open the door and a bunch of your own people, men ami women, have already cleaned it ns though it belonged to them, and done a better Job than we would have done I</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Kansas City an unknown clergyman prevailed upon the fire department to remove a banner thirty feet long, placed by permission over one of’the main highways leading into the city. The sign was re-erected, however, in a conspicuous place on near-by property, after a friendly fireman &quot;had spilled the beans”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the same city two strangers had listened to &quot;Government and Peace”. The one had said, &quot;I can’t help but think it is a money-making scheme like everything else.” The other replied, &quot;I don’t agree with you.” Asked why, she explained, &quot;Because if this were a money-making scheme, why didn’t they take up a collection this afternoon? They could have gotten hundreds of dollars from the crowd that was there. But you see they didn’t take up a collection, and that is proof to me that they are not after our money.” The first answered, &quot;I guess you are right.” The second said, &quot;You don’t see any religious organization missing an opportunity to get all the money they could from a crowd like that.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Mobile, Alabama, one listener to &quot;Government and Peace”, who seemed still under the influence of the clergy, said to his friend, &quot;He can’t take our religion from us.” To which his companion replied, &quot;But didn’t he bring it out plain?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One Mobile clergyman boosted the convention by publishing a church bulletin lamenting the prosperity of Jehovah’s witnesses and weeping because his own parishioners are indifferent to his &quot;church”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Oklahoma City, W. A. Quinn and ten other persons sympathetic with his church, and calling themselves a “truth committee”, issued a mimeographed bulletin entitled (sic)</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&quot;Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Americans, ---Protest II’!! Ex-convict ‘Judge’ Rutherford gets use of Free municipal Auditorium”. They called upon all persons receiving it to call up the city officials to try to break the contract for the use of the municipal auditorium and also to call radio stations KOMA and KTOK to persuade these to break their contracts for broadcasting Judge Rutherford’s address. This worked as a boomerang as far as the auditorium was concerned, but the manager of radio station KOMA got excited and shut oft’ the lecture 28 minutes after it started, because Judge Rutherford quoted something from </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Encyclopedia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As an information march in Portland, Oregon, was passing a high-class restaurant out came two priests and for about a block walked directly behind a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl carrying &quot;the banner of love”, the banner of Jehovah’s Kingdom. The priests felt the embarrassment of their position so much that while following the young lady they turned up the collars of their coats to hide their jackass collars. On one occasion these Portland marchers went by a Salvation Army group and attracted so much interest that when they had passed the tambourine-shakers had to find another place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Portland the Knights of Columbus, with John R. Murphy as spokesman, undertook to exclude Jehovah’s witnesses from the Municipal Auditorium. Murphy explained that he was for free speech for the Irish and the Roman Catholics and the Knights of Columbus and the Italian Camorra that operates out of Vatican City, but was not in favor of free speech for Judge Rutherford; but he lost his case when he asked the question, “Who is this man Rutherford?’’ If the Murphys don’t know by now who Judge Rutherford is, it is too late to tell them. In the exciting colloquy on this subject in the mayor’s office. Ed. Betler had to defend even that innocent and truthful and gentle magazine </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Baptism at Columbia, S. C.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7">It just shows what America has come to! Commissioner Bennett showed that he was a real American when he disposed of some camouflaged patriotism by saying, “Some of the biggest traitors we have have been the boys with the American flag wrapped around them; the bigger the traitor, the more it takes to cover him, the lowest refuge of a coward.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Denied the use of the Bell Telephone Company’s lines to their convention at Montreal, the witnesses there assembled adopted a unanimous protest in which they said, in part:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Bell Telephone Company had a grand opportunity to use their facilities to bring a Bible lecture to this city. One of the officials says. “Our hands are tied.” </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">It</span><span class="font5"> is </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">well known who tied their hands.</span><span class="font5"> It Is history repeating Itself. In the early days. Christians fled from Spain and South America and other places where that same element was operating, to escape such inquisition. Many people in this city. Catholics and Protestants, were hindered from hearing this world lecture as a result of your determination to co-operate in tin* Roman Catholic Hierarchy methods. Instead of sending to you as we had hoped, a message of thanks and appreciation for your co operation, we are obliged to do otherwise. This Assembly unanimously endorses this protest to you, denouncing your action. The Lord is causing all people to be Identified. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">You have identified yourselves.</span><span class="font5"> The responsibility is placed upon your heads (Ezekiel 33:4) and you are accountable to the great Jehovah God for your action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Bell Telephone Company also prevented the use of their lines to the Toronto convention, but service was obtained to the convention at Lethbridge, Alberta, and other Western Canada points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Lethbridge convention the Catholic priest, local representative of the Vatican, standing on the sidewalk as Jehovah’s kingdom publishers marched by, was seen by many to turn up his coat collar to hide his badge of shame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Catholic church building was directly across the street from the convention headquarters, and the priests, walking in and out of their house of Baal, seemed greatly embarrassed. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">.Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers, marching in Winnipeg, saw a clergyman turn up his coat collar to hide his identity. Also, a soundcar passed a clergyman three times, and on the third trip he saw what it was and held a box in front of his collar; thus in effect these men have said, *T am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.”- Zech. 13:5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Belfast, Ireland, Jehovah’s Kingdom publishers had nineteen information marches, besides automobiles constantly running to and fro, well decked in advertising apparel. When the Orangemen march in Belfast they have to have a very strong police guard, but Jehovah’s witnesses marched with no police escort whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Bristol, England, the usual attempt was made to prevent Jehovah’s witnesses from the use of their auditorium, which they had engaged. but the manager replied by return of post, “I beg to inform you that there arc still two countries, Britain and America, where free speech.is tolerated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the Leeds, England, convention, about an hour before the lecture was due to commence, six young men appeared at the main entrance to the cinema, distributing the Bellarmine leaflet to the public as they were entering the building. Thereupon arrangements were made for six large-sized ushers to surround the entrance and distribute programs. The immediate result of this was that the opposing party were crowded out and retreated into the background some yards away and were seen talking it over. Jehovah’s witnesses also obtained a number of these leaflets from the public after they had entered the cinema, by asking them to exchange for better literature. In this manner several of the ushers collected pocketfuls of opposition literature and advised the young men what was being done. This apparently so disheartened them that, they soon disappeared altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every American child knows that it is illegal, in this country, to prevent or disturb or break up assemblies gathered for purposes of worship, yet Catholics have done this repeatedly in the United States, thereby putting Jehovah’s witnesses to great inconvenience and expense. The Catholics admit that they have done this, and they admit that such illegal activities have not been a success. Jehovah’s witnesses are not taking such treatment quietly from anybody anywhere. and that is why the gangsters grieve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Our Sunday Visitor,</span><span class="font7"> Huntington, Indiana, is the official mouthpiece of the &quot;Most Reverend” John Francis Noll. D.D., LL.D., bishop of the Fort Wayne. Indiana, diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. In its issue of June 25, 1939, the very day when the same organization conspired to break up the meeting in Madison Square Garden, the editorial writer, Art Kuhl, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We’d be much wiser to devote our time to answering the arguments than we would be to scurry about attempting to have him shut up. Deprive your enemies of free speech, and your enemies will some day deprive you of your rights. The point seems well taken. Certainly Rutherford is making capital of Catholic attempts to have him silenced. Fortunately we seem to have given up our misguided efforts along those lines, but there is still a bitter aftertaste from the previous mistakes. We can prove our claims as the supporters of liberty only by helping protect the liberty even of those with whom we disagree. Not, of course, that it is easy to argue with Judge Rutherford. He spends most of his time in advancing arguments that are based entirely on the Bible, and we Catholics have always denied that the Bible was the sole rule of faith.</span></p>

<h6><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Court Experiences</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">One of the witnesses at the New York convention was Attorney Grover 0. Powell, who had the pleasure of arresting the chief of police of Opelika, Alabama, for violating the laws of the state in imprisoning an innocent young boy in a barred and bolted room full of whites and blacks, men and women, detained there in cages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Witness Ruffner, of Virginia, fined five dollars for being a Christian in Suffolk, and $4.75 costs, asked the judge to make the total ten dollars, so that the case could be appealed. 'When the judge refused, Ruffner served ten days and went all over town explaining that the Txtrd had said to His people they should be hated of all men for His name’s sake, and that this had taken place right in Suffolk. This resulted in many becoming interested and obtaining literature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">At New York itself 447 were baptized. They made an impressive picture standing on the sidewalk awaiting their opportunity to be immersed in the pool provided, in token of their consecration to do the will of Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Los Angelos one Jonadab was immersed who was born while James K. Polk was president of the United States. She was recently married, and here’s hoping that after Armageddon she may have the privilege of helping to fulfill the divine mandate. Age now, 93.</span></p>

The next day, taken by the guards before the resident officer in charge, for an hour of questioning, he was asked by what authority he engaged in such a display without permission from headquarters, and he replied effectively, &quot;Jehovah God asks no man’s permission to carry on His work.”</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark43"></a>A Dallas Jonadab</span></h6>
<p><span class="font7">A Dallas Jonadab, who attended the Houston convention, said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The Mexican government, by its colonization laws, invited and induced the Anglo-American population of Texas to colonize its wilderness under the pledged faith of a written Constitution that they should continue to enjoy that constitutional liberty and republican government to which they had been habituated in the land of their birth, the United States of America. In this expectation they have been cruelly disappointed, inasmuch as the Mexican nation has acquiesced in the late changes made in the government by General Antonia Lopoez de Santa Anna, who. having overturned the Constitution of his Country, now offers us the cruel alternative ei</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">ther_to</span><span class="font5">_aband</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">on o</span><span class="font5">ur homes<sub>?</sub> acquired by so many privations, or suEmlFto </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">the^</span><span class="font5">most </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">intolerable of oi</span><span class="font5">l</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">, tyr</span><span class="font5">rany. the Combined de$potism_of the sword and the </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has sacrificed our welfare to the state of Coahuila, by which our interests have been continually depressed through a jealous and partial course of legislation carried on at a far distant seat of government, by a hostile majority, in an unknown tongue; and this too, notwithstanding wo have petitioned in the humblest terms, for the establishment of a separate State Government, and have, in accordance with the provisions of the national Constitution, presented to the general Congress a republican Constitution which was, without just cause contemptuously rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It incarcerated in a dungeon, for a long time, one of our citizens, for no other cause but a zealous endeavor to procure the acceptance of our Constitution and the establishment of a Slate Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has failed and refused to secure on a firm basis, the right of trial by jury: that palladium of civil liberty, and only safe guarantee for tho life, liberty, and property of the Citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has failed to establish any public system of education, although possessed of almost boundless resources (the public domain) and. although, it is an axiom, in political science, that unless a people are educated and enlightened it is idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty, or the capacity for self government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has suffered the military commandants stationed among us to exercise arbitrary acts of oppression and tyrrany; thus trampling upon the most sacred rights of the citizen and rendering the military superior to the civil power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has dissolved by force of arms, the State Congress of Coahuila and Texas, and obliged our representatives to fly for their lives from the seat of government; thus depriving us of the fundamental political right of representation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has demanded tho surrender of a number of our citizens, and ordered military detachments to seize and carry them info tho Interior for trial, in contempt of the civil authorities, and in defiance of tho laws and the Constitution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It has invaded our country, both by sea and by land, with intent to lay waste out territory and drive us from our homes: and has now a large mercenary army advancing to carry on against us a war of extermination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It has. through its emisarics. incited the merciless savage, with the tomahawk and scalping knife, to massacre the inhabitants of our defenceless frontiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It hath been, during the whole time of our connection with it, the contemptible sport and victim of successive military revolutions; and hath continually exhibited every characteristic of a weak, corrupt, and tyrranical government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">These, and other grievances, were patiently borne by the people of Texas untill they reached that point at which forbearance ceased to be a virtue. We then took up arms in defence </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> the national Constitution. We appealed to our Mexican brethren for assistance. Our appeal has been made in vain. Though months have elapsed, no sympathetic response has yet been heard from the Interior. We are. therefore, forced to the melancholy conclusion that the Mexican people have acquiesced in the destruction of their liberty, and the substitution therefor of a military government — that they are unfit to be free and incapable of self government.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark47"></a>Advertising Experiences</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font7">NGLAND put forth the greatest effort, and in every direction, to make a complete success of the- Kingdom interest entrusted to them at the time of the convention, and they succeeded beyond all praise. Not a district of London was overlooked. On some occasions4here were as many as 1,500 marchers in line at one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">One advertising stunt was “fly posting”. Scores of young and zealous Jonadabs entered this part of the service with all the thrills of real adventure. The idea was to post their own signs, instead of paying for having them posted on billboards or hoardings. Hundreds of locations were found all over the city. The courageous little band went out with buckets of paste and brushes and literally dressed up the old town. Some of this work was done ’way on in the night; and in one case detectives gave two of the boys a merry chase in the early hours of the morning, and when they found out what the boys were doing a mild warning was given them and the boys shoved off to their next scoop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">So great was the success of the London advertising campaign that despite the late hour (9 p.m.) there were 6,000 people thronging the auditorium, with 1,500 others outside gathered around four loudspeakers. The Alexandra Palace audience applauded several times where the American audience failed to, thus showing their keen interest in following the subject matter presented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This issue of </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The. Messenger</span><span class="font7"> contains a picture of the 28-foot motorboat used with great effect on the river Clyde and along the beautiful west coast of Scotland. The boat carried a prepared sail, 12 by 6 feet, and its broadcast announcements could even be heard on the far-distant hills of Rothesay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Newcastlc-on-Tync the windows of seventeen empty shops were covered with large double crown posters, and the Newcastle company distinguished itself by hiring a marquee on the moor for a week from which the Kingdom message was heralded forth each day by loudspeakers attached to the tent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Manchester, England, besides all their other means of advertising, publishers pasted stickers all over their cases and phonograph. </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font7"> will have pictures of these, sometime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Liverpool all manner of advertising was used, including specially prepared signs forj formation marchers, a sound-car precedi marchers, playing martial music, causing much excitement through the busy centers. Car and cycle drives did their part in displaying the beautiful posters, and the horse and cart was quite a novelty, complete with transcription machine and announcements. Window cards were exhibited, Hashing signs at homes and on cars, handbills by the thousand, and cinema slides, all directed the public to the Empire Theatre and Picton Hall to learn of Jehovah’s kingdom and to hear the challenge to Satan’s organization. At the Pier Head large six-sheet posters were in evidence; 300 signs were placed in tram-cars—the most popular means of transport in Liverpool; railway trains and stations were also utilized. At the Empire Theatre, situate in the center of the city, three large specially prepared streamers 17 feet by 4 feet were affixed to the main doors this being the first time that such methods of advertising were used at this theater. It constituted a splendid witness to the thousands of people continually passing this point, and was very effective when the cars and marchers passed right in front. The information marches were very orderly and were undoubtedly the -most impressive advertising medium. It is clear that the personal witness by the workers as a spectacle to men is the most potent form of advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Los Angeles the editor of the Ilearst-owned Los Angeles </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Examiner</span><span class="font7"> said with trembling hands that ho had “orders not to touch anything about Rutherford”. All Americans who know Ilfearst appreciate this subtle compliment to Judge Rutherford. In the same city, when the protests began coming to radio ” station KFVD, the operator, who is a Roman Catholic but friendly to Jehovah’s witnesses, was greatly amused at the protests, knowing that it was a frame-up. lie advised each protes that KFVD was only one of more th stations broadcasting this talk and tha no control over the program. Pro requested to leave their names them were ashamed to do so.</span></p>
