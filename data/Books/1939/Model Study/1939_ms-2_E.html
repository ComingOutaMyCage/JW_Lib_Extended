<p><span class="font9">E</span><span class="font3">ACH ONE of Jehovah’s witnesses should be prepared to conduct a model study in the Bible. This booklet is arranged to help you do that very thing. Herein you will find a model study of the matter contained in the following lectures: “Government and Peace,” “Victory,” “Fascism or Freedom,” “Face the Facts,” “Fill the Earth,” “Warning,” “Violence,” and “Safety”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also a reference index citing the subject, phonograph disc and book containing the scriptures particularly bearing on the point. Where you find some interest, fix a time with the interested to call back at that home and play a phonograph series, and then start a model study in that very series. Have each one present provided with a copy of the study booklet. You read the question and call on someone present who can read well to read the; answer. Then, if thought advisable at the time, have someone read the scripture relating to the subject matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If desired, after the question is propounded and the answer below it is read and the Bible texts are also read, then the paragraph in the booklet under consideration, and which you will find cited immediately following the question, should also be read as a sum-up. This done, the next, question should be taken up and considered in like manner; and so on until one hour is occupied. If the points covered in the phonograph record or group) of records run arc finished before the hour is up, then take up the next record or group of records, and follow in like manner as above outlined. The meetimg should close promptly at the end of the hour. At the next meeting following, the study should be taken up where left off at the previous meeting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS NOS. P-205—P-208 &quot;GOVERNMENT AND PEACE&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 1. Why are ‘people of good will’ mentioned as desiring a government of peace? (Page 3, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because the scripture states there will be “peace on earth among men of good will”.—Luke </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2 :</span><span class="font3"> 14, Rotherham, Douay and Revised Versions. Ezekiel 9:4; 1 Corinthians 14:33; Romans 16:20. s, 160, If 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 2. What fact, and scriptures, prove that man cannot set up a government of peace? (Page 4, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Men have tried for six thousand years and failed. —2 Timothy 3:1,5,13; Psalms 49:12,13; 46:8,9; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Peter 3:12,13; Revelation 11:15-19; Daniel 2:44; 2 Corinthians 4: 3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. Why are human theories an unreliable source of information? (Page 4, ff 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because all men are fallible. God’s Word is a sure guide. — Proverbs 3:5; John 17:17; Romans 3:4; Psalm 146:3; Proverbs 13:13; Psalm 118: 8,9. s, 62, If 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 4. Why was the first law given to man a theocratic law? (Page 5, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it came from Jehovah God, the great Lawgiver.—James 4:12. s, 301, ff 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. What is the difference between political and theocratic law? (Page 5, ff 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Political law is made by imperfect men, who are often clergy-ridden, scheming politicians. Such laws are frequently unjust, partial or designed for mischief. (Psalm 94:20) God’s law is perfect, just, impartial, and made for man’s good.—Psalm 19:7-11; 2 Samuel 22:31; Psalm 89:14; Deuteronomy 1:17; 1 Peter 1:17; Proverbs 29: 2. t, 35, ff 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. Will not God’s theocratic government prosecute wars of conquest? (Page 6, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. It will break in pieces all earthly (totalitarian) governments, and rule world-wide in peace.—Daniel 2:44; Psalm 72:8; Zechariah 9:10; Isaiah 9: 6, 7; Psalm 24:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. How do we know the experiences of Israel were prophetic pictures? (Page 7, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The Scriptures so state. — Romans 15:4; 1 Corinthians 10:6,11; Hebrews 3:5,6; 10:1; Colossians 2:16,17. s, 301, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. Why is religion injurious or misleading? (Page 7, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it is based upon teachings and traditions of men, making void the Word of God. It changed the Truth of God into a lie. — Romans 1:25; Maric 7:1-13. s, 35, fl 1; 250, fl 2; 251, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9. How did the Jewish Hierarchy vote for a totalitarian government? (Page 8, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By rejecting Christ and accepting Caesar.—John 19:12,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. Do not many religious organizations pray ‘'Thy kingdom come”? (Page 9, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. While religionists often do pray this prayer formally, they are united with the kingdoms of tins world, support them and are supported by them.—John 4:23; Isaiah 29:9-14; Matthew 7:21; 15:8; 23:14. en, 110, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 11. Why are not Jehovah’s witnesses concerned about their reputation? (Page 10, fl2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jesus sought no reputation among men, and neither do his followers.—Philippians 2:7; Isaiah 53:3; 1 Corinthians 4:9,10; Psalm 119:141; Luke 16:15; Hebrews 12: 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 12. Why can it he stated that Jehovah’s witnesses are not a cult or sect? (Page 10, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. A cult: is a system of formalistic worship; hence worship by religious rites, ceremonials, practices. “Sect” is from the Latin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sequi,</span><span class="font3"> which means to follow. A sect is a group of religionists who follow some human, selfappointed leader or creed or religious practice. Jehovah’s witnesses do not practice religious forms of worship or follow some man’s notion. Their steps arc ordered in God’s Word. —Psalm 119:105, 133; Acts 20:29-31; 26: 5; 1 Corinthians 7: 23; 2 Peter 2:1-3. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book of Jehovah’s witnesses</span><span class="font3"> for 1939, page 7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. Docs any religious leader or head have any Divine authority to appoint anyone as a political ruler? (Page 11, fll)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. Jehovah God has nothing to do with this world, but does appoint the great ruler of the “world to come”.—Matthew 20: 20-28; Revelation 2:10; 3: 21; James 4:4; 2 Corinthians 4:4; 2 Peter 3:13; John 18: 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. What has been the claim of the counterfeit theocracy? (Page 12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. That the popes rule instead of Christ, taking the title of “vicegerent of Christ”, and that all must be subject to him for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 15. Will the Lord hold the religious leaders and the nations responsible for side-stepping and opposing the real remedy for tire world? (Page 13, fll)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jesus told those who opposed the Kingdom in his day that they could not escape the condemnation of Gehenna (destruction). — Matthew 21:42-45; 23:13, 29-36; Luke 11:52; 1 Thessalonians 2:15,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 16. How do religionists violate God’s law by praising leaders in war? (Page 14, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They are parties to the crime of shedding innocent blood.—Exodus 20:13; Joel 3:7, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font3"> Jeremiah 2:34; Genesis 9:5. en, 163; s, 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 17. Why is it wrong to pray to the virgin Mary? (Page 15, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Nowhere in Scripture is it even intimated that prayers may be addressed to anyone but God alone.—• Matthew 6:6-9; John 14:13; 16:23-27; Pliilippians 4:6; Ephesians 3:14; Psalm 65: 2; Romans 1: 25; Revelation 22: 8,9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. What scriptures show that the issue is Satan’s rule vs. the Theocracy? (Page 16, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. All nations oppose God’s rule and are pictured by the scarlet-colored beast upon which the harlot rides. —Revelation 17:1-5; 16:13-16; 19:19-21; Isaiah 8: 9-13. en, 283.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. What is the meaning of &quot;Armageddon”? (Page 18. top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. “Hill of the assembly of troops.” It symbolically represents God’s assembled organization against which Satan is directing his forces.—Psalm 2:1-6; Revelation 16; 13-16; 19:11-14. !t-2, 55, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 20. Why does the ’Theocratic government rest upon the shoulders of Christ? (Page 19, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. He rules as the representative and executive of Jehovah God.—Isaiah 9:6; Revelation 11:15; 1 Corinthians 15: 24-28; Psalm 110; Hebrews 1: 8, 9. s, 301.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21. How has Christ Jesus now come to reign as the Governor of the world? (Page 20, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By directing his attention and power to the earth for this purpose. (John 14: 19; Revelation 3: 3; 16: 15) He reigns, invisible to natural eyes, by beginning his work as God’s anointed King, ousting Satan and his wicked angels from heaven, and announcing His kingdom among men before the destruction of Satan’s world organization.—Psalm 2: 6; Revelation 12: 7-10. s, 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. Why are people of good will pictured as “sheep”, opposers as “goats”? (Page 20, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Sheep are docile, meek, obedient, not injurious. Goats are self-willed, stubborn, cruel and given to butting.—John 10: 3-5,16; Zechariah 10: 3. s, 160, fl 3-164.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23. Jehovah’s witnesses bring to the people literature that deals with the Bible. Is not that interpreting the Scriptures? (Page 18, fl; 21, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. They merely thereby enable the people to learn from the Scriptures themselves how present-day events fulfill Bible prophecy. God, through Christ, opens the Scriptures’ meaning.—2 Peter 1: 20,21; 2 Timothy 3:16,17; 3 Timothy 2:15; Luke 24: 32, 45; Revelation 5 : 2, 5 ; Psalm 119 :18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. Are lea</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">rnin</span><span class="font3">g and worldly education required to understand the Bible? (Page 21, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. The requirements are fear of God, humility, sincere desire for the truth, meekness, study, obedience. —Luke 10:21; Matthew 13: 10-17; Acts 4:13; Psalm 25: 9,14; Daniel 12:4, 8-10; Hosea 14:9; Micah 6:8; Zephaniah 2: 3; 1 Corinthians 1: 26, 27; Proverbs 3: 5. s, 29, 30, 47.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS NOS. P-214—P-218 &quot;GOVERNMENT AND PEACE&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 25. What are the chief characteristics of the Theocracy? (Page 22, 1(2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It will be ruled by God’s appointed and anointed King. It will dispense the blessings of life to mankind. The King will rule in righteousness and give no place to scheming politicians and religionists. It will have proved and faithful earthly representatives. — Isaiah 9: 6, 7; Isaiah 32:1; Daniel 2: 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 26, Where are these “faithful men of old” now? and what will be their condition? (Page 23, middle)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They are in their graves awaiting resurrection. They will be perfect when awakened.—Acts 2:29-34; Psalm 45:16; Hebrews 11: 39,40; Luke 13:28; Matthew 8 :11. s, 307-309, 350.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. Why is God’s Theocratic organization called “Zion” and “Jerusalem”? (Page 23, IT 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jerusalem is Jehovah’s universal (all-inclusive) organization, while Zion represents the capital organization which exercises the will of God over all.—Isaiah 2: 2, 3; Psalm 48: 2. go, 247-250; ch, 12, fl 1; s, 333, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 28. Who, specifically, arc the ones that will benefit by the righteous government? (Page 24, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The poor and the righteous toward God.—Psalm 72: 4, 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 29, Why have men heen unable to put into operation the righteous principles of the Theocracy? (Page 24, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A, Because none are righteous. Failing to accept Jehovah’s way, men have been easily overreached by the god of this world, Satan, and his religion, and have gone in the wrong direction. — 2 Corinthians 4:4; 1 Samuel 8: 6-8,19, 20; John 19:12-15. go, 40,41,247,248.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 30. Why must Armageddon precede the rule of the Theocratic Government? (Page 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because Satan and his representatives refuse to vacate; dictators defy God and his King and persecute Jehovah’s witnesses. Religion and state seek to perpetuate the rule of man and line up against the Theocracy. —Psalms 110: 2; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2:</span><span class="font3">1-9; Revelation 11:18; 16:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. As all nations are against the Theocracy, will all be destroyed? (Page 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. All nations will be destroyed, but not all people of all nations. Those—out of every nation, kindred and tongue—who take their stand on the side of God’s Kingdom will survive.—Revelation 7:9-17; Psalm 34:7; Zephaniah 2:1-3. s, 320, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 32. What is the meaning of the statement, “The wicked shall be turned into hell”? (Page 25, bottom)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It means that they will be sent away into destruction. “Hell” is a translation of the Hebrew </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sJieol, </span><span class="font3">meaning “the grave” or the “death condition”. This word is translated “hell” 31 times, “grave” 31 times, and “pit” three limes, in the King James Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 33. What kingdom do the “sheep” (approved ones) inherit? (Page 26, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They receive the blessings of God’s Kingdom rule over the earth, ch, 345.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 34. What is the “everlasting fire” for the “cursed”? (Page 26, fl 2) ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is a symbol of destruction, and is also called “eternal punishment” as contrasted with the everlasting “life” given the sheep. — Matthew 25:46; Revelation 21: 8; 20:14; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Isaiah 66: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 35. How may one take his stand on the side of and support the Theocracy? (Page 27)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By studying in the Bible the revelation of Jehovah God and his purposes, rejecting the traditions of men and, receiving the Word, obeying its requirements, and proclaiming the Truth to others.—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Timothy 2:15; 3:15-17; John 5:39; Acts 17:11; 1 John 2:3-5; John 7:17; Proverbs 22:11; Matthew 24:14; Proverbs 14: 25; Revelation 22:17. s, 299.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 36. What is meant by “declaring Jehovah’s name”? (Page 28, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It moans not merely to pronounce the name, but also to make known what it stands for, i.e., God’s purposes toward his people.—1 Peter 2: 9, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font3"> Exodus </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">9:16. en, 86, fl 1; ch, 14, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 37. How has the legislature of New Jersey made it a ‘crime’ for parents to teach their children the commandments of Almighty God? (Page 28, fl2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By making it a misdemeanor for anyone to seek to influence a school child not to salute the American flag, even though the parent conscientiously believes such a practice is contrary to the commandment forbidding one to bow down to or salute any image or symbol.— Exodus 20: 4, 5 ; Deuteronomy 5: 8, 9; Daniel 3:14-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 38. Why is saluting of flags and hailing of men idolatrv, and not merely an “expression of respect”? (Page 31, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A, Because salvation and protection are thereby attributed to the nation instead of to God. The flag stands for the ruling power of a government, and all nations of the earth are against God and His kingdom.—Hosea 13: 2; 1 Kings 19:18; Luke 4:8; Romans 1: 21, 22, 25 ; John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11; James 4:4. s, 257-268.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 39. Are not the rulers of the various nations “higher powers” or “powers that be” and “ordained of God”, and to whom men must be subject? (Page 31, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No, not according to the Scriptures and the obvious facts. The tyrannical totalitarian dictators are not “ordained of God”, nor are rulers elected by the people so ordained, nor those who inherit their position as ruler from some tyrant of the past. None of the worldly rulers are for Jehovah’s kingdom, but they are friends of the world.—James 4:4. s, 255.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 40. Is it judging others to tell them they are guilty of wrong and are going to die? (Page 31, fl 3; page &lt;32)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. This is a fulfillment of the prophetic course of Jeremiah toward the false prophet Hauaniah. (Jeremiah 28:15-17) Christians who are Jehovah’s witnesses must declare the judgments already written, because the time is here.—Psalm 149:9; 1 Corinthians 4:5; Matthew 7: 20; 23:14, 33; 2 Peter 2:3; Ezekiel 3:1821; 33: 3-7.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 1. What is implied by the statement, “The Almighty, the Most High, is the God 'whose name alone is Jehovah’”? (Page 34, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. That, though there be gods many, there is but one “Almighty God”, who is Jehovah.—1 Corinthians 8: 5, 6; Psalm 82:1, 6; John 1:1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott,</span><span class="font3"> interlinear reading); 10:34; Psalm 96:5; 136:2; Exodus 7:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 2. What is the meaning of the scripture: “Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah”? (Page 34, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. That, all men being under condemnation by reason of imperfection and sin, Jehovah alone can rescue and save them to everlasting life, through his Son, Christ Jesus. (Romans 5:15; John 3:16; Revelation 7:10; Psalm 37:39) It also means deliverance from impending disaster, s, 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. Why is violence associated with those who oppose the Kingdom ? and why will they now fail in their opposition? (Page 34, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because violence springs from iniquity (lawlessness). Those who oppose the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Kin</span><span class="font3">gdom are lawless; but the time has come for their defeat at the hands of Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Vindicator and King, who is righteous.—Ezekiel 7:10,11; 28:15,16; Acts 21: 2736; Psalms 2:1-3; 110: 2, 5, 6; Isaiah 8: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 4-. Wily is the vindication of Jehovah’s name of paramount importance? (Page 35, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because God is supreme, all-powerful, just, wise and loving and will not be otherwise represented to his creatures, both for his own sake and for their sakes, as they would be without foundation for faith and obedience to Him if they did not rightly know him.— Romans 3:4; John 17:3; Hebrews 11:6; Romans 10:13,14; Matthew 19 :17. en, 85, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. What is meant by &quot;Christ’s coming to the temple”? (Page 35, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See Question 21, page 6; Question 25, page 58; also ch, 303, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. Where did God in the beginning promise to bring forth a government that would prove his supremacy? (Page 36, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In the garden of Eden. (Genesis 3:15) Also in his dealings with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.—Genesis 12:2,3; 17:1,6; 49:10; Numbers 24:7. go, 56.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. What, briefly, is the issue ? (Page 36, fl 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The issue that must be settled is, &quot;Who is supreme?” This in order that creation may know whom to obey, and why.—Psalm 83:18; Isaiah 45:23; Romans 14:11; Ezekiel 6:10; Exodus 9:16; Isaiah 14:12-14, ch, 339, fl; s, 22, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. Why does not one religious organization support God’s Kingdom? (Page 38, fll)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because religionists support earthly kingdoms (and salute their flags), and are part of Satan’s world.—-John 15:19; 19: 15; Matthew 6 : 24; Titus 1:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9. What is Jehovah’s royal house? (Page 39, fll)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is his Temple, composed of the faithful footstep followers of Christ with Christ as chief cornerstone and head.—1 Corinthians 3: 16; 1 Peter 2:3-9; Revelation 7: 4; 14:1, 3; Acts 15:14; 2 Timothy 2:12. ch, 37, 38, 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. Is the lack of learning on the part of most of Jehovah’s witnesses an evidence that the message they bear is unimportant? (Page 40, fl 1, 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; for the reason that the message is not theirs, but Jehovah’s, and the further reason that Jesus’ apostles, chosen by him, were also unlearned,—Acts 4:13; 1 Corinthians 1: 26-29; 2:1; Galatians 1:11,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 11. Why is it now that the Lord is gathering the “great multitude” of “other sheep”? (Page 41, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it is before the final end that “this gospel of the Kingdom” must be preached in all the world as a witness, as a result of which preaching the great multitude take their stand now while the great tribulation is held in abeyance.—Matthew 24:14,21; Revelation 7:9-14. ch, 317-320.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 12. What similarity is here noted as existing between Jehovah’s witnesses and locusts? (Page 42, fl 1, 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Neither is highly esteemed by men of Satan’s world (Luke 16:15; 21:16,17); nor do they do bodily injury to human creatures (Romans 13: 8-10), but destroy the food supply of religionists.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. What proves that Jehovah’s witnesses deliver God’s, not man’s message? (Page 43, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is taken from the Word of God, and turns men to God and his Theocracy, and is for the vindication of his name. Every statement is supported by Scripture quotations and citations, and compared with the physical facts fulfilling Bible prophecy. (Each book put out by Jehovah’s witnesses contains a thousand Bible references or more.)—1 Corinthians 2:1-7; Isaiah 8:20; Matthew 4:4. p, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. Why is the “Christian Religion” (“Christendom”) not God’s vine and fig tree? (Page 43, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A. </span><span class="font3">It does not bear God’s Life-sustaining food to the people. It does not bear “good fruit”.—Jeremiah 2:21; Deuteronomy 32: 32, 33; Hosea 10:1; Matthew 7:20; 21:43; Galatians 5:19-21. en, 159, ft 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 15. What is God’s vine and fig tree, and its fruit ? (Page </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">43, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. God’s Kingdom organization which holds before the people the Kingdom truth for their sustenance and growth.—John 15:1-8; Mark 4:20; Judges 9:11-13; Isaiah 61: 3. en, 158, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 16. What effect does the message of the Kingdom have on “Christendom”? (Page 44, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jehovah’s “strange work” makes the religious fields a miserable sight, like a field of vegetation destroyed by pests.—Joel 1:10-12; Isaiah 28 :17-20,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 17, What difference is there between the religious systems or sects and Jehovah’s witnesses, taken collectively? (Page 45, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The religious systems have a form of godliness, indulging in traditional ceremonious “worship”. Jehovah’s witnesses worship God by serving Him in bringing to the people the message of the Lord.—Matthew 15: 8, 9; Isaiah 29 :13,14; 66: 3, 4; Galatians 4: 9-11; Luke 6:46; Acts 10:42. ch, 48-51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. What is the “day of the Lord”? (Page 46, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is the time of Jehovah’s vindication, from A.D. 1914 on, therefore a day of gloom upon Satan’s organization and those subject to it. During this “day” the witness is given extending an opportunity to those of good will to escape before the climax at Armageddon. —Zephaniah 1:14-18; Psalm 118:22-24; Zephaniah 2:1-3. en, 263, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. Why are Jehovah’s witnesses unafraid of their powerful enemies, visible and invisible? (Page 47, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They have faith in Almighty God and his promise of protection (Isaiah 12:2); they love God, and there is no fear in love (1 John 4:17,18); they believe Jehovah’s assurance of their resurrection if faithful unto death.-Matthew 10:28; Revelation 3:10; Psalms 34: 7; 91: 2,11; Romans 8: 31; Hebrew's 13: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 20. Is it not disorderly conduct for Jehovah’s witnesses in numbers to “invade a community fully organized” to carry on their work? (Page 48, fll)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; for the reason that their work is not injurious to any; but exposes the religious racketeers, and is commanded by Jehovah to be done.—Proverbs 30: 24, 27; Isaiah 61:1, 2; Matthew 28:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21, What is meant by the statement, “They obey God rather than . . . men”? (Page 49, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A, Since Jehovah’s witnesses are proceeding in harmony with God’s law, no law of man could rightly be framed or applied to hinder them in their work, but if so applied is ignored by them.—Acts 5 : 27-29 ; 4:18-20. s, 257, fl 1; 263, fl 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. Why are Jehovah’s witnesses denounced as Communists, seditionists, reds, etc.? (Page 50, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Being unable to answer the truth of the Kingdom message the clergy and their allies resort to misrepresenting Jehovah’s witnesses in order to have an excuse to do injury. Jesus and his apostles were similarly accused.—Matthew 26: 59, 60; Luke 23: 5,14; Acts 17:6; 24; 5 ; Psalm 83 : 2, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23. Why does Jehovah now challenge all the nations to engage in war with him? (Page 51, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because the time has conic for the final showdown and a demonstration of Jehovah’s supremacy over all forces that could be arrayed against Him and his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. What law of God are children made to violate by the compulsory flag-salute laws? (Page 52)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A, The command, “Thou shaft have no other gods [objects of worship] before me [Jehovah]; thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything . . . : thou shalt not how down thyself to them nor serve them.”-Exodus 20; 3-5; Daniel 3:16-18; Leviticus 26:1, 30. s, 257, fl 1-259, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 25. Who are the mighty host of heaven? (P. 54, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. God’s invisible war organization, consisting of cherubim, seraphim, angels and others under the guidance and command of Christ Jesus, as Jehovah’s Warrior-King.—Revelation 5:11; 19:11-16; Matthew 25:31; Jude 14,15, A.R.V.; Isaiah 13: 3-5 ; 6:1,2, 6; Genesis 3:24; Psalm 99:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 26. How does Jehovah maneuver the enemy forces to the “site of battle”? (Page 54, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By sending forth his witnesses with His message, which exposes the lies and hypocrisy of the enemies, thus forcing these to take their stand openly against God and his kingdom.—Psalm 83: 2-5; Isaiah 28:17; Luke 12:2; Jeremiah 1:17-19; Revelation 10:14; Joshua 8:10-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS NOS. P-200—P-203 “VICTORY”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. What is the &quot;valley of decision” ? (Page 54, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is the “valley of Jehoshaphat”—not the geographical site by that name, but the symbolic &quot;valley”, the condition and time for the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name by threshing his enemies, settling the question at issue as to who is supreme.—2 Chronicles 20:15, 22-26; Joel 3: 2,14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font3"> Psalms 2: 8-12; 46: 6-11; Isaiah 4.1:15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 28. What is meant by “the fire of God’s jealousy”? (Page 55, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. &quot;Fire” is a symbol of complete destruction. “Jealousy” means “zeal” for truth and righteousness, which will consume all wickedness and those who practice it. —Zephaniah 3: 8, 9; Deuteronomy 4: 24; Isaiah 24:6; Exodus 34:14; Ezekiel 39:25; Zephaniah 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 29. What is meant by the shaking of “heavens” and &quot;earth”? (Page 55, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. “Heavens” refers to the invisible part, “earth” to the visible part, of the world-organization. The Lord will shake and remove every vestige of Satan’s world to make way for the righteous world to come.—Haggai 2:6,7; Hebrews 12:25-29. ch, 36, ¶ 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 30. How does Jehovah &quot;roar out of Zion”? (Page 55, ¶ 3,4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Through his witnesses on earth, who boldly declare his judgments.—Jeremiah 25:30; Isaiah 66:6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. In view of the stopping of the work in Germany and elsewhere, how can it be said ‘No law enacted will stop the testimony’? (Page 56, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Laws have been enacted for the express purpose of stopping the witness, but the testimony is still being given in Germany, etc., though under great persecution.—Mai'k 13:9; Isaiah 54: IT; 46:11; Philippians 1:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 32. What difference is there between those who take refuge in Jehovah and those who resort to religion for safety? (Page 57, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Those who trust in Jehovah shall never he moved; but those who trust in religion shall have their refuge swept away completely.—Psalms 46:1, 2; 125:1; Isaiah 28: 15,17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 33. What does it mean to flee from religion and take refuge under Christ? (Page 58, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. To flee from religion means to abandon the systems, traditions, hearsay and say-so of men, and avoid forms, ceremonies and sectarian practices. To take refuge under Christ means to serve God as he did, and believe in him as the One sent of God to save those who seek salvation.—Revelation 18: 3,4; Galatians 4: 9-11; 2 Timothy 3:5; Matthew 24; 16; John 3:16; 4:24; 6: 27-29. &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 34. Why is the “witness work” of primary importance? (Page 59, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it is the work Jehovah has specifically commissioned his people to do; it honors his name, comforts those of good will, and warns the enemy.—Isaiah 43:10-12: Matthew 24:14; John 18:37; Acts 1:8; Romans 10:10; Isaiah 61:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 35. Why do Jehovah’s witnesses have no earthly political aspirations? (Page 60, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they are subjects of Jehovah’s theocratic kingdom under Christ and kmow they cannot serve two masters.—Philippians 3:20, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font3"> Hebrews 11:1416; Psalm 118:8,9; Hebrews 13:14; John 18:36; James 4:4; Matthew 6:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 36. What is the host of the Devil? (Page 60, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Host means “army”. Satan’s army is composed of his wicked angels (also called “demons”), who operate through wicked men.—Ephesians 6:12; Revelation 12: 7, 9; 1 Timothy 4:1, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">AJ?..V.;</span><span class="font3"> Revelation 16:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.;</span><span class="font3"> 1 Corinthians 10: 20, ri.R.V. en, 34, ¶ 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 37. Should a Christian be indifferent to having a good reputation among men? (Page 60, fl 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes; because the world lies in the wicked one and because Jesus made himself of no reputation.— Luke 6: 26; 1 Jolin 2:17; 4: 5, 6; 5:19; James 4:4; Philippians 2: 7,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 38. Why is the message declared by Jehovah’s witnesses a message of hope? (Page 61, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it announces the end of all wickedness and the establishment of the kingdom of peace, truth, love and righteousness. — Isaiah 65:17,18; Proverbs 10: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 39. To whom only will this message be comforting? (Page 61, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. To those who are of good will toward God.—Luke 2:14, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin, ch,  57, ¶ 1.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q, 1. What great issue confronts the people today? (Page 3, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Shall the world be ruled by Jehovah’s Theocratic Government under Christ Jesus, or by arbitrary dictators under Satan? Psalm 2 states that “the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord” while Jehovah declares “Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion”. Also Psalm 110:2 states that Christ. Jesus must begin his reign in the midst of his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 2. Why cannot men settle the issue? (Page 3, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The issue is not between men, but affects men. The issue is between Jehovah God and the Devil. The totalitarian powers are backed up by Satan and his invisible hosts. Only by divine power can the vicions rule of Satan through dictators be overthrown, and that is exactly what God purposes to do, through his King Christ Jesus. — Psalms 110:5,6; 2:9; Daniel 2:44; Revelation 19:11-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. Why do the people need to hear the facts about this issue? (Page 3, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because life or death of creatures depends upon their choosing the proper side. (Psalm 2:11,12) The very purpose of this speech is to present the facts showing that to obey God and Christ, his King, means life, but that to render allegiance to arbitrary dictators who oppose God’s kingdom means death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 4. Why do certain groups, such as those who support Fascism, suppress a free expression of honest opinions? (Page 3, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. To keep the people in ignorance, until the people are deprived of all liberty and are under the complete control of dictators.—Luke 11:52; John 3:20; 8:32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. How can it be said that Jehovah’s witnesses are not engaged in a campaign of hate when they speak against all religious faiths? (Page 4, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jehovah’s witnesses declare the truth, and offer the Word of God and the physical facts in proof, so that honest people may consider it and choose their own course. Jehovah’s witnesses do not try to coerce or compel anyone to believe, nor do they try to suppress others from speaking, as is done by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. To tell the people about the evils of totalitarianism, how it is supported by a religious organization, and that disaster will befall those who willingly co-operate with it, is an act of duty and unselfishness, not of hatred, nor to create hatred of any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. What is the Scriptural and historical proof that Nimrod was the first dictator? (Page 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See Genesis 10: 8-10; also en, pages 65-67, 202, 203.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. Are not religion and the worship of God the same thing? (Page 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. Religion is a form of worship of some higher power, but is based on tradition and teachings of men, not on the Bible. Jesus condemned the scribes and Pharisees because they followed the traditions of their religion instead of the commandments of God. (Matthew 15:1-9) It was the same religion that induced Saul to persecute the true followers of Christ Jesus, and the apostle Paul definitely links religion with tradition. (Galatians 1:13,14) For a full treatise on the difference between religion and Christianity, see the booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Protection;</span><span class="font3"> also page 43 of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. What is meant by the statement “Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful Ruler, has come again”? (P. 7, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jesus promised he would come again with all his holy angels at the end of Satan’s uninterrupted rule over the world, in order to establish his kingdom of righteousness, to judge the living and the dead, to destroy Satan and all his invisible organization, and to vindicate his Father’s name, (John 14:3; Matthew 25:31; 2 Timothy 4:1; Revelation 22:12) As the Scriptures and the physical facts show, Christ has now begun to do these things. But since he is no longer the human Jesus, but a divine, immortal spirit, he is invisible to human eyes.—John 14:19; Matthew 24:3-22; Luke 21: 7-28. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9. What is the Theocracy? (Page 8, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is the government of the world by the immediate command and direction of the Almighty God, administered by the Lord Jesus Christ. It is the long-promised “Kingdom of Heaven”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. How do we know that Hitler and Mussolini are supported by the Hierarchy in the persecution of the Jews? (Pages 10,11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. History shows that the Catholic Hierarchy has always been the most cruel persecutor of the Jews. Hitler’s and Mussolini’s anti-Semitic decrees are very similar to the bulls of many popes. The much-advertised movement of some American Catholics announced as to “fight anti-Semitism” is only a smoke-screen and to divert attention and investigation by Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 11. As to the statement that Hitler and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy have heen working together in Germany: How do you harmonize that with reports in the press of growing hostility between the Nazis and the Catholic Church? (Page 11, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Regardless of censored propagandistic press reports, the fact remains that they have worked together in the past. Some examples of their co-operation are (1) the Concordat between Hitler and the Vatican made in 1933 still stands; (2) the co-operation of Cardinal Innitzer when Hitler took over Austria, instructing all Catholics to vote for the annexation; (3) the support of the German cardinals and bishops when Hitler entered Czechoslovakia; (4) the backing of Franco in the war in Spain by Hitler, Mussolini and the Vatican; (5) the support of the German Catholic clergy by state funds; (6) the pope’s refusal to excommunicate or interdict Hitler as a Catholic; (7) Hitler’s immediate suppression of the work of Jehovah’s witnesses in Germany at the request of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy; etc. See Appendix of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Face the Facts, </span><span class="font3">page 60.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 12. Has not the Catholic Hierarchy as much right as anybody else to control America and to carry on political activities? (Pages 14, ¶ 1; 15, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; no party or organization, political or religious, has any right to divide its allegiance with a foreign power and seek to bring the country into subjection to such foreign power, such as the pope. The Hierarchy poses as a Christian body, and Christ Jesus declared that his kingdom was not of this world (John 18: 36) and that his followers were not a part of the world. (John 17:16) Jesus refused temporal power when it was offered to him. (Matthew 4:8-10; John 6:15) Also see 2 Corinthians 6:14-17; 2 Timothy 2:4; John 15: 19. Therefore a person or group of persons cannot be followers of Christ Jesus and at the same time indulge in polities.—James 4: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. Are these acts of the Hierarchy in suppressing freedom of speech and of assembly and gagging their opponents something new? (Pages 19-33)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. History shows that from Emperor Constantine’s time on they have always persecuted those who expressed opinions contrary to theirs and they have caused the suppression and destruction of countless books., including Bibles, that expose their false doctrines and their crooked work. See ch,  pages 245-348.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. Why docs the Roman Catholic Hierarchy seek to suppress freedom of speech and of assembly and worship? (Page 22, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because, as stated by Jesus (John 3:20,31), “every one that doeth evil hate th the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved [discovered (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin) ].”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 15. Isn’t it unchristian io judge others and call them ‘hijackers’? (Page 24, fl3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. For like descriptive, symbolic words of judgment see Matthew 23:13-15, 23-33; John 8:44; Isaiah 58:1; Ephesians 5:11-13. These texts show plainly that it is the duty of a Christian to expose those who oppose God and His kingdom; to declare the judgments written against them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 16. Is it Scriptural for a group which claims to be Christian to use threats, boycott and violence to silence their opponents? (Pages 18-82)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. God declares, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” (Romans 12:19) Also see Deuteronomy 32: 35; Psalm 94:1. The high priest of Jerusalem tried to silence the apostles by threats, imprisonment and other violent methods, similar to those used by the Hierarchy now. One of the Pharisees, Gamaliel, gave wise counsel to his colleagues who wanted to kill the apostles: “Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ye be found even to fight against God.”—Acts 5:17-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 17, Why don’t the newspapers report such acts of the Hierarchy to suppress free speech? (Pages 19-22)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because frightened by the Hierarchy, and because controlled by selfish men who do not want the truth to be known.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. Why are Jehovah’s witnesses not afraid of the Fascist-Hierarchy combine, while others, like the public press and radio stations, yield to its pressure? (Page 25, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they love God and have complete faith and confidence in the power that is backing them up, which is, to wit, the Almighty God and his King Christ Jesus, together with his invisible host of angels. —1 John 4:17,18; 2 Chronicles 20: 15; Deuteronomy 3:22; 31:6; 2 Samuel 22:2, 3, 31-33; Psa</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">lm</span><span class="font3">s 7:1; 18:2,30; 91:1-11; 125:1; 1.44:1,2; Isaiah 26:4; Matthew 10:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. Why have sorrow and woe increased since 1914? and who is to blame? (Page 25, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Sorrow and trouble have increased upon Satan’s organization because we are living in the “last days” thereof, (2 Timothy 3:1) Satan, the Devil, is to blame. (Revelation 12:12) See ch, 174, ¶ 1; 175, ¶ 1. Also en, 312, ¶ 1 and 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 20. Does God hear the prayers of religionists when they pray for peace, and when they ask their flocks to pray for peace? (Page 26, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. Such prayers are hypocritical because those praying continue to support those who prosecute war, such as Franco in Spain, Mussolini against Ethiopia, and the Japanese against China, as well as Hitler’s seizure of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. In Proverbs 15:8 it is stated that the “sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Loud; but the prayer of the upright is his delight”, (Proverbs 15: 29; 28:9; Psalm 34:15,16) God is neutral as to wars among nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21. What is meant by the term “the last days”? (Page 27, fl 2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Not the last days of this earth (Ecclesiastes 1: 4), but the last days of Satan’s rule over the earth. (John 12:31) The physical facts in fulfillment of prophecy show we are living in that time now. (2 Timothy 3:1-4; 2 Peter 3: 3, 4) Following the destruction of the present evil world (<sup>c</sup>old heavens and earth’) Christ Jesus will completely establish his righteous rule in the earth.— 2 Peter 3:12,13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. How do we know that the Fascist-Hierarchy combine is the “abomination of desolation” mentioned by Daniel (Daniel 11: 31; 12:11) ? (Page 28, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it is a monstrosity set up in opposition to God’s kingdom. It arrogantly claims the right to rule the world, is founded on lies, and causes much innocent blood to be shed to accomplish its purpose.—Proverbs 6:16-19. See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Year Book</span><span class="font3"> for 1939, pages 8, 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23. Who are those “in Judsea” ? and how do they “flee to the mountains”? (Page 28, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See ch, 352, ¶ 1; 353, ¶ 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. Why is it impossible for men to stop the onward march of the Hierarchy-Fascists? (Page 28, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because only Jehovah God can do that. — Job ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;38:10,11; Zephaniah 3:8; Zechariah 14:3; Ezekiel</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">38:18-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 25. Is it carrying on a “campaign of hate” to expose a wicked organization? (Page 29, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. Jesus hated wickedness (Psalm 45:7) and denounced the hypocritical religionists of his day. (Matthew 23: 13-33) Jehovah foretold that he would cause the refuge of lies to be swept away. (Isaiah 28: 17) Jehovah’s witnesses tell the truth and expose evil, not to do injury to anyone, but that the people of good will may forsake that which is in opposition to God and turn to his King and kingdom. They warn the people of the disaster that will befall those who remain in religious organizations.—Ezekiel 3 :17-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 26. How do we know that Jesus’ words about the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">clergy of his day apply at this time? (Page 30, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because his words exactly fit the actions of the religious leaders now. The religious leaders had led the Jews away from the true worship of God. (Matthew 15: 7-9; Isaiah 29:13; Jeremiah 7: 4-12; Matthew 21:12,13) The apostle stated that these things were pictures or types of things that would come to pass in the last days.—1 Corinthians 10:11; Romans 15:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. How do we know that the battle of Armageddon is near at hand? (Page 31, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By the fulfillment of prophecy. Some of the prophecies relating to the last days which are now being fulfilled are Matthew 24:3-15; Revelation 11:15-18; 16:13-16; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Timothy 3:1-5; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Peter 3:3-13; Luke 21:26-28; Ezekiel 9:1-7; 33:7-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 28. How does one know that Jehovah enthroned Christ in A.D. 1914? (Page 32, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By Bible chronology and by the physical facts in fulfillment of prophecy.—Matthew 24: 3-14; Psalm 110:1, 2 ; Revelation 11:15-18; 12:1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 29. Who are the “princes [that] shall rule in judgment”? (Page 33, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The faithful men of old who lived before Christ, some of whom are specifically named in Hebrews 11, and who shall be resurrected as perfect men on earth. -—See Psalm 45: 16 and Hebrews 11:35, 39,40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 30, Can one remain neutral in regard to the issue between the monstrosity and God’s kingdom? (Page 34, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. One must take his stand on the side of God and His kingdom in order to receive protection and deliverance. — Matthew 24:16; Zephaniah 2:3; Matthew 6: 24; 12: 30; Revelation 3:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. What does it mean to turn to God and Christ his King? (Page 34, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. To forsake religion, because it is of the Devil and is part of his organization, and to study God’s Word to learn what His will is, and then to obey his commandmerits. One must identify himself as being on the Lord’s side by engaging in the proclamation, of the theocratic kingdom.—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS NOS. P-155—P-158 “FACE THE FACTS”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 1. What is the use of facing facts, especially unpleasant facts? (Page 3, ft 1-3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In order that one may pursue a course which is best for his interests. See page 5, 1, 3.—Proverbs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">22:3; </span><span class="font3">Ezekiel 3: 17-21; John 8: 32.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 2. What is the reason for stressing the name “JEHOVAH”? (Page 3, ¶ 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By this name the Most High God reveals himself. (Exodus 3:14-17; Isaiah 42:8) It is his “Memorial Name”. It signifies his purpose, promise and pledge to those who believe. It means “I will be what I will be” or “I will be what I please (to my people)”. To them he is Creator, Savior, Preserver, Redeemer, Father (Life-giver), Supporter, Friend, Protector, Helper, Shepherd, Comforter, Teacher, Leader, Law-giver, Deliverer, Judge, Commander, Warrior, Avenger, Bless-er, or whatever his purposes toward his people may require, always being absolutely equal to any circumstances and necessities that may arise. See ch,  8, 28.—Jeremiah 10:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. Where is the name “JEHOVAH” found in the Bible? (Page 3, fl 4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In the King James Version it is found at Exodus 6:3 (see also </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Douay Version Bible,</span><span class="font3"> margin); Isaiah 12: 2; 26: 4; Psalm 83:18. However, in the original text of the Bible (Hebrew) the name occurs more than seven thousand times. In most instances the name has been translated “Loud” or “God” in our Bible, but it should properly be “Jehovah”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 4. When in world history have conditions been similar to those now existing? (Page 4, '| 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In the days of Noah, before the great flood.—Genesis 6: 5-13; Matthew 24: 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. How do we know that all nations are facing death? (Page 5, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Daniel 2: 44; Matthew 24: 21,22; Isaiah 24: 1-6; Jeremiah 25:29-33; Zephaniah 1:14-18; 3:8,9,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. How do we know that the Bible is a safe guide ? (Page 5, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Psalm 119:105; 2 Timothy 3:16; John 5:39; 17: 17; Romans 1:16,17; Psalm 19: 7-14. See c, 105.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. What is a theocracy? (Page 6, H 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See page 19, Question No. 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. Who was Lucifer, and when did he become the adversary? (Page 6, JI 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Isaiah 14: 12-14; Luke 10: 18. He is referred to by the prophet Ezekiel as the “king of Tyre” (Ezekiel 28: 11-15), which Satan really was.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9. What are the meanings of the names which Jehovah gave to unfaithful Lucifer (Revelation 20:2)? (Page 6, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Satan</span><span class="font3"> means opposer (Zechariah 3:1, 2; Jude 9); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Serpent</span><span class="font3"> means deceiver (Genesis 3: 13; 2 Corinthians 11:3); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Devil</span><span class="font3"> means slanderer (John 8:44; 13:2); and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Dragon</span><span class="font3"> means devourer (Revelation 12:4; Jeremiah 51:34). See en, 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. Why did God permit Satan to live after his rebellion? (Page 6, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In order that an opportunity might be provided to prove whether or not the Devil’s challenge was true. (Job 1:9-11; 2:4,5) Also that God might demonstrate his own supremacy and vindicate his name over Satan, the greater Pharaoh.—Exodus 9:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 11. How do we know that practically all of the human race have been blinded by Satan? (Page 8, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See 2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 12:9; Isaiah 60: 2; 29:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 12. What proof have we that Satan has a limited time in which to operate? (Page 8, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Revelation 12:12 states that the Devil knows he has but a short time. Matthew 8: 29 shows that the demons knew they had a fixed time to operate. Hebrews 2:14 shows definitely that the Devil will be destroyed. See also Psalm 110:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. How can it be said “God’s kingdom is here”, when there is so much wickedness in the world? (Page </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">9,</span><span class="font3"> fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Psalm 110:1,2 shows that Christ Jesus would begin his reign in the midst of his enemies. At 1 Corinthians 15: 25 the apostle states that Christ must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. Revelation 11:17,18 shows that when God’s kingdom begins the nations would be angry. Jesus gave similar testimony.—Matthew 24: 3-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. Is the kingdom of God something that is established in the hearts of men (Luke 17 : 21) ? (Page 9, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. The text at Luke 17: 21 Jesus said to his enemies, and it should properly be translated “the king is among you”, according to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott,</span><span class="font3"> footnote. See c,  114, ¶ 1-117, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(J. 15. What is the proof that Christ has now come and that his rule has begun? (Page 11, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See answer to similar question, No. 8, page 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 16. What is the “hideous monstrosity” referred to by Judge Rutherford? (Page 11, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The totalitarian rule with religion in the saddle and which is now swooping the earth. See booklet </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fascism or Freedom,</span><span class="font3"> page 41, fl 2 and page 58, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 17. Are Jehovah’s witnesses as opposed to Communism as to Fascism? (Page 12, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes. They are against any form of government set up in opposition to God’s kingdom. Communism and Fascism are both opposed to God’s kingdom. Russia, Italy and Germany are all ruled by arbitrary dictators, and although their governments operate under different names, the form of rule is really the same, that is, totalitarian, and this lecture shows that such antitheocracy, totalitarian rule is a hideous monstrosity. See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Warning,</span><span class="font3"> page 51, ¶ 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS NOS. P-159—P-162 “FACE THE FACTS&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. What proof is there that religion is the tie that binds together earthly ruling powers? (Page 13, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. All practice religion in common, which religion is of the Devil, “the god of this world.” See en, 66, fl 169, ¶ 1; also pages 148-152.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. What shows that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy is against God and his kingdom? (Page 13, ¶ 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is willing to make a deal with any political party of Satan’s world and to recognize such as the “higher powers” provided it can gain some religious and temporal favors. See en, 284, fl 2-286, ¶ 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 20. Why does the Roman Catholic Hierarchy raise the cry that they are “persecuted” in Germany, though Hitler is a Catholic and supports Catholicism? (Page 15, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. One reason is to win sympathy and to keep the people in democratic countries like Britain and America in ignorance of, and from protesting against, its purpose to gain control of all the nations through Fascism. Until public opinion in Britain and America can be brought around to submit to totalitarian rule, the Hierarchy tries to cover up its relations with the Nazis and Fascists. There is, however, much evidence that the Hierarchy, the Nazis and Fascists are working together. The magazine </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> publishes much information from time to time to prove that there is co-operation between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21. Has not the Roman Catholic Hierarchy always opposed Communism? (Page 15, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Outwardly, yes. But secretly it has pushed Communistic movements in various lands to provide an excuse for Fascists and Nazis to seize the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. What is the law referred to by which the president can become a dictator in one hour? (Page 16, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Two measures have this effect: (1) Industrial Mobilization Plan- (2) The National Defense Act. All that is needed is an “emergency” to put them into effect. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> No. 508, page 25; also </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Mercury</span><span class="font3"> of July, 1938.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23. Does the fact that the servants of God have always been persecuted prove that the Devil is supreme? (Page 17, fl 2, 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No- The Devil challenged that God could not put men on earth who would remain faithful to Him under persecution. The fact that Jehovah’s servants do remain faithful under the test proves that Jehovah is supreme. (Job 1: 6-12; 2:1-6) Even though the Devil kills some of God’s servants, such are promised life. (Revelation 2:10; Matthew 24: 9-13) Furthermore, God will avenge the blood of his servants.—Revelation 19: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. Who are the “Jonadabs”? (Page 17, fl 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. These are the people of good will, the &quot;great multitude”, who take their stand on the side of Jehovah and Christ Jesus, just as Jonadab took his stand with King Jehu, whom God used to destroy Devil religion in Israel. —2 Kings 10:15-23. ch, 76, fl 1-78, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 25. Is it not a good thing to prevent blasphemy? (Page 19, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. One who is a Christian would be against those who blaspheme God’s name. However, note that the British Blasphemy Act does not seek to stop those who blaspheme God’s name, but those who speak against religion, which is of the Devil. The obvious aim of the act is to protect religious systems from exposure as being the real blasphemers of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 26. What will be the condition when all nations become totalitarian? (Page 20, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The rulers, especially the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, will say “Peace and safety”, but their destruction will be imminent.—1 Thessalonians 5:3; Psalm 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. “The wicked shall be turned into hell.” Does this mean that their fate will be “eternal torment”? (Page 20, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Nowhere in the Bible does “hell” mean a place or condition of torment. It is the state of death or destruction.-—Psalm 16:10; Acts 2: 27-31; Ezekiel 32:27; Jonah 2:2. c, 256-263.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 28. Will the totalitarian monstrosity succeed in stopping the proclamation of the message of Jehovah’s kingdom? (Page 21, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Not at all Jehovah’s purpose has been accomplished and the witness has completely been given and finished according to Matthew 24:14, 21; Isaiah 55:11; 54:17; 6:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 29. What hearing do the experiences of Jehoshaphat and David in fighting their enemies have upon the present-day situation? (Page </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">22,</span><span class="font3"> fl 1, 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They are prophetic illustrations or dramas, showing how God’s enemies will bo beaten, by Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s Warrior-Vindicator, in which victory God’s people, Jehovah’s witnesses and “Jonadabs”, share.— 2 Chronicles 20; 1 Samuel 17:38-54; Romans 15:4; 1 Corinthians 10:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RECORDS NOS. P-163—P-166 &quot;FACE THE FACTS&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 30. Prove that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy now stands before Christ’s judgment seat. (Page 23, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. We are now living in the judgment day, when Christ Jesus is at his temple for judgment. (Malachi 3:1-3; Matthew 25: 31,32 ; Revelation 14; 6, 7; Romans 14:10; Isaiah 28:16,17) It is the time for the judgment of “the great whore” (Revelation 17: 1, 2), which is a picture of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. When will the death of the pope and the Hierarchy, as mentioned, take place? (Page 23, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. At the Battle of Armageddon, when Jehovah God takes action against them.—Revelation 18: 8-10, 20-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 32. By whom will Jehovah cause the wicked to be destroyed? (Page 24, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By his invisible hosts of angels, led by Christ Jesus. See Revelation 19:11-21; Ezekiel 38:14-23; Zechariah 14: 3,12; Jeremiah 51: 47-58; Ezekiel 9:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 33. Why compare the conditions of the present time to those which preceded the flood? (Page </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">24,</span><span class="font3"> fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because what came to pass at the flood is a picture of what will happen in the near future. Before the. flood the earth was filled with violence, just as it is now. (Genesis 6:5,11-13; Matthew 24:37-39; Luke 17:26,27) Those now devoted to God and his kingdom will survive Armageddon just as Noah and his family survived the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 34. How do we know that “mountains” represent God’s kingdom? (Page 25, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See Daniel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3">: 35,44; Isaiah 2: 2,3; 11:9; 25: 6-8; 52:7; 57:13; 65: 25,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 35. Why will it he too late to flee to “the mountains” after Armageddon has begun? (Page 25, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because that will be the time of the “Lord’s anger”. (Zephaniah 2:1-3) It will be the ‘wintertime’ referred to by Jesus. (Matthew 24: 20) At that time the separation work will be complete.—Matthew 25: 31-46; Ezekiel 9 :1-6. ch, 93-99.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 36. How can you “take your stand firmly on the side of God and his kingdom”? (Page 26, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See answer to Question No. 31, page 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 37. How does one flee out of the organization of “Christendom” and find refuge in God’s organization? (Page 26, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By abandoning religion and religious practices (“Christendom” being “organized religion”), and by serving God in spirit and in truth. (John 4:23; Philip-pians 3:3) See answer to previous question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 38. If Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Gentiles, Fascism and Hierarchy, as well as Communism, are all on the same side, why do they fight one another? (Page 27, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Harmony and unity does not exist in the Devil’s organization as it does in the Lord’s organization. All those who are on the Devil’s side are moved by selfishness; therefore each one looks out for his own interests rather than for the common cause. The enemies of God’s typical people often fought among themselves, but when the question came up as to whether they would serve Jehovah, they were at one against Jehovah and against his people Israel. In the question at issue now, there is no neutral side. One is either for God’s kingdom or against it, and all of the groups mentioned in the question are definitely against God’s kingdom, — Matthew 12:30; 1 John 5:19; Matthew 6:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 39. What is meant by the statement &quot;Jehovah God’s kingdom has begun”? (Page 28, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See answer to Question No. 13, page 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 40. Why is the work of giving testimony concerning the Kingdom called a “strange work”? (Page 28, fl </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it is against religion and appears very strange to religionists, who do not understand God’s purposes. (Isaiah 29: 13,14) God has taken out of the world a people for his name who announce his purposes about to be executed. (Isaiah 43:10) This work of proclaiming the kingdom appears very foolish to the “wise ones” of this world.—1 Corinthians 1: 18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 41. What responsibility rests upon those who hear this lecture? (Page 29, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. To take their stand definitely on the side of the Lord and to co-operate with Jehovah’s witnesses in his “strange work”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 42. Is it Scriptural to say “religion is a snare and a racket”? (Page 31, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes. Religion is a snare because through it the Devil has deceived and entrapped the masses of mankind. Religion was a snare to the Israelites (Psalm 106: 36; Judges 2:3; Deuteronomy 7:16) and is likewise a snare to all those who practice it now. A racket is a scheme, plan or trick used for selfish gain and which deceives and works injury to others. The word “racket”, therefore, is appropriately applied to religion, because it is deceptive, it robs the people of their property, their peace of mind and freedom of action, and will result in destruction to those who continue to practice it.

<p><span class="font3">Q. 1. Why is having a part in the vindication of Jehovah’s name man’s greatest privilege? (Page 34, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Since Jehovah God is the Most High and the Almighty, the creator of the universe and all things therein (Acts 17:24), and the giver of life and all incident blessings (James 1:17; Romans 6:23; Psalm 16:11), therefore it is the greatest honor man can have to serve Jehovah and to have a part in glorifying his name. Jehovah holds in his hands the life of every creature (Job 12:10), and to have a part in the vindication of his name means life to the creature.—Acts 17: 28; Revelation 4:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font3"> Did not God create man to ultimately go to heaven? (Page 34, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No, God created man to inhabit the earth, (Isaiah 45:18; Psalm 115 :16) Life in heaven is promised only to the &quot;little flock” (Luke 12: 32), who share with Christ Jesus in his sufferings and are taken into the covenant for the Kingdom. (Luke 22: 28-30) Not even John the Baptist will be of the heavenly class (Matthew 11:11), but he and the other faithful servants of God mentioned in Hebrews 11, as well as the &quot;great multitude” (Revelation 7:9), will live upon the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. Since Adam’s offspring total many billions, was not the command to “multiply and fill the earth” fully carried out? (Page 34, fl 2, 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. God’s purpose was to fill the earth with righteous creatures, and none of Adam’s offspring are righteous, because born imperfect. — Romans 3:10-12,23; Psalm 51: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 4. Would not the resurrection of the dead fulfill the divine mandate? (Page 35, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; because the mandate was given to man to perform, and the resurrection of the dead will be an act of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. How do we know that the flood and attending circumstances were typical? (Page 35, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jesus’ words so stated.—Matthew 24: 37-39; Luke</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">17:26,27;</span><span class="font3"> Romans 15:4; 1 Corinthians 10:11; also see eh, 99, If </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2;</span><span class="font3"> s, 71, fl 1,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. Why attach importance to the names of players in prophetic dramas? (Page 35, fl 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The Scriptures show them to be significant.—Genesis 17: 5; 32:28; Matthew 1:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. How did the Devil try to prevent the performance of the divine mandate? (Page 36, (( 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By inducing Adam and Eve to disobey God and thus receive the death sentence before their children were born; and by inducing the angels to materialize and intermarry with women to produce a race of giants who were hybrid creatures, thus filling the earth with violence and causing God to destroy all flesh.—Genesis 6:1-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. Who were the &quot;neph</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">ilim</span><span class="font3">”, the &quot;sons of God”, and the “mighty men”? (Page 36, 1(2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The nephilim (“fallen ones” or ‘“'fellers”) were the angels who joined Lucifer in the rebellion (Jude 6; 2 Peter 2:4); the “sons of God” were the angels who were deceived by Satan and his bullies (nephilim) and induced to come down to earth io marry the daughters of men, and which angels are now held in prison by Satan (1 Peter 3:19, 20); and the “mighty men” were the offspring of the improper union of angels and women. (Genesis 6:4. AJf.P.) These mighty men (Gibborim) were destroyed in the flood. — Genesis 7:23; see en, 37, U 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9. Who made the Devil? (Page 37, 1(1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See Questions Nos. 8, 9, and answers, page 26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. Why does Satan try to prevent the fulfilling of the mandate? (Page 37, 1(1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. To try to prove that Jehovah is not able to carry out Iris expressed purpose, and therefore unworthy of the worship of men; thereby to bring reproach upon his name.—Job 1:9-11; 2:4,5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 11. Who are meant by the “body of Christ” as foreshadowed by Noah? (Page 38, 1(2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They are the spirit-begotten and anointed footstep followers of Jesus.—1 Corinthians 12: 12, 20, 27; Ephesians 5:23,30; Colossians 1:18. en, 133, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 12. Why has God permitted Satan to continue for so long? (Page 39, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. To first have Hie witnesses declare His name, and then to prove His own supremacy and righteousness.—Exodus 9:16. s, 15, fl 1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. What is the “temple”? and how did Christ “come to the temple”? (Page 40, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The “temple” is the composite body of Christ’s followers. (1 Corinthians 3:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16) See en, 313-320; also answer to Question No. 25, page 58.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. Should one literally be baptized in water? (Page 41)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes; such is a proper and necessary act of obedience.—Matthew 28:19; 3:15,16. ch, 144; s, 270, 271.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q.. 15. Why is the doctrine of “universal salvation” a trick of Satan? (Page 42, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It denies man’s responsibility before Jehovah God and robs God of the voluntary fear, respect and obedience due him. (Proverbs 11: 21; 16:5; 17:5; 19:5; Matthew 25: 46; Romans 6:23; Psalm 145: 20; Acts 17: 28; 2 Thessalonians 1:9) It denies Jehovah’s word.. It leads men into destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 16. Who are the “remnant” (Romans 11:5)? (Page 43, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The members of Christ’s body yet remaining on earth, ch, 175, fl 2; en, 317-319; s, 164, fl 1,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 17. Who are the “just”, the “unjust”, and the “wicked”? (Page 43, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The just are those who in this life prove their faith in God and receive his approval, and include the faithful men of old, the faithful prophets (Hebrews 11: 39), the faithful followers of Christ, who compose the 144,000 (Revelation 14: 1), and the “great multitude” of “companions”, otherwise known as the “Jouadabs”. (Revelation 7:9; Psalm 45:14) The unjust include the world of mankind in general who have inherited the condemnation that came upon Adam and who have not been justified by faith in the blood of Christ Jesus. (Romans 5:18,19) The wicked are those who reject and oppose the truth (Hebrews 10:26; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Peter 2:20-2-2) and who fight against God and persecute his servants. (Psalms 10:2-7; 11:2; 37:12) The wicked shall be destroyed for ever.—Psalm 37: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. Is the idea of a “second chance” unscriptural? (Page 44)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is unscriptural, because God does not change. (Malachi 3:6) Esau and Judas sought repentance in vain. See Hebrews 6: 4-6; 12:16,17; 1 Samuel 15: 29; Matthew 26:24; Isaiah 26:10,14; Luke 16:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. If the great multitude are to “fill the earth” with offspring, what place will be left for those who are raised from the dead? (Page 45, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The expression “fill the earth” is not to be taken in the extreme sense to mean “pack the earth’. It does not mean that there will be no habitable room left when the mandate is fulfilled, nor that God cannot create further habitable parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 20. Why docs the lecture suggest that comparatively few wilt survive Armageddon? (Page 46, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because the Scriptures and the prophetic pictures indicate that only a comparative few of the many millions now on earth will survive. (Isaiah 24: 3-6) Only eight persons survived the flood, which was a picture of Armageddon.—Matthew 24: 37-39; Jeremiah 25: 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21. Will very old people who survive Armageddon share in filling the earth? (Page 46, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. There is no reason why they could not, because God’s Word states he can cause an old man to return to the days of his youth. (Job 33:25) Shem, one of Noah’s sons, was 100 years old when he begat his first son (Genesis 11:10); note also Abraham and Sarah. —Genesis 21:1-7; Romans 4: 19-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. Since there were no children taken into the ark, does that mean no young children will survive Armageddon? (Page 46, fl 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Not necessarily. The fact that no children were born to Noah’s sons until after the flood shows that the divine mandate will not begin to be performed until after Armageddon, That faithful children will survive Armageddon is indicated in 2 Chronicles 20:13,15,17 ; Psalm 8:1,2; Proverbs 14:26, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A.R.V.,</span><span class="font3"> margin; Matthew 21:15,16; Ephesians 6 :1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23. What are the advantages of remaining single now ? (Page 47, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Those so doing will be better able to serve God and be spared much trouble.—Luke 14 : 16,17, 20; 1 Corinthians 7: 27, 32-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. Should children be sent to Sunday school for instruction? (Page 47, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. “Sunday schools” are not Scriptural. It is the duty of the parents to instruct the children.—Deuteronomy 4:9, 10; 6:2, 6, 7, 20, 21; Genesis 18:19; Joshua 8:34,35; Ephesians 6:1-4; 2 Timothy 1:5; 3:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 25. What scriptures prove the statements of page 48, fl 1 ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. That the wicked will be destroyed from the earth is indicated in Psalms 9 : 17; 37:10; 68: 2; 104: 35; Proverbs 10: 30. That the righteous shall inherit the earth is shown by Isaiah 60: 21, 22. That the wicked will not be able after Armageddon to influence the children of the righteous is shown by Revelation 20:1-3. s, 330, 331.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 26. Does the absence of any fear of death under Jehovah’s kingdom mean there will be no accidents, sickness, storms or other calamities on earth at that time? (Page 50, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes. Accidents are the result of sin and imperfection. Calamities are caused by Satan,, or by Jehovah as a punishment.—Isaiah 11: 6-9; 65; 16, 21-25 ; 32:17, 18; Ezekiel 34: 25-29; Micah 4: 3,4; Revelation 21:4,5; 22: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. Who are the “princes of the earth” referred to on page 50, ]J 2?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The faithful servants of God that lived before Christ.—Isaiah 32:1; Hebrews 11:35; Psalm 45:16; Ezekiel 45: 8., 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 28. What is the meaning of the statement that “the glorious kingdom is here and in full sight” ? (Page 50, U 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jehovah’s people see by faith that God’s kingdom is now in operation, that God’s King, Christ Jesus, will soon destroy his enemies. (Psalms 110:2; 2:6) See answer to Question No. 13, page 27.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A. See s, 327, 328.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 30. Do not Jesus’ irords at Luke 20: 34-36 show that there will be no marrying in the righteous world? (Page 54)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. Jesus was speaking to the Sadducees concerning a woman who would be brought forth in the general resurrection, and his statement does not apply to the period of time when the Jonadab Armageddon survivors marry and bring forth children in carrying out the mandate. See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> Nov. 1, 1938, If 36-39.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. Why will those who will be resurrected not also have the privilege of marrying and bringing forth children? (Page 55, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. When the general resurrection (Revelation 20:5) takes place the filling of the earth will have been completed. The divine mandate will be carried out by righteous Armageddon survivors, who have proved their faithfulness to God. Those who come forth in the general resurrection will be imperfect, without integrity, and hence unrighteous, until they have proved their obedience.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A. No. The wicked whom Jesus referred to as “goats” go into “everlasting” punishment, which means lasting destruction or death.—Matthew 25: 46, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 34. Does not John 5: 28, 29 prove that even the wicked will be resurrected? (Page 56, top)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 35. What is one reason for the long lapse of time between the flood and the kingdom? (Page 57, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. So that God’s purpose to take out a “people for his name” and use them might be accomplished.—Acts 15:14. en, 136, ft 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 36. Why are the religionists called the chief agents of the Devil on earth? (Page 57, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they have defamed the name of God more than any other class of men. (Matthew 23:13,14; Revelation 17 : 5, 6) Their course of action identifies them as children of the Devil.—John 8:44; Matthew 7: 20-23; Romans 2 : 23, 24; 6: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 37. Why must the “strange work” be done in haste now? (Page 58, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because Armageddon is near, and when Armageddon begins it will be too late for one to take his stand on Jehovah’s side. The warning message must be given before God’s executioner takes action.— See Matthew 24:20.21; Habakkuk 2:1-3; Ezekiel 9:2-7; Zephaniah 2:1-3,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 38. What is the proof that Armageddon is near? (Page 58, top)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 40. How do we know that the faithful prophets “will soon be back”? (Page 58, ft 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In order to fill their appointed places under the kingdom as “princes in all the earth”, they must be resurrected at the end of the days of Satan’s uninterrupted rule. (Daniel 12:13; Revelation 18:20; Psalm 45:16; Isaiah 32: 1) They have a &quot;better” resurrection. —Hebrews 11: 35, 39,40.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q, 42. Why do Jehovah’s witnesses now rejoice at the increased opposition by the religionists? (Page 60, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They rejoice to suffer for the vindication of God’s name (Matthew 5: 10-12; 1 Peter 4:12-14; Acts 5: 40-42) ; and the desperate attempt to stop Jehovah’s work shows that Armageddon is near.—Psalms 2:1-9; 83:1-5,18; Isaiah 8:9,10; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3; Luke 21: 28-32.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A. Because it is an insult to God, man’s creator, to His Word, and also to man’s intelligence. (1 Timothy 6:20) It is only a theory. There is no proof to support it.—Genesis 1: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">26, 27;</span><span class="font3"> Revelation 4:11; Psalm 100: 3; Acts 17:38; Romans 1:18-25. r, 50-61.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. What is necessary as “equipment for light”? (Page </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3,</span><span class="font3"> fl 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. An honest desire to know the truth (Proverbs 2:3-7); the fear of the Lord (Proverbs 1:7); meekness (Psalm 25:9); an honest heart (Luke 8:15); obedience to God’s commandments (Proverbs 6: 20, 23); seeking righteousness.—Psalm 97: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 4. Why do the religionists not understand God’s Word? (Page 4, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they walk after their own selfish preferences (2 Peter 3: 3-5); they rely on human traditions and reasoning instead of the Word of God (Mark 7:13; 1 Corinthians 1: 19-22); like the scribes and Pharisees, they reject Christ Jesus, the King (John 12:3840,46); and they serve the Devil.—John 8:43,44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. What is God’s “capital organization” ? (P. 4, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is called Zion, and is composed of Christ Jesus, the head, and his faithful footstep followers, the 144,000 members of Christ’s body.—Philippians 2:9-11; Revelation 14: 1-3; Psalms 2:6; 48: 2. ch, 12, If 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. How do we know that a crisis is impending? (Page 5, IT 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By the physical facts on earth in fulfillment of prophecy. Every issue of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font3"> and of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Consolation</span><span class="font3"> furnishes additional proof.—Luke 21:25,26; Matthew 24:14-16,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. What proof have we that the destruction at Armageddon will be by Jehovah? (Page 5, jf 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Isaiah 13: 6-11; Ilabakkuk 3: 10-13; Ezekiel 7:9; Zephaniah 3:8; Psalms 83:9-18; 46:8; Revelation 16:14; Jeremiah 23:19,20; Zechariah 14:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. How do we know that the prophecies of Habakkuk and others, describing the battle of Armageddon, mean literal destruction, not symbolic? (Page 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A.. Jesus’ words at Matthew 24:21, 22 prove it. He compared Armageddon to the flood. (24:37-39) The flood was literal; also the destruction at Gibcon.—Isaiah 28:21; Joshua 10:10,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9. If Adam was created perfect, why was Satan able to turn him away from God? (Page 8, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By an appeal to selfishness, which Adam permitted to develop in his heart, (James 1:13-15) Adam was created with the ability to know right from wrong and to choose whatever course he pleased. (Genesis 2:16,17) God does not compel obedience from anyone, but states the consequences to those who disobey. (Deuteronomy 30:15-19; Proverbs 19:16) Even Lucifer, who was appointed as man’s invisible overlord, was allowed to choose his own course.—Ezekiel 28:13-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. How may one know &quot;the only true God, and Jesus Christ”? (Page 10, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Through diligent study of God’s Word and by faithfully keeping His commandments.—1 John 2: 3-6; John 5:39; 8:31,32; 7:17; Matthew 4:4; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Timothy 3: 16; 2:15. ch, 136,137.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 11. Why has religion ensnared so many? (P. 11, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because Satan has made it appear attractive, and because God has not interfered with this test upon men. See en, 200, fl 2. Satan has thereby deceived the whole world.—Revelation 12:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 12, What is the meaning of the terms &quot;scribes” and &quot;Pharisees”? (Page 13, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. &quot;Scribes” means religious clerks. &quot;Pharisees” means &quot;separated ones” (who thought themselves more holy than others) and applied to a &quot;sect”, some of whom occupied positions similar to religious leaders of our day. They were looked up to as teachers. — Matthew 23: 2, 3; Acts 15:5; 26: 5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. Why did Jesus refer to the clergy as sons of the Devil (John 8:43,44)? (Page 14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they yielded to the influence of the Devil, taught lies, disobeyed God’s commandments, opposed the truth, and persecuted and killed the true servants of God.—John 8:37-47. en, 112-114.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. What does it mean to ‘worship God in spirit and in truth’? (Page 14, IT 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It means to render one’s full and complete devotion to the Most High, prompted by love, and to obey his commandments.—John 4:24; 14:15; 2 John 3-6. en, 139, fl 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 15, Why do Jehovah’s witnesses not accept the definition of religion and of Christianity given by standard dictionaries? (Page 14, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because the dictionary definitions are not in harmony with the Word of God and its definitions, s, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 16. How did the Roman Catholic religion come to take the place of Christianity? (Page 15, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. God, through his prophets, foretold how such would take place. — Matthew 13: 24-30, 38, 39; Acts 20: 29, 30; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-7; Jeremiah 2:13,21; 2 Peter 2: 1-3. en, 152,153.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 17. If religion is not based on the Bible, why do not the learned scholars of our day expose religion? (Page 15, ¶ 2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because these men are trained in human philosophy and are ignorant of God’s purposes. (Luke 10 : 21; Isaiah 29: 10-14) Men not devoted to God are easily deceived by the Devil. (2 Corinthians 4: 4) God reveals the truth only to those who fear and obey him.—Proverbs 1:7; Psalm 25 :14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. Do the Catholic Hierarchy’s wealth and worldly power have the approval of the Lord? (Page 16)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. See Jeremiah 5:26-31; Psalm 37:35,36; Matthew 6:19-21; 8:20; 1 Timothy 6:6-11; James 4:4; 5:1-6; Luke 16: 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. How have we “now come to the end of the world”? (Page 17, top)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">of Bible prophecy on the end of the world? (P. 17, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. The prophecies concerning the rebuilding of Jerusalem had a miniature fulfillment 536 B.C. and thereafter, but the complete fulfillment now applies to those who are spiritual Israelites and to God’s organization.—Romans 2: 28, 29; Galatians 3:29; 4: 26; Romans 9:6-8; Revelation 2:9; 3:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21. If Jehovah’s witnesses hold no malice toward Catholics or Protestants, why do they publish so much that is against their religion? (Page 18, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In order that the honest people, both Catholics and Protestants, may see that religion is a racket, turn away from it, and serve the only true God. ch, 79, fl 1; 80.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. What are some of the scriptures proving that those who continue practicing religion after hearing the warning shall die at Armageddon? (Page 19, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Ezekiel 3:17-21; 33:2-9; Jeremiah 21:8-10; 38: 2, 3, 17, 18, 21-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23, What is meant by planting the heavens and laying the foundations of the earth (Isaiah 51:16) ? (Page 20, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. This means for God to (1) set in positions of authority the invisible spirit rulers of Jehovah’s theocratic government over (2) the new earth, to wit, humankind organized on earth in obedience to and in harmony with the will of God. His truth now preached by his witnesses is making ready the people of good will for the new earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. In democratic countries the Hierarchy denies endorsing totalitarianism. Explain. (Page 23, ¶)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. This is a smoke-screen to cover up their work, particularly to mislead those of democratic countries. The Hierarchy has never done anything to support democracy. The Hierarchy is itself a totalitarian organization. It teaches that the people should be obedient and subject to political rulers as the “higher powers&quot; representing God and Christ. To keep the people in the dark in regard to its purpose, it does not hesitate to tell lies. ■—Isaiah 28:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 26. What is one reason that the religionists place the State above God, and what will be the result? (Page 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They hope to entrap Jehovah’s witnesses. (Daniel 6:4-13; Psalm 94:20) However, they will be caught in their own trap.—Esther 7:9,10; Psalm 7:15,16; 9:15,16; Revelation 17: 16,17. pr, 139, fl 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. Is it strange that the servants of God are persecuted by religionists? (Page 25)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Not to those who are familiar with the Bible. See 1 Peter 4:12,13; John 8: 37; 16:1-4; Matthew 5:1012; John 15:18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 28. What will cause the radical elements to turn on their religious allies and destroy them? (Page 26, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The Fascists and Nazis will discern that their religious allies are hypocritical racketeers, that they are not sincere in putting the state above their religion, and that they are double-crossers and have great material wealth worth grabbing.—Revelation 17:16,17; 2 Chronicles 20: 22-25; Ezekiel 23 : 22-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 29. How can one keep himself &quot;unspotted from the world”? (Page 27, top)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 30. Though it is stated Jehovah’s witnesses have no controversy with any man or organization, do they not fight against the Roman Catholic organization? (Page 27, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No, they merely serve notice of God’s announced purpose to destroy religion and religionists; they expose the racket of the religionists in order that those of good will and honest heart may forsake religion and serve God and Christ the King; and their message is a message of warning. They have no personal quarrel with anyone and do not expect by their work to overthrow the wicked. That is the work to be done by God’s Executioner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. Who are the real friends of the people? (Page 27, ¶ 1)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 1. Why are these days of great peril ? (Page 33, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because these are the last days of Satan’s rule of violence. (Revelation 12:12; 2 Timothy 3:1) Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus, has begun his reign in the midst of his enemies. (Psalms 110; 2; 2: 1-6) The Devil, in opposition, has brought forth a violent monster, the totalitarian form of government, to champion his cause in the earth and to oppose God’s kingdom. The Devil is gathering his forces for the battle of Armageddon. (Revelation 16:13,14,16) Jehovah has a controversy with the nations, and for one to choose the wrong side in that controversy means his destruction,—Hosea 4:1; Jeremiah 25:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 2. If God foreknew a monster would arise, why did he not take steps to prevent its appearance ? (Page 33, K 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Pot the same reason that he allowed Satan to remain, namely, to demonstrate his supremacy and magnify Ids name, (Exodus 9:16) Another reason is to let all creatures be put to a test. God does not coerce anyone, but allows each one to choose his own course. (Deuteronomy 30: 19; Joshua 24: 15 ; 1 Kings 18: 21) Those who yield to the monster because of fear will die.—Revelation 13:1, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. What is the purpose of divine prophecy? (Page 33, If 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. (1) The vindication of Jehovah’s name. By the fulfillment of prophecy we know that God’s word is true.—Isaiah 42:9; 46:9,10; 48:3-5; John 14:29. p, 24, 25, 63.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 4. Since the Devil was the originator of violence, why did not God destroy him long ago? (Page 34, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. God has given him full opportunity to use his most powerful means to keep the people in fear and to try to turn them away from God and into destruction in order to prove his boast, and thus settle the issue of God’s supremacy.—Job 1:1-22; Ezekiel 28:13-19; Exodus 9 :16, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser;</span><span class="font3"> Romans 9; 17, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott</span><span class="font3"> footnote, also verses 22 and 23. en, 85, fl 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. Does the ‘rain of fire and brimstone’ upon those who love violence (Psalm 11:6) refer to hell? (Page 35, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No. The Bible word “hell” means the grave. See c, 256, fl 3. Fire and brimstone are destructive, and symbolize destruction. Those upon whom God ‘rains fire and brimstone’ shall perish for ever.—Isaiah 66 : 15,16; Revelation 20: 13, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. The lecture states that religion was used by the Devil to draw the Israelites away from righteousness-; but is not religion the worship of God? (Page 38, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; religion is based on tradition instead of the word of God. which it makes void. It is a substitute for obedience to God. (Matthew 15:1-9) At James 1: 26, 27 the word “religion” wrongfully appears and mistranslates the word meaning “worship” or “form of worship”. See Murdock’s Syriac translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. Is not the distinction between clergy and laity Scriptural? (Page 38, top)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. What is God’s righteous nation? (Page 38, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Every nation (that is, people united under a government of their own) of the world is unrighteous. God’s righteous nation is the kingdom or government promised, with Christ Jesus as the head or ruler. (Isaiah 9: 6, 7; Matthew 21: 43) Associated with Christ Jesus are his 144,000 footstep followers, (Revelation 14: 1, 3) That nation was foreshadowed by the nation of Israel. —Exodus 19 : </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">5-7 •</span><span class="font3"> 1 Peter 2 : 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9, Why has God permitted his servants to suffer violence? (Pages 39-42)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. Why is there so much said in these talks about the vindication of Jehovah’s name? (Page 39, fl2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it is the primary purpose of Jehovah, and stands out in his Word. In the prophecy of Ezekiel it is stated more than sixty times, “They shall know that </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font3"> am Jehovah.” All other things are secondary, or incidental, to the vindication of Jehovah’s name.—Matthew 6: 9,10. jh, 27, fl 2-29.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. How do we know that the nation of Israel unfaithful foreshadowed “Christendom”? (Page 45, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Israel was Jehovah’s covenant people and bore his name. (Deuteronomy 14:2) “Christendom” claims to worship God, takes his name, and by reason thereof is in an implied covenant with him. Both Israel and “Christendom” started out to keep the commandments of the Lord, but both failed to do so. (Jeremiah 2:21) The worship of both is hypocritical. (Isaiah 29:13) The leaders of Israel, the scribes and Pharisees, based their teachings on tradition instead of the Word of God. (Matthew 15:1-9) The same is time of the clergy of “Christendom<sup>5</sup>*. “Christendom,” like Israel, has become a place of murderers and thieves (Isaiah 1: 21-23), and has illicit relationship with the Devil’s organization,—■ Jeremiah 3:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. What is meant by the “Devil religion”? (Page 45, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. All religion is of the Devil. The nations round about Jerusalem practiced the Devil religion, by the worship of false gods who represented the Devil. From time to time the Israelites forsook the worship of Jehovah and worshiped these other gods.—Numbers 25:1-5; Psalm 106: 35-39 ; John 8: 39-44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 15. Where is the coming of the great “monstrosity” foretold? (Page 45, ¶ 2)</span></p>

By declaring that the “state” is supreme, by denying the individual the right to serve God as his conscience dictates, and as God has commanded; by violently persecuting those who proclaim God’s name and purposes; by decreeing that all people shall “heil” some man or men or salute a flag, contrary to God’s commandment.—Exodus 20:3-5; Psalm 94:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. What is the issue that must now be settled? and how does it involve every creature? (Page 46, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The issue is, “'Who is supreme, Jehovah or the Devil?” Every creature must choose one side or the other. Only those who choose, serve and obey Jehovah, even though threatened by Satan’s monstrosity, will live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. Do not Romans 13:1 and Luke 20: 25 show that a Christian should obey all laws made by the visible ruling powers? (Page 47, ¶)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. See ch, 219-222; s, 257-267.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 20. Why is it wrong for professed Christians to attempt to rule the world? (Page 47, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because this world is Satan’s organization (Matthew 4:8,9; 2 Corinthians 4:4) and Jesus’ followers are instructed to be separate from the world. — John 15:18,19; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17; 5:4; John 18: 36,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21. Has the Papacy really acquiesced in the claim that the state is supreme? (Page 49, middle)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Not openly, but the facts show that it has. It has made agreements with the Nazi and Fascist governments, and co-operates with these powers in persecuting the true followers of Christ, Jehovah’s witnesses. It makes no attempt to uphold the name of Jehovah as superior to the state, and does not forbid the “Catholic population” to “heil” dictators or co-operate in totalitarian schemes which are contrary to God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. Why is the totalitarian rule referred to as a monster? (Page 50, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because, like a monster, it is an abominable thing (Daniel 11:31; 12:11); it is extremely wicked, horrible, deadly and destructive. The totalitarian rule, like the giant Goliath, defies God, is arrogant, boastful, and threatening. (1 Samuel 17: 4-11) It controls the people through fear and bluff. It destroys the liberties and rights of men and leads into destruction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23. What is wrong with saluting a flag? (P. 50, ¶)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is a religious formalism in direct violation of God’s law.—Exodus 20: 3-5; Daniel 3: 4-18. s, 258-263.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. Where can one find refuge from this monstrosity ? (Page 52, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In Jehovah’s organization, which is symbolically represented by “mountains” in the Bible. — Matthew</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">24:15,16; Psalms 121:1; 2:6; 3:4; 15:1; Daniel 2:35; Psalm 72: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 25. The Catholic Church denies that it is in polities. What is the proof to the contrary? (Page 52, ¶ 2)</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 26. Why did David meet the giant armed only with sling and stones? and what is the present significance? (Page 55, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. David trusted in Jehovah rather than physical weapons of combat, to vindicate Jehovah’s name. The one deadly stone pictures the truth concerning Christ, Jehovah’s anointed King. (Daniel 2: 34, 35, 44,45; Matthew 21: 42-44) Jehovah’s witnesses are the fellows of this “stone” (Psalm 45: 7) and are used as his mouthpieces to announce the impending destruction of the monstrosity.—1 Peter 2: 4, 9; 2 Corinthians 10: 3-6. s, 118, fl 2-120.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. How have the religionists “gone too far to ever back up”? (Page 57, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they have allied themselves with God’s opponents, the totalitarian powers, and have rejected Christ as God’s anointed King or “the head stone of the corner”.—Psalm 118: 22; Matthew 21; 42-44; Acts 4:10,11; 1 Peter 2:6-8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A. The “little flock” (Luke 12: 32), the faithful footstep followers of Jesus who will be associated with him in his kingdom.—Luke 22 : 29, 30; 1 Peter 2:9; Colos-sians 1:13; Revelation 20: 6; Daniel 7:13,14, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 29. How will the question of supremacy be settled? (Page 58, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Christ Jesus, leading his invisible army, will destroy Satan and all of his organization, including the monstrosity.—Revelation 19:11-21; 20:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 30. How does the monstrosity ‘frame mischief by law<sup>5</sup> (Psalm 94: 20) ? (Page 59, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By making laws to entrap Jehovah’s witnesses, such as flag salute laws, laws designed to prevent them from carrying the Kingdom message from house to house</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">; etc.</span><span class="font3"> An example of this is set out in Daniel 6: 4-13; also Daniel 3. en, 280, U 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. What scriptures make it certain that religionists will perish first at the battle of Armageddon? (Page 60, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Revelation 17:16,17; 18:15-19; Ezekiel 27:32; Jeremiah 25: 29, 34-36; Ezekiel 9: 5, 6. en, 220, 221.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 32. Why will God first destroy the religionists? (Page 60, 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because these, by taking the name of God and Christ, have brought the greatest reproach on his name. They are the chief among the hypocrites, and are opposers of God’s kingdom under Christ. By their false teachings they lead men into destruction. Because they pose as spiritual leaders, and have had access to God’s Word, they bear the greatest responsibility. See Matthew 23: 8, 9, 29-35.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 1. Does the fact that Jehovah holds in his hand the destiny of all creatures mean they are predestinated? (Page 3, ¶)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. ho. Each individual is responsible for his own course. If he obeys God’s laws he shall live, but if he disobeys he shall die. (Ezekiel 18:20-22) Jehovah allows each one to choose his own course. (Deuteronomy 30:19) However, no one can get life except through the provision Jehovah has made; those refusing his provision will die. Therefore he holds in his hand the destiny of all creatures. (Job 12:10) “Predestination” as used in Romans 8: 30, Ephesians 1: 5, and similar texts, refers to a class and their qualifications, and not to individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 2. Why does the proclamation of the truth produce a controversy? (Page 4, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because it exposes the liars and wicked, who desire to have their own way. (Acts 6:9; 19: 8, 9) The speaking of the truth offended the scribes and Pharisees in Jesus’ day. (John 8: 40; 10:19, 20) One who is selfish and proud cannot hear the truth and acknowledge his error.—Proverbs 13: 10; John 3: 19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 3. How could a heathen king like Nebuchadnezzar foreshadow Christ Jesus? (Page 5, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Not the individual, but the work he performs, is important. Jehovah carried his judgments upon Israel into execution through Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly his judgments upon “Christendom” are carried out through Christ Jesus. — Psalm 110:1,5,6; Revelation 19:11. v-2, 57-59.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 4. Why were the Israelites the “chosen nation” of Jehovah? (Page 6, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They were beloved for their faithful forefathers’ sakes (Exodus 19:5,6; Deuteronomy 7:6-8; Romans 54</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">11: 28), and, when unfaithful, were used to foreshadow “Christendom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 5. What is meant by the statement that Israel was a “typical people”? (Page. 7, If 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It means that their recorded experiences, as well as their tabernacle and its. service, were representations, pictures, shadows, figures, patterns, or types, of greater things to come.—1 Corinthians 10:11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin;</span><span class="font3"> Hebrews 10:1; Colossians 3:16,17. s, 63, 64.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 6. When did Satan declare he could turn all men away from God? (Page 8, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By his course of action in turning Adam and Eve away from God, in Eden, and by his express boast with reference to Job.—Genesis 3:1; Job 1:6-12; 2:1-5; Isaiah 14:13,14. ch, 161-166; en, 88-91.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 7. When did Satan begin to introduce religion? (Page 8, middle)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In Eden, when he substituted his own doctrinal lies for God’s commandments, thus making the word of God void.—Genesis 3:1-5. en, 200,201.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 8. Is it proper to refer to the so-called “Christian religion” as a racket? (Page 9, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes; just as it was proper for Jesus to show that the typical temple at Jerusalem had been made a house of merchandise and den of thieves and robbers.—Mark 11:17; Luke 19:46; John 3:16; 2 Peter 3:3; Matthew 23:14. en, 190-192, 173-175.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 9. Will not the fact that &quot;Christendom” bears Christ’s name save it? (Page 11, fl 3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; just as Israel’s identification with Jehovah’s name and temple did not save them when disobedient to his commandments.'—Jeremiah 7:4,11-14; Amos 3:2; Matthew 7 : 31; Ezekiel 18 : 24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 10. How have the religionists and their allies broken God’s everlasting covenant (Isaiah 24:5)? (Page 12, Ifl)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By waging cruel wars and wantonly slaying animals for sport and selfish gain.—Genesis 9: 3-6,16. s, 281, fl 2-289.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 11. Why is Satan bent, upon the destruction of mankind? (Page 14, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A, His object is to rule or ruin, to show his supremacy or greatness. He now knows his time is short, and recklessly stakes all on a final effort to thwart God.— Revelation 13:13; Isaiah 14:12-14. en, 311,313.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. Will God destroy all those that remain in religious organizations? (Pages 14, (fl; 15, J[l)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes ; but not until fair warning is given and the people of good will who are sighing and crying for the abominations in the land (Ezekiel 9:4-7) may flee to God’s organization for safety.—Matthew 24:15-21; Revelation 18:4; Isaiah 52:11,12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Q. 13. To what do religious leaders now refer the people for protection and salvation? (Page 16, (fl)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They put forward human organizations and schemes and “more religion”. But such will completely fail.—Colossians 3:8; Psalms 146 : 3; 49: 6, 7; Isaiah 29:13,14; 1 Corinthians 3:18-21; Isaiah 8:9-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 14. What is the meaning of the prophet’s statement concerning the religionists, “They overpass the deeds of wickedness”? (Jeremiah 5 : 28, A.R.7.) (Page 17, middle)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. This means that religionists excuse or connive at wickedness, ignoring it in silence and not exposing it. They are ultra-lawless and the most reprehensible of all wicked men, because they have God’s Word and ignore or pervert it. — Luke 12:47,48; Isaiah 5:30; Matthew 23:14,33; Psalm 50:16-19. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 15. If any religionists now amend their ways will they find favor with God? (Page 18, &nbsp;1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Yes; as the apostle Paul did (Galatians 1:13-16), so others may. (Ezekiel 18: 30-32; Joel 2:13,14; Jonah 3:8-10; Ezekiel 33:14-16; Acts 3:19) However, the Scriptures indicate that very few will amend their ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 16. Why do Jehovah’s witnesses refuse to obtain a license to go from house to house to preach the gospel? (Page 19, 1(2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. For the same reason that Jesus did not ask for a license to preach, (en, 322, ¶ 1) It would be an insult to the Lord to ask any man for a permit to do what the Most High has commanded shall be done. The authority to grant a license to preach the gospel would imply the authority to withhold the right to preach the gospel, and this we could not concede to any civil authority. (Acts 5 : 28, 29; 4:18-20; 1 Corinthians 9:16) Furthermore, those of Satan’s organization are not qualified to act as judge or censor of one who is delivering a message of the Lord.—Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 17. How does God gather the nations for the outpouring of his wrath? (Page 20, ¶ 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. By the proclamation of the truth &quot;unto all nations”, which incites the nations to open opposition to Jehovah’s witnesses, thus identifying themselves as enemies of Jehovah and as worthy of destruction.—Zechariah 12:2,3,9; 14:2,3; Joel 3:2,9-16; Revelation 16:14,16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 18. Is it sufficient to have a desire for righteousness? (Page 21, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; one must take a positive stand for God and His kingdom and against Satan and his organization. —Revelation 22:17; 7:15; Isaiah 43:10; James 1:22; 2:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 19. In what significant respects did Nebuchadnezzar represent Christ Jesus, Jehovah’s King? (Page 22, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. In that he was a king of kings and was God’s executioner toward hypocritical religionists. (Daniel 2: 37; Revelation 17:14; Jeremiah 25:9; 27:6) Even his name is descriptive of that which Christ Jesus is and does, vs 2, 128, ft 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 20. Will &quot;Christendom” heed the warning now being .given? (Pages 23, ft 2; 24, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. No; they prefer to believe their smooth preachers or prophets. The religious Jews of Jeremiah’s day did the same. — Jeremiah 23:21-32; Matthew 15:13,14; 2 Timothy 4:2-4; Jeremiah 27:9-11,14-18; Isaiah 30 : 9,10 ; Ezekiel 3 : 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 21. What prophets besides Jeremiah show that ‘'Christendom” must drink the cup of God’s fury? (Page 25, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. David (Psalms 11:6; 75:8); Isaiah (51:17; 22:23); Lamentations of Jeremiah 4:21; Ezekiel (23:32-34); Habakkuk (2:16); John (Revelation 14:9,10; 16:19); and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 22. What are the contents of the cup that &quot;Christendom” must drink? (Page 25, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. They are (1) the declaration of God’s judgments against her (Jeremiah 1:16; Isaiah 61:2; Psalm 149 : 6, 9; Isaiah 28: 17-20) ; and (2) the execution of those judgments against her.-Ezekiel 5: 8,10,15; 11: 911; 23: 24, 31-34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 23. Why will the slain at Armageddon not be buried? (Page 25, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they have wantonly slain the beasts and fowls in violation of God’s everlasting covenant (Genesis 9: 3-5) and will be left for these latter to feed upon in retributive justice for the wrongs done.—Jeremiah 15:1-3; 16:4; Ezekiel 33:27; Isaiah 14:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 24. What is the controversy Jehovah has with the nations? (Page 25, bottom)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. It is over his name and his supremacy, because they have defamed the name of Jehovah and disregarded his commandments. (Isaiah 24:5,6; 48:11; 37:23) They have also persecuted his people and opposed his Theocracy and his King.—Joel 3: 1-7; Zechariah 2:8; Luke 18:7,8; Psalm 2:1-6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 25. What is meant by the statement that in 1918 the Lord Jesus began his judgment at the temple of Jehovah? (Page 26, fl2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. The temple is his true church, the royal house of God. (Acts 7: 48; 17: 24; 1 Corinthians 3:16,17; 2 Corinthians 6:16; Ephesians 2: 21, 22; Revelation 3:12) As the Bible and historic facts show, in 1918 his judgment began with his followers and proceeded to the judgment of the nations.—1 Peter 4:17,18; Matthew 25 : 14-46; Malachi 3:1; Revelation 11: 18,19 ; Psalm 11: 4, en, 317-321.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A. See ch, 353, 353.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 27. Why does Jehovah say &quot;it </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">may</span><span class="font3"> be ye shall be hid” (Zephaniah 2:3)? (Page 27, fl 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because, after forsaking the Devil’s organization and taking refuge in God’s organization, one must continue to obey God’s commandments and prove his love and devotion to Jehovah. If he fails to do this, he will not be hid. s, 26-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 28. Why is obedience necessary in gaining protection at Armageddon? (Page 28, fll)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because Jehovah has promised protection only to those who are obedient.-Zephaniah 2:3; Isaiah 1:19,20; Job 36: 11,12; Exodus 19: 5; Jeremiah 7: 23; 1 Peter 4:17,18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 29. Why do religionists violently oppose Jehovah’s witnesses? (Page 29, top)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they hate the testimony of truth proclaimed by Jehovah’s witnesses, and because they are led on by the Devil.—John 8:40,44; 7:7; 3:19,20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 30. How can God’s servants fearlessly deliver a message so unpopular? (Page 29, fll)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Because they love and trust Jehovah, who is backing them up.—1 John 4:17,18; Isaiah 12:2; Jeremiah 1:17-19; Joshua 1: 9; 2 Timothy 1: 7; 1 Peter 3:14; Hebrews 13:6; Matthew 10: 2 6-28; Isaiah 44:8; 2 Chronicles 20:15; Acts 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 31. What defense should Jehovah’s witnesses make when falsely accused of being “unpatriotic” ? (P. 30, ¶ 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Jeremiah was similarly accused by the religionists (Jeremiah 26: 8-15), but, on presenting his case, proved that the charge was false. A real patriot looks out for the interests of his fellow countrymen, and Jehovah’s witnesses are delivering a message that is in the highest interest of the people, showing them the only place of safety. Those who squawk the most about being “patriots” are really traitors to the people, Further, Jehovah’s witnesses obey God rather than men.—Acts 4:1620; 5:29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 32. Who now are able to see the hypocrisy and duplicity of the religious leaders? (Page 30, 2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Those of good will toward God and his kingdom, who love righteousness and hate iniquity. Those who love unrighteousness and “love to have it so” are blinded. —2 Thessalonians 2:10-12; Jeremiah 5:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 33. What is the meaning of the eojnmand to keep silence before God (Habakkuk 2: 20) ? (Page 31, (f 1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. Those who will receive Jehovah’s protection must now hear and give heed to what he has to say by his revealed Word and through his organization. (Job 40:15; Zechariah 2:13) When Jehovah rises up in battle, then all the clergy, the political windjammers like Hitler, the so-called “scientists” and other prognosticators will be compelled to shut up and let Jehovah give his testimony of supremacy.—Psalm 46:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Q. 34. Why do real Christians formally and publicly declare their devotion to God? (Page 32, 1f 1-3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A. For the vindication of Jehovah’s name, which has been defamed by Satan’s claim that he can turn all men away from God. Therefore it is necessary not only to believe, but to confess this belief and prove it by obedience.—Romans 10:10; Matthew 10:32, 33; Luke 9:26; Mark 8:38; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font3"> Timothy 2:12; Joshua 24:15.</span></p>
