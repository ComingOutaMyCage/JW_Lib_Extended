Now, however, all peoples are being divided before the Great Judge of all, and by your personal decision on this vital issue of Fascism and totalitarianism or freedom He will determine your ultimate destiny. Judge Rutherford dearly puts this before you in his gripping speech “FASCISM OR Freedom ' *, first delivered before a packed-out auditorium in New York and nt the same time radiocast over a chain of more than fifty stations, and now published herein.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12">B</span><span class="font7">EFORE all peoples there is today a great issue or question for final determination. Stated in brief, that issue is this: Shall the world be ruled in righteousness by Christ the enthroned King of Jehovah! or shall it be ruled by selfish, arbitrary dictators! To be sure, men cannot settle that issue; but soon the Lord will settle it, and every person must choose to take one side or the other and to receive the consequences. The issue involves life and death, and therefore the welfare of the people requires that they be told the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today I speak to the American people, who for more than a century have taken the lead as defenders of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of worship of Almighty God. All of these rights of men are now in grave jeopardy. The people need to hear and to give calm consideration to all the facts relating to the issue, and for that reason an assembly such as this is of great importance. Those who object to or oppose such assembly and a full discussion of the facts are the ones who advocate rule by cruel dictators, and their opposition is because of their desire to keep the people in ignorance until the people are deprived of all liberty and are under the complete control of dictators. The press and the radio are means of easy and quick communication of the facts to the people, but it is well known that, because of fear, many of these agencies are in the control of selfish interests and therefore refuse publication of the facts. This in itself increases the peril of the people. Certain radio stations, desiring to serve the public, are now broadcasting this speech, but before it ends there will be strenuous efforts to stop the broadcast and to deny the people the privilege of hearing. Such conduct is entirely un-American and very wrong. The American people are capable of hearing and considering the facts mid arc able to decide for themselves what they should do. I therefore earnestly urge upon the radio stations and all listeners to hear me through.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The totalitarian or dictatorial rule is fully supported by ambitious politicians, entrenched predatory wealth, and extremely selfish religious leaders, Totalitarian rule is the product of Satan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God’s kingdom is fully supported by all persons who love righteousness, and this is true without regard to race, color or previous faith. Jehovah.' witnesses, for whom I speak, are wholly devoted to Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and therefore give their unqualified support to God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Newspapers of the religious element falsely charge 'that Jehovah's witnesses arc engaged in a campaign of hate, but that charge is entirely without foundation in truth. Jehovah's witnesses are lovers of peai-v and righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">They do not hate men and are not fighting against men. As witnesses for the Lord their sole mission is to inform the people and aid them to see what is for their best interest. They do hate wickedness and wicked schemes which bring upon the people oppression and sorrow and which defame God's name. In this they follow exactly in the steps of Christ Jesus, whom Jehovah has made the rightful ruler of the whole world, and concerning whom it is written in God’s Word (Hebrews 1: 8,9; Psalm 45:7): &quot;A sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom; thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah's witnesses are true Christians, that is, followers of Christ Jesus, and God’s command to all such true Christians is that they must tell the truth, that the people of good will may learn the way to righteousness and life. (John 18:37) No human agency can rightfully interfere therewith. Those who object to the full publication of truth of God’s Word and the facts in support thereof thereby declare themselves against Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his King. Honest men will lay aside all prejudice and calmly consider the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The issue now before the people is not new, but the time has come when that issue must be finally settled, and God has announced it shall be settled once and for all. Totalitarian rule raised its blighting head and began to exercise</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">its destructive power live thousand years ago. Such rule' originated with Satan the Devil, the foe of God and of honest men. As Christians we must and do accept the Bible as God’s Word of truth given to man for his sure guide. (Psalm 119:105) Therein we find the truth recorded that the Devil used Nimrod as the first dictator. Nunrod set up religion contrary to God’s command; introduced traffic to control the products of men’s labor, and employed politics to rule the . jieople arbitrarily. From that time till now every dictatorial government has employed religion, and combined religion with commercial traffic and politics to arbitrarily rule the people and to turn them against Jehovah God and bis kingdom. Jehovah God organized the people of Israel into a nation for himself and gave to that people his covenant and his law for their guidance, that they might boa model nation. To them God gave the express command that they must hold themselves entirely aloof from religion and that they must obey God’s law. (Exodus 20:1-5) In time selfish men, as leaders of the Israelites, adopted a form of religion and employed it, together with commerce anti politics, to control the people and turn them away from God. The Pharisees and the doctors of the law became religious leaders, ruled the people arbitrarily, and persecuted every one of God’s true witnesses. (Matthew 23:33-35 ; 21:43) Jesus denounced religion and religionists, declaring the same to be instruments of the Devil. (Matthew 15:1-9; John 8:42-44) Then the Jews fell under the arbitrary dictatorial rule of Rome, and the religious clergy took the side of the dictator of Rome as against Jesus, the Son of Gori. When those religious clergymen were demanding the lifeblood of Jesus the Roman governor said to them (John 19:15): “Shall I crucify your King!” Those religionists in answer cried out: &quot;We have no king but Ctesar”; thus rejecting Jesus, whom God had sent to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The people of Israel were ruled by the iron hand of a Roman dictator, and Israel’s religious clergymen gave the allegiance to and supported the dictator, aliandoned God and his Word, and took away the freedom of the people. In the presence and hearing of those clergymen Jesus said to the people (John 8:31,32,36): “If ye continue in my word, ... ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free,” and, ‘if 1 make you free, then you shall be free indeed.’ Thus it is settled that true freedom comes by full obedience to Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Exactly a similar condition obtains today. Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful Ruler, has come again, and Jehovah has enthroned him. His rule has begun while the Devil still operates through his agencies on earth. (Psalm 110:2) In “Christendom&quot; the leaders have turned from God and have become entirely religious and are against God and his kingdom. In every country where dictatorial rule obtains religions leaders support the dictator, and dictators declare their violent opposition to Jehovah God and his King, Christ Jesus. Now the Lord has sent forth his witnesses to tell the truth of and concerning hi.-kingdom and of his purpose, to the end that the people may learn that their only means of freedom is by serving Christ the King of Jehovah. Therefore all dictators and their allies bitterly oppose those who serve God and who advertise his King and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THEOCRACY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan the Devil caused the downfall of man and brought sickness and death upon the human race. That was the beginning of religion. Then God gave his word of promise that in due time he would redeem man and would set up a righteous government for the rule of the world and that all men who would choose to serve him and his King should receive life everlasting and dwell for ever in peace. That government is a theocracy because everything thereof is done in harmony with the will of Jehovah. Psalm 19:7-9: ‘AU of his laws and ways are righteous and true.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In opposition to Jehovah God and in direct contrast to his righteous kingdom, the Devil brings forth an arbitrary, a dictatorial, totalitarian rule of the people, which is unrighteous and desperately wicked and which denies the people the right of peaceable assembly, freedom of worship, and freedom of speeech. The Devil is the mimic god, and his dictatorial rule in the earth is a mockery of Jehovah God and a blasphemy of God's holy name, and is set up for that purpose and to turn the people against God and his kingdom, and to plunge the whole race into everlasting destruction. All people that now willingly give their allegiance to the Devil’s totalitarian rule are certain to be destroyed at Armageddon, because God has so decreed. The only place of safety and. freedom and of life for the people is by turning to and giving their en tire allegiance to the kingdom under Christ.* Knowing this, the Devil desperately attempts to keep the people in ignorance of these vital truths, because it is only by knowing the truth that the people may learn the way to freedom and to life. The issue, therefore, is of life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">facts</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For the benefit of all persons who desire righteousness I now submit the indisputable facts. In doing so I ant not moved by hatred of any man, but am moved by loving obedience to Almighty God and by an unselfish desire to do good unto all men. Therefore 1 ask the radio managers of stations broadcasting this speech to permit the entire speech to be heard without interruption, because your life is involved and the life and liberty of each listener is involved. If it appears that the facts, when spoken, may shock the susceptibilities of some religious lead ers, ask yourselves this question: Which are more important, the feelings of a few selfish men or the liberties and lives of countless millions T The loss of liberty means ultimately the loss of everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ITALY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">What already obtains in continental Europe is moving stealthily and with rapidity against America, and for this reason 1 cite ns apt examples the European condition. Italy set up a Fascist government with Mussolini, an avowed atheist, as dictator, and he has excluded from that land every witness of Jehovah God and supporter of Christ's kingdom. Shortly after Mussolini became dictator he entered into an agreement with the pope, the leading religionist on earth, by which temporal power was granted to the Vatican, and Mussolini became a supporter of the Catholic organization and of Catholic Action; hence he is a religionist and against God and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Italian dictator prosecuted a cruel war of conquest against and destroyed the helpless people of Abyssinia, and that unwarranted action of the dictator the pope fully supported. Now Mussolini persecutes the Jews, who have made their homes in Italy, and in that wrongful act he is supported by the Hierarchy. For more than two years a bloody and unrighteous war has been prosecuted in Spain by rebels against the government, and that war of rebellion, which has brought cruel death to many innocents, both Mussolini and the pope have fully supported. Japan is now carrying on a wicked war against China, and in that war Jafian has the support of the pope and at his instance Japan has excluded or has denied Jehovah’s witnesses the privilege of bearing testimony to His kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Fascism. Nazism, and Communism all mean the same thing, because all are for totalitarian rule and all are against God and Christ his King and all persecute the faithful followers of the Lord Jesus Christ. This evidence is cited to show the deadly conflict between Fascism and freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GERMANY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In Germany the common people are peaceloving. The Devil has put his representative Hitler in control, a man who is of unsound mind, cruel, malicious and ruthless, and who acts in utter disregard of the liberties of the people. Together with his liackers, he rules with an iron hand. He cruelly persecutes the Jews because they were once Jehovah’s covenant people and bore the name of Jehovah, and because Christ Jesus was a Jew. Hitler has imprisoned thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses, the true followers of Christ Jesus, who have been guilty of nothing but advertising the kingdom of Christ. Many of those witnesses have been foully murdered while in Hitler prisons. Ln the persecution of Jews and of Christians, and in his arbitrary rule, Hitler has had the unqualified support of the Catholic Hierarchy. 1 here read’ into the record an article over the signature of a Catholic priest of Berlin, and which was published in the newspaper </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">The German</span><span class="font7"> on May 29, 1938, which, amongst other things, says: “There is now one country on earth where the so-called . . . Bible Students [Jehovah’s witnesses] are forbidden. That is Germany! . . . The Catholic Church in Bruning’s time urged to have [that sect suppressed]. . . . When Adolph Hitler came to power, and the German Catholic Episcopate repeated their request, Hitler said: ‘These so-called Earnest Bible Students [Jehovah’s witnesses] are troublemakers; . . . I consider them quacks; T do not tolerate that the German Catholics shall be besmirched in such a manner by this American Judge Rutherford; I dissolve [Jehovah's witnesses] in Germany; their property I dedicate to the people’s welfare; I will have sill their literature confiscated. [The priest adds,] Bravo! However, ip the American Episcopate, even Cardinal Mundelein is not able to have Rutherford’s books . . . taken away.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Hitler and the pope entered into a contract for mutual operations and have worked together in Germany. When the Nazis marched into and seized Austria and destroyed the freedom of the jMtople. there the Vatican betrayed the Austrians and fully supported Hitler in his ruthless act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Today Hitler and Mussolini, the arbitrary dictators, threaten the peace of the whole world, and they are fully supported in their destruction of freedom by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, which fact is shown by the Catholic press today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Communistic dictator arbitrarily rules Russia, and that country has put tip a wall against all witnesses for the kingdom of God. The Catholic press of America tries to induce the people to lielieve that the Vatican is against Communism. But the facts show that the Hierarchy is willing to make an arrangement with any dictatorial or totalitarian power that will permit the Vatican to act as a kind of superspiritual government and have the political element do its bidding. Note this, which appears in the New York </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font7"> July 26, 1938: ‘Mr. Forbes, executive secretary of the Communist party, proposed mutual co-operation between Communism and the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in state affairs. In answer thereto the pope, acting through his cardinal and authoritative representative (Verdier) at Paris, made reply to the Communist party in these words: &quot;If this gesture of the outstretched hand from your side expresses the wish to become better acquainted with your Catholic brothers in order to give better respect to the religion which inspires them to their convictions, their feelings, their works, then the church will not refuse to carry out this work of enlightenment and you will recognize that this can contribute greatly' to the happiness of all.” To such generous offer from the pope the Communist party responded in these words: &quot;The outstretched hand of the Communist party to the Catholic people remains outstretched.’” This further was supported by Communistic leaflets distributed in New York yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These are not lying statements, as the Catholic press of America generally declares concerning all statements 1 make, hut are plain truths which cannot be successfully contradicted. They are stated, not because of hate, but in order that the honest people. Catholics and non-Catholics. may see that the kingdom of God under Christ is violently opposed by the greatest religious institution on earth, which falsely and blasphemously claims to represent God and Christ, and which now works desperately against the Kingdom of God and against the interest of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AMERICA</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That it is the purpose of the religious organization named to destroy American freedom, I shall now prove, and in support thereof I quote from a letter of a Catholic priest, O’Hrien. of Syracuse, New York, published in </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">L’ Aurora,</span><span class="font7"> as follows: &quot;This land belongs to us by every right. Long enough have we compromised on every important question. Now wo demand what is really ours and we are going to have it; . . . peacefully, honestly, if we may; if necessary we • are ready to fight and die for it. . . . We want as cabinet members children of the holy mother church holding important positions in the entire structure of our government. . . . From now on the Protestant heresies will receive the treatment ascribed to the Protestant heretics . . . by our Canon laws. . . . We are ready prepared for 1940. . . . All . . . institutions . . . must be wiped out or placed under the protection of our Hierarchy ...” &quot;All loyal children of the [Catholic] church [are] to assist our worthy President with all [our] strength to see that the individuals comprising the United States Supremo Court shall obey the President's injunctions and if necessary we will change, amend or blot out the present Constitution so that the president may enforce . . • our humanitarian program on all phases of human rights as laid down by our saintly popes and the holy mother the church.” That traitorous statement has never been repudiated by the Hierarchy, and therefore has the Hierarchy’s approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">No one has ever tried to interfere with Catholics’ practicing their religion. The official Hierarchy has taken advantage of the liberty granted by the Constitution of the United States to use their religious organization as a political machine to gain control of the nation and to destroy the liberties of the people. Many honest and enlightened Catholics, seeing that the Vatican is bent on political conquest of America, have forsaken that religious organization and have taken their stand on the side of the Lord and righteousness. An ex-Jesuit priest of New-York, Doctor E. Boyd Barrett, recently published his book entitled “Rome Stoops to Conquer”, and from that book 1 quote the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Pope Pius XI . . . has given the best of his singular ability to the supervision and direction of the Catholic campaign in America. . . . [War is being waged in] the greatest struggle of the Church’s history. The conquest of America is the supreme objective at which he aims. . . . Pius is well aware that the Catholic ehurch can neVer hope again to dominate the civilized world until America kneels. beaten and penitent, at her feet. . . . Characteristic of [hisJ strategy in guiding American Catholics [in Catholic Action] ... he has taught them to enlarge and remodel the Catholic press. . . . Catholic Action partakes of politics, and is a political penetration, an infiltration into the political world of a new force and agency. . . . Cardinal Paeelli, on behalf of His Holiness, . . . urged on the Knights [of Columbus] to . . . rally . . . Catholic manhood as necessary for the ‘practical solution of those problems of social and civil life . . . In 1930 Alfred E. Smith announced his belief &quot;in the American doctrine of the absolute separation of Church and State”. “Pius XI . . . definitely repudiated (he ‘absolute separation’ heresy of . . . Smith and enlarged upon the desirability of ‘union and association’ between Church and State.” The pope said: “Governments can assist the church greatly in the execution of its important office if in laying down their ordinances the} take account of what is prescribed by divine and ecclesiastical law, and if penalties are fixed for offenders. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“A phase of present-day Catholic Action i.-the urging of Catholics to throw themselves into politics. . . . Catholic leaders ... do not advocate ... a separate Catholic party. . . . The church prefers to </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">control legislators</span><span class="font7"> rather than parties, and to avoid the odium and expense of running a distinct organization. But the church wants </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">plenty of high offices</span><span class="font7"> for her children. . . . The most sensational use of political power to force a Church issue was that of Archbishop Curley when he threatened the present administration, and President Roosevelt in particular. . . . When he took it upon himself to tell the President what he should do, and to threaten him with political extinction if he did otherwise, then Archbishop Curley was acting not merely as an ordinary politician but as a political dictator. ... It seems to lie the policy of the church here to maintain intimate relations with politicians, and with State employees. As regards the latter, the police are first in favor with the Church . . . and that having them in their thousands in her tow she can all the more easily command politicians. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">“Who can place a limit to the Catholic objective in this country? Re-open diplomatic relations with Rome? Though gratified by such a concession, why should. Catholics be content with that? Accord to them the right of exclusive censorship over books, plays, amusements and the Press. The church would accept such office without giving thanks for it, for she would regard it as her exclusive right to enjoy it. Amend the Constitution so as to allow State Legislatures to apportion public moneys to the support of Catholic schools and institutions. The Church would grudgingly admit that a long-delayed obligation was being met by the country. Go further, and amend the Constitution so as to recognize the jurisdiction of her Ecclesiastical Courts and </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">establish</span><span class="font7"> the Catholic Church as the oflicial Church of America. At this point the Church would begin to relax and smile with content. But still she would demand more and more of us. . . . She would not ask for any measures to be taken against Protestant denominations as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">long as they did not criticize her</span><span class="font7"> or cross her path or encourage Freemasonry . . . Protestant sects would be tolerated and treated in a kindly way </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">subject to what she would consider necessary and reasonable restrictions. . . . </span><span class="font7">Never was the Catholic Church i» </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">any country </span><span class="font7">in the world since Christendom began so rich, so highly organized, so influential, so loyally soldiered by her subjects as she is today in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That is plain language and strong proof that the Hierarchy in America is working hand in glove with the Fascists to grab control of the nation and to take away all the liberties of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">FURTHER ACTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">I now’ submit the proof showing the Hierarchy putting into practice what Doctor Barrett says they intend to do. On September 11 last I delivered an address at London, which was broadcast to many countries. More than 100 radio stations in America broadcast that speech “Face the Facts”. To prevent the people from hearing the facts Catholic Action flooded many radio stations with threatening letters, and some stations, because ofj fear, yielded to their demands. In many places in the United States, Christians rented public halls, installed wireless equipment, and there peaceably assembled to hear the speech and to worship God in spirit and in truth. Catholic Action tried to prevent such assemblies, and succeeded in a few instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Chicago, where most of the public officials are Catholic and dominated by a cardinal, the Navy Pier auditorium was leaseci for the convention of Jehovah’s witnesses, and everything was in readiness, when Cardinal Mundelein’s representative demanded the cancellation of the lease and the prevention of this Christian assembly. Public officials yielded to that demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Rochester, New York, Commissioner McFarlin rented to Jehovah’s witnesses the city hall for their convention. Two days before the convention opened the Catholic priest, John Randall, acting under command of the bishop, demanded that the city cancel the lease, shut out Jehovah’s witnesses, and prevent their peaceable assembly, and the cancellation was made, and for one day this hall was closed against that Christian body. Then on application Justice Voorhis issued an Order of Court requiring the hall to be opened, and it was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Ottawa, Canada, the Coliseum was engaged for this convention of Christians. Ten days later notice was served on Jehovah's witnesses by the Board of Control that the use of the Coliseum “is granted subject to there being no utterances made . . . against any church or religious denomination or those connected with churches or religious denominations’'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Little Rock, Arkansas, the city council, at the instance of the Catholic bishop Morris and his organization of Knights of Columbus, prevented the peaceable assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses in the public park for worship and to listen to the London lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At Colorado Springs the Catholic clergy and other politicians signed a petition, falsely charging “that Rutherford is against Christianity and all it stands for, and the American flag, and the ideals it stands for”, and thereby induced the radio station to cancel its broadcast contract and the press to publish the libelous statement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Many other radio stations in the chain were bullied and threatened. As to the effect thereof I quote a letter of a radio manager, which is a sample of many others, addressed to the Watch Tower agency: &quot;We regret to advise that due to the prevalence of Catholicism in this territory we must refrain from taking the broadcast.” Many radio stations were threatened by Catholic priests if they broadcast the lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At New Orleans the Coliseum arena was leased for the assembly in convention of these Christian people to worship God and to hear the London speech. At the instance of the Catholic Hierarchy the doors of the Arena were locked and the literature of Jehovah’s witnesses withheld from them and they were prevented from assembling. Another hall was then eu-gaged, and Catholic Action succeeded in having that hall closed to Jehovah’s witnesses. A third hall was taken, and while a local speaker was delivering a Bible lecture the audience was intimidated by a squad of police under the command of one McNamara. The fourth hall was rented, and a Catholic police squad stopped the installation of telephone wires in that building, and thus prevented the assembly of Jehovah’s witnesses there to receive the London speech. Then the Jockey Club, outside the city limits, was leased for the peaceable assembly and worship by these Christians. Under pressure from the Catholic Hierarchy the parish sheriff prevented the installation of the telephone wires and the use of that place of assembly. Tlujn, as a last resort, a private open-air lot was taken, and there on Sunday, September the 11th, a body of Christian people assembled peaceably and to worship God and to hear the London address. Electrical equipment had been installed. A squad of police, under command of McNamara was on the ground before the audience arrived. McNamara, under the direction of the Catholic Hierarchy, stepped forward and excitedly cried out to the audience assembled: ''Stand back”; and then, turning to his police squad, he gave this command: &quot;Men, when the lecture starts stop it, even if you have to break the electrical equipment; and the first man who interferes, shoot to kill.’'’ When the lecture began at London, McNamara himself cut the telephone wires, disabled the electrical equipment, and, while he was doing so, the police squad stood with their hands on their guns, and thus the people again were forcibly prevented to peaceably assemble, freely worship and exercise freedom of speech. Immediately following this highhanded and unlawful action the Catholic newspaper known as </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Action of the South,</span><span class="font7"> edited by the &quot;Right Reverend’’ Wynhoven, published the following: “It is indeed a source of deep gratification that notwithstanding the persistent efforts of the witnesses of Jehovah, their three-day convention in New Orleans was frustrated. . . . Practically even’ large hall in the city was denied them. . . . The chief of police’s office and the sheriff of Jefferson Parish unhesitatingly stepped in to stop effectively this insult to New Orleans/’ The Federal Court is preventing a repetition today of such unlawful acts, but Wynhoven won’t publish that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The proof is therefore conclusive that the Catholic Hierarchy was back of the unlawful action in breaking up a peaceable assembly of Christians gathered together for worship of Almighty God. This is further and conclusive proof that the Hierarchy is against God and against his kingdom under Christ and is working in league with Fascism to destroy the liberties of the people. The Hierarchy has bullied and bluffed and threatened and put fear into the public press and the owners of many radio stations, to prevent the people from hearing the truth. Honest, sincere Catholics do not endorse such highhanded and unlawful action, and they, seeing that the Hierarchy has turned the organization into a political machine and is robbing the people and using the money to destroy their liberties, these honest Catholics are forsaking the Hierarchy and turning themselves to God and to his kingdom. This action of honest Catholics greatly angers the Hierarchy. And their priests and press howl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Calmly now consider the length to which Fascist-Hierarchy rule has advanced in America: Catholic priests boldly declare that the government of the United States shall Im? seized in 1940; threaten to compel the United States Supreme Court to obey the demands of the Hierarchy; threaten to amend or destroy the Constitution as best suits the convenience of the Hierarchy; threaten Protestants with violence who dare oppose the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Hierarchy, as stated by Doctor Barrett, has been turned into a political machine which prefers to control legislators rather than have a separate party, and to have many important offices in the government; a Catholic bishop arrogantly threatens the president of the United States unless he conforms to the will of the Hierarchy. The public press and many radio stations are browbeaten into silence as against the Hierarchy’s crooked work; Protestant clergy have been induced to remain silent; the Jews are frightened into submission and silence; and now the only class of men on earth who have faith and courage to tell the truth are persecuted, imprisoned, threatened, their peaceable assemblies broken up, and their freedom of worship and freedom of speech denied! Docs it not appear that lil&gt;erties of the American people are about all gone!</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">When the people are told the facts about a crowd that is operating under a religious cloak to steal their rights, the Hierarchy howls and says: “Lies! Put a gag in the mouths of those who do not permit them to speak.’’ Honest Catholics and honest men of all faiths arc against such highhanded action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Is it wrong to publish the truth concerning a bunch of hijackers that are robbing the people! No! Then is it wrong to publish the truth concerning a religious organization, operating hypocritically and doing the same thing! Americans have heretofore been at liberty to express themselves freely on public matters. No sane man in America would desire to do the president any personal harm, but many sincere and honest Americans properly criticize the policy of the president, and the newspapers and the radio stations are not forbidden to publish such criticism. Is the Hierarchy so sacred that it has greater privileges than the president of the United States! What right has Rome to tell the Americans that they cannot publish the truth about the despoilers of the people! Shall honest men be gagged and compelled to remain silent while this bunch of hijackers destroy the liberties of the people! Above all, shall the people be denied their God-given privileges of peaceable assembly and freedom of worship of Almighty</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God. and freedom of speech concerning his kingdom and those who oppose it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a sect and are not religionists. They are Christians. They are made up of those who have come from Catholics. Protestants, Jews, and those outside of all religious organizations. They are men and women who love righteousness and truth and hate wickedness. They are not politicians. They are not kingdom builders, because God builds His kingdom. As John the Baptist was, so are Jehovah's witnesses, “a voice in the wilderness crying out” to the people and warning them that their only means of escape, safety and salvation is by placing themselves under Jehovah’s King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It is written in the Word of God: “The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.” (Proverbs 29:25) Protestants, Jews, many radio station owners and others, by reason of fear of the Boman Catholic Hierarchy, have been le&lt;i into the snare of Satan, gagged, and are bound hand and foot. Jehovah’s witnesses, and all others who love righteousness and who love God, now' serve notice on the Fascist-Hierarchy combine that they will not, because of fear, yield to that totalitarian rule and will not remain silent and refrain from testifying to God's kingdom. They believe and trust wholly in the Lord God, and him they will obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Since the appearing of that hideous monstrosity, the totalitarian rule, the liberties of the people have rapidly vanished, and everincreasing woes have come upon the nations. Among such woes and crimes are these, to wit: The rape of 'Abyssinia; the wanton slaughter of innocents in Spain; the cruel persecution of Jews and Christians in Germany and Haly: and now the unwarranted assault upon Czechoslovakia; and the malicious attempt to destroy the liberties of the people of Britain and America. When the storm of insanity and tribulation has passed, the true history of the world will be written under sane conditions. It will then fully appear that the men more reprehensible and therefore chiefly responsible for such crimes and woes are the men who compose the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, headed by the present pope, who inaugurated “Catholic Action”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The head of the Hierarchy appears to be an adept in getting in line with his political allies. Within an hour after the fate of Czechoslovakia had been fixed with the consent of the pope’s allies, and in order to magnify the importance of the religious element of the alliance, the pope calls upon the faithful Catholics to pray for peace. It did not seem to him advisable to pray for peace when Italy was murdering the Abys-sinians, when the rebel Franco and other Fascists were slaying and continuing to slay thousands of innocents in Spain, nor when his friend Hitler grabbed Austria and drove out defenseless Jews and Christians. Now he prays that Hitler may not be disturbed while stealing Czechoslovakia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For centuries it has been the desire of the head of the Catholic Hierarchy to rule the world as a spiritual overlord. That unsatisfied ambition has led the Vatican to stoop to the worst kind of politics to accomplish their wrongful and blasphemous purpose. When such conscienceless men, while carrying on their nefarious work, hypocritically claim to be the representatives of Jehovah God and Christ, they are guilty of the greatest blasphemy against God’s name that has ever been uttered under the sun. Honest Catholics will now give heed to God’s warning, flee from that religious makeshift, and find rest, liberty and life under Christ the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Christians fully realize that these are the last days and hence the time of great peril. In the Scriptures it is written (2 Timothy 3:1-5): “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, . . . traitors, . . . having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof; from such tiyn away.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">These words exactly describe tfie Hierarchy combine. If the men of the Hierarchy really loved God and his kingdom, they would not try to control the poetics of the world and to destroy the liberties of the people. By trying to rule the world the Hierarchy denies the power of God to set up his kingdom as he has promised. The fact that they do practice a form of religion, claiming to serve God and at the same time opposing his kingdom and joining with others to arbitrarily rule mankind, is proof conclusive that they are the enemies of man and of God; and the Lord admonishes the people to turn away from such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The fact that the Fascist Hierarchy claims the right to rule the world in the place of God’s King, Christ Jesus, is also proof that such combination constitutes the “abomination of desolation”, which God by his prophet named and foretold would arise in these days. (Daniel 11:31; 12:11) To the honest people the Lord says: “When ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, . . . then let them that be in Judiea flee to the mountains [that is, to the kingdom of God under Christ]?' “For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.”—.Mark 13:14; Matthew 24:15-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Seeing, then, that the liberties of the people are being taken away by that religious-Fascist combine, which stands where it ought not to stand, claiming the right to rule the nations of the world, then all who would live must take heed to this admonition of the Lord and flee to God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men cannot stop the onward march of the Hierarchy-Fascists now. It has gone too far! The Lord is permitting it to come to a climax to serve his own purposes. Now the only possible place of safety is under the protection of Christ’s kingdom, because God has declared his purpose to soon act and to completely destroy everything that opposes his kingdom. The Fascist Hierarchy presume that they shall now-gain and for ever control the world; and when they think that they have silenced completely the people that are for God’s kingdom, then, as it is written in the Scriptures, they will felicitate each other and say: “We are at peace and in safety.’’ Note, then, what the Lord's Word says about this, at 1 Thessalonians 5:3: “For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child ; and they shall not escape.” Such disaster will befall them nt Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In view of these facts and for the encouragement of the radio stations that do broadcast this speech in the public interest, I earnestly urge upon all listeners. Jehovah’s witnesses and all others who love liberty and righteousness, to immediately send letters to the radio station to which you are listening, expressing your hearty-approval of their broadcasting this speech. Let the radio stations know that there are yet many Americans who love the principles of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom of worship, which are guaranteeri by the American Constitution and commanded by the Most High God. Furthermore, I invite the radio stations that stand for American principles, and who are against Fascism, to advise me by wire or letter that they are willing to again broadcast the truth for the benefit of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Let the Fascist-Catholic Hierarchy know that this is the land of America, and not Rome; that they may freely practice their religion here amongst those who like it; but that they cannot use their religious institution as a political machine to turn over to the fanatical dictators the American government and take away all the liberties of the people. The Catholic press persist in lying al&gt;out me and saying that 1 am engaged in a campaign of hate. But, together with others of Jehovah's witnesses, we are fighting for the principles of righteousness which are loved by all honest people regardless of previous faith. What Jehovah God has commanded us to do, that we will do regardless of opposition. We are certain that the will of God is that a hypocritical, religious organization shall not destroy freedom of worship and freedom of speech.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Foreknowing this day of great crisis, when dictators would destroy peoples’ rights, Jesus addressed himself to cruel religious leaders of all time. His words, thereby announcing with the greatest force fixed principles of Jehovah, now apply to the Roman Catholic Hierarchy and to all otliers who use religion to further their selfish interests. He says to those religious leaders who are against God’s kingdom under Christ: ‘Woe unto you, Catholic clergy, hypocrites, for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for ye enter not in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. . . . Fill up ye then the measure of your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell T . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font11"><sup>1</sup> pon you shall come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth?—Matthew 23:13-35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Fanatical Fascists and Nazi dictators, with the aid and co-operation of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy at Vatican City, <sup>nre now</sup> wrecking continental Europe. They may for a brief period of time gain control of the British Empire and of America, and then, God declares, He will act and through Christ Jesus, his great Executive Officer and Executioner, will completely destroy all such organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Then the people who obey God and Christ shall survive and live for ever in peace and happiness and will fill the earth with a righteous people, all to the praise of Jehovah. Choose ye. therefore, whom ye will serve! Shall we have Faseistic Catholicism, slavery and death? </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">OU </span><span class="font11">shall we embrace Christ and his kingdom and receive true freedom and everlasting life? It is not within your power to stop the onward march of the wicked, but it is your privilege to flee to God and to his kingdom under Christ and thus find security, refuge and salvation; and let this warning be sounded now again in the language of God's prophet Jeremiah (21 : 8,9: 38: 2), that all who do not flee to and obey his King, Christ Jesus, shall suffer destruction at the battle of Armageddon, which is near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Consider now briefly what God's kingdom means for the people. When Satan defied God to put men on earth who would remain faithful and true, Jehovah said to the Devil: 'Instead of destroying you now, I will permit you to re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">main for a time, that I may have my name declared amongst all the nations, and then I will show you my power.’ (Exodus 9:16) God then declared his purpose that in his due time he would redeem man and send Christ Jesus to set up his kingdom. God’s purpose cannot fail! He has said: “I have purposed it, 1 will also do it.” (Isaiah 46:11) Jehovah proceeds according to his own sovereign will, lie sent Jesus to earth, who gave his life as a redemptive price for those human creatures who do prove their integrity toward Jehovah. Jesus instructed his followers that in God’s due time he would return and set up his kingdom of righteousness. Knowing that the kingdom is God’s means for the blessing of the people, Jesus taught his followers to pray to Jehovah this prayer: 'Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven.’ That means that God's will shall be done on earth in his due time, and his will is always righteous. Christians and religionists still utter this prayer, but only true Christians sincerely desire the fulfillment of the prayer. They rely solely upon God and his King and kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">It was in 1914 that Jehovah enthroned Christ as the invisible Ruler of the world. (Psalm 110: 2; Revelation 11: 17,18; Matthew 24: 3-14) Before destroying Satan, Jehovah, according to his Word, causes his name to be proclaimed throughout the earth in order that all persons of good will toward him may hear and learn Ilie truth and flee from religions organizations and find refuge and safety under the Lord’s king-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">&lt;lom. That testimony is now being given. Only the Devil could so violently oppose that testimony, and hence lie uses his religious repre-sentatives to oppose it and to persecute God's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">You people of good will have had all the sorrow you want to have. You desire to see righteousness rule in the earth, that you may dwell in peace with your children and your neighbors. You hate strife, war, and oppression. The Lord’s kingdom will bring to pass the desire of all honest hearts for peace and prosperity. You believe that the Bible is God's Word. Then hear what he says to you about his kingdom and his King. ‘‘Unto [you] a son [King] is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called Wonderful Counsellor, The mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace; of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end.” (Isaiah 9:6,7.) “And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (Isaiah 2:4) “Behold, a king .^iall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.”—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy have kept you in ignorance of these precious promises recorded in the Bible, because they want to rule and to exploit you. When one calls attention to God's warning against hypocrisy, deceit and oppression practiced in the religious systems and . to God’s good promises to the obedient ones of mankind, then the Hierarchy, having no reasonable or Scriptural answer thereto, howl these words: ‘Those things arc all lies. The people should not read the Bible, but hear only what the Catholic priests say? These religious leaders rob you of your money, your freedom of thought, and freedom of action, and greatly oppress you, and Christ alone can and will relieve you, as it is written: “He shall judge the poor of the people, . . . and shall break in pieces the oppressor/' (Psalm 72:4) Furthermore God says to the obe&lt;iient ones: “Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land. Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. Yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase/’—Psalm 85:9-12.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">We give thanks to Almighty God that he has brought to our attention his Word of truth. We love righteousness and choose to serve .Jehovah God and his King, Christ Jesus. In obedience to his commandment we do now forsake hypocritical, religious institutions, turn to God and Christ his King, and henceforth we will seek righteousness and meekness as God has commanded, that we may receive protection, peace and life everlasting, and that we may share in the vindication of God’s name. We recognize that God’s kingdom is a theocracy, which is holy, righteous and true, and we delight to put ourselves under the Lord and gladly obey his righteous rule.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font10" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Theocracy</span></h1>
<p><span class="font7">EARTH peace among men of good (J will.&quot; More than nineteen centuries ago a heavenly host brought that message to men. The occasion was the birth of Jesus, the Christ, the beginner of Christianity. Although this long period of time has elapsed, there is not yet peace on earth. Controversies and malice and strife are manifest amongst the peojde of every nation on earth. In all the controversies religion has a prominent part. While there are many religious organizations, the Roman Catholic religious organization, ruled by the Hierarchy, takes the lead. That organization conducts a bitter and malicious warfare against all persons who take positive issue with the Hierarchy. It is not a light of the ordinary Catholic people against the non-Catholics; hut the Hierarchy, in order to keep the people in subjection, bitterly makes war against all Christian people, and particularly against Jehovah’s witnesses, and in that controversy the Hierarchy is supported by the radical, political element of the world that favors the dictatorial government. Is that controversy because the Bible is confusing and not understandable! No, that is not the cause of the controversy. Then why do not all who believe the Bible get on together in peace 1 The correct answer to that question will serve to aid till persons of good will to get the proper understanding. The it answer given herein is the correct one, because it is the infallible proof taken from the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">There are two powers which are active, and which are unalterably opposed to each other: the one, which is supreme, enlightens the minds of men of good will; the other deceives men, blinds their minds to the truth, and causes them to pursue a wrongful course. The supreme, righteous One is the Almighty God, whose name is Jehovah. The opposing one or enemy of God is named Satan, the Devil. Jehovah is the God of peace. Satan is the. mighty one of strife. Mark this: that the message brought to the men by the heavenly host, as above stated, says, “On earth peace, among men of good-will.&quot; (Luke 2:14, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham</span><span class="font7"> translation) That means that only those who are of good will toward God can find and enjoy everlasting peace. The purpose of what is here written is to give a plain statement of the facts and the Scriptures in order to help persons of good will to learn the right way. What is here said is not tli&lt;*opinion of man, nor man’s interpretation of tile Scriptures. Jehovah’s Word is the authority, and He is his own interpreter. The Scriptures cannot be properly interpreted by any man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">God the Almighty is the Creator of heaven and earth, which together constitute the world, and the world belongs to Jehovah, as it is written : “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.” (Psalm 24:1) “The heavens are thine, the earth also is<sup>-</sup>thine; as for the world, and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.” (Psalm 89:11) God created the earth and created the perfect num to live forever on the earth. (Isaiah 45:12,18) God gave man the rule over the lower animal creation, and he made Lucifer, the heavenly creature, the overlord of man. (Genesis 1:26; Ezekiel 28:14‘; Isaiah 14:12-17) All creation then dwelt together in peace and praised the Almighty God. Lucifer coveted that praise, desiring it for himself (Jeremiah 51:13), and hence he rebelled against Jehovah. Many of the angels of heaven and the perfect man Adam joined in that rebellion. God changed the name of Lucifer, giving him four names, to wit: Dragon, Satan, Serpent, nnd Devil. Satan then challenged Jehovah God to put men on the earth who would remain true and faithful to God. The rebellious Satan was sentenced to death; but in order that all creation might in due time know that Jehovah is supreme and that his power is without limitation, nnd that Satan would have an opportunity to prove his challenge, God suspended the sentence of death and permitted Satan to continue to live for a specified period of time, at the end of which time God will execute Satan. Therefore God said to Satan : ‘‘But for this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.”—Exodus 9: 16, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jehovah God also gave his word of promise that in his due time he will set up a government</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">that will rule the people in righteousness, and in which there will be everlasting peace on earth, and that such government of righteousness will be administered by Christ Jesus. A long period of time elapsed between the date of God’s promise and the setting up of his government of righteousness, in which period of time Satan the Devil has full opportunity to make proof of his wicked challenge. If Satan should succeed in turning all men against God, that would prove that Satan is equal to Jehovah God. or even greater, and that Jehovah is not supreme. If Satan fails, that means his end in complete destruction. Satan is certain to fail. It is of vital importance to every person of good will to know the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The issue or question for final determination is therefore plain and clear, and that issue is, Who is supreme? The conflict of Satan against Jehovah God began; and mark how it progressed to this day, when there shall he a final showdown. Eve was deceived by the lie of Satan. and Adam voluntarily joined in the transgression and they were expelled from Eden. Adam and Eve then began to have children. Their son Abel devoted himself to Jehovah God. Satan induced his elder brother Cain to murder Abel, and hence Satan is not only the arch liar but a murderer. (John 8:44) Approximately 16(X) years passed. In that time of all the human creatures born on the earth only a few of them stood on the side of Jehovah God. At the end of that time Satan had turned almost all the human race against God and the earth was filled with wickedness and violence; and for that reason God declared his purpose to destroy all human creatures, which he did in the flood; only Noah and his family, eight persons in all, survived.—Genesis chapters 6,7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGION ORGANIZED</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Noah brought out of the ark numerous animals and fowls, all of which were free to roam the earth. These would soon multiply in great numbers and would endanger men; hence, for the protection of Noah and his descendants, God said to Noah: “And the fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.”—Genesis 9: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">More years passed, and Nimrod, the descendant of Ham, came into prominence. Satan evolved a scheme to defame God’s name, and to turn men away from God, and he used Nimrod for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">All human creatures are born to look up to and worship some recognized superior power. Nimrod became an object of adoration and worship by weaker men: “He [NimrodJ began to be a mighty one in the earth; he was a mighty hunter before [in defiance of] the Lord.” (Genesis 10:8,9) Being deceived, the people were induced to honor and worship Nimrod; and thus they were turned away from and against Jehovah. That was the beginning of organized religion. Nimrod was a wicked man, a cruel slayer of wild beasts, and also of men. By reason of his power and influence over men he organized Babylon, the first arbitrary, dictatorial or totalitarian government that ever existed, Ue was the Devil’s instrument in organizing religion against God and in organizing a political government against God, and in setting in operation commercial traffic. (Genesis 10:10,11) In his cruelty he chased and viciously slaughtered many wild beasts and fowls of the air, thus causing the beasts and the fowls to become vicious and fight against man. He trained young men to fight other men and thus engage in murder. From the time of Babylon until the present day Satan has combined religion, politics and commercial traffic, and by this means or combination he has controlled the people, deceived them, and turned them away from Almighty God and his provision to give man life in peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MONSTROSITY AGAINST THEOCRACY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The government of the world by the immediate direction or administration of Jehovah, the Almighty God, is a theocracy. Following the rebellion by Satan God gave his word of promise that in his due time the work! shall be ruled by a theocrat or theocratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Any rule or government set up in defiance of Almighty God or claiming to rule the world in the place and stead of Jehovah God is a monstrosity. God describes such in these words: “The abomination that maketh desolate.” (Daniel 11:31; 12:11) Such an abomination or monstrosity turns men against God and leads them into destruction. A monstrosity is ugly, extremely wicked, horrible, deadly and destructive of the rights and liberties of the people, and leads the people into destruction. The rule by Nimrod was a monstrosity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan’s monstrosity takes away all the liberties of the common people and makes them slaves to Satan’s chief representatives. The theocracy sets men completely free, enables them to pursue a course of righteousness in peace, and the people of good will in due time shall dwell under the theocratic government and be for ever at peace. Thus the two great ruling factors are contrasted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The world powers, to wit, Assyria, Egypt, Babylon, Medo-Persia, and ancient Rome, were each a monstrous government, or monstrosity. Those world powers were arbitrarily and cruelly ruled by the three elements of Satan, to wit, religion, politics and commerce, in defiance of Almighty God. From time to time God has given evidence of his supremacy in order that men might have an opportunity to observe the right way an&lt;l to walk therein'. To safeguard the Israelites from the Devil religion God selected the Israelites and gave to that people his law and his statutes for their true guide and protector until the coming of the Messiah, Christ Jesus, and his kingdom. (Galatians 3:19) God specifically commanded the Israelites to strictly obey his law, informing them that the practice of religion would ensnare them and result in their destruction. (Deuteronomy 7:16, 25; Exodus 20:1-4; Judges 2:1-3) All nations of the earth aside from Israel were called &quot;heathen&quot;; and all of such nations practiced religion in defiance of Almighty God, and this they did because of the influence of the Devil. That a clear distinction between religion and Christianity may be seen, the following definitions are given, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Kelitjion</span><span class="font7"> means any form of worship of some superior power or creature, and which form of worship or form of practice finds support or authority in the teachings or traditions of men. It is often claimed that the Bible supports religion ; but such is not true.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Christianity</span><span class="font7"> nieaus full obedience to the law and commandments of Almighty God as set forth in the Bible, and therefore the worship of God in spirit and in truth, disregarding all forms or formalism. Christ Jesus always obeys the law and commandments of Jehovah God; and therefore Christianity means the following the lead of Christ Jesus in obeying God’s law and commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Men have invented the phrase &quot;the Christian religion&quot;; but such phrase is entirely misleading, because religion and Christianity are exactly opposite one to the other. According to the Scriptures the so-called &quot;Christian religion&quot; is a form of godliness—which denies the power of God; and the admonition is to turn away from such. (2 Timothy 3:5) The leaders amongst the Israelites, or Jews, wore the scribes and Pharisees, corresponding to the clergy of the present time, and which leaders departed from the law and commandments of God and adopted tradition or the teachings of men; and thereby they became religionists, although they claimed to represent God. For that reason Jesus said to them: “Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites! Well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”—Matthew 15:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Good men have been deceived and in ignorance have practiced religion and still do so. An outstanding example is a man whose name originally was Saul, but whose name was afterwards changed to Paul the apostle of Jesus Christ. Paul states that he was a practitioner of religion until the Lord opened his understanding to the truth, and then he became a Christian. (Galatians 1:13-16; Acts 9:1-20; 26:4-17) Furthermore Paul states that religion and superstition are one and the same. (Acts 17:22) From the time of Niinrod until now Satan has used religion to deceive men and to cause them to indulge in the practice thereof in defiance of Jehovah. Satan’s purpose in practicing this deception is readily seen when one discerns the issue of supremacy growing out of his challenge to Almighty God. It should be kept in mind that all wickedness in the world is due to the influence of Satan, who induces men to fight against one another. There is no cause for a controversy amongst sensible men, because the interests of all men are of necessity the same. The Devil subtly and deceitfully brings about conditions causing men to fight amongst themselves and to defame Almighty God; and this he does in his efforts to make good his challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE KINGDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">That which is of greatest interest to all men, if they only realized it, is the kingdom of God, the theocratic government, with Christ Jesus, the King and official representative of Jehovah, in full charge, ruling in righteousness and bestowing lasting blessings upon all men of good will toward God. Because that theocratic government under Christ is of most vital importance to humankind the Devil bitterly opposes it; and he employs fraud, deceit and lying, as well as violence, to oppose the kingdom of God. Religion is the Devil’s chief instrument employed to lead the people into his trap. Having these indisputable facts in mind, that among all the religious institutions on earth today there is not one of them magnifying the importance of God’s kingdom, those persons on earth who are completely devoted to God and Christ, and who strive to obey God’s commandments, are the only ones who advocate and advertise the theocratic government, that is, the kingdom of God under Christ Religionists stress the importance of escaping “hell’’ or “purgatory” and finding bliss in some other existence, and they are entirely ignorant of the fact that God’s kingdom under Christ is the only means of salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">For more than eighteen centuries God gave attention to the Jews, or Israelites, using that people for the purpose of making pictures illustrating the development of his kingdom, which prophetic pictures God is now performing in reality by bringing to pass the things which were foreshadowed by the prophecies. God began the fulfillment of his prophetic pictures when he sent Jesus to earth, more than nineteen centuries ago. Jesus emphasized the kingdom, or theocratic government, as the most important of all things. At the ago of thirty years God anointed Jesus to be the King of the world because it pleased God to use Jesus to carry out his purpose. (Matthew 3:15-17) Immediately the Devil attempted to destroy Jesus. The Devil knew that Jesus was the Anointed One, whom God would set to rule over his theocratic government, and therefore the Devil tried to cause the death of Jesus by tempting him to violate God’s law. (Matthew 4:1-11) In that attempt Satan completely failed; and immediately thereafter Jesus began to proclaim to the people the importance of the kingdom: “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matthew 4:17) During the three and one-half years that followed Jesus constantly emphasized the kingdom of heaven, the theocratic government. He went about telling the truth, and healing the sick and afflicted, and demonstrated that life, health and happiness can be had by the people only under the theocratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus informed his disciples that the kingdom is of first importance. (Matthew 6:33) He taught them that Clod would select from amongst men a certain number who would prove faithful, and to whom he would entrust the interest of his kingdom on earth, and that the very least amongst these would be greater ultimately than any man living on earth. Jesus made it clear that not all men that get life will go to heaven, but only a small number go to heaven and are made a part of the kingdom; and concerning these he said: ‘‘Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12:32) Such are likened unto a little flock of sheep, and these will be with Christ in heaven as spirit creatures, being changed from human to spirit Then Jesus declared he would select another class of persons of good will and that these would find everlasting life and peace on earth, and concerning which he said: “And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.” (John 10:16) Thus he showed that all human creatures that get life must be either of the little flock that go to heaven or of the great multitude of persons of good will to whom he grants life as human creatures</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">on the earth. The only means by which anyone can obtain life is by faith in the shed blood of Christ Jesus and by complete obedience to the law of his theocratic kingdom. Again Jesus emphasized the paramount importance of the kingdom when he urged his disciples to pray at all times to God, ‘Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as in heaven.’ (Matthew 6:10) Religionists utter these words from time to time but they do not sincerely desire the kingdom to rule the earth. (2 Timothy 3:5) Jehovah sent Jesus to earth to tell the truth of and concerning his kingdom, and the record in the Bible by Matthew, Mark. Luke and John proves beyond all doubt that Jesus magnified the importance of the kingdom above everything else because that theocratic government will be a complete vindication of the word and name of Almighty God and the only means of man’s salvation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REDEMPTION</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Because of Adam’s sin in joining in the Devil’s rebellion he was sentenced to death and all his offspring were born as sinners. (Romans 5:12) Before any human creature could have opportunity to get life, either in heaven or on earth, such creature must be purchased or redeemed. In agreement with God’s will Jesus the man was put to death and thereby purchased the human race. Jesus died as. a man and God raised him out of death as a spirit who lives forever. He was “put to death in the flesh, but [made alive] by the spirit’’. (1 Peter 3:18) He is alive</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">now for evermore. (Revelation 1:18) God raised him out of death and exalted him to the highest place in the universe, clothed him with all power and authority in heaven and in earth, made him Lord and King, and commands that everyone that gets life must bow to and obey Christ, the theocratic King. (Matthew 28:18 f Philippians 2:9-11; Acts 2:33-36; John 18:36,37) By his obedience unto death as a nian, mid his resurrection by Jehovah from death, Jesus Christ becomes the owner of all of the human race who believe on and obey him. No one else can obtain life; as it is written: &quot;He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.”—John 3:36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RECEIVING THE KINGDOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">A short time before his crucifixion Jesus informed his faithful disciples that he must go away to heaven and receive the authority for the kingdom, ami that he would return and receive unto himself his faithful followers and associate them with him in his theocratic government. (John 14:1-6; Matthew 25:14-31; Luke 19:12-15) The last night that Jesus was on earth with his disciples he said to them: “Ye arc (hey which have continued with me in my temptations. And 1 appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat ami drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”—Luke 22:28-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus died upon the tree, being crucified, and thereafter at Pentecost God revealed to his faithful disciples the purpose of the death and resurrection of Jesus anti informed them that the lifeblood of Christ Jesus furnished the ransom or redemptive price for the human race and that God had appointed Jesus as Lord and King, and that Jesus would come again and set up the theocratic government, to the glory and vindication of Jehovah. The disciples then discerned that a long period of time must elapse before the Lord Jesus would come again and set up the theocratic government; and therefore under his command they went forth, preaching to the people the great imjiortance of the coming of Jesus Christ and of his kingdom. This they continued to do as long as they lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR HIS NAME</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the centuries that have passed since the resurrection of Jesus the Devil has continued to use his deceptive schemes to blind and* mislead the people, religion being the chief amongst such things. The Devil has induced religious leaders to promulgate false doctrines, amongst which are these: That every man has an immortal soul and at death the soul goes to “hell” or “purgatory” and the only way to get out is by the aid of priests or preachers, who receive a consideration for uttering prayers in their behalf. The people thus being put in fear, great multitudes rush into the religious organizations. (Isaiah 29:13) Such credulous persons have been induced to believe that salvation depends upon their joining some religious organization. Thus the Devil has kept the mass of the people in some religious organization. In that long period of time, what has God been doing toward his kingdom! It is written concerning this that when Jesus ascended on high, although he was then the King, God commanded him to wait until God’s due time for Jesus to begin his reign. (Psalm 110:1,2; Hebrews 10:12,13) Shortly after the resurrection of Jesus his faithful disciples learned that during this long period of waiting God proceeds to take out from amongst obedient men “a people for his name”, who must be witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah. (Acts 15:14) Those who prove themselves faithful must proclaim before the people the testimony of God’s Word as he commanded at Exodus 9:16. Therefore such are Jehovah’s witnesses. (Isaiah 43:10-12) It clearly appears that ‘the people taken out for his name’ must be witnesses for Jehovah regardless of all opposition. Christ Jesus is the first and chief witness of Jehovah, and one of his titles is “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Revelation 3:14) Everyone who is a true follower of Christ Jesus must also l&gt;e a witness to the truth. (John 18:36,37) The apostles of Jesus were faithful witnesses to the truth and always emphasized the importance of the kingdom and the second coming of Christ. They were faithful unto death and knew that they must remain dead until the coming of Christ Jesus and his kingdom. at which time they would be resurrected as spirit creatures and ever thereafter be associated with Christ Jesus in his theocratic government.—2 Timothy 4:1,6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Jesus Christ told his apostles what condition.' would exist on earth at the time of his coming, by which conditions all of his true followers would know that the time hud arrived for setting up of the theocratic government. Those foretold conditions definitely began to appear in A.D. 1914, at which time Jehovah enthroned his King, Christ Jesus, and sent him forth to ride while the enemy Satan still operates in the earth. (Matthew 24:3-12; Psalm 110:2: Revelation 11:16-18) A great conflict then took place between Christ and Satan, which resulted in the casting of Satan out of heaven and down to the earth, and Satan, knowing that his time is • ghort before the final battle, has since that period of time brought ever-increasing woes upon the peoples of earth, even as the Lord foretold. (Revelation 12:1-12) That conflict beginning in 1914 and continuing until 1918 marked the time of the second coming of Christ and the beginning of his theocratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">At the same time, as Jesus had foretold, the world war betweea nations of the earth took place. Did the religious organizations mid their leaders inform the people that such was evidence of the coming of God’s kingdom? Not one did so. Almost all the religious leaders advo eated and supported the world war and bitterly persecuted those who insisted on telling the people that the world war was evidence of the coming kingdom. It was in 1918 that the Lord gathered his faithful ones into a compact body to Im? used for his particular purpose, causing them to bear testimony to the people that the kingdom had come. Then the Lord revealed to his people the distinction between religion and Christianity, making it dearly to appear that religion is the Devil's snare and that Christianity means to faithfully follow Christ Jesus. To the faithful Christians on earth, Jehovah says: 'Ye are my witnesses and my servant, whom I have chosen. Ye are ray witnesses that I am God, the Almighty, the Supreme One/ (Isaiah 43: 10. 12) Thus are faithful Christians commanded to proclaim tlfc name of Jehovah throughout the earth just preceding the final battle of Armageddon. Jehovah’s theocratic government has come and the people must be told, and all of good will toward (rod rejoice because of this good news or gospel. In harmony therewith the command is given: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall lx? preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come. . . . For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall he/’—Matthew 24: 14,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This is done exactly in fulfillment with the prophecy of Exodus 9:16. In obedience to die Lord's command the faithful Christians named by the Lord as his witnesses have come out from the religions organizations, including the Cath-</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">olic, Protestant and others, and now go about the earth proclaiming the name of Jehovah and his theocratic government. Jehovah’s witnesses are not religionists, and indeed they could not be supporters of any religious system and at the same time be witnesses to the name and kingdom of Jehovah. They are not in competition with any religious-organization. Their sole duty is to tell the truth concerning Jehovah and his kingdom, which theocratic government will vindicate God’s name and bring salvation and - peace to the people of good will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SATAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Devil’s name </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Satan</span><span class="font7"> means “adversary” or “opposer’’ of God. It is certain, therefore, that he opposes everything that is on the side of Jehovah and his kingdom, and whatsoever is in opposition to Jehovah and his theocratic government is an instrument of Satan and hence a monstrosity. Let every person who desires to know and to do what is right Ik* honest and fair with himself. The fact that one has l&gt;cen a supporter of some religious organization can do that person no good. Every person that gets life must choose to support the theocratic government under Christ. All opposers God declares shall Im? destroyed, together with Satan, the chief wicked one. (Psahn 145: 20) Jesus and his apostles were unalterably opposed to religion because religion is Satan’s deceptive means to ensnare the j»eople. Now give a moment to a sober consideration of the facts:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan employed religion to ensnare and bring about the destruction of the nation of Israel, as shown by the following scriptures: Ainos 3:2; Deuteronomy 7:4; Jeremiah 51:6,7. When Jesus came he found the leaders of Israel practicing religion and inducing the people to do the same. He denounced the leaders, calling them hypocrites and the children of the Devil. (Matthew 23:13-28) During the entire three and one-half years that Jesus was on earth he was cruelly persecuted. And by whoinf In every instance the religious leaders. They accused him of every crime known, and because he proclaimed the theocratic government of his Father the religionists charged Jesus with sedition and treason and caused him to be wrongfully convicted and crucified. Thus those religionists proved they were on the Devil's side. The same rdigionists put Stephen to death because he testified to the name of God and his theocratic government. (Acts 6:8-15; 7:1-59) Saul, who was afterwards Paul the apostle, took part in the cruel murder of Stephen; and this he did ignorantly, as he declared. Later the Lord revealed the truth to him and Saul the religionist became Paul the Christian. Thereafter Paul and the other apostles of Jesus were bitterly persecuted by religionists because they told the truth. Why is it material to mention these things here! As further proof that religionists are the instruments of the Devil who persecute Christians and oppose God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">With fairness take note of the Roman Catholic religious organization, which is ruled and controlled by a few men called the “Hierarchy of Authority&quot;. Do not permit prejudice to control you and follow the lead of the Hierarchy, who cry that “all of Jehovah’s witnesses are liars; they are ignorant and bigoted”. Look at the leading histories and encyclopedias of the world and there read the record of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy organization. From beginning to end such record is filled with the cruel persecutions of the true followers of Christ Jesus. Today Jehovah’s witnesses are bitterly persecuted in every nation. And who takes the lead in such persecution! The Roman Catholic Hierarchy and their dupes. What are Jehovah’s witnesses doing that furnishes an excuse for the Hierarchy to persecute thcnil! Telling the truth of and concerning the theocratic government of Jehovah, as the only means of safety and salvation for the good people of the world. Jehovah’s witnesses have no controversy with any person because he is a Catholic. Many sincere persons have been induced to join the Catholic organisation, and God’s express purpose is to give such persons, who are of good will, an opportunity to know of and concerning his theocratic government. The telling of the truth exposes the Devil, his organization and his religious schemes; therefore the fight is, Satan against everyone and everything that is for God and his kingdom or theocracy. The Cath olio Hierarchy claims that it is the pope and has immediate associates that shall rule the world as the vicegerent of Christ; hut that is a clear ■ lewption invented by Satan for the purpose of turning the people-away from God and his theocratic government. Jehovah's witnesses are the only real friends on earth of sincere and honest Catholics. Jehovah's witnesses have no desire, ami make no effort, to build up a religious or any other organization on earth. Their sole mission is to bear testimony to the people in obedience to God’s commandment, and to inform the people that Jehovah is the Almighty God and that his theocratic government is their only hope. -.Matthew 12:18,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the Roman Catholic Hierarchy ami religious allies in fact represented God and Christ Jesus they would be boldly and joyfully telling the people that God’s kingdom under Christ is the only means of bringing peace and salvation. Instead, they persecute Jehovah's witnesses for telling al&gt;out the kingdom. The fact that the Hierarchy and allies oppose the message concerning God’s theocratic government, and persecute his messengers, is proof conclusive that the Hierarchy are the servants of God’s enemy Satan. Jehovah repeatedly declares in his Word that He will soon destroy Satan and all his sup porters, and particularly the religious organizations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">GOOD WILL</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Persons of good will are those who desire to know Jehovah God and Christ Jesus and who seek to know and to obey the Lord. When God</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">caused his angel to announce, “Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,” he was announcing the birth of Jesus the King, upon whose shoulder his theocratic government shall rest. (Isaiah 9:6) At the same time the angelic host sang: “Glory in the highest unto God! and on earth peace, among men of good-will.” (Luke 2:14, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Rotherham)</span><span class="font7"> Let it be carefully noted that the promise of peace is only to men of good will and is not to anyone that opposes God and his theocratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Are you a person of good will! Pause now and honestly answer the question following; whether you are a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, or without all religion, your answer involves your eternal destiny. Do you desire to see and to live under a government of righteousness, peace and happiness! Only God’s theocratic government can bring that condition to the earth and give you life. There is no religious institution that can give you such blessings, l»ecause all of such are anti-God and against his kingdom. If you are not for God and his kingdom under Christ, then you are against him; because, says Jesus the King, “Ue that is not with me is against me.”—Matthew 12:30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">THE MONSTROSITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Satan tries to mimic Jehovah; and in doing so he brings forth dictators to rule the earth. As the theocratic government is centered in Jehovah under Christ, so the dictatorial governments on earth are centered in Satan. Knowing that his time is short till Armageddon. immediately following the World War Satan caused men to form the League of Nations to rule the earth. The religious organizations supported that League. It has now failed. Fascist dictatorial government was then set up in Italy by an avowed atheist. A similar government was set up in Russia; then a dictatorial government was set up in Germany under Hitler, who defies Jehovah God and bitterly persecutes everybody that names Jehovah's name. The Roman Catholic religious organization is the most powerful on earth; and while it claims to serve God, the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, including the pope, has made a covenant with Mussolini and with Hitler, supports these dictatorial governments, and offers support to the dictatorial government of Russia. The Hierarchy has supported and still supports the destruction of Abyssinia, approves and supports the rebellion in Spain, and the prosecution of the war by Japan against China. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy claims the right to rule as the spiritual overlord of the dictators, all of whom are combined against Jehovah's government under Christ Jesus. Hence that monstrosity of Satan, claiming the right to rule in defiance of God and Christ, is the abomination that maketh desolate, as stated in the Scriptures.—Mark 13:14-19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">If the Roman Catholic religious system is on the side of God and Christ, then why does that institution join forces with the totalitarian governments that now misrule Europe, and which dictators are desperately trying to gain control of England and America? The Catholic religious system does not support Jehovah’s theocratic government. Why, then, does that religious system claim to represent God? The answer is. Satan the Devil is the arch deceiver and he has always used religion to deceive the people, and now the Hierarchy operates that religious system at ihc Devil's command to carry out his deception, Why Ite led into Satan’s trap? Why not heed and obey the Lord's command, to wit: ‘When you see the abomination of desolation [themonstrosity,dictatorial government] standing where it ought not to stand, then flee to the mountains [symbolic mountains, picturing God’s government under Christy? As Jesus has declared, the greatest affliction that has ever befallen man is shortly to come upon the world. That tribulation is the battle of the great day of Jehovah and will completely destroy all organizations in opposition to Jehovah’s theocratic government. Such will be a manifestation of Jehovah's supreme power against the Devil, which ho declares shall take place immediately following the finishing of the work of declaring his name by his witnesses in the earth.—Exodus 9:16, </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">Leeser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The Boman Catholic Hierarchy charges that Jehovah's witnesses now engage in a campaign of hate. That charge is entirely untrue. Jehovah's witnesses act only in obedience to God’s commandment to proclaim his name and his kingdom, and to warn the people of what is about to follow upon the earth, even as Noah, in obedience to God’s command, sounded the warning just preceding the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SURVIVORS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Only tight persons survived the flood; and God spa nd them because of their faith and obedience to his command. Only persons of good will toward God, and who prove their good will by exercising faith in him and obedience to his commandments, will survive Armageddon. (Jeremiah 25 : 34; Zephaniah 2:3) All persons of good will now must seek righteousness and meekness by learning of God’s purpose, to follow his commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BLESSED RESULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Every creature that receives the approval and blessing of the Lord must dwell in peace. Jesus tells of the “little Hock&quot; that will be associated with him in the heavenly kingdom. (Luke 12:32) The admonition to all such is written in these words: “Follow fieace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.&quot; (Hebrews 12:14) Those of the “little flock” are here specifically admonished that they must expect to have trials, tribulations, chastisements and persecutions, but amidst all such they must dwell together in peace and follow righteousness; otherwise they cannot receive the approval of the Lord. Then the Lord names his &quot;other sheep” or obedient ones, and collectively these are called the “great multitude”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">(John 10:16; Revelation 7:9-17) God used a good man named Jonadab, long ago, to picture those who form the “great multitude’’ (2 Kings 10:15-23), and hence such persons arc now called “Jonadabs”; and these must prove their full obedience to the Lord’s command (Jeremiah 35:18,19) It is such persons of good will toward God whom he will protect and shield from the fiery tribulation of Armageddon, and which persons will survive and continue to live. Such persons must prove their good will toward God by taking their stand on the side of his theocratic government under Christ, and must do so before the battle of Armageddon takes place. The time is short. God commands his witnesses to carry the message of truth to such persons of good will that they may know God and Christ and find life. (Ezekiel 9:4; John 17:3) The great multitude are the “millions now living | that] will never die” and who will live for ever on the earth and Im* regenerated and brought up to a perfect condition physically, mentally and morally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the rebellion Jehovah God gave his command to Adam to “multiply and fill the earth&quot;. Adam liecame a sinner by reason of his disobedience and could not fulfill that command. At the end of the flood God repeated that mandate to Noah and his sons. The flood was a type of Armageddon, and Noah’s sons pictured the Jonadabs, who form the “great multitude” and survive Armageddon. That mandate to fill the earth must be carried out, and will Im» carried out by the “great multitude”. They wall bring</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">children into the earth, and all the obedient ones of such will live for ever on the earth in perfect peace. The earth will become a glorious place to live. Sickness and death will end for eVer, became under the reign of Christ all obedient ones will he given life everlasting.—Revelation 21: 1-4; I Corinthians 15:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The message which Jehovah's angels brought to the earth when Jesus was born will then be fully realized. Jesus Christ, the Lord and King Sand Redeemer, is the administrator of life to the obedient ones. (Romans 6: 23) All men who live will then Ite of good will toward God. the King, and his Kingdom, and proving obedient they will dwell for ever in peace. Therefore the message &quot;Peace on earth among men of good will<sup>-</sup>’ applies only Io those who are of good will. The King, Christ Jesus, is the Prince of Peace, and “of his government and peace there shall he no end’'. (Isaiah 9:7) Such are the blessed results from the theocratic government under Christ, and which will come to men of good will. All persons of good will will enjoy the blessings of everlasting life if they remain obedient unto God : and this will be a vindication of Jehovah's name and prove Satan a liar. The earth will be filled with a joyful, peaceful and blessed human race to the eternal glory of the Most High. If you would live, learn of ami obey Jehovah and his King.</span></p>
