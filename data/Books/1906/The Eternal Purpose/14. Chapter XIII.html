Acts 3:19-21. "Then cometh the end" (1 Cor. 15:24-26) - the end of the whole period allotted for the increase, development, probation, redemption and final judgment and deliverance of the human race "into the glorious liberty of the children of God" (Rom. 8:21) thenceforth to be eternally enjoyed. "For he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death." "There shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor pain for the former things" will have "passed away." 1 Cor. 15:25, 26; Rev. 21:4</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark250"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>A Great Week</span></h5><p><span class="font0">The fact that this foretold period of Christ's reign upon earth is definitely stated to be one thousand years (Rev. 20:4; 2 Pet. 3:8) and is further designated "the last day" (not the last of human existence, but the last day of human probation, and consequently the day of final accounting - the Day of Judgment and resurrection (See John 6:39; 11:24; 12:48) and is also further designated as Sabbath (Heb. 4:8, 9 margin and Diaglott), the whole period from Adam to the end of human probation is clearly shown to be a week of millennial days - seven thousand years. And this inspired testimony is clearly verified in historic fulfillment to the present time. The early disciples of our Lord with all Israel were well aware of the prophetic week so fully foreshadowed in the Law, and also with the chronologic times and seasons symbolically foreshadowing future events, and they pondered them deeply as time brought their varied fulfillments.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark252"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark253"></a>The Sabbath</span></h5><p><span class="font0">"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day?" Well, the Pharisees of old, like a good many such today, thought not, or at least so claimed, but our Lord showed that "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath" and that he "the Lord of the Sabbath," will do for humanity what any Pharisee even would do for his ox or his ass having fallen into a pit - he will pull him out on the Sabbath day. Our whole race had fallen into the pit (the grave) and the coming Sabbath of Christ's reign upon earth is to be devoted to pulling him out and lifting him up and healing him. See Mal. 4:1-3; Rev. 22:2.</span></p><p><span class="font0">It will be the busiest day of all the great week. Court will be convened, the great, just Judge will be on the bench for a thousand years, and there will be multitudinous healing ministries established for all who desire healing from sin and its myriad calamities. God has been preparing the agents and the agencies for this great Sabbath day's work through all the preceding six days (6,000 years) and they will all be brought forth organized and ready for the great tasks of that day as soon as the kingdom of Christ is set up and established, as it will be "in power and great glory." And no "wiles of the devil" will be permitted to interfere with the vast philanthropic ministry of that glorious day. For at its very beginning Satan is bound, that he should deceive the nations no more while the great work of restoring all things proceeds. See Rev. 20:1-3; Acts 3:19-21.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark254"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark255"></a>The Six Preparatory Days</span></h5><p><span class="font0">During the six preparatory days of man's week (6,000 years) the race has been increasing to fill the earth (Gen. 1:28) and men have been getting acquainted with the value of this inheritance. They have spread themselves abroad over its surface; they have noted the grandeur of its mountain heights, the beauty of its smiling valleys, the breadth of its seas, the course of its rivers; they have sought out its treasures of mine and of ocean; they have harnessed its forces of earth and of air; they have basked in its sunlight and tasted its fruits; and they have said, How glorious this place, if only we could possess it forever.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Through sin the inheritance was lost, and the life of our race was forfeited by our first progenitor even before posterity came into existence. But it has all been redeemed and now we are considering the wonderful plan and process of restoring the race to life and health. This is the work of Christ during the millennial Sabbath day.</span></p><p><span class="font0">This is resurrection - and not only of the blessed and holy who shall have part in the first resurrection and who shall reign with Christ (Rev. 20:6) but of all men, good and bad. Those who will have part in the first resurrection and who will constitute the reigning priesthood of the incoming age will be but a small minority of the human race. To them Jesus says, "Fear not </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">little flock,</span><span class="font0"> for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." Luke 12:32. This will include not only all the kingdoms now in existence, but also all the kingdoms of the past, for there is not only a first resurrection but there are also subsequent resurrections - "every man in his order." 1 Cor. 15:22, 23.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark256"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark257"></a>The Fifth World Empire</span></h5><p><span class="font0">Over this vast host will be established the fifth universal empire referred to by Daniel the prophet, who says "In the days of these kings [as represented in the toes of the great image] shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom." It is described in the vision as a </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">little stone</span><span class="font0"> (Jesus says a "little flock" - small numerically) - taken out of the mountain (the dominion of the world: just so the overcoming church has been and is being selected) and finally destroying these kingdoms and itself becoming a great mountain and filling the whole earth. See Dan. 2:44, 45, 34, 35.</span></p><p><span class="font0">If we inquire further for the object to be attained in the setting up of this kingdom of God in the earth, the suggestion of all this preparation surely is that it must be one of benevolence. The terms used in connection with it - "Times of refreshing," "of restitution." of "restoring all things" - clearly indicate blessing and not cursing. The titles of the new King - "The Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace" (Isa. 9:6) surely indicate the same thing. And even though at his coming "clouds and darkness are round about him" and the rod of his righteous indignation shall dash the nations to pieces as a potter's vessel (disintegrate them as nations) it must be remembered that only when the chastening rod is felt will humanity yield to that righteous authority that seeks to bless: "When thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness." Isa. 26:9.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark258"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark259"></a>The Lost Inheritance</span></h5><p><span class="font0">The coming of the Son of God twice to earth is stated to be "to seek and to save that which was lost." Luke 19:10. He found the whole race lost, ruined, dead and dying under the just condemnation of God's righteous law. His first work therefore, was to remove the just legal disability to their restoration. This he did "by the sacrifice of himself.” Heb. 9:26. He "gave himself a ransom for all." 1 Tim. 2:6. "Tasted death for every man," "even the death of the cross." Heb. 2:9; Phil. 2:8. And since for every man, this blessed gospel must be clearly testified to every man. And it will be "in due time." 1 Tim. 2:6. And in the interval between then and now (i.e. during the gospel age) he has been selecting from among the redeemed race a comparatively small company composed of those who first believe on his name and who are willing to follow now in the footprints of their Lord's humiliation before he is manifested in the glory of his kingdom, to be joined with him in the subsequent kingly and priestly office of restoring all things.</span></p><p><span class="font0">His coming the second time is with these, his saints. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints." "The Lord my God shall come and all the saints with thee." Jude 14; Zech. 14:5; Rev. 3:21. And this second coming of Christ - of Jesus the head, and the overcoming church which is his body - is to reign over and bless and restore that which was lost. Therefore this gospel of the kingdom is good news to all men, even as the angel who announced the first advent of the new-born king declared: "Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people." Luke 2:10</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark260"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark261"></a>What Was Lost?</span></h5><p><span class="font0">When the sentence of death was passed upon man he certainly lost his life, and he lost his inheritance -the earth, which God gave him, and over which he was given full dominion. Gen. 1:28; 3:19; Psa. 115:16 - "The earth hath he given to the children of men." "For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens, God himself that formed the earth and made it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited" and "the earth abideth forever." Isa. 45:18; Eccl. 1:4; Psa. 119:90. This then is what was lost. Then bear in mind that it is "that which was lost" that is to be "saved," "restored."</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark262"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark263"></a>Nearness and Blessedness of the Millennial Sabbath</span></h5><p><span class="font0">It was to the dawn of the blessed Sabbath day of Christ's reign that our Lord Jesus pointed his disciples when he said, "I will come again and receive you unto myself." (John 14:3) "Watch," "wait," "be ready" - ready to sit with him in his throne as joint-heirs of his kingdom and sharers of its blessed work of restoring all things. Rev. 3:2; 20:6. To the day described as "times of refreshing," "times of restitution of all things" (Acts 3:19-21), and the restoration of Israel's glory (Isa. 1:25, 26): The day of which the Psalmist wrote saying, "Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad before the Lord, ...for he cometh to judge the earth: With righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.” Psa. 96:9-13; 98:4-9.</span></p><p><span class="font0">From the time of the promise on, even from the first intimation of it in Eden, believers have scanned the heavens for the signs of the dawn of that day and the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ in power and great glory. What are the signs of its approach? and how shall we know them? The apostle Peter says we shall know them by taking heed to the sure word of prophecy, which shines as light in a dark place until the day dawn. 2 Pet. 1:19. Then he shows that that word of prophecy spans three great epochs of human history: epochs so distinct as to be termed three separate worlds - the world that was before the flood, the world that now is, and the world to come wherein dwelleth righteousness. 2 Pet. 3:6, 7, 13. To illustrate, as follows: -</span></p><p><span class="font0">Creation: The World that was.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Flood: The World that now is.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Second Advent of Christ: The World to Come.</span></p><p><span class="font0">The first of these periods - "worlds" - extending from creation to the flood in the six-hundredth year of Noah's age, is shown by the genealogical records of Genesis V to be 1,656 years according to the original Hebrew text, accepted and followed by Archbishop Usher, as noted in our English Bibles and other learned chronologists.</span></p><p><span class="font0">From that date on (1,656 A.M.) to the second advent of Christ, is "the world that now is." Paul speaks of it as "this present evil world." Gal 1:4. It is the period or world in which we are now living: a world which, like the first world, is doomed to destruction - not by water as the first world, but "by the fire of God's jealousy." Zeph. 1:18; 2 Pet. 3:6, 7; Gen. 9:9-17. "The heavens and the earth" - the ruling powers and the ungodly masses of humanity, constituting the civilization of the first world, perished together; and likewise "the heavens and earth which are now, constituting the present civilization, perish in the </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">fiery</span><span class="font0"> calamities of the last days of this world. All unconsciously and heedless of he prophetic warnings, yet with ominous forebodings, even today the </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">fiery</span><span class="font0"> armament of all nations is preparing for this, its Armageddon conflict. 2 Pet. 3:5, 7; Rev. 16:16.</span></p><p><span class="font0">With the second advent of Christ begins the third period - "the world wherein dwelleth righteousness." This third world is characterized by the resurrection of all the dead - the "blessed and holy" of the "first resurrection" (Rev. 20:6) and afterward "every man in his own order" (1 Cor. 15:23); and over this resurrected host - "the just and the unjust" - the reign of Christ is established. *</span></p><p><span class="font0">* In vs. 5 of Rev. 20 the statement - "The rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand years were ended" is an evident interpolation, out of harmony with the context and with the clearly declared purpose of Christ's millennial reign of restitution and judgment. And further, they are omitted in the ancient Syriac and in the Vatican manuscripts.</span></p><p><span class="font0">It will be the office of this righteous Judge, "the Prince of Peace," to bring in everlasting righteousness (Dan. 9:24) through the great restoring, renewing work of his millennial reign, wherein he will lay judgment to the line and righteousness to the plummet. Isa. 28:17. "And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever." Isa. 32:17. Which effect will mark the consummation of his glorious millennial reign on earth.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark264"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark265"></a>Our Present Location</span></h5><p><span class="font0">Our present inquiry then is, How near are we at the present time to the end of "this present evil world" and the dawn of the world to come at the glorious appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ? The word of prophecy on this line is both chronological and circumstantial. We are far removed from its beginning at the Flood in Noah's day, and while chronology is carefully preserved in the divine records down to the time of authentic secular history, with only a few brief intervals of uncertainty, leaving the </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">exact</span><span class="font0"> date indeterminate, as God for wise reasons evidently intended, coupled with this circumstantial historic and current evidence in fulfillment, divine prophecy is luminous and eloquent in these last days, wherein all the lines of prophecy, both chronologic and circumstantial, converge.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Let us consider first this circumstantial prophecy, which subdivides "the world that now is" into three distinct ages, or dispensations of God's overruling providence. Beginning with Noah after the Flood - and yet preceded by worthy ones of former ages in the 1,656 years before the Flood, only a few of whose names are recorded, such as Abel and Enoch, Seth and Noah - we observe a marked selection of individual characters, through whom God was preparing to carry forward his wonderful plan for the subsequent redemption and final deliverance of the fallen human race. Abel had the testimony of acceptance with God, and though he died without offspring, his later brother Seth, in his stead (Gen. 4:25) is the link supplied in the line of succession from Adam to Noah, and thence to the promised deliverer, Jesus Christ, while the unworthy Cain, though the first born, is ignored. Gen. 5:1, 3. Compare Gen. 4:1, 2. Enoch walked with God for 365 years with the testimony that he pleased God, Noah's faith and righteous character had the divine approval and blessing, and after the Flood, Abraham became the heir of wonderful promises. Human life in those early generations stretched on into centuries, yet never went beyond the time limit announced to Adam - "</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">In the day</span><span class="font0"> that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die." One day of man's week is 1,000 years. Adam lived 930 years, Seth 912, Enoch 365 (and then translated), Methusaleh, grandfather of Noah 969, Lamech, father of Noah 777, Noah 600 years before the Flood and 350 after, or 950 years; Shem 602, Terah, Abraham's father, 205 years, Abraham 175 years. After the Flood there gradually came a notable shortening of life. Gen. 6:3; Psa. 90:9, 10.</span></p><p><span class="font0">During those long lives, with others their contemporaries, the race was rapidly multiplying, and history -God-given at the beginning (Gen. 1:) and subsequently in the making, was easily and naturally handed down from fathers to sons and daughters, and progress made in subduing the earth. And though soon the masses of the world were forgetting God and were heedless of his righteous requirements, there were always some of his witnesses (Acts 14:17) and teachers of righteousness 2 Pet. 2:5. But notwithstanding, corruption increased until only eight persons - the family of Noah - remained faithful to God and his righteousness in the closing days of that first epoch or "world." Then judgment fell. But the work of God was resumed after the Flood through the family of Noah - his three sons - Shem, Ham and Japheth and their descendants.</span></p><p><span class="font0">At the death of Noah the special prophetic blessing descended upon Shem, and in a lesser degree upon Japheth Gen. 9:26, 27. In the line of Shem came Abraham "the friend of God." Down to the call of Abraham and the special promises made to him may he regarded then as the Patriarchal Age, when the outstanding figures in the world's civilization, such as it was, were the heads of families and of tribes. But the Patriarchs failed: they could not stem the tide of evil in the world, and often themselves fell under its power.</span></p><p><span class="font0">With the call of Abraham a new dispensation of divine providence is manifest. God called this faithful patriarch and established his covenant with him, promising to make of him </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">a great nation,</span><span class="font0"> which he did after four centuries of growth and discipline in the land of Egypt and forty years of training in the wilderness of Sinai. So that when they emerged from the wilderness into the promised land of Canaan they entered the land as an organized host, a homogenous people - "a </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">nation</span><span class="font0">" i.e., a people of one common inheritance of ideals, usages, customs and laws; in other words, of one civilization and thenceforth to be of one country. And the Lord himself, to whom they were bound in solemn mutual covenant relations and who thus established them </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">nationally,</span><span class="font0"> was ever after to be recognized as their rightful Sovereign, their officers of state being his representatives, and always by his appointment.</span></p><p><span class="font0">To </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">that nation,</span><span class="font0"> thus divinely organized, he said, You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth. Amos 3:2; Deut. 10:15. They were chosen to be "a holy nation," "a royal priesthood," through whose instrumentality under divine providence all the families of the earth were to be blessed, according to the promise made to their father Abraham. But Israel </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">as a nation,</span><span class="font0"> like the Patriarchs that preceded them, failed in their mission and again only a remnant remained true to their covenant. In the line of this remnant, in due time (the time foretold by Daniel - Chap. 9:24-27) came the long promised "seed of the woman," "seed of Abraham," the "Son of David," the incarnate "Son of God."</span></p><p><span class="font0">As a nation Israel (degenerated), in its stubborn willful blindness, rejected even this divine condescension - </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">the glory</span><span class="font0"> of that favored people. And again only a true and loyal remnant received him, "and the rest were blinded." Rom. 11:7. </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">The nation</span><span class="font0"> rejected the Son of God and with that national rejection of him, God's favor to that people </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">as a nation</span><span class="font0"> was withdrawn - the Jewish age of special favor ended. And Jesus, beholding its long revered capital city, wept over it, saying, "If thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now, they are hid from thine eyes. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and you would not! Behold </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">your house is left unto you desolate.</span><span class="font0"> And verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." Luke 19:41, 42; 13:34, 35.</span></p><p><span class="font0">That </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">national</span><span class="font0"> blindness will continue until their rejected Messiah comes again, comes, this time "in his glory," when their blindness will be turned away.</span></p><p><span class="font0">With the worthy believing remnant of Israel, accepted of God, filled with his Holy Spirit and led by his beloved Son at his first advent and onward, a new dispensation of divine favor began, which thereafter included not only the worthy remnant of Israel, but also Gentile believers of all nations, the collective body of which is divinely recognized as "the Church of the living God," and which, as a chaste virgin espoused to Christ, awaits the promised day of his second coming to become his glorious bride and joint-heir with him of his kingdom and glory. These children of Abraham by faith, thus supplant the rejected nation of Israel, the fleshly seed of Abraham, as heirs of the promise made to him, in its highest sense, as previously shown. (See chap. XI)</span></p><p><span class="font0">The period devoted to this selection is thus seen to extend from the first advent of Christ to his second advent. It is the Gospel or Good News Age, wherein the good news of </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">the "high calling" to joint heirship with Christ</span><span class="font0"> is offered to all believers, of whatever nation; and the present year A.D. measures our advancement in it. Thus we see the whole period of "this present evil world" subdivided into three marked periods, as shown in the following diagram.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark266"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark267"></a>"This Present Evil World"</span></h5><p><span class="font0">Maria's diagram on her page 19 needs be inserted here. She has a margin note: "Printer: place diagram on separate and opposite page."</span></p><p><span class="font0">But there are yet other and even more explicit notes of time in the circumstantial records of the sure word of prophecy. Our Lord mentions a prophetic period which he calls "the times of the Gentiles," saying, "Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled." Luke 21:24. The term is used in contradistinction from the times of Israel's national favor and consequent supremacy. Israel's times began when God "took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt," organized then as a nation in the wilderness of Sinai and took them into covenant relations to himself. Jer. 31:32; Exod. 19:1-8. Thenceforth they were his people, his peculiar treasure, his nation and eventually, through long experience and training, they must and will become the divine agency of blessing to all the families of the earth, under the leadership of their promised Messiah and King. "Which covenant" however, "they brake." In consequence, there followed a long period of national subjection and debasement under Gentile powers, which was permitted and even timed, to endure until as a nation they should be brought to repentance and contrition. Then Israel's times are to be resumed and again they become God's recognized people under a new covenant, when they shall recognize Messiah, their Savior and King. Jer. 31:31-34. Then they shall see him coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span></p><p><span class="font0">That national humiliation of rebellious Israel began with their subjection to Babylon and through the prophet Daniel God foretold that it should be continued under the successive Gentile kingdoms of Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome. When the first advent of Christ occurred they had lived under all four of these overruling Gentile powers; and it was under the Roman power, at the instigation of rebellious Israel, that Messiah was crucified. But beyond this Gentile power, Rome, there is no other successor prophetically indicated to precede the coming of earth's rightful King, Messiah. Then Israel's blindness shall be turned away and through the prophet Isaiah God calls again to his people Israel, "Arise, shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. For behold darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising." Isa. 60:1-3.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Hence "the times of the Gentiles" end at the second coming of Christ. They began with </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">an era</span><span class="font0"> including the gradual rise of the Babylonian power and the gradual subjection of Israel to that power. They end in a </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">corresponding era</span><span class="font0"> of the decline of Gentile power and the renaissance of Israel as a nation. The time features of this long period are thus seen to be the political features and their successive development as historically recorded, become markers of the approaching end. This manner of foretelling the time does not indicate beforehand the exact date - the year or day or hour of the advent of Messiah - but when events of the last era transpire they tell us plainly that it is nigh, even at the doors.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Rome, the last of the four great Gentile powers, covers the major part of the Jewish age and all the Gospel age, as outlined in the preceding diagram. A study of the career of each as foretold by Daniel is beyond our limits here. Suffice it to say that Rome's dominion in the world was first animated by Pagan philosophy and later by antichristian Papal philosophy; and both Jews and Christians have suffered under both; the former under the divine displeasure, the latter in the spirit of martyrdom.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Thus, briefly viewed, we see all the lines of prophetic circumstantial evidence of the near end of "this present evil world" and the near end of this Gospel Age and the near end of "the times of the Gentiles," converging in our day. Rome, the last of the four great world powers, is still in existence and is in the condition so aptly symbolized in "the toes" of the symbolic image of Nebuchadnezzar's prophetic dream (Dan. 2:33, 4043) - in the nations of Europe that have grown out of the old Roman Empire. Iron was the symbol of Rome's strength: the legs were of iron but the democratic tendencies among all peoples in modern times is figured in the brittle clay of the feet and toes. Yes, the modern nations of Europe have much of the strength of the iron still, yet the brittleness of the clay - partly strong and partly brittle, hence breaking and forming again and again, for the iron and the clay will not mix - "They shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay." Dan 2:41-43.</span></p><p><span class="font0">In the great World War (unparalleled in all human history) the Image of Gentile power was struck a stunning blow - not on the head (Babylon), nor on the breast (Medo-Persia), nor on the thighs (Grecia), nor even on the iron legs of Rome: these as world powers have passed away (Dan 7:14) - but on the feet and toes. (Dan 2:34) Hence we see the fragments of the broken governments and peoples lying all over Europe to-day. It was struck by a power beyond human control - and in judgment, on </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">the nations</span><span class="font0"> as such. And the end is not yet, though it is hastening on to its Armageddon conflict, the final result of which shall be, as foretold by Daniel, the end of Gentile dominion in the earth and the firm establishment of the millennial kingdom of Jesus Christ and his joint-heirs. To him is committed all judgment, both national and individual. He is the "stone of stumbling and rock of offense" to nations as well as to individuals. The nations stumbling at that stumbling stone are broken and shall be (are being) carried away as foretold. Compare Isa. 8:14, 15; Matt. 21:44. And that stone, Christ Jesus and his kingdom in glory and in power becomes a great mountain (kingdom) and fills the whole earth (Compare Dan 2:33-35 and 41-45): For in it is </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">"in the days of these kings"</span><span class="font0"> of these Gentile powers: i.e. while they are still standing, however broken, crippled and "shaken" - that the God of heaven is setting up his kingdom, which shall by and by become a great kingdom and fill the whole earth. Dan. 2:34, 35, 45, margin.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark268"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark269"></a>Significance of Present National Perplexity</span></h5><p><span class="font0">In the perplexities of readjustment since the shock of the terrible blow of the late world-war, the statesmen of all nations are making desperate efforts to accomplish the impossible task - the mixing of the iron and the clay - to bring about harmony and cooperation among the factions composing the feet and toes and so to save the world's present civilization from the threatened collapse which all fear and dread. Luke 21:26. Italy's Premier, Mussolini, hopes to restore the ancient glory of Papal Rome's tyrannic power and to extend it to the world limits again, which is also the declared purpose and constant endeavor of the Papacy. An attempted league of the nations involved is seeking by multiplied counsels and treaties to bolster up the shaking, tottering walls of the old civilization but every effort only reveals the hopelessness of the task, as our World Press Agents constantly report.</span></p><p><span class="font0">And is it not a hopeless task when God has said, "Yet, once for all, I will shake, not only the earth (the peoples, the organized nations of the world), but the heaven, (the ruling powers, the governments) also"? And the Apostle Paul explains, "Now this 'Yet once for all' denotes the removal of the things shaken, as of things made (temporary things) that those things that cannot be shaken - 'the kingdom which cannot be moved' - may remain," being established upon the sure foundation of righteousness. "For our God is a consuming fire," and sin, wherever found or however entrenched in power, is always inflammable. Heb. 12:26-29; Hag. 2:6, 7.</span></p><p><span class="font0">The final collapse of Gentile power in the world will necessarily spell what divine prophecy foretells -"a time of trouble such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be." Matt. 24:21.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark270"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark271"></a>Day of National Judgment</span></h5><p><span class="font0">Manifestly this, our day, is the day of </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">national</span><span class="font0"> judgment, when God is having a controversy with the nations as such (Jer. 25:31), when he is calling the nations to his bar, saying, "Come near, ye nations to hear, and hearken, ye people. Let the earth hear, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies." Isa. 34:1, 2. Is it not indeed the day when the hidden things of secret national diplomacy and intrigue are being revealed? 1 Cor. 4:5. For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that shall not be known. Luke 12:2. Eventually "every work shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire." 1 Cor. 3:13.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Thus the world-wide political features of this long period of "the times of the Gentiles," as foretold by the prophets, and as fulfilled and fulfilling in our day, mark our present proximity to the end of the old long established Gentile dominion and the dawn of a new order of things under the reign of Christ.</span></p><p><span class="font0">This circumstantial evidence of fulfilled and fulfilling prophecy in our day is of itself conclusive evidence that we are now living in the closing era of "the world that now is" and the dawning of a new and better day. It fixes our present location, though it does not and was not intended, to reveal an exact date. Like the dawning of the natural day so the dawning of the day of Jesus Christ is first amid clouds and darkness (and that darkness deepened by storm and tempest (Matt. 24:21) and then a gradual illumination, growing brighter and brighter unto the perfect day as the "Sun of Righteousness" rises higher and higher to his meridian glory and, Praise the Lord, never again to set. Matt. 24:27. It is an era of transformation through national judgments which, however severe, the process, when accomplished will be "the desire of all nations" (Hag. 2:6, 7) bringing such satisfaction to the weary world as no efforts of its own best statesmen could ever achieve: "For when his judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness." Isa. 26:9.</span></p><p><span class="font0">The chronological data of this long period of Gentile times, a period of 2,520 years dating from the era of Israel's gradual subjection to Gentile power and extending to the era of their gradual rising again, which event we are witnessing today, is a subject the satisfactory treatment of which would be beyond the limits of this work. The author therefore is satisfied to refer the reader to a valued work on the whole subject of prophetic time by the late Rev. Dr. Grattan H. Guinness - a volume of more than seven hundred pages, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Approaching End of the Age.</span><span class="font0"> Published by Morgan and Scott, Ltd., 12 Paternoster Buildings, London E.C. This masterly work is in full harmony with all of the circumstantial evidence herein cited. A condensed statement of the subject would be unsatisfactory to careful students, hence is not attempted here.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark272"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark273"></a>Last Times</span></h5><p><span class="font0">Briefly then, we are in the last times in every sense. Behind us is the "world that was before the Flood." So also the Patriarchal Age and the Jewish Age of "this present world," while the Gospel Age has well nigh run its appointed course and accomplished its great work of bearing the message of salvation (not to all individuals but) "</span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">to all nations for</span><span class="font0"> a </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">witness</span><span class="font0">" and of taking out "from among the Gentiles a people for his name" - a remnant of the nations which, together with the remnant of Israel, shall be associated with their Lord in the great work of the new dispensation, the work of restoring all things.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Politically we now see the foretold events which mark the closing of the times of the Gentiles. God's controversy with the nations is on and the Armageddon judgment is impending. We are witnessing the shaking once for all, of all nations, preparatory to the final removal of the Gentile powers and the setting up of Messiah's kingdom, while the renaissance of Israel and the restoration to the land of promise, begun in our day and rapidly proceeding, is the great event to which our Lord pointed as indicating that the end is in sight - "even at the doors." Luke 21:24-31; Matt. 24:32, 33. Amen! Is it not enough to comfort and hearten all those who love the Lord's appearing and long for his righteous orderly reign to heal the broken-hearted peoples of he earth: enough to stimulate the hope of all those who walk by faith?</span></p><p><span class="font0">But it is not enough to warn the nations, who walk in darkness, heedless of the divine counsel and steadily ignoring the sure word of prophecy while they resort to human devices only, in seeking to establish, at least a measure of that peace and harmony without which the world cannot endure.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark274"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark275"></a>The Manifest Wisdom of Divine Providence</span></h5><p><span class="font0">Thus far we have been hastily tracing the course of an overruling providence in human affairs during the first six days of man's great week as prophetically foretold and historically fulfilled to date. But let us observe further some of the details of this great work and note their character and progressive means to the great end to be finally and fully accomplished in the seventh millennial day.</span></p><p><span class="font0">During all of the past six days (6,000 years) God's overruling providence has been shaping human experiences for the accomplishment of his own wise ends. Though men have very generally chosen to forget God and to ignore his Word and have pursued their own course regardless of his will, God, like a wise father, has been letting them do it to its bitter end and allowing them to try every experiment of their own imagination until their folly in ignoring his counsel and despising his reproof is finally proven to them. Consequently as we look back over human history what do we see? Truly every page of the volume is stained with blood and tears. Behold the rise of empires today, their fall tomorrow. Every imaginable experiment of government and of national and social institutions has been tried: none have brought the desired peace and happiness that all men crave; and baffled hope often finds expression in such words as those of Charles Mackay: -"Tell me ye winged winds that round any pathway roar, Do ye not know some spot where mortals weep no more?</span></p><p><span class="font0">Where weary man may find the bliss for which he sighs,</span></p><p><span class="font0">Where sorrow never lives and friendship never dies?</span></p><p><span class="font0">Is there no happy spot where mortals may be blessed, Where grief may find a balm and weariness a rest?" Then hear the answer -</span></p><p><span class="font0">"The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low,</span></p><p><span class="font0">And sighed for pity as it answered, No."</span></p><p><span class="font0">While humanity at large has been plodding along under this discipline of experience, groaning under the heavy load which sin has imposed, God has also been preparing the instrumentalities for their future blessing. To this end, in the fullness of time he sent his only-begotten Son to redeem the world. The great atoning sacrifice was made and thus was finished the work which made salvation a </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">legal</span><span class="font0"> possibility.</span></p><p><span class="font0">To this end also he sent into the world his word of promise and wherever faith received it into good and honest hearts, there the star of hope arose above the surrounding gloom and a comparatively few wise men following that star were led to Jesus. A goodly company from the past pursued that star of hope to the manger in Bethlehem and then said, "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace for mine eyes have seen that which thou hast prepared before the face of all people: a light to lighten the gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel." - and then laid down to "rest in hope" until the appointed "times of restitution of all things." Luke 2:29, 32; Acts 2:25, 26; Psa. 16:8-11; Acts 3:21.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Then another company with the hearing of faith catching the inspiration of the self-sacrificing love of Jesus, have like him taken up their cross and followed in his steps. These two great, yet comparatively small companies, God has been preparing for the future service and honor of his kingdom - to be associated with Christ in the great work of blessing "all the families of the earth." Gen. 12:3; Gal. 3:8, 29.</span></p><p><span class="font0">All of these mighty works God has been doing for a race in sin and in rebellion. And why? Because he "So loved the world" and is "not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved." John 3:16, 17; 2 Pet. 3:9. And "God commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us." Rom. 5:8.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Since a thousand years is to be devoted to the restoring work of Christ's kingdom it is manifest that the lost inheritance is not to be restored to man until man himself is restored, made perfect and thus fit to have dominion over it. The new age will therefore necessarily be not only the day of the resurrection of all that are in the graves, both the just and the unjust but also the day for their instruction, training, discipline, correction; a day of rewards and of penalties too, when stripes many or few as the case may be will follow the wasted or abused opportunities of the present life: "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil." And to this end "The eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good." See and ponder Prov. 15:3; 2 Chron. 16:9; Job 34:21,22; Prov. 5:21-23; Jer. 16:17; Zech. 4:10; Heb. 4:13. "And that servant which knew his Lord's will and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required." Eccl. 12:14; Luke 12:47-48.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Thus to the extent that men have led clean lives in this age will they have the advantage in the age of judgment to come, while those who have reveled in wickedness have been treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath for such and revelation of the righteous judgment of God. Rom 2:5.</span></p><p><span class="font0">In this view of the great millennial Day of Judgment it is very manifest how judgment will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet (Isa. 28:17); and how "there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that shall not be known." Luke 12:2. The pall of death has covered many a hideous secret which must be revealed and punished, while the echo of many a good deed unappreciated here will resound there to the praise of him that did it. And so exact will this judgment be that even a cup of cold water given to refresh another shall not lose its reward. Matt. 10:42.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Thus the world's probation is seen to begin with life on this side of the grave and continue through the millennial day of Christ's reign, the interval of death being a blank parenthesis: "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts perish." "His sons come to honor and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them." "So man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens [the present ruling powers] be no more. They shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep." Psa. 146:4; Job 14:21, 12. See also John 11:11-14. Strange to say these great facts so clearly set forth in the Word of God have been obscured, made void, by human theories and traditions. Now let us consider how great the work of the incoming age is to proceed.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark276"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark277"></a>The Binding and Loosing of Satan</span></h5><p><span class="font0">In the beginning of this millennial day we are informed Satan is to be bound and is to remain so for a thousand years. This in order that the world being thus relieved from his deceptions and snares, may the more rapidly progress toward perfection of character. Hear the testimony - "And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years ... that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled. And after that, he must be loosed a little season." Rev. 20:1-3.</span></p><p><span class="font0">As soon as Satan is thus loosed we see that the entire work of the millennial day is put to the test. Under the favorable conditions of Christ's reign of righteousness - its wholesome measures of discipline, correction and training unhampered by any of the wiles of Satan, humanity will make rapid strides of progress; and at the end of that day God will require of every man an established righteous character. For into the new eternal order of things "there shall in no wise enter any thing that defileth." Rev. 21:27. And rightfully so, for that long experience will have fully manifested the love and wisdom and grace of God and the righteousness of his requirements.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Before God will grant to men the full possession of eternal life and of the original inheritance, the earth, the characters thus formed must finally be put to the test. The loosing of Satan does this. At once he resorts to his old deceptions, not as to what is the will of God, for men will know that perfectly but as to their opportunity again to ignore his will and to pursue their own independent course. This final deception will make manifest all the wicked , who, with Satan their leader, will suffer the final penalty of sin, which in the symbolic language of Revelation, is called the "lake of fire" and defined "the second death." Rev. 20:14.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Then "blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth" (Matt. 5:5), for God "made it not in vain but to be inhabited" - by a noble race in glory and everlasting felicity. Then, the curse of sin removed, shall its desert places "blossom as the rose," and "They shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it." "In his days shall the righteous flourish, and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth." Isa. 35:1; Micah 4:4; Psa. 72:7.</span></p><p><span class="font0">These will be the sheep of our Lord's parable (Matt. 25:31-46) while the wicked who are made manifest and thus separated from the sheep in this last trial will be the goats.</span></p><h5><a name="bookmark278"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark279"></a>Service of the Present Witness to All Nations</span></h5><p><span class="font0">Since our Lord directed that before this gospel age should end this gospel of the kingdom should be preached in all the world, for a witness unto all nations (Matt. 24:14), we may inquire, Of what avail is this witness to the nations if it does not accomplish their conversion to God?</span></p><p><span class="font0">Perhaps the reader already sees the answer in the wonderful order and arrangement of God's plan - that God has been preparing for the world's conversion, both nationally and individually in the coming day - the times of restitution of all things. That there will be a sudden turning to God on the part of all nations as a result of the great tribulation which shall overwhelm all is clearly shown by the prophets, who say, "When thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness." "For thus saith the Lord of hosts ... I will shake all nations, and </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">the desire of all nations</span><span class="font0"> shall come" - the kingdom of God. "And all nations shall flow unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths." "And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." "And it shall be said in that day, Lo this is our God, we have waited for him and he will save us; ... we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation." See Isa. 26:9; Hag. 2:6, 7; Isa. 2:2, 3; 40:5; 25:9.</span></p><p><span class="font0">And in the very midst of the great tribulation with which this age will end comes the proclamation of "the everlasting gospel ... to every nation and kindred and tongue and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters." Rev. 14:6, 7.</span></p><p><span class="font0">This everlasting gospel, be it observed, is no new gospel. It is the same "good tidings of great joy to all people" which the angels proclaimed at our Lord's first advent.
