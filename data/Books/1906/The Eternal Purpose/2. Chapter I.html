Ephesians 3:10, 11.</span></p><p><span class="font0">—As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.” Isa. 55:9</span></p><p><span class="font0">That the eternal God who introduces himself to us as the Creator and Sustainer of all things, in whom all wisdom, power and virtue inheres, has a plan of such dimensions as to give to all the truths both of nature and of grace, a glorious setting in one harmonious whole, is not only a reasonable deduction from what we see of the universal order of things, but it is also a fact, to which the sacred Scriptures give ample testimony. God’s —eternal purpose” is therefore his ultimate design or intention in the creation of all things animate and inanimate.</span></p><p><span class="font0">The Apostle Paul calls this purpose of God in creation, The Eternal Purpose, and declares it to be a purpose of mutual interest to heaven and to earth, to angels and to men; for —in the dispensation of the fullness of times” God will —gather together in one [in one grand organization] all things in Christ, both which are in the heavens and which are on the earth, even in him.” Eph. 1:10. Indeed he classes both angels and men together as the one family of God, for whom the divine purpose is being worked out, —the whole family in heaven and in earth.” Eph. 3:15.</span></p><p><span class="font0">It is called the eternal purpose because its consummation is to be an established order of things which shall endure to all eternity. And since the purpose in reference to that order is an eternal purpose, it follows that the creation itself, both material and intelligent, is designed for eternal duration.</span></p><p><span class="font0">When the divine purpose reaches its grand consummation it will redound to the </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">supreme</span><span class="font0"> glory of the great Designer who —purposed it in himself” (Eph. 1:9): in whose mind alone it originated. For —Who hath directed the spirit of Jehovah, or being his counselor, hath taught him? With whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?” For of him and through him and to him are all things: to whom be glory forever.” Isa. 40:1214; Rom. 11:34-36. And all of his willing and obedient agents in heaven and in earth who delight to learn the works and ways of God, and to cooperate with him in bringing to pass the final consummation will, in measure, share that glory, from his highly exalted only-begotten divine Son, down to the feeblest human child of God.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Hear the end of the eternal purpose as revealed in the prophetic vision of St. John—Rev. 5:13——And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.” Its culmination, then, will be the promised —new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.”</span></p><p><span class="font0">If men would search for this testimony of God as diligently as they search for silver and gold their search would be rewarded with a knowledge of him far transcending the meager glimpses of his glory with which the masses, even of his professed people, seem contented. That it is the will of God that his people should reverently inquire into his works and ways is very manifest from his repeated and urgent invitations to us to do so. Hear:--—My son, if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments with thee, so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding; yea, if thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasure, then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord [that reverent filial fear which is begotten of a clear sense of the divine majesty, glory and holiness, and his deep and loving condescension even to his most insignificant creatures] and find the knowledge of God.” Prov. 2:1-5.</span></p><p><span class="font0">And since the works and ways of the infinite and hold y God so far transcend the works and ways of finite sinful man, as often to seem foolish to men, simply because in their fallen condition they cannot rise to an appreciation of them, it is absolutely necessary to the understanding of God that man should come to their study in a spirit of humble faith in his sure testimonies—that faith with only the spirit of God can impart to such as come to him in his appointed way—through Jesus Christ: —Without faith it is impossible please God,” and hence to secure the leading of his spirit; —for he that cometh to God must believe that he is”—that he exists: a fact to which the visible creation bears ample testimony,--—and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” Heb. 11:6. Let us bear in mind also that, that is not faith in God, which declines to accept a —Thus said the Lord” save when it bears some trusted human endorsement.</span></p><p><span class="font0">The acceptable spirit of inquiry is clearly shown in Isa. 45:11, 12, 18——Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come: concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me? I have made the earth and created man upon it. I even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. ...Thus saith Jehovah that created the heavens, God himself that formed the earth and made it: he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited. I am Jehovah and there is none else.” (Compare Leeser’s translation.)</span></p><p><span class="font0">Observe that the invitation to inquiry here given is not confined to the things pertaining to human salvation, but beyond this, it extends to the yet larger theme of God’s great and comprehensive purpose in his creation; and that, not only of the earth, but of the heavens as well—Now —Ask me of things to come”—of my plans for the future of this stupendous creation, both material and intelligent. Do not come with skeptical pride and tell me you have hammered the rocks with your mallets and pierced the heavens with your telescopes, and that now you know all about it: that the testimonies of my Word do not agree with your science and philosophy, and that therefore it—can—not stand. The spirit of reverent research into divine testimonies, both of nature and of revelation, is pleasing to God; and he stands ready to reveal his truth, in its season, to those who can, in simplicity of heart, trust his Word; but from the self-wise and worldly-prudent spirit he hides his truth.</span></p><p><span class="font0">—But what is the use of aspiring to such knowledge?” say some, who seem to regard their willing ignorance of divine things as evidence of commendable humility: —to know that I am saved is enough for me.” Is this the reply we should make to the gracious invitation of our God to come yet closer to his heart that he may more fully reveal his glory to us as his sons?</span></p><p><span class="font0">Such has not been the attitude of those faithful ones who have received the stamp of the divine approval. Moses besought the Lord to show him his glory, and God rewarded Moses’ prayer. See Exod. 33:18-23. Daniel fasted and prayed for three full weeks for further knowledge of the ways of God, to whom God sent his angel with the message that he was a greatly beloved, and that from the first day that he had set his heart to understand and to chasten himself before God, his words were heard: and now, said the angel, —I am come for thy words, etc.” Dan. 10:1-3, 11, 12; 9:21-23.</span></p><p><span class="font0">All the prophets and holy men of old searched the Scriptures diligently, and the angels look into these things (1 Pet. 1:10-12); and if we have no more interest in the works and ways of God than merely to secure exemption from the divine wrath upon the ungodly, we lack the true spirit of sons. —The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. ..He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered. .They stand fast forever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.” Psa. 111:2-8.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Moses said, —The secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever.” Deut. 29:29. Yet this things revealed are not always surface truths, lying open to all eyes: there are treasures of divine truth that must be mined from the deeper strata of sacred lore; there are gems and pearls that must be carefully sought; and while every truth is a treasure of great value, it is only when these are seen in their setting of a great and harmonious divine plan, that their full worth can be understood.</span></p><p><span class="font0">When God planned his vast creation he had a far-reaching, even an —eternal purpose” in it, and his omniscient eye foresaw the sure consummation of it from the beginning. To presume that men should be able to fathom God’s great purposes without a direct revelation from him is to assume that the finite mind can fathom the infinite. Manifestly this is impossible, for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are his ways higher than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts. Isa. 55:8, 9.</span></p><p><span class="font0">That God’s purpose is not only definite, but also sure of fulfillment, he clearly asserts, saying, —For as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.” Isa. 55:10, 11.</span></p><p><span class="font0">Not only is the divine purpose in creation a definite and well matured purpose, and sure of accomplishment, but both the end to be attained and the means of attaining it are worthy of the divine attributes and of the divine character, and a glorious testimony to the divine wisdom, power love and grace. Consequently the more we can learn of God’s works and ways, the more nearly can we fulfill —the first and great commandment”——Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.” Matt. 22:36-38.</span></p><p><span class="font0">From the inspired statements already noted it is manifest that what the Apostle Paul terms the eternal purpose of God, is not merely his purpose in human redemption and salvation, through this is an integral part of it, and one of stupendous importance, both in itself, and in its relation to the eternal purpose. The complex character of the eternal purpose includes it as very vital to its all comprehensive design, as subsequent chapters will show.</span></p><p><span class="font0">That these two allied and interwoven purposes of God may be kept distinct before the mind, we briefly state again that the eternal purpose is as broad as creation, while the plan of human redemption and salvation deals directly with the earth and the human race upon it, although in its results it immensely affects the whole creation. In their consummation the two blend in one, the purpose in redemption being accessory to the eternal purpose in the creation of all things, and culminating at the same time.</span></p><p><span class="font0">That the eternal purpose of God had progressed to the completion of the work of creation before the plan of human salvation was begun, and even before there was yet any necessity for it—that is, before the fall of man—is clearly stated. Man was the last of the works of creation: then God rested from his creative work, and the six-day’s work is summed up in the words, “thus the heavens and the earth </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">were finished,</span><span class="font0"> and all the host of them.” Gen. 1:26-31; 2:1.</span></p><p><span class="font0">The time allotted for the accomplishment of God’s eternal purpose is definitely marked as beginning with creation, and culminating at the close of Christ’s millennial reign on earth. Then, not only will order be restored on earth, and sin and sinners, both angelic and human, be finally disposed of, but the whole universe, earth included, will be united in one harmonious dominion, the will of God being done on earth, as it is done in heaven, and all creatures in heaven and in earth praising God with one accord.</span></p></body></html>
