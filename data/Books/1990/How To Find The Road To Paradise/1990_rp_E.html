<p><span class="font4">67:6</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ing.”—Isaiah 65:21, 22; compare Psalm 145:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ No more sickness and death: “He |God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore.”—Revelation 21:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The resurrection of the dead: “The hour is coming in which all those in the . . . tombs will hear his voice and come out.”—John 5:28, 29,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Man and beast will live in peace: “And the wolf will actually reside ... with the male lamb, and with the kid the leopard itself will lie down. . . . and a mere little boy will be leader over them.”—Isaiah 11:6; compare Isaiah 65:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ No more wars and violence: “And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.”—Isaiah 2:4; compare Psalm 46:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The human family will be united in love: “He that does not love has not come to know God, because God is love.”—1 John 4:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Ample food and homes for all: “And they will certainly build houses and have occupancy;... they will not plant and someone else eat</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Some have tried to falsify God's Word, but they did not succeed. For instance, in John's first letter, chapter 5, verse 7, the following words were at one time added: “In heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.”—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">King James Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">These words do not appear in any of the ancient Bible manuscripts but were added later in order to support the false Trinity doctrine. Scholars, however, know that such words are counterfeit, and modern Bible translations omit them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Many Bible manuscripts that are four or five centuries older than the Qur'an can be seen in museums today. When our present-day Bible is compared with such old manuscripts, it becomes quite clear that the text we have today is the same as that which God inspired his ancient servants to write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">HAS NOT THE HOLY BIBLE BEEN TAMPERED WITH?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Almighty God could by no means allow such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Qur'an declares: “None can change the decrees of Allah.”—Surah 6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Al-An'am</span><span class="font4"> (Cattle), verse 34.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Holy Bible makes a similar declaration as follows; “The green grass has dried up, the blossom has withered; but as for the word of our God, it will last to time indefinite.&quot;—Isaiah 40:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHERE WILL THE PROMISED PARADISE BE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We read in surah 21. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Al-Anbiya’</span><span class="font4">(The Prophets), verse 105: “We wrote in the Psalms after the Torah had been given: ‘The righteous among My servants shall inherit the earth.’”* Compare surah 39, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Al-Zumar,</span><span class="font4"> (The Hordes), verses 73 and 74.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yes, centuries before. Psalm </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Zebur)</span><span class="font4"> 37:29 revealed that the promised Paradise would be on earth. It reads: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LIFE IN PARADISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Holy Scriptures go even further, describing what life will be like in Paradise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">* All quotations from the Qur’an in this publication are taken from the translation by N. J. Dawood.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Compare surah 10, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Yunis</span><span class="font4"> (Jonah), verse 94: “If you doubt what We have revealed to you, ask those who have read the Scriptures before you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT YOU SHOULD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">KNOW ABOUT THE HOLY BIBLE</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ God is the only true God. the Almighty, who has no equal.—Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 44:6.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The idea that God married a woman in order to have sons is unthinkable.—Psalm 36:9; Job 38:7; Luke 3:38; Genesis 2:7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The Holy Bible strongly condemns worship of any person or object (including idols and carved images). God alone must be worshiped.—Matthew 4:10; Leviticus 26:1; Psalm 115:4-8.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ God is Lord of all mankind, and his Word was written for all humans, both men and women.—Genesis 22:18; 1 Timothy 2:4; Ephesians 5:33.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Entry into God's promised Paradise does not depend on birth, nationality, or the religion our parents gave us.—Acts 10:34.35; Revelation 7:9.10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ The Holy Bible appeals to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">reason</span><span class="font4"> and rises up against </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">ignorance.—</span><span class="font4">Proverbs 2:3-6; Psalm 119:33, 34.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">W E ARE ON THE POINT OF ENTERING GOD'S PARADISE—HOW DO WE KNOW?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Only God knows the future, and in his Word he foretold certain events that would be a sign that Paradise was at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Here are just a few of the events he mentioned:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Wars, earthquakes, pestilences, and famines.—Luke 21:10, 11.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Lawlessness.—Matthew 24:12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">♦ Selfishness, disobedience to parents, religious hypocrisy.—2 Timothy 3: 1-5.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">Do you see these prophecies being fulfilled today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT MUST WE DO IF</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WE WANT TO LIVE IN GOD'S PARADISE?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We must come to know the truths of God's Word, for this accurate knowledge is compared to hidden treasures.—Proverbs 2:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We must also put into practice what we learn, as the Creator ordains: “This is the way. Walk in it, you people.&quot;—Isaiah 30:21.</span></p>
