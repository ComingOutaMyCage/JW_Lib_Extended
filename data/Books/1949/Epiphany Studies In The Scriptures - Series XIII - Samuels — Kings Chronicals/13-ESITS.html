<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">AUTHOR'S FOREWORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">IT IS the design of this volume of the Epiphany Studies in the Scriptures to set forth the antitypes of the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles, with the exception of those parts of them that treat of David and Solomon. Those parts of these books that treat of David are given, as to their small antitype, in the two volumes of this work entitled &quot;The Parousia Messenger.&quot; Those parts of these books that treat of Solomon will, as to their small antitype, be discussed, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">D.</span><span class="font3"> v., in a chapter that is to be added to another volume of this work. The present volume treats first, of antitypical Samuel in two chapters; then of antitypical Samuel and Saul in one chapter. Thereafter it gives the antitypes of the kings of Israel and Judah insofar as they concern their large parallels. We say large parallels, in which the years in the lives of these are paralleled by the years of certain Gospel-Age movements just 2520 years later, because there is a small parallel in which the years of these kings are paralleled by days in the Epiphany. This small parallel has been explained in EJ, chapter 6. It might be added that there is a third set of antitypes of the kings of Judah and Israel, that is, certain specialized antitypes, for example, Elijah as the type of the Church as God's reformer —mouthpiece to the world from Jordan to its final deliverance, Elisha as the type of the Great Company and Youthful Worthies, first, as the servants of the Church until it lost mouthpieceship to the world, and thereafter, as God's mouthpiece to the world, particularly as Societyites. There are numerous other specialized antitypes in these books. In the appendix we treat briefly of the specialized antitype of Athaliah and Joash and their acts. The first part of the appendix treats of the Gospel-Age antitypes of lamentations set forth in Lam. 1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the above it can be readily inferred how rich in typical teachings the six books treated of in this volume are. That the two books of Samuel and the two books of Kings are typical, and that typically prophetic, is evident from the fact that, in the Hebrew Old Testament, they belong to its second division, which is in Hebrew called The Prophets. This division has two parts, the first, the books from Joshua to 2 Kings inclusive, being by God called The Earlier Prophets, and the second, consisting of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the twelve minor prophets, is there called The Later Prophets. From what Peter said (Acts 3: 24) we infer that Samuel, the first of the line of prophets, wrote Joshua, Judges and Ruth, and from 1 Chro. 29: 29, we infer that he wrote the bulk of 1 Sam. The questions arise, Why does God call the former set of books &quot;Earlier Prophets&quot; since they are historical in character, and how could the inspired Peter refer to these four books, as well as to the rest of these historical books, as Prophets? The reply to these questions is that they are prophetic. They are histories that give prophetic types, that is, types that foretell future persons, events and things. From this fact we infer that 1 and 2 Chro., treating of the same general events, are also typically prophetic. It is these facts that have moved the author to study these books as types of future things in the unfolding plan of God, and to set forth his Divinely illuminated findings thereon in this volume. That upon its ministry God may richly bestow His blessing is the prayer of its author.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">WE WILL, as the first part of this book, study the first 15 chapters of 1 Sam., and that under the following two titles: (1) Samuel—Type and Antitype (1 Sam. 1—8), and (2) Samuel and Saul—type and Antitype (1 Sam. 9—15). Accordingly, in this and the following chapter we will study the first subject, and, after finishing it, we will study the second subject in the third chapter, God willing and prospering our study. As elsewhere indicated, our typical expositions will be made terser than those usually hitherto given. Otherwise we will be unable to accomplish the Lord's will for the Epiphany messenger, that he explain everything in the Bible not explained by the Parousia messenger. We will not find the Samuel antitype to follow throughout a progressive, chronological sequence of events. Rather, the first 15 chapters of the book give us, especially in its first eight chapters, a series of Gospel-Age pictures of certain events more or less disconnected chronologically from one another, though more or less connected in general lines of thought. Thus the events of 1 Sam. 1 and 2 give us a chronological picture of certain related events, more or less separate and distinct from those that follow. As we go on we will point out in each case the changes from one to the other set of pictures. The general setting of 1 Sam. 1 and 2 will first be given. It treats of the elect classes, especially of the Little Flock, in the end of the Age. The antitype in general outlines is like that of Jacob, his wives and his children, with certain differences to bring out thoughts not found in the Jacob</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">picture. In this story, generally speaking, Elkanah corresponds to Jacob, Peninnah to Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah, and Hannah to Rachel, with certain elaborations not found in the Rachel picture. We have seen that in his family matters Jacob types the Gospel-Age star-members and their special helpers; Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah certain truths and the servants who applied them to the members of the ten denominational groups of Christendom; Rachel the elective truths and the servants who applied them to the Little Flock and the Great Company in the end of the Age—the Parousia and the Epiphany; Joseph the Little Flock in the Parousia movement and Benjamin the Great Company in the Epiphany movement. In the Hannah picture Samuel is made to correspond with Joseph in the Rachel picture, Hannah's other three sons (1 Sam. 2: 21) to the Great Company in its three divisions and Hannah's two daughters to the Youthful Worthies in their two groups, those in the Epiphany movement, who will, if faithful, be the Millennial Shimite Gershonites, and those among the Levite Truth movements, who will, if they cleanse themselves and then prove faithful, be the Millennial Libnite Gershonites. Thus we see that while Rachel types the spiritual elective truths and the servants that apply them to the two spiritual elect classes in the end of the Age, Hannah additionally types the earthly elective truths and the servants that apply them to the earthly elect class, the Youthful Worthies developed in the end of the Age, i.e., from 1881 onward. The Jacob, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., </span><span class="font3">and the Elkanah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> types are a splendid example of how God gives His truths, here a little and there a little, thus making various Scriptures, while giving certain lines of Truth in common, supplement one another by giving varying details, which, of course, are not contradictions. So far an outline of the antitypes of 1 Sam. 1 and 2. Now to general, not particular details.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) The star-members and their special assistants (Elkanah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God-acquired,</span><span class="font3"> 1) throughout the Gospel</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Age from early in the Smyrna period (70-313 A.D.) onward, have been prominent in both the real and the nominal church (Ramathaim, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">two, heights')</span><span class="font3"> as watchmen (Zophim, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">watchers)</span><span class="font3"> in both Zions (mount Ephraim, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">doubly fruitful),</span><span class="font3"> in the interest of God's real and nominal people. They had the qualities (son. . . son. . . son. . . son) of being shown love, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> experienced God's love in providence, redemption, instruction, justification, sanctification and deliverance (Jeroham, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">he is loved),</span><span class="font3"> of being strong in grace, knowledge and service (Elihu, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">he is strong, or he is a god), </span><span class="font3">of being humble (Tohu, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lowly),</span><span class="font3"> of being the bearer of good tidings (Zuph, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">honeycomb)</span><span class="font3"> and of especial efficiency (Ephrathite, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one doubly fruitful).</span><span class="font3"> They were made the steward of two sets of truths and of the servants who applied them to their respective subjects (he had two wives, 2). The character and nature (name) of the first of these sets of truths and its appliers were grace (Hannah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">grace, favor). </span><span class="font3">The character and nature (name) of the second of these sets of truths and its appliers were strength and brilliance (Peninnah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">coral, pearl).</span><span class="font3"> The second set of truths and its appliers had produced and developed from the Smyrna period unto the end of the Philadelphia period the ten, or twelve, denominational groups (had children) of Christendom: the Greek Catholic, the Roman Catholic, the Lutheran, the Calvinistic, the Baptist, the Unitario-Universalist, the Episcopal, the Methodist, the Christian (Camphellite) and the Adventist Church. It will be noted that under the Jacob picture the Congregational Church is included in the Calvinistic Church, while the Fanatical Sects are regarded not as sects, but as individuals fanatically disposed in all of the ten denominational,groups of Christendom, though in the tabernacle's camp picture these two as denominational groups are set forth as the antitypes of the Manasseh and Benjamin tribes respectively. While thus antitypical Peninnah had as children the ten, or twelve, denominational groups (it will be noted that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">their number is not indicated, except suggestively or indirectly in 2, 4, 8, hence they may be viewed from either of the above viewpoints), antitypical Hannah had produced and developed neither a denomination nor a permanent movement (had no children).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) The star-members, as God's special servants, started, and they and their special assistants developed (this man went up, 3) all twelve movements, that were later perverted into sects, by their services (worship) and sacrifices (sacrifice) among God's nominal people (Shiloh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">quiet,</span><span class="font3"> not active or zealous). Their services and sacrifices were in connection with the ten (or twelve) stewardship doctrines, by which they started and developed the ten (or twelve) movements that were later by the crown-lost leaders perverted into the above-mentioned ten (or twelve) denominational groups. These they did not start or originate in certain equal, regular, periods of time, as the facts prove, but from time to time at irregular intervals (yearly, year by year, 3, 7). And to do these things they had to leave the movement or denomination in which they previously were (out of his city). Their services and sacrifices were not in the interests of sectarianism, as were those of the crown-lost princes, but unto the Lord directly (unto the Lord). The period covered by such services and sacrifices was that in which the Greek and Roman Catholic Churches in their clergy (Hophni, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fighter,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the contentiousness of the Greek and Roman clergy) and the Protestant Churches in their clergy (Phinehas, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">brazen mouth,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to their strong teachings) functioned as the subordinates of the crown-lost princes (Eli, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">high,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the exalted position of the crown-lost princes in each of the denominations). Hence this period of service and sacrifice started in the Smyrna period, during which the Greek Catholic Church started and began its further development, and extends up to the present. The sacrifices and services that developed the Parousia Little Flock movement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and the Epiphany Great Company and Youthful Worthy movements take place toward the end of the functioning of the Catholic and Protestant clergy, as will be brought out later. These clergy classes are called priests of the Lord (priests of the Lord), more particularly as referring to their services as the denominational mouthpieces of the nominal church, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as God's mouthpiece,</span><span class="font3"> before 1878, when with the nominal church they ceased being such.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) At each of these periods of service and sacrifice (when the time was that Elkanah offered, 4), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> at the time after the starting and developing of the ten (or twelve) Little Flock movements set in, as each was perverted into a denomination the star-members and their special assistants gave to the truths and to the servants that applied these to the pertinent sectarians (Peninnali) the doctrine (portions) that became the stewardship doctrine of the pertinent denominational group, and thus in all gave such to all the ten (or twelve) denominational groups, both to the greater and stronger (sons) and to the lesser and weaker (daughters). But to the truths that developed the ten (or twelve) Little Flock movements of the Gospel Age and the servants who applied and apply these to the participants in these movements (antitypical Hannah.), the star-members and their special assistants gave at each time of such services and sacrifices more than to antitypical Peninnah (a worthy portion, 5; literally, one of two faces, favors, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font3">while more or less perversions set in the stewardship doctrine, as each denomination received and used its own, the Little Flock movements' developing truths and their servants got not only what the denomination received, but more—all ten [or twelve] truths fiee from the denominational perversions, and such additional truths as were confined to the ten [or twelve] Little Flock movements). But throughout the Age, until the Parousia, antitypical Hannah was not given by God the power to produce a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">permanent</span><span class="font3"> Little Flock movement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(Jehovah had shut up her womb). Antitypical Peninnah (her adversary), by her persecutions of every Little Flock movement which preceded its perversion into a denomination, by her scorning the day of little things, characteristic of every Little Flock movement, by her mocking the Little Flock brethren associated with the Little Flock movements and by her perverting such movements into sectarian systems, sorely distressed antitypical Hannah (provoked her sore, 6), and thus accomplished her design to make antitypical Hannah fret (fret; literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tremble), </span><span class="font3">which certainly occurred (Is. 54: 11, 15-17) , because the Lord did not in the interim between the Harvests prosper antitypical Hannah's movements with permanence (because the Lord had shut up her womb).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) As the star-members, their special helpers cooperaring, served and sacrificed among the nominal people of God (he did so, 7), in one Little Flock movement after another (year by year) the Little Flock servants other than the 70 [35 starmembers and 35 special helpers] co-operated with the latter in such movements (she went up to the house of the Lord). But in each of such movements antitypical Peninnah exercised her opposition to antitypical Hannah (provoked her). This oppositional course caused antitypical Hannah much grief (therefore she wept); and she did not appropriate the blessings that her privileges in those Little Flock movements offered her (did not eat). The starmembers and their special helpers (Elkanah, 8), noting this grief and abstinence from appropriating such blessings on antitypical Hannah's part, inquired the reason. This occurred as troubles involved each of the ten (or twelve) Little Flock movements; for the star-members and their special helpers saw their faithful co-operators' grief, disappointment and failure to count their blessings (why. . . why. . . why). Then they suggested a blessing (am not I better to thee) that was by antitypical Hannah overlooked and that was more valuable than the possession of all ten denominational groups combined (ten sons), possessed by antitypical Peninnali. After the last truth, the one on Chronology given in the Miller movement, had in its easier and harder parts been appropriated (eaten. . . and. . . drunk, 9) by the tenth (or twelfth) denomination (in Shiloh), the Adventists, antitypical Hannah arose from the dust of Babylon (Is. 52: 2), and as a cleansed sanctuary class stood apart from Babylon, yet mingled more or less among the nominal people of God (in Shiloh). Her more or less severed stand was during the exercise of the rule (seat; literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">throne) </span><span class="font3">of the crown-lost princes (Eli, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">high),</span><span class="font3"> who as the crown-lost leaders of the various denominations were in prominence as such at the entrance (post; literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">door post)</span><span class="font3"> of the nominal church (temple of the Lord; the temple proper was not built until about 145 years later, in the times of Solomon; and the temple here referred to was a structure that had been erected in such a way as completely to enclose and cover the tabernacle and hide its exterior from view, even as the true Church was within, and its normal visible parts were hidden from view through its being within, the nominal church up until the Parousia).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) The Little Flock's Truth servants, apart from its then star-member (Bro. Miller) and his special helper (Bro. Wolf of England, or Bro. Hines of America, we are not sure which), in the cleansed sanctuary suffered much distress because their efforts seemed fruitless (she was in bitterness of soul, 10). And what else should they have done than to have repaired to the Throne of Grace (prayed unto the Lord), and poured out in tears and sighs their plaint to the Father of all mercies (wept sore). These in their prayers gave God a solemn promise (vowed a vow, 11), in most intense, most humble and repeated pleadings for pitying consideration (if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thine handmaid), asking to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">be favored with bringing into being a permanent Little Flock movement (wilt give Thine handmaid a man child), and promising to devote it perpetually to the Lord (I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life) and to regard and treat it as an antitypical Nazarite (there shall no razor come upon his head), in allusion to the fact that the movement would be like an antitypical Nazarite, in that in no way would it through unfaithfulness deprive itself or permit itself to be deprived of its special powers as the mouthpiece of the Lord. This prayer was one of act, as well as desire and words, these faithful ones ardently working (which is a prayer of act, as distinct from one of words) to arouse such a movement. This made them also set forth the character that they thought such a movement should have. These ardent prayers, yearnings and teachings (continued praying; literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">multiplied praying,</span><span class="font3"> 12) occasioned the crown-lost leaders to direct special attention to their teachings (Eli marked her mouth). Their speech was most hearty (Hannah, she spake in her heart, 13); and they uttered only doctrines (only her lips moved), but their pertinent doctrines were not understood by the crown-lost princes (voice was not heard); and as a result the latter thought the former were drunken with error (Eli thought she had been drunken). The crown-lost leaders denounced them as errorists (Eli said. . . How long wilt thou be drunken? 14), and exhorted them to give up their errors (put away thy wine from thee). They alluded to their being long drunken, because these yearning souls were recognized by the crown-lost leaders as having been in the Miller movement, which then, between 1846 and 1874, was universally considered by the nominal church as an erroneous movement of fools and fanatics.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) These faithful souls very respectfully denied the charge of being long in error, or of being in error at all (Hannah answered. . . No, my lord, 15). Then they opened their hearts to the crown-lost leaders,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">as hearts sharply pained by sorrow (I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit). Again, they denied that they were cherishing any error (I have drunk neither), small (wine) or great (strong drink). They said that their heart's desires and works were poured out as a prayer before the Lord (but I have poured out my soul before the Lord). They did not desire the crown-lost princes to regard them as evil or worthless, and therefore asked that they do not so regard them (count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[wickedness,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">worthlessness},</span><span class="font3"> 16), and therefore gave a picture of the real condition of their full hearts and words (out of the abundance of my complaint and grief [literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">provocation}</span><span class="font3"> have I spoken), as one in deep need of the Lord's favor and help. We are not to forget that the crown-lost leaders, despite the fact of their loss of their crowns, were earnest, zealous and kindly-disposed consecrated men of God, as this is pictured forth in the reply of Eli, their type (said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition, 17). Indeed, it was quite creditable of their piety and tolerance that they could wish the sorely distressed faithful ones their petition, whose exact nature was unknown to them. They would not perhaps have been so kindly disposed in the matter, had they understood the nature of the prayer; for its answer implied something against them, as recognized leaders of God's people. Their kindly-disposed exhortation (Go in peace) and their good wish (the God of Israel grant thee thy petition) heartened the Little Flock servants (Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight, 18) since the latter highly respected the former, and thus desired their favor; for it is most natural to desire the favor of great ones whom one respects. After these assurances these longing ones (Ps. 107: 5, 9) felt more of resignation, comfort, assurance and peace (went her way, 18). They appropriated to themselves the promises that at that time the Lord was opening up to His Faithful, as they were nearing 1874 (See Antitypical</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">David's First Appearance, El, 507-540), and became full of expectant joy (did eat, and her countenance was no more sad). Hope makes the heart joyous.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) The star-member (Bro. Russell) and his special helpers (the five pilgrims who successively became his special helpers: Bros. Barbour and Paton, Sr. Russell, Bro. McPhail and J.) and the rest of the Little Flock servants entered into the Harvest activity early in the Harvest day (they rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before the Lord, 19). Then they began to give their attention to the Little Flock especially (came to their house to Ramah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[height,</span><span class="font3"> not here Ramathaim, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">double height,</span><span class="font3"> because the antitypes had by now left Babylon, the second of the two heights]). So occupied, Bro. Russell and the five in their succession, on the one hand, and the rest of the Little Flock, on the other hand, became of one heart and mind in the work of producing the Parousia Little Flock movement (Elkanah knew Hannah, his wife), and God remembered their heart's longing prayer, work and vow and granted it in preparing the way for such a movement (the Lord remembered her). In due time, through God's interposition, this movement was brought into being (wherefore. . . she bare a son, 20) and developed into the greatest and only permanent Little Flock movement of the Age. No wonder that antitypical Hannah regarded it as standing for the character and honor of God (called his name Samuel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">name of God,</span><span class="font3"> not as many mistakenly render it, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">heard of God).</span><span class="font3"> It could be so regarded, because it came into being in answer to a prayer that it might exemplify the character of God. and reflect honor upon him (because I have asked him of the Lord). During the Parousia Bro. Russell and the five above-mentioned pilgrims successively (Elkanah, 21) and the rest of God's people in the Truth (and all his house) appeared before the real and nominal people to carry out their consecration and their sacrifice unto the Lord in the Harvest work (went up to offer unto the Lord. . . sacrifice and his vow) in a</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">more or less public manner, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> engaged in work toward the public. But some of the Little Flock devoted their attention to the care of the new ones coming into the Truth for their development unto fitness for the public work (Hannah went not up. . . said. . . not go up, until the child be weaned, 22). After these would develop such unto fitness for public work, they would with such partake in that form of service (I will bring him. . . before the Lord, and there abide for ever, continually). Thus the two sides of the Harvest work are brought to our attention: (1) that toward the public; and (2) that toward the brethren. Bro. Russell and the five above-mentioned pilgrims successively were agreed to this course on antitypical Hannah's part (Elkanah. . . said. . . Do what seemeth thee good. . . the Lord establish His word, 23).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) Thus the Little Flock servants in their capacity of ministering to the babes nourished these with the sincere milk of the Word, that they might grow thereby unto fitness of entering the sphere of work toward the public as a part of the Parousia Little Flock movement (gave her son suck), and continued to prepare them for such work until they were fit for it (until she weaned him, which in Oriental countries does not occur with a first-born until the child is five years old). After such servants of the Truth had well prepared the Little Flock members for the public Harvest work (had weaned him, 24), they brought those whom they had prepared for such a service (took him up with her. . . unto the house of the Lord in Shiloh) before the public, for these to engage in that service. They brought them in faith in the merit of Christ as sufficient to satisfy God's justice (one of the bullocks), as that which manifested God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice on behalf of the Church (the second bullock) and as that which makes the Church's sacrifice and vows acceptable to God (the third bullock). They appeared, preaching the harder things of the Truth (one ephah of flour) and the simpler things</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of the Truth (bottle of wine) to the public. They did it while their proteges were more or less immature, being desirous of arousing their zeal for service as early as possible (the child was young). They offered the sacrifice of faith in the merit of Christ as sufficient for the three things typed by the three bullocks (slew a bullock, 25). And by their advancing their proteges into public service, some as pilgrims and auxiliary pilgrims, sometimes aptly referred to as &quot;pilgrim-ettes,&quot; some as colporteurs and sharpshooters, some as volunteers, some as newspaper workers, some as Bible House workers, some as extension workers, some as Photo-Drama workers, they brought these to the attention of the crown-lost leaders by leading them into the public work (brought the child to Eli, 25).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) In the stress of opposition, which, however, is not here indicated, but of which the Harvest history is full, and which came to the Little Flock as servants of the Truth, it became necessary that they should own antitypical Samuel as their proteges, as they brought them forward to the service. The same class, though not necessarily the same individuals, that prayed for antitypical Samuel presented them before the Lord and acknowledged them as their proteges before the crown-lost princes. This acknowledgment was very politely and very emphatically made (Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, 26). Then they identified themselves as of the same class as from 1846 to 1874 ardently pleaded with God (praying unto the Lord) for the production and development of a permanent Little Flock Movement, and as having done so while in more or less fellowship with the crown-lost princes (I am the woman that stood by thee). They openly acknowledged that they had prayed for the Samuel movement, which was now an accomplished fact (For this child I prayed, 27). In the presence of the fact that the Samuel movement was in existence and active, they could confidently affirm that the Lord had graciously granted the petition (the Lord hath given me my petition).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This they told as a testimony to the fact that God grants the prayers of His faithful people (which I asked of Him). They then stated the fact of the vow which they had made in connection with the said petition, and the fact that they were now fulfilling that vow (I have lent him to the Lord, 28—a wrong translation; Dr. Young renders it better: Also I have caused him to be asked for Jehovah ['s use] i.e., my heart impelled me to pray for him, not in my own interests, but in those of the Lord). They likewise stated that the vow was not one binding him to the Lord for a little while, but perpetually (as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord; literally, all the days that he shall be he was prayed for in the Lord's interests). V. 28 shows that the Samuel class heartily joined in co-operation to realize antitypical Hannah's intentions when she made the vow; for he entered into the service of the Lord before the nominal people of God, /. e., served in the work toward the public, as that part of the harvest history abundantly proves (And he [Samuel, not Eli, is the one here spoken of] worshiped the Lord there).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) It would be in place in discussing 1 Sam. 1 and 2 to set forth a comparison and a contrast between antitypical Sarah, Rachel and Hannah: As to the truths of which they are the expression, antitypical Sarah refers to those only that develop The Christ; antitypical Rachel, those that develop the Christ and the Great Company; and antitypical Hannah, those that develop the Christ, the Great Company and the Youthful Worthies, as we will prove of her when explaining 1 Sam. 2: 21. As to the personal parts of these three antitypes, the appliers of these truths, antitypical Sarah includes the Ancient Worthies from Abraham to John the Baptist (yea, we may from an anticipatorial standpoint begin them with Abel) and the Christ class in their capacities of developing the Christ class; antitypical Rachel, the Ancient Worthies, the Christ class in its capacity of developing the Christ, and the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Ancient Worthies, the Christ class and the Great Company in their capacity of developing the Great Company; and antitypical Hannah, the Ancient Worthies, the Christ in their capacity of developing the Christ, the Ancient Worthies, the Christ and the Great Company in their capacities of developing the Great Company, and the Ancient Worthies, the Christ, the Great Company and the Youthful Worthies in their capacities of developing the Youthful Worthies. In point of time of operation, antitypical Sarah is active from Abel on until the Little Flock leaves the world; antitypical Rachel from Abel's time until the Great Company leaves the world; and antitypical Hannah, from Abel's time until the Youthful Worthies leave the world. In time of producing their children, antitypical Sarah was active from Jordan until the Church leaves the world; antitypical Rachel, the same period for The Christ, and for the Great Company as individuals, from shortly after Pentecost onward, and as a class from Nov. 25, 1916—Jan. 14, 1917, onward until the Great Company leaves the world; antitypical Hannah, the same periods for The Christ and the Great Company respectively and for the Youthful Worthies as individuals, from Oct., 1881, onward to Sept. 16, 1914, and as a class from Sept. 16, 1914, onward until they leave the world finally. In point of ceasing to operate, antitypical Sarah operates until the last member of The Christ leaves the world; antitypical Rachel, the same plus until the last Great Company member leaves the world; and antitypical Hannah, the same plus until the last of the Youthful Worthies leaves the world. Antitypical Sarah is the least inclusive, antitypical Rachel is more so, and antitypical Hannah is the most so of these three. What great truths are here seen!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) Having finished the discussion of 1 Sam. 1, we will proceed to study 1 Sam. 2. It continues the viewpoint set forth in Chapter I. Let us remember that Hannah as the mother of Samuel types the Christ features of the Oathbound Covenant in its personal</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">parts, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Little Flock brethren in ministering the Oathbound promises in the development of their less mature Little Flock brethren into the Harvest Movement. Their success in such work and its accompanying and resulting privileges made them declare, with ardent yearnings (prayed, and said, 1), the antitype of vs. 1-10, which, analysis will show, features salient parts of the Harvest message from the standpoint of antitypical Hannah's relations to them. With this thought in mind, we will now study the antitypes of vs. 1-10, which are very helpfully rendered by Rotherham, whom, with a few exceptions, we will quote for this section. Certainly these Little Flock developers of their less mature brethren unto participation in the Harvest work were by their success therein brought to the very heights of joy at the privilege that they had in their consecrated course (My heart hath leaped for joy in Yahveh, 1); because to arouse such a (permanent) movement had been the desire of such from early in the Smyrna period, at whose start the Little Flock movement of the Jewish Harvest ceased. They exulted in the fact that the Truth and its arrangements as the power (horn) of God's people, restored during the Harvest, had been set on high by God (is exalted by Yahveh) before the nations, through their being rescued from their creedal corruptions and set forth with unanswerable power, transparent clearness and glorious victory over error. This was so because the utterances (mouth) of such servants of the Oath-bound Covenant were so greatly enlarged (is opened wide), since their minds comprehended the heights and depths, the lengths and breadths of the Divine Plan of the Ages, and this enabled them to overthrow in argument all of their adversaries (Is. 54: 17; Luke 21: 15; over my foes), who, though many, wise, mighty and noble (1 Cor. 1: 26-28), were unable to meet the Truth servants' attacks on their errors and their defenses of the Truth. Truly, the joy of the Lord proved to be their strength (Neh. 8: 10); for the Truth, which</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sets forth the plan of salvation (in Thy salvation) from various standpoints: the high calling, restitution, future probation, the first and second hells, the ransom, God's perfect character, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> gave these such joy as strengthened them in their fight for the Truth and against the error. No wonder that they were so j oyful!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(13) As the most important feature of the Harvest message, they set forth the perfection of God's Person, Character, Word and Works, as being superior to the corresponding things in all others (There is none holy like Yahveh, 2). They stressed the sole Deity of the Father against the doctrine of the trinity (Nay, there is none except Thee!). And in so doing they stressed His superiority in these four, as well as in all other good respects, even over those of His Only Begotten, let alone over those of all who are that Son's inferiors (nor is there a rock like our God). Then turning to antitypical Peninnah and her children (the nominal-church leaders and denominations), these Truth servants, as the mother of the Little Flock Parousia movement, reminding them of their many and proud teachings, exhorted against their continuance therein (Do not multiply words, so loftily, loftily, 3), as they had done in their past teaching and persecuting course. Moreover, they rebuked their Parousia boasting and arrogance (Rev. 3: 17), and exhorted them to desist therefrom, especially in their mouthpieces (nor let arrogance proceed from your mouth). The reasons for such exhortations are plain—God alone is the God of true knowledge (for a God of knowledge is Yahveh) and is powerfully accomplishing His plans and purposes for His own glory alone, and certainly not for that of the arrogant and haughty antitypical Peninnah and her children (and for Himself are great doings made firm). Another feature of the Harvest message did the developers of the Little Flock into the Harvest Movement proclaim: the breaking up of the creeds (bows ... are broken, 4) as the means whereby the great theologians (mighty) of the nominal church shot</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">forth their sharp sayings and teachings, as figurative arrows, at their enemies. It was the Truth, as a mighty sword (Eph. 6: 17), that broke up these bows of the mighty, and it did this after the Harvest warriors girded it on, and used it as their weapon of offense, though before so doing they were, and were regarded as the stumbling and fainting ones (while the fainting ones are girded with strength). Yea, the Harvest Truth was their strong, sharp and powerful sword (Heb. 4: 12), whereby they utterly overthrew the creeds.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) Another part of the Harvest message proclaimed by the developers of the Little Flock into the Parousia Movement was this: Members of the nominal church who had boasted that they were rich and increased in goods and had need of nothing (Rev. 3:17; thus were &quot;the sated&quot; full, 5) had to hire themselves out to the Truth people to obtain the Truth as the life-sustaining bread (have for bread taken hire), while the Little Flock, which before the Harvest had been hungry for the Truth and fainted at its lack (Ps. 107: 5), were during the Harvest made to cease from their hunger and faintness (but the famished have left off [their hunger and weakness]), and become satisfied with the goodness of the Truth (Ps. 107: 9). As a result antitypical Hannah became the mother of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">perfect</span><span class="font3"> (seven) Parousia Movement (the barren hath bome seven). On the contrary, antitypical Peninnah, the nominal-church developers, who produced the ten [or twelve] denominations (many sons) of Christendom, waxed fainter and fainter during the Parousia (languisheth). Additional parts of antitypical Hannah's Parousia message were the curse, the death state and the resurrection (Yahveh killeth, exacts the death penalty, as the curse, through the dying process), but in the Millennial morning will bring back the dead, some to the life resurrection, others to the judgment resurrection (Yahveh doth kill and make alive; causeth to go down to sheol [the death state] and bringeth up,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">6). Still another part of the Harvest message did antitypical Hannah proclaim, according to v. 7: Yahveh certainly made the nominal people of God poor during the Parousia (Yahveh maketh poor, 7); for He divested them of mouthpieceship for Him to the world, divested them more and more of the little Truth and Truth arrangements that they had had, took away the tentative robe of righteousness that they had had, bereaved them of the little peace, joy and other graces that they had had, stripped them of their various prerogatives that they once had as His nominal people, thus leaving them wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked (Rev. 3: 17). On the other hand, antitypical Hannah proclaimed that the Little Flock was enriched (and enricheth) by God through His giving it the Divine Truth as figurative silver and gold, the graces as precious stones, the white raiment of Christ's righteousness as her glorious dress and the qualities of humility, meekness, Truth-hunger, honesty and holiness as an eyesalve for anoinring her eyes (Rev. 3: 18). Yea, theirs were the true riches!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) Moreover, antitypical Hannah then proclaimed the fact that Yahveh abased the proud and exalted the humble (1 Pet. 5: 5, 6; Jas. 4: 6; layeth low, yea, exalteth). How manifest this is in the abasement of the great in the nominal church during the Parousia, and will be yet more so in the Epiphany, especially in Armageddon, and mostly so in the Kingdom; and in the exaltations of the Little Flock in the Parousia, which will yet be more manifest in the Epiphany, and mostly so in the Basileia, the Kingdom. The exposition of both clauses of v. 7 shows this of both classes in the Parousia and the Epiphany. Yea, hath not God raised up the poor, the humble, from the dust of error (Is. 52: 2), (raiseth from the dust) in which beside Babylon's rivers they sat down and wept when they remembered Zion (Ps. 137: 1) , to become enriched Little Flock members (8)? Yea, hath not God uplifted the needy, from the dunghill of sin, to become Little Flock</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">members? And by so doing, hath He not give them a dwelling with nobles, among God's real people? And did He not do this to prepare them to be seated with our Lord upon His Millennial throne (Rev. 3: 21), as saith v. 8, as joint-heirs of His (Rom. 8: 17; 2 Tim. 2: 12)? These will be made God's pillars of the new earth (to Yahveh belong the pillars of the earth), and as such they will be the foundations of the world to come, made such by God Himself (He setteth thereon the world—symbolic heavens and earth). V. 8 beautifully prophesies in typical form the Parousia preaching of antitypical Hannah with respect to the thought that the gracious Father condescends to uplift the poor and needy Little Flock to the highest spiritual privileges during their stay in the flesh, and thus prepares them to become His Kingdom, whereby He will establish among the children of men a new earth in which will dwell righteousness (2 Pet. 3:13) unsullied by evil.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(16) V. 9 contains another part of the Parousia message of antitypical Hannah, and that in three parts: (1) that she would proclaim God's watchcare over the feet-member saints, which word is in the A. V. used to translate a word that means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">loving ones—</span><span class="font3">most exact description of saints, whose highest quality, like God's highest quality, is disinterested love. Ps. 91 most beautifully describes this quality as theirs and God's provisions for their watchcare during the Parousia and Epiphany (the feet of His loving ones He doth guard); (2) that she would proclaim God's judgment on the wicked, the Second Deathers, as one that remands them in this life into outer darkness and after this life into the perpetual darkness of Gehenna (Jude 13; but the wicked in darkness shall be silent); and (3) that she would proclaim the Truth that not by human but by Divine strength will one prove to be an overcomer (Zech. 4: 6; for by strength shall no man prevail). Finally, as indicated in v.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">10, antitypical Hannah proclaimed five other parts in God's great</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Parousia works: (1) that God would defeat and shatter in utmost confusion those who oppose Him, who are Satan and his legions of fallen angels, the kings and judges of the earth in church; state, aristocracy and labor and their supporters and the sifters and siftlings (as for Yahveh, they shall be shattered who contend with Him); (2) that through the arising New Heavens (the Christ during the Parousia beyond the vail, taking their great power and reigning) against those who contend with Him will He stir up controversies that will end disastrously for such opposers (against them by the heavens will He thunder); (3) that He through the great tribulation will sorely stripe the human family, which must undergo this striping to prepare them to receive meekly the Kingdom of God, which they had refused to receive meekly at the ministry of moral suasion (Yahveh will judge the ends of the earth); (4) that God would give The Christ all power and authority as His Vicegerental King to reign Millennially over mankind and the earth (and giveth strength to His King); and (5) that God would exalt the power of His Christ by giving Him the highest success and honor 'through His reign as King and ministry as Priest (and exalt the hom of His Anointed One). If now in the light of the foregoing interpretation we review vs. 1-10, we will all easily recognize that Hannah's prayer and speech types, as we said at the outstart of the exposition of this section, the proclamations, with ardent yearnings, made by the Little Flock developers of antitypical Samuel during the Parousia. Praised be the Lord!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) After introducing the Little Flock brethren as the Parousia Movement in its various members into the public service (1: 26-28) Bro. Russell and the said five pilgrims successively gave their attention to the higher features of the Truth service in helping the brethren, as well as themselves, to attain higher character development (Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, 11). And the Little Flock Movement, the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Parousia Movement, attended to the public service of the Truth in pilgrim, colporteur, volunteer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> work, in such a manner as was in the presence of, and as brought them to the attention of, the crown-lost leaders (and the child [better here, the youth] did minister unto the Lord before Eli, the priest). The Catholic and the Protestant denominations in their clergy (sons of Eli, 12), as classes, with individual exceptions, were to the Lord during the Parousia unprofitable, worthless and wicked (sons of Belial, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">worthlessness, wickedness, unprofitableness).</span><span class="font3"> They did not appreciate (know) the Lord in His person, character, word and works. Instead of seeking to serve the Lord wholeheartedly, they used their positions for their personal advantage, for the following was their manner of procedure (the priests' [not priest's] custom with the people was that, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> 13): They by their agents (the priest's servant) used the teachings as to doctrine, organization and practice (fleshhook of three teeth) as a means of their work (hand) to draw out of the true priesthood's doctrinal (pan), refutative (kettle), correctional (caldron) and ethical (pot) teachings many and large parts of the consecrators' privileges as sacrificers connected with these four forms of teachings for their own personal, selfish aggrandizement, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the very benefits that the consecrators should have drawn out of their services to themselves the clergy appropriated to themselves exclusively. This they did, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., </span><span class="font3">by exclusively appropriating to themselves the office of being priests, which all the consecrators were, and all the priestly privileges, which all the consecrators should have had; for they claimed them as their own exclusively. In the Catholic churches this &quot;custom&quot; of exacting the &quot;benefit of the clergy&quot; has been reduced to a business of vast classifications, every department drawing to the clergy from the consecrators what is the latter's. Thus the Catholic and Protestant denominations in their clergy have robbed God's people, whom &quot;the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">clergy&quot; have been pleased to call &quot;the laity,&quot; of their sacrificial privileges and have enriched themselves thereby, as to prerogatives belonging to the true priesthood (1 Pet. 2: 5, 9). This was the universal custom throughout Catholicism and in most of Protestantism (So they did in Shiloh unto all Israelites that came thither). This is a sad state of things.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(18) But the Catholic and Protestant clergy's &quot;custom&quot; contained in it something worse than robbing God's priesthood of their privileges connected with their sacrifices: They have robbed God of His part of the sacrifice. The choice part of a real sacrifice is the love (fat, 15) that should prompt and accompany the sacrifice. This is the particular thing offered as a sweet savor to God in the services of an antitypical sacrifice (burnt; literally, make perfume with). This precedes the privileges (sodden flesh) that the sacrifices receive as consecrators, even as in the type the fat was burned before the flesh was sodden. But through their agencies (priest's servant) the Catholic and Protestant denominations in their clergy demanded what they considered their part in the sacrifice before (raw flesh; not sodden flesh) the sacrificer as such would get his privileges, and also before God would get the portions of the sacrifices belonging to Him. That is, these clerics took to themselves, for themselves, honors, riches, powers, influence, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> that the sacrificers should bring to God. Hence they have become money-lovers, popularity-lovers, honor-lovers, influence-lovers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> using the opportunities of their offices for self-aggrandizement instead of to the glory of God. To them their office is a business, out of which every earthly advantage that they can get they seek to draw to themselves. Thus instead of God's getting the benefits of the consecrators' sacrifices the denominations in their clergy have drawn these to themselves. This has made them lovers of ease, luxury, fame, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> The prophets severely denounce them for this course (Mal. 1: 6—2: 10;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Is. 56: 10-12). And</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">when the consecrators would desire and work otherwise (If any man said. . . Let them not fail to bum the fat presently [now], 16) they were persecuted by the clergy, who used force to exact for their own personal gain what through the sacrifices of God's people should have gone to the advancement of God's cause (If not, I will take it by force). Thus they forced the faithful to give up the Divinely profitable parts of their sacrifices, by imprisonment, restraint, slander, riots, arrests, boycottings, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> Yea, earlier than the Parousia they used all sorts of means of torture and death in what actually was taking away from God the fruits of the sacrifices of God's people. And the Parousia clergy, acting out the same principles, though in more attenuated forms, are partakers of their earlier living persecuting brethren's sins. By these courses they greatly sinned against the real priesthood and against God in matters pertaining to God (Wherefore the sin of the young men [Hophni and Phinehas] was very great before the Lord, 17). For their pertinent evils, exposed to the public, turned many into atheists, agnostics, heathen, infidels, worldlings, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> all of whom despised the religious life, deeming it hypocrisy; especially did they do this with the more prominent of the people (therefore men [literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font3">men,—the prominent ones] abhorred the offering of the Lord). Thus it is true that Churchianity and the clergy have become a stench in the nostrils of ever-increasing multitudes, especially of the more prominent people throughout Christendom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Little Flock (Samuel) engaged in the special Parousia work, was very actively engaged (ministered) in the Parousia work of the Lord (before the Lord). They stood girded with the Truth, centered in the Abrahamic and New Covenants, i.e., they had the Truth and were devoted to its service (Eph. 6: 14; girded with a linen ephod). The ephod was worn only by priests (18, 28) or by those who had a priestly character, like David (2 Sam. 6: 14), typing a priest. Samuel was not of the priestly family, but belonged to the tribe of Ephraim (1: 1). But being a Nazante, and devoted for his whole life to God's service (1: 11), he had a priestly character, typing the Little Flock, at times as a whole, and at times in its special leaders. The Little Flock Truth servants (his mother, 19), in their capacity of developing their Little Flock brethren, gave the latter (him) official powers (little coat), by giving them added truths and the ability and opportunities to serve them, especially amid the various Parousia call and sifting periods (brought it to him from year to year), at which times such Truth servants specially served in connection with Bro. Russell and the pertinent one of the said five pilgrims (when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice). As all these servants of the Truth were thus ministering in such Parousia call and sifting periods, the crown-lost leaders did them much good (Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, 20), not by word but by deed, and that as a return for their devotion in giving antitypical Samuel to the Lord; for these ministered to antitypical Elkanah and Hannah (the Lord give thee seed of this woman) in that they brought people to consecration, some of whom became new creatures, others of whom became Youthful Worthies; and of the former the bulk apparently became crown-losers. We say this because the said seed given Elkanah by Hannah types the Great Company in its three main divisions and the Youthful Worthies in their two main divisions (21). This blessing was partly by antitypical</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Eli brought into being as symbolic begettals, in part during the Parousia, but the births take place during the Epiphany, not during the Parousia, so far as these two as classes are concerned, though there were individual crown-losers and Youthful Worthies during the Parousia. After each call and sifting period of service, Bro. Russell, the pertinent one of the said five pilgrims and the rest of the Truth servants betook themselves to the special high calling matters (they went to their own home).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) After the Little Flock Movement—the Parousia Movement—was completed, in 1914, the Lord blessed in the Epiphany antitypical Elkanah (who was first, for 2-1/12 years, the Parousia messenger and the last of the five said pilgrims, thereafter the Epiphany messenger) and antitypical Hannah (now the Parousia and Epiphany Truth and the other servants of the Parousia and Epiphany Truth) with fruitfulness (the Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived, 21). By the time this fruitfulness will become the antitype of the finished picture there will be born three clean general Great Company and two clean general Youthful Worthy groups (and bare three sons and two daughters). Thus here we learn that Hannah in the widest sense of the type of the Gospel-Age elects' mother pictures forth all of the Gospel-Age applications of the Oath-bound Covenant (Gen. 22: 16-18), with their implied truths and arrangements, and the servants who have applied them to the development of the three general classes of the GospelAge elect. It will be noted that, as the mother of the Christ class, antitypical Hannah is the same as antitypical Sarah and Rachel as mother of antitypical Joseph, that as the mother of the Great Company she is the same as antitypical Rachel as mother of antitypical Benjamin, the cleansed Great Company as a whole, while Hannah's three sons in contrast with Samuel represent the cleansed Great Company in its three main groups, corresponding to the Gershonite, Merarite and Kohathite</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Levites. Hannah alone of these three mothers types the mother of the Youthful Worthies, and that in their two divisions, (two daughters) corresponding to the Libnite and Shimite Gershonites. As yet we do not know it; but there may be a mother of four sons used in the Bible to type the Oath-bound Covenant as the mother of the four special elect-classes—the Ancient Worthies, the Little Flock, the Great Company and the Youthful Worthies. If so, in due time the Lord will reveal this to us. And since in a certain sense (Rom. 11: 29) Fleshly Israel is an elect people of God and is a part of the seed in the Oath-bound Covenant, as also are the persevering of the tentatively justified, there may be a mother of five or six used in the Bible to picture these together with the four special elect classes, as the five or six class-children of the Oath-bound Covenant. If there, the Lord will reveal it to us.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(21) The time of the first Samuel antitypes (the Parousia) was late in the long ministry of the crown-lost leaders (Now Eli was very old, 22). These during the Parousia mainly and partly in the Epiphany have learned of the great wickedness of the Catholic and Protestant churches in their clergy (and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel) in the two forms of robbing God's consecrators of their privileges as such, and God of the benefits of the sacrifices of His people. Another evil they also learned of these clerics: that they were living in unclean, defiling relations with the twelve large denominations and with their almost innumerable sects (lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation). These unclean and defiling relations on the clergy's part consisted of the false doctrines, organizations, ethics, discipline and other arrangements that they foisted upon these denominations and sects, as well as the sifting errors and arrangements of the Parousia and Epiphany, with which these defiled such denominations and sects. It was primarily from the Parousia and Epiphany Truth servants' exposures</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that antitypical Eli first learned of them; then from their observations and the complaints of denominational and sectarian members who also protested against these symbolic fornications and adulteries. These crown-lost leaders protested to the clergy against such evils, as can be seen in the protests against such evils made by evangelists, like Moody, Small, Jones, Booth, Sunday, Gipsy Smith, Biederwolf, Gaebelein, Torrey, Grey, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> and pastors, like Pearson, Gregory, Meyer, Gordon, Spurgeon, Parker, Farrar, Morgan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc.</span><span class="font3"> (He said unto them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people, 23); but the remonstrance was feeble.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) Those of our readers who attended, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> the meetings of Billy Sunday, will recall how to their faces he excoriated for their evils the ministers who were seated on the platform from which he was speaking! This is an illustration of the antitype of vs. 23-25. Certainly the pertinent reports against the clergy were no good thing (It is no good report that I hear, 24). Certainly the clergy by these deeds caused the Lord's people to transgress (ye make the Lord's people to transgress). They showed these recalcitrant clerics that for humans' sin against fellow humans, they might be entreated for (not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">judged,</span><span class="font3"> as the A. V. gives it) by the judge; but if one sin deliberately against the Lord, none could entreat successfully for him (if one man sin . . . ; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? 25). So far as the rebukes that these crown-lost leaders administered to the wicked clergy are concerned, this must be said: They were neither vigorous enough (my sons, 24) nor were they accompanied with as strenuous methods at suppression as the evils deserved, even as Eli in the type was neither severe enough in his rebukes nor strenuous enough in his measures to suppress the evils and evil-doers in their evils. Both in type and antitype the matter was allowed to go on with nothing more than feeble remonstrances. And, of course, these hardened sinners, not subjected to the suppressive measures for which their misconduct called, but let go with too tender rebukes, which their hardened consciences quietly shed, as a duck would shed water from its back, went on in their evil ways, in both the type and the antitype. Too much leniency with evildoers in one in an executive position encourage them in their wrong ways. But in both the type and the antitype their impenitence was arousing the Lord to execute retribution upon them—a cutting off of life in the type, and in the antitype a cutting off from their office and of life, combined with the destruction of Catholicism and Protestantism as institutions in Armageddon (therefore [not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">because]</span><span class="font3"> the Lord would slay them). In contrast with the course of the Catholic and Protestant clergy, antitypical Samuel progressed and developed very well (And the youth [not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">child\</span><span class="font3"> grew on,—literally, went and became large, Ze., grew to full stature) and was recognized as good, both by the Lord and by men (Luke 2: 52; and was in favor [literally, was good] both with the Lord and also with men, 26). We saw this fulfilled.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) Bros. Storrs, Stetson and Russell and the said five pilgrims in their succession (there came a man of God unto Eli, 27) appeared before these crown-lost leaders with a message denouncing the clergy for the above-mentioned wickedness, and the crown-lost leaders for tolerating them, and forecasting condign punishment, as those who heard these and read their writings know that they frequently spoke and wrote in this vein. They came as a messenger of God, z.e., with Bible passage as giving them the contents of their rebukes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (Thus saith the Lord). They raised the question in the crown-lost leaders' minds by their pertinent speeches and writings: Did God reveal Himself to the Jewish Harvest Christians as to members of Christs house while they were involved in Satan's empire in its Romanempire phase (Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Egypt in Pharaoh's house)? The answer, of course, is, Yes; for God did then manifest Himself to His Jewish Harvest priests as these were made underpriests in the Christ priesthood. Then these brothers' speeches and writings raised another question in the minds of the crown-lost leaders: Did God choose Jesus Christ (choose him, typical Aaron, 28) from among all God's people (out of all the tribes of Israel) to be the Church's High Priest (to be My priest), to bring the antitypical Bullock and Goat as the true sin-offerings (to offer upon Mine altar), to yield the odor of a sweet smell in the graces of the Spirit (to burn incense), to administer the Truth, especially on the two great covenants, as God's Representative (to wear an ephod)? Again the answer is, Yes. Then, through their speeches and writings, they raised a third question in the minds of the crown-lost leaders: Did God arrange for the Gospel-Age priesthood as the house of Christ to get a sufficiency for their earthly needs from certain features of the sacrifices of the consecrators (Did I give unto the house of thy father [Aaron] all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel)? Again the answer is, Yes; for the Lord ordained that they that preach the Gospel should also live by the Gospel (1 Cor. 9: 14). Thus without their robbing the consecrated of their privileges and God of His parts in the sacrifice and thus His honor, the &quot;clergy&quot; were sufficiently provided for as to their earthly needs; and therefore there was no call for them to do the evils above-mentioned. Therefore, through Bros. Storrs', Stetson's and Russell's and the five others' speeches and writings God demanded of the Catholic and Protestant denominations in their clergy why they opposed the plain intent of the sin-offerings (kick ye at My sacrifice, 29) and the preachings (offering; literally, meat offering), that God had charged in His Temple (which I have commanded in My habitation), by their perversions, misuses, errors, attacks on the Truth and selfaggrandizements (make</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">yourselves fat), in putting their interests above those of the consecrators and of God (with the chiefest of all the offerings [meat offerings] of Israel My people). Not only did God through these brothers make this demand; but He also blamed the crown-lost leaders for tolerating the situation, which was an actual honoting of denominations in their clergy above God (and honorest thy sons above Me).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) Having through these brothers' speeches and writings pointed out the sins of the clergy and the wrong of the easygoing attitude of the crown-lost leaders toward these sins and sinners, God by the same agents and means proceeds to announce from the quoted Scripture passage (Wherefore the Lord God of Israel saith, 30) the retribution that is to come upon all the guilty. The first of these pieces of retribution was the revocation of a promise long kept (forever, age-lasting), despite the wrongs done by the beneficiaries of the promise: the office of being the leaders of God's people would not be continued with the clergy and the crown-lost leaders (Be it far from Me). This was announced by the above-mentioned brothers, in telling how antitypical Saul would be rejected as leader of God's people, and by Bro. Russell and the said five pilgrims in their succession, announcing that Babylon was cast off from mouthpieceship in 1878. The second piece of retribution would be that the clergy and the crown-lost leaders who failed to honor God would fall into disrepute. This has been increasingly going into fulfilment, and will finally eventuate in their becoming a stench in everybody's nostrils (they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed). On the other hand, God has been honoting His Parousia and Epiphany priesthood, because they have honored Him (them that honor Me I will honor). The third piece of retribution would be that the strength (arm, 31) of the crown-lost leaders and that of Christ's nominal church and its clergy (the arm of thy father's house) would be taken away.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This was fulfilled when God forsook antitypical Saul (crown-lost princes) and cast off Babylon and her clergy (will cut off). The fourth piece of retribution would be that the clergy would soon be cut off in the great tribulation, especially in its Armageddon feature (there shall not be an old man in thine house). The fifth piece of retribution would be that the crown-lost leaders would see an enemy, Bro. Russell as their successor, antitypical of David, whom Saul counted an enemy, as Saul's successor (thou shalt see an enemy in My habitation, 32), enjoying the Truth and its Spirit as the real wealth of God's people (in all the wealth which God shall give Israel). This would spell the speedy overthrow of the clergy (there shall not be an old man in thine house forever, for long). The sixth piece of retribution would be that those who would remain in the true priesthood would depart (man of thine whom I shall not cut off from Mine altar, 33) from among the clergy; and this would be by their coming into, and ministering with the Parousia Truth; they would by their refutation of the errors of the crown-lost leaders and the unfaithful clergy gradually blind the insight of the crown-lost leaders to what Truth they had (to consume thine eyes), and would by turning away ever-increasing numbers from the crown-lost leaders and the unfaithful clergy greatly grieve them (to grieve thine heart). This is also given as a sign of the near approach of the overthrow of the crown-lost leaders and the unfaithful clergy (and all the increase . . . shall die in the flower of their age).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(25) Then the Lord through the above-mentioned brothers pointed out a sign to the crown-lost leaders: that as classes the Catholic and Protestant denominations in their clergy would die as mouthpieces of the Lord, which was from 1878 onward (Is. 65: 11-15; Jer. 25: 36-38); and as individuals the unfaithful clergy would all be slain (Is. 65: 12; Jer. 25: 34, 35), especially during Armageddon (this. . . sign unto thee . . . thy two sons ... in one day . . . die, 34). To the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">crown-losers this would be a sign in two senses, corresponding to the two senses in which the sentence would fulfill: (1) The clergy going into increasing error and making increasing attacks on various phases of Bible Truth from 1878 onward would be giving evidence to the crown-lost leaders that they were cut off from all mouthpieceship for the Lord. This is a secondary application of the passage. (2) As the primary application of the passage, the clergy would be literally slain in their non-Spirit-begotten members, their Spirit-begotten members being counted either among the crown-lost leaders, whose cleansed members will later be slain, or the hierarchy and uncleansed clerics who will be slain and be Second Deathers. But all of these new creatures who will survive as such until Armageddon will live long enough to see at least the bulk of the rest of the clergy slain in Armageddon, as Eli in the type lived to learn of the death of Hophni and Phinehas (4: 12-18). Then God proceeded to tell, through the above-mentioned brothers, that He would in Bro. Russell establish a wise and faithful stewardly priest (Matt. 24: 45-47; Luke 12: 42-44; Num. 25: 10-13; I will raise Me up a faithful priest, 35), who would fulfill all the Lord's good pleasure in the exercise of his stewardly priestly office (that shall do according to that which is in Mine heart and mind). To that faithful and wise servant God would build up a faithful priesthood—the Parousia priesthood—as the household over which he would be placed as their leader under Christ in the Parousia priestly work (Num. 25: 13; and I will build him a sure [faithful] house). He as that servant would be faithful as Jesus' special eye, hand and mouth unto the end of his ministry (and he shall walk before Mine Anointed [Jesus] forever, [unto a completion]). And, finally, God affirmed that every true priest (every one that is left in thine house, 36) of those under the charge of the crown-lost leaders, leaving the nominal church, and coming into the Truth, would humbly (come and crouch to him)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">apply to that wise and faithful servant (1) for each piece of Truth (a piece of silver) and food for heart and mind (a morsel of bread), and (2) for opportunities and positions of service (Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices), that they might appropriate the privileges of these to their sustenance (that I may eat a piece of bread). This ends the forecasts of the Lord through the above-mentioned brothers; and we are witnesses of the fulfillments of most of them, whose fulfillments are a proof to us that the rest will fulfill in due time, which our God guarantees.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(26) Our study of Samuel, type and antitype, now brings us to 1 Sam. 3 and 4. It will be recalled that we remarked in the opening part of our previous study that the antitypes of 1 Sam. 1—8 do not follow one another in chronological succession, as the development of one subject. While there was such a chronological sequence in 1 Sam. 1 and 2, our study of these two chapters brought us to a full conclusion of the line of thought in the antitype of those two chapters. Our study of 1 Sam. 3 and 4 will take up a somewhat different phase of the activities of the Little Flock in relation to certain events forecast in 1 Sam. 2: 27-36;. for in 1 Sam. 3 and 4 Samuel does not represent the Little Flock Parousia movement, but the Little Flock itself in part as in Babylon from after 1846 until after 1897, and then as the Little Flock in the rest of the Parousia and in part of the Epiphany in the Truth movement as such. Thus the viewpoint as to antitypical Samuel, though somewhat related to, is somewhat different in 1 Sam. 3 and 4 from that of him as presented in 1 Sam. 1 and 2. As we study the Samuel picture further, we will find still other viewpoints of antitypical Samuel presented to us; for in most of the later pictures of him we will find him typing Little Flock leaders mainly, as we have already seen this in our study of 1 Sam. 16, as he there acts in connection with antitypical David's first appearance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">We make these remarks the better to enable our dear readers to see clearness in our study.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(27) The opening statement of 1 Sam. 3 proves that the class and time of the antitype of v. 1 could not be the Truth section of the Little Flock in the Parousia and the Epiphany, because to it during the Parousia and the Epiphany the Word of the Lord was not rare, scarce (precious, 1); for never, not even in the Jewish Harvest, was the Truth (the Word of the Lord) more abundant to the Little Flock than during the Gospel Harvest. Nor can we say that among those of the brethren who were in the part of the cleansed Sanctuary separate from Babylon the Truth was rare or scarce, though, of course, it was not so abundant with the Little Flock in the Truth as during the Parousia and Epiphany. The language of v. 1 rather seems to fit the Little Flock's condition in its members who remained in Babylon during the time between 1846 and 1897; for during that time very little Truth came to that part of the Little Flock. The condition of the Little Flock during that time could properly be described as one in which it served (ministered unto, 1) the Lord before Eli, and that before the Truth (lamp of God, 3) went out in the temple (the nominal- church), where from 1878 onward it began gradually to go out finally. Samuel'ss lying down in the temple to sleep is in harmony with this thought; for not only the foolish, but also the wise virgins fell asleep between 1846 and 1877 (Matt. 25: 5); and, as the following episode shows, the part of the Little Flock that remained in Babylon until 1896, typed here, as we understand it, by Samuel, continued to sleep onward from 1846 to 1897. Some of the Little Flock slept even until 1914. Not only the above lines of Truth show that Samuel in 1 Sam. 3: 1-3 represents the Little Flock in Babylon from 1846 to 1878, but thoughts that later parts of the chapter bring out will be found in harmony with this thought. Hence the above-given considerations enable us to see the time</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">setting of vs. 1-3, and also prove that the viewpoint of the Samuel antitype now under study differs somewhat from that given in 1 Sam. 1 and 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) In v. 1 the word, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">naar,</span><span class="font3"> should not be given as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">child, </span><span class="font3">rather as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">youth.</span><span class="font3"> Certainly, this class did serve the Lord in conversionist work, between 1846 and 1878, even as we saw that its leaders did this, as typed by Samuel'ss sacrifice at Bethlehem (16: 2-10). They did this under the eyes and approval of the crown-lost leaders (before Eli). Little, indeed, was the new Truth given the Church in Babylon during 1846-1878 (the word of the Lord was precious in those days). Not only so, but this is true of the entire nominal church (no open [public] vision), despite the fact that the nominal church was God's mouthpiece then. It will be noted that the thing meant by the words, it came to pass (v. 2), is not mentioned in vs. 2 and 3. It is first mentioned inv. 4, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Lord called Samuel. The other things noted in vs. 2 and 3 are set forth to give us the circumstances amid which God called Samuel in type and antitype. The condition of the crown-lost leaders (Eli, 2) was a sad one for persons in their office. They betook themselves to rest at their post of duty (laid down in his place); for they were among the foolish virgins who slumbered and slept (Matt. 25: 5) , while they should have been wide-awake at their post of duty in the nominal church. As a rule, these had fought the Miller movement, and when its 1844 expectations were not fulfilled, the crown-lost leaders as a class largely gave up special consideration of prophecy, and gave up almost altogether the study of prophetic time, even in an oppositional sense. Hence so far as the old truths were concerned, they became increasingly unclear thereon (his eyes began to dim), and so far as the advancing Truth in its blessing the part of the cleansed Sanctuary that was separate from Babylon was concerned, they were entirely blind (he was not able to see). Thus the crown-lost leaders were in a sad plight indeed,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">furnishing a marked example of the blind leaders to whose lot it had fallen to be leaders of the blind.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(29) By the lamp of God antitypical of v. 3 we understand the Truth to be meant, even the Bible (John 17: 17). We do not understand the typical lamp of God here to mean the lampstand in the Holy, for that never went out, either in the tabernacle or in the temple; but it was some lamp that burned in the evening in that structure which is called here the temple, and which enclosed the tabernacle. This lamp was allowed to become dimmer and dimmer, until finally it went out entirely. Apparently, the temple attendants laid down to sleep before the lamp went out entirely. In the antitype the Bible to the nominal people of God began to grow dim in 1835, when, as shown under another figure, the symbolic sun (New Testament) and moon (Old Testament) began to darken to the nominal people of God (Joel 2: 30, 31). The dimming of this symbolic lamp (Ps. 119: 105; 132: 17; Prov. 6: 23; 13: 9; 20: 20) was from 1835 to 1878, when its gradual going out set in and became complete for the nominal-church members in 1955. Hence, antitypical Samuel laid down after 1835 and before 1878. From the fulfilment in the parable of the ten virgins we know that it began in 1846. Thus it was the Little Flock among the nominal people of God (in the temple of the Lord) who are represented here as lying down to sleep from 1846 onward. The twelve stewardship truths (the ark) were then with the nominal people of God (where the ark of God was) at that time. We say this, because the ark is the depository of God's full arrangement as due at any time with which the ark is associated. This view clarifies the antitypes of the ark in 1 Sam. 4-7.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(30) While vs. 1-3 treat antitypically of things from 1846 to 1878, the rest of the chapter treats of things subsequent to 1878. V. 4 has its antitype's beginning from 1886 onward. The call antitypical of that indicated in v. 4 was voiced through Studies, Vol. I, which, as we know, was issued in 1886. This was</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">circulated in a variety of ways, the most important and fruitful being by colporteuring. As it was circulated it came in touch with many Little Flock brethren, and its message was so attractive, clear and winsome that Little Flock brethren made a ready response, as having been called by it, with the antitype of the words, Here am I (4). As they thought over its contents they wondered who the author was, and concluded that he was one of the leading Christian writers in the world; hence they concluded that he was one of the Church leaders. This led them to go (he ran, 5) and to inquire of their pastors and still more prominent Church leaders (Eli) what they meant by giving them such a call (Here am I; for thou calledst me), since they felt such a call could come from one alone who was of their class. But these crown-lost leaders lost no time is disabusing the minds of such inquiring Little Flock brethren of the thought that Studies, Vol. I, could have emanated from one of their class (I called thee not). Do not bother your head about things that you read in that book. Disabuse your mind of its thoughts (he down [literally, return] ), i.e., go back to your former tranquil state of mind and rest yourself from worry or study on the subjects of that book, which did not originate with one of us Church leaders. The seed on of the Little Flock here typed followed the suggestion of the crown-lost leaders and composed themselves to rest content with the sleep of Babylon (and he went and lay down).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) Then when Studies, Vol. II, was circulated from 1889 onward, it reached the Samuel class in the nominal church (and the Lord called yet again, 6), and it reached an attentive ear, because, like Studies, Vol. I, its message was attuned to the ear of the class that was like God in character (Samuel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">name of God).</span><span class="font3"> To them it had the ring of a message coming from God; and, accordingly, this class concluded that such a book must have come from a member of the crown-lost leaders. Hence, they betook themselves to such</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(Samuel arose and went to Eli), assuring them that this message must have come from their midst (thou didst call me), and expressed readiness to respond to this message (Here am I). The crown-lost leaders denied that they originated the contents of Studies, Vol. II (he answered, I called not, my son), affirming that the message came from another source. And not only so, but the crown-lost leaders again charged the Samuel class to give no heed to a message that did not proceed from them, nor to let it disturb their peace of mind (literally, return, he down). They spoke kindly (my son), which influenced the Samuel class to heed their exhortation. These two calls came to the Samuel class before they had come to an appreciation of the Lord as He really is (Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, 7). This was due to the fact that they had not yet come into the Truth, and that what they had previously heard of it was not clearly grasped (neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him). Again, Studies, Vol. Ill, appearing in 1891, came to the Samuel class, while it was yet in the nominal church (the Lord called Samuel again a third time, 8), and its message also had to this class the ring of a Divine origin, which they, therefore, concluded must have come through the agency of the crown-lost leaders. To these they, therefore, went to confer further on its subject matter (he arose and went to Eli), telling them that they were responding to their message (Here am I; for thou didst call me).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) Doubtless, in the meantime, some of the crown-lost leaders had been thinking seriously over the message of Studies, Vols. I, II and III. Some of its light was dimly dawning upon some of them, at least enough of it to make some of them think that there was considerable of Truth in many of their positions; for not a few of them were taking things from the Studies for their lectures, sermons and writings, without, however, letting the source of their views become known to those who regarded them as their leaders (Eli perceived that the Lord had called the youth). Accordingly, these crown-lost leaders assured (Eli said unto Samuel, 9) the Samuel class in Babylon that there were some truths in the Studies, but that they should not be disturbed over what they had already read in the three Volumes (Go, lie down), but if another message calling them should come (if He call thee), they should not only give to it an attentive ear, but should exercise to it a responsive heart (thou shalt say, Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth). Accordingly, the Samuel class dismissed serious thought on the contents of the first three Volumes of the Studies for the time being (So Samuel went); and without further distraction of thought went about their ordinary service (lay down in his place). In Studies, Vol. IV, appearing in 1897, the Lord, and that for the fourth time, came to the Samuel class in Babylon (the Lord came, 10). This time He took a firmer and stronger hold on the attention of the Samuel class in Babylon (and stood; literally, caused Himself to stand, set Himself). This riveted their attention all the more on the contents of the fourth call (and called). Yet, the fourth call was made in a way similar to the other three calls, i.e., by the printed page, especially reinforced by conversations in most cases (as at other times). Yet, it was more emphatically impressive to Samuel, as is indicated by the repetition of the name (Samuel, Samuel). And the fourth time the Samuel class not only recognized that the messenger was not the crown-lost leaders, but the Lord's Truth itself as the representative of God, and, therefore, lent it not only an attentive and responsive, but also an obedient ear (answered, Speak, for Thy servant heareth).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(33) The message of Studies, Vol. IV, in so far as it concerns Babylon in its two ecclesiastical divisions, Romanism and Protestantism, is certainly finely summarized typically in vs. 11-14. It is this typical summary of that feature of Studies, Vol. IV, that enabled us to see the entire run of thought of 1 Sam. 3 and 4, as also helps to that end came from the statements of vs. 1-3. Since the message of vs. 11-14 suggested Studies, Vol. IV, the other three calls naturally suggest the calls of the preceding three Volumes. The message of vs. 11-14 receiving its fulfilment in the events of 1 Sam. 4, the latter's events are naturally suggestive of certain Parousia and Epiphany battles with, and defeats of Nominal Spiritual Israel at the hands of the antitypical Philistines, certain sifting sectarians of the Parousia and the Epiphany in church, state, capital and, especially, labor; for through these the predicted wrath is poured out on Romanism and Protestantism. These considerations give us solid ground upon which we tread as we unfold the antitypical teachings of 1 Sam. 3 and 4. Now for some details on vs. 11-14. As we read these verses we are reminded by them of the prophecy in 1 Sam. 2: 27-36; for vs. 12-14 directly refer to 1 Sam. 2: 27-36, declaring that God would folfill the prophecy there declared against Eli and his house. Above we showed that the man of God referred to in 1 Sam. 2:27 is Bro. Russell and his five successive special helpers. It was from these, especially from the first of these, speaking in Studies, Vol. IV, that the Samuel class while yet in Babylon received the message of Studies, Vol. IV; and it came to that class, in so far as it concerned Romanism and Protestantism, as typically epitomized in vs. 11-14. The many Scriptures on which Studies, Vol. IV, bases its descriptions and denunciations of ecclesiastical Babylon make its teaching of the pertinent matters the teachings of the Word of God (the Lord said, v. 11). To the Samuel class this was the Truth on the subject, coming from the Lord to Him (to Samuel), and was, therefore, final.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) The Lord, through Studies, Vol. IV, declared that He would perform an astounding act, a dumbfounding act and an unexemplified act in Christendom (I will do a thing in Israel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.).</span><span class="font3"> He stresses the declaration (Behold). And, certainly, the wordy battles of the Parousia and Epiphany against ecclesiastical Babylon and the violent battle against her in the World</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">War, phases I and II, and, especially, in the revolutionary feature of the Time of Trouble, have, so far as they have developed, been an astounding, a dumbfounding and an unexemplified act, and what is yet to come will be even more so. In the symbols of Rev. 14: 10, 11 the antitypical tingling of both ears, not merely one, is described in some of its details. Yes, it will be in the Time of Wrath (in that day, 12) that the Lord will fulfill all the forecasts of the six abovementioned brothers, especially those of Bro. Russell uttered in Studies, Vol. IV, against the crown-lost leaders of Romanism and Protestantism (against Eli), as these concern them, the Romanist and Protestant clergy and the principal of their flocks (which I have spoken concerning his house). This is no mere threat. Nor will it be commenced and then after a while be allowed to cease before a completion. It was to begin—it already has begun—proceed and come to a full completion in Armageddon. A fairly full description of the destruction begun, continued and completed, is given us in Rev. 18, as well as in numerous other places in Holy Writ. That the coming punishment does not come unheralded and unwarned against, the Lord emphatically declares (I have told him that I will judge his house, 13).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) Through the prophets of both Testaments this judgment was revealed and was expounded by the six above-mentioned brothers, especially by that Servant, who mentions it in Studies, Vols. I, II, III, comparatively briefly, and in very great detail in Vol. IV (1 have told him that I will judge his house). It will be a final judgment (forever). It is due to its sin, known and unrestrained by the crown-lost leaders. This iniquity has been particularly in the Romanist and Protestant clergy (his sons made themselves vile), despite which the crown-lost leaders did not use sufficiently stringent measures to restrain it (he restrained them not). The matter is one of such overshadowing consequence that God has even bound Himself by an oath (therefore I have sworn, 14) never to forgive the iniquity of ecclesiastical Babylon (unto the house of Eli). The sacrifice of Christ will not atone for it, because it is for Adamic sins, while ecclesiastical Babylon's sins are willful. Nor will the sufferings of the repentant Great Company avail for more than the cancellation of the willfulness of individual Babylonians; since it does not suffer for the wilfiilness of the condemned systems of Babylon (shall not be purged by sacrifice). Nor will any effort of man or devils avail to save Babylon from utter and eternal ruin. And the willful guilt of its non-Spirit-begotten members will require them to go through harrowing experiences in the Trouble Time to cleanse themselves of part of their uncleanness (Zeph. 3: 8, 9; Is. 59: 18, 19), and for the rest to pass through the resurrection by judgment in the Millennium (Zech. 13: 9; John 5: 29).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(36) The Samuel class was astonished by the phases of the Lord's Truth antitypical of what is contained in vs. 11-14, and refrained from telling of it to the crown-lost leaders for fear of hurting them overmuch, as well as from a natural respect that they cherished for such (lay until the morning . . . feared to show Eli the vision, 15). His next activity (in the morning) was to help the evangelistically working justified and crown-lost workers (opened the doors of the house of the Lord) as they sought to win the penitent to faith in Christ. By now the Samuel class was about to leave Babylon, of whose necessity they first heard while reading Studies, Vol. Ill, and of which they became convinced by their reading and understanding Studies, Vol. IV, especially in its descriptions and condemnation of ecclesiastical Babylon. This step they took in connection with their announcing to the crown-lost leaders the contents of the &quot;vision.&quot; Its fallen condition and imminent destruction, with the Lord's concordant charge, were given as the reason for their leaving ecclesiastical Babylon. Proper was the deference that restrained the Samuel class from announcing the disagreeable tidings to the EH class until asked about it by the latter itself. Still affectionally disposed (my son, 16) to the antitypical youth, whom they recognized to be zealous for God's glory (Samuel), the crown-lost leaders were curious to learn what they were satisfied was a message from the Lord in Studies, Vol. IV; hence they inquired of the former to give their attention to the latter's call (called). Filially, the Samuel class gave an attentive response to the call (Here am I). Instead of the crown-lost leaders expressly conceding that the message was from the Lord, a thing that they doubtless thought might have a to them undesirable effect on antitypical Samuel, they asked what they had learned from Studies, Vol. IV (literally, What is the thing which he [or it] said to thee, 17; the words, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the LORD,</span><span class="font3"> are in italics, implying that they were interpolated into the text without corresponding words in the Hebrew). They desired no concealment to be made by antitypical Samuel in the matter (I pray thee hide it not from me). The earnestness of this feature of the antitypical request on a frank and full statement on the subject is typed by Eli's statement in v. 17: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he [the writer of Studies, Vol. IV] said unto thee. They were thus at least earnest.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) The Little Flock is candid in declaring God's message as due to be given, not holding back any real feature of it. Accordingly, the Samuel part of the Little Flock told the matter in its entirety (Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him, 18). They emphasized every feature of the antitype of vs. 11-14, not holding back the crown-lost leaders' guilty part therein. Since the contents of the antitype of vs. 11-14 had in the writings and lectures of the six brethren mentioned above been already made known to the crown-lost leaders, who were only too well aware of the facts charged in the antitype against the guilty ones concerned, the Eli class accepted submissively the message, believing it to be true; for in the Parousia writings and addresses of many of the crown-lost leaders such charges against the fallen condition of the nominal church and wrongs of its clergy are to be found (It is the Lord: let Him do what seemeth Him good). The Samuel class continued to grow in grace, knowledge and service (Samuel grew, 19), which fact, among other things, moved him to leave Babylon, and to come among the Truth people, for whom in the rest of this chapter Samuel stands as type. Surely, the Lord was with them in leading them out of Babylon, and in blessing them with all their privileges after coming into the Truth (the Lord was with him). After becoming of the Truth people their teachings as the advancing Truth unfolded factually, reasonably and Scripturally, and as such fulfilled without failing as due to be fulfilled (and [God] let none of his words fall to the ground). As the Harvest advanced all Christendom (from Dan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[judge',</span><span class="font3"> those not in the Truth in any sense] to Beersheba </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[well of the oath',</span><span class="font3"> the Little Flock, Great Company, Youthful Worthies, the tentatively justified and Israelites, as those to whom various features of the Oath-bound Covenant belonged], 20) recognized that the Parousia Little Flock in the Truth was by God made a mouthpiece of His as the publishers of the Truth and righteousness (knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord). Nor did the Truth cease to advance with the giving of the antitype of vs. 11-14 to antitypical Samuel (the Lord appeared again; literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">continued to appear,</span><span class="font3"> 21); rather it unfolded on the nominal church (in Shiloh) and this continued unfolding of Truth on the nominal church (in Shiloh) was granted by the Lord to antitypical Samuel by the Truth (word of the Lord) coming to them through the Parousia Messenger. The first clause of 1 Sam. 4: 1 should have been made the last clause of 1 Sam. 3: 21; for putting that clause into Chap. IV, as in some other cases, is an unhappy cutting off of what belongs to the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">end of one chapter from it, and an unhappy adding of it to a chapter to which it does not belong. It gives the reason for Samuel'ss having been recognized as a prophet of the Lord by all Israel, i.e., because his speaking as the Lord's mouth came to the hearing of all Israel. In an antitypical way the Little Flock's witnessing the Parousia Truth throughout Christendom during the Parousia made its preaching as the prophet came to antitypical Israel's attention.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) 1 Sam. 4 types the fulfilment of the Lord's forecasts through the six above-mentioned brethren, as typed in 1 Sam. 2: 27-36, and of the Little Flock, as typed in 1 Sam. 3: 11-14. Part of these forecasts have already been fulfilled, part of them are now fulfilling and the climax of them is to be fulfilled a little later, in Armageddon. These we will now proceed to trace, as fulfilled, or fulfilling, or to be fulfilled, as the case of each may be. As already said, the battles antitypical of the two set forth in 1 Sam. 4 are different in the antitype from one another in their nature. The first antitypical battle was a wordy one and the second in part has been, and its yet remaining part will be, one of words and of physical violence. The wordy battle continued throughout the Parousia as a wordy fight only. The antitypical battle of both words and violence began as such in World War, Phase I, and has continued in both features in World War, Phase II. The second battle began with the revolution sifting in the nominal church in its wordy feature and will take on its violent feature in Armageddon, which will complete the antitypical second battle. The type does not clearly indicate the two features of the second antitypical battle. It is from the fulfilled facts of the wordy feature that we recognize these as the way the antitype will fulfill. This type says nothing of the anarchy feature of the Time of Trouble, because in Armageddon Babylon, civil, ecclesiastical and aristocratic, will be annihilated, and this chapter treats of the defeat and destruction of Babylon ecclesiastical. In</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">many places in the Bible the conflict of the radicals against the nominal church in the Parousia and in the Epiphany is set forth under the figure of a war or battle. The following are some of the passage that use this figure of the wordy battle: Is. 29: 1-8; Jer. 51: 1-4, 11, 12, 20-58; Ezek. 33: 26-29;Hos. 10: 13-15. The part that Jesus and the Church take in the wordy battles of the Lord's Word against the nominal church (Rev. 19: 11-16) is not typed in 1 Sam. 4, though whatever of secular and religious Truth the antitypical Philistines use in their wordy battle has been, is and will be from the Lord Jesus (Rev. 19: 17-21;Joel2: 1-11).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) The purely wordy battle, consisting of partisan (Philistines) attacks on Babylon's creeds in their doctrines, organizations and practices, and of her attempted defenses of these against the partisans who attack her, is set forth in vs. 1, 2. The antitypical Israelites took their stand on their creeds (pitched beside Ebenezer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stone of help,</span><span class="font3"> 1), on which as a whole they relied for vindicating their beliefs; and their partisan opponents took their stand on facts, reason and some Scriptures (the Philistines pitched in Aphek,/or/re^). The defenders of each denomination sought to vindicate its creed in its entirety, and because each one was contradictory of itself, as well as of Scripture, reason and facts in various respects, and because all of them contradicted one another from the standpoint of Scripture, reason and facts, their defense individually and in entirety was an impossible thing from the standpoint of their attackers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> from the standpoint of Scripture, reason and facts. Moreover, their contradicting one another divided the defenders of each creed against those of the rest of the creeds, which again weakened their defense. Their attackers consisted of all five sets of the Parousia sifters, from the threefold standpoint of each set of sifters—those in the sanctuary, court and city or camp. Each of these attacked every weak point in each creed, but</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">in general passed by the stewardship doctrine of each one without much of an attack. Thus the three sets of noransomers attacked Babylon's doctrines that contradicted the ransom doctrine, showing their inconsistency, like the ransom's being brought by a member of the Trinity, while the satisfaction of justice in each member of the Trinity is required by the Trinity theory; human immortality, and eternal torment as the penalty of sin as opposing death as the ransom process, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc.</span><span class="font3"> The infidelistic sifters attacked especially the Trinity and the Bible as the alleged support of Babylon's doctrines, showing their inconsistency. The combinationists attacked the denominational differences, in defense of which Babylonians were very weak. The reformers in the name of progress, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> attacked the creeds' conservatism and thereby undermined their influence. And the contradictionists fought many vital things in Babylon's creeds and thus stirred up doubts, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> against them. Labor especially, and the state in certain cases also belong to the antitypical Philistines, for they attack various theories of the nominal church, by which they are leading multitudes against her and causing other multitudes to forsake her. The result is a divided, confused and ineffectual defense, resulting in a sore defeat for the Babylonians (they joined battle, Israel was smitten. . . they slew. . . about 4,000 men, 2). Certain features of this wordy battle, with the Little Flock's part coming thereafter, are typed by the battle between the four and five kings of Gen. 14, with Abraham's part therein coming thereafter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(40) The ark of the covenant types God's plan in God and the Christ—Jehovah's full arrangement. Hence it may represent all the features of the plan as due at any time, and as its concerns any section of God's real or nominal people. As God's nominal people are treated of in 1 Sam. 4, only those parts of God's plan as seen by the nominal church in the Parousia and Epiphany before Armageddon are there typed. And this, of course, would mean the twelve stewardship doctrines</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and such other Truth features seen by any denomination. Hence the ark, as in the possession of Eli and his two sons, represents the truths in possession of the crown-lost leader and the Romanist and Protestant clergy during the Parousia and Epiphany up to Armageddon. With these truths exclusively the nominal church did not engage in the first, the exclusively wordy battle, antitypical of that of vs. 1, 2. Yea, very little use of them did she make, because she devoted her energies mainly to defend the attacked creedal errors, which in each denominational creeds its adherents took to be the Truth. E.g., the Calvinists sought to defend absolute predestination of the saved and the lost, and met such a sore defeat thereon as to lead to their largely repudiating it, as can be seen in the revision of the Westminster confession. But for the wordy part of the second battle the leaders (elders, 3) after the defeated nominal-church apologists retired from the first battle to their fortified positions (the people were come into the camp) advised to use only their undoubted truths (Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us) and leave their creedal errors unused. For, as they reasoned over the wherefores of their defeat at the hands of hostile partisans (Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines?), they concluded that it was due to their creedal errors; hence they felt certain of victory, if they would fight against the hostile partisans with their truths (that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies). Therefore the nominal-church warriors began to revamp their long-neglected stewardship and other truths, refurbishing them to fitness for battle (So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubim [who acts in harmony with His wisdom, pictured by the light that comes out of the Shekinah, His power and love, pictured by the cherubim, and His justice, the antitypical Mercy Seat], 4). But as the sequel will show, these stewardship and other truths were not well studied; nor did their wielders understand well how to use them effectively against the arguments of their enemies. Again, the Romanist (Hophni) and Protestant (Phinehas) clergy, who were the main custodians of these truths (were there with the ark of the covenant of God), had a very poor hold thereon. These things put the overconfident, nominal-church warriors to a great disadvantage.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(41) On all hands the nominal-church warriors expected victory because of their taking their stand on the denominational stewardship and other truths, and gloried in an anticipated sure victory (when the ark . . . came . . . shouted with a great shout, 5). And this confidence extended to various phases of society—state and aristocracy (so that the earth rang [moved] ); for be it remembered that for the most part state and aristocracy sided with the nominal church. The boastful exultation of the nominal-church warriors came to the ears of their antagonists, e.g., Mr. Bryan's boast of a sure victory over Mr. Darrow before their encounter at Dayton, Tenn., on Modernism and Fundamentalism (the Philistines heard . . . the shout, 6). These soon learned the cause of the boasting of the so-called orthodox (they understood... the ark .. . was come into the camp). This first aroused fear in the enemies of the nominal church, and such fear moved them to exhort one another to the courage of, desperation (were afiaid. . . God is come into the camp; Woe is us . . . not. . . such . . . heretofore, who will deliver us out of the hand of. . . Gods that smote the Egyptians, 8; Be strong ... be not servants unto the Hebrews . . . quit yourselves like men, 9). The enemies, therefore, knew that they would have to exert themselves to their utmost not to be defeated. Little did they know that God, who they feared was on the nominal church's side, had forsaken her. These antitypical Philistines consisted: first, of the religious revolutionists in the nominal church, the so-called</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">modernists, who use various phases of the five sifting errors of the Parousia and other errors of the Epiphany; then, of conservative and radical labor, including the tradeunionists, radical socialists, communists, syndicalists and anarchists; then, of inimical statesmen, like Calles of Mexico, Azana of Spain, Hitler of Germany, Lenin and Stalin of Russia, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> with the backing of the countries that they represent. It will later take in all the ten languagenations of Europe, after the violent revolutionists get control of them. Also antitypical Elisha has been doing his share in the damage. These are the antitypical Philistines during the second battle, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> in the Epiphany. During World War, Phase I, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the late part of the first battle, both a wordy and a violent battle set in against the nominal church as part of the first battle. The wordy battle of that time especially attacked its doctrine of the Divine rights of kings, clergy and aristocrats. The armies inflicted much physical violence on the nominal church, by killing millions of its adherents, destroying much of its property and greatly injuring its prestige as that of the institution whose failure to fulfill its mission was more than any other institution responsible for the spirit that led up to the World War. In Russia both the Greek and Roman Churches were almost annihilated by the physical violence exercised during the World War, Phase I. Therein in the second battle will come the complete verbal and violent defeat of the nominal church (the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, v. 10).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) And since the end of World War, Phase I, the wordy and the physical violence war has been going on. The conflict between the Modernists and the Fundamentalists continues with the Fundamentalists ever going down to defeat after defeat, both in the arguments and in the practical measures adopted. The classic example for this period is the encounter between Messrs. Bryan and Darrow at Dayton, Tenn., where Mr. Bryan made a most dismal failure of defending</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the Bible against Mr. Darrow's infidelistic attacks. In most Protestant denominations the Modernists are now in the chariot driving the organizations executively onward, e.g., the Presbyterian Church in its general assembly and in most of its synods is controlled by the Modernists, who have even succeeded in getting the courts to give them the church buildings of Fundamentalist congregations! Rome and what it is pleased to call the Reds, i.e., practically everything anti-Romanist, are waging a world-wide wordy and physical violence battle. First antitypical Ben-hadad and later antitypical Hazael joined the fray, with Rome getting by far the worst of it. Against both Protestantism and Romanism the sword of Elisha has been bared, with heavy losses inflicted upon both of the former. In both a wordy and a physical violence fight are various states in conflict with Rome. Certainly Calles in Mexico most disastrously struck Rome in such a conflict. Czechoslovakia made Rome retreat in their wordy conflict. Even Romanist Poland struck Rome a hard blow over the Romanist Cardinal of Cracow refusing to allow Carol of Roumania to view the body of Pilsudski in the Cracow Cathedral. Rome met another defeat over the concordat conflict in Serbia. In 1932 in the verbal battle between the Fascist! and the Vatican, the pope learned to keep his hands, burnt in that battle, out of Italy's political fires. Mr. Hitler struck Rome and Protestantism most disastrous blows both verbally and physically. In Spain both the verbal and physical violence conflict went on in a major catastrophe for Rome, which through the rebels, Germany, Italy and the Moors, and even its own priests, monks, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., </span><span class="font3">struck back with physical violence, while everywhere Rome waged a verbal warfare on Republican, Spain. In every Protestant country the Modernists have driven the Fundamentalists more or less into the background, and all phases of Modernism reign in Protestantism. The future will give the Fundamentalists more and more defeats at the hands of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Modernists, while in every European country before Armageddon the nations have plundered and will devastate Rome of her privileges, powers and prerogatives. All this is a part of the antitype of the battle and the defeat of Israel described in v. 10.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(43) But the worst of the defeat is yet to be inflicted on Nominal Spiritual Israel. While it will be decidedly worsted in the yet remaining part of the second verbal fight and in the pre-Armageddon physical violence part of the battle antitypical of that of v. 10, the climax of its defeat is reserved to Armageddon, which, while there will doubtless be in it some of the verbal fight waged, will consist mainly of the physical violence part of the second battle. As the ally of both state and capital (though to stay off the coming revolution, Rome and Protestantism pretend to favor conservative labor, having been driven to take that pretended stand somewhat by the logic of argument and events and mainly by fear for their future safety) they will become a target for antitypical Jehu when antitypical Jezebel reviles him for his attack on the state (2 Kings 9: 30-37), and will certainly go down into utter destruction. There will, as 2 Kings 9: 35 shows, be nothing left of Protestantism and Catholicism, except the memory of their theories (skull), conduct (feet) and deeds (palms of her hands). It will, indeed, be a disastrous rout and destruction that mark and will mark their part in both features of this battle. The complete destruction of a large part of their following will mark their defeat (a great slaughter. . . fell. . . 30,000 footmen) and the disorganized retreat of their surviving warriors (they fled every man into his own tent, habitation). The clergy and the most prominent church members will be cut off in death in Armageddon, after being soundly refuted in the wordy battle (2 Kings 10: 1825; Is. 65: 11, 12; Jer. 25: 32-38). This is expressly shown of the clergy in our study (the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain, 11). And, worst of all for Nominal Spiritual</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Israel, the custodianship of the stewardship doctrines and other truths that the nominal church has, will fall into the hands of antitypical Elisha and Jehu, both of whom will take these as their charge; for while the Little Flock will not be a part of the antitypical Philistines, antitypical Elisha, Jehu and Hazael are of them (1 Kings 19: 16, 17), antitypical Elisha taking part in the verbal battle only, even as the sword of all three of them refers to their theories used in the verbal battle (the ark of God has taken); for after Armageddon the Epiphany Levites will be the religious teachers of Christendom and will therein be supported by antitypical Jehu.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(44) All throughout these two battles, particularly throughout the second battle, news-bearers have carried intelligence of the progress of the conflict to the nominal people of God (ran a man... to Shiloh, 12). These were especially crown-losers (a man of Benjamin) who were very much grieved at the continued ill success of the nominal-church warriors in the second battle (clothes rent. . . earth upon his head). Their grief continually increased until it will reach a climax in the Armageddon stage of the battle, which seals the refutation and slaughter of the clergy, a thing that will occur before the nominal church is utterly destroyed in Armageddon, the crown-lost leaders still occupying the place of leadership in the nominal church at the place of access to, and egress from it (when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat [literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">throne]</span><span class="font3"> by the wayside, 13). These were intently on the lookout for tidings from the field of battle (watching). Knowing the ill preparation of the defenders of the nominal church's truths, they trembled for their safety in the conflict (trembled for the ark of God). The tidings of the verbal defeat of the antitypical Israelites in their battle with the antitypical Philistines, particularly of the taking of the ark and of the physical death of the Romanist and Protestant clergy, distressed unspeakably the nominal-church people (told it, all the city cried</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">out; Rev. 14: 10, 11; 18: 9-11, 15-19; Jer. 25: 34-36). The cries of distress of the nominal-church members have been, are coming and will come to the attention of the crown-lost leaders increasingly (Eli heard the noise of the crying, 14). And they ask its meaning (he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult?). They were not long left without an explanation (the man came in hastily, and told Eli). Old, indeed, in leadership are now the crown-lost leaders, who began to take the place of leadership about the beginning and middle of the second century, when Ignatius began to exalt bishops and Justin Martyr began the sectarianizing of the Little Flock movement begun by St. John and nourished by Polycarp, working onward gradually toward the sectarianizing of that movement into the Greek Catholic Church (Now Eli was ninety and eight years old, 15). But their spiritual vision had become dim, especially since 1846; and by the time the Parousia was over they could see nothing of God's Truth in its connection as a plan (his eyes were dim, that he could not see). The news-bearers, who gave their reports verbally and in writings, e.g., in newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, books, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> gave evidence of having been in the thick of the fray (I am he that came out of the army [literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ranks],</span><span class="font3"> and I fled today out of the army </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[ranks],</span><span class="font3"> 16). From eye witnesses the crown-lost leaders desire to know the news (he said, What is there done?). His question was put with the kindliness of a leader to a subordinate (my son), as it was fitting so to be.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(45) In the rest of the chapter the effects of the tidings of misfortune upon the crown-lost leaders and upon united Protestantism (the image) as a whole are described, and that first upon the crown-lost leaders. The news-bringers briefly sum up the evil tidings in four parts: (1) the flight of antitypical Israel before the antitypical Philistines (Israel is fled before the Philistines, 17); (2) a fearful refutation of many antitypical Israelites in the wordy part of the battle and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">a fearful amount of deaths in the physical violence part of the battle (there is also a great slaughter among the people); (3) The Romanist and Protestant clergy, the new creatures among them, including the crown-lost leaders, excepted, are all slain (thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead); and (4) the nominal-church stewardship and other truths are taken by the &quot;Russellites&quot; and conservative labor as of their guardianship (the ark of God is taken). We note both in the type and the antitype how to Eli and the crown-lost leaders each succeeding calamity is greater than the preceding one until the climax of evil is reached in the fourth and last one. And it was the last calamity that brought fatal effects on typical and antitypical Eli. The tidings that the antitypical Philistines had taken away from antitypical Israel the stewardship and other truths and then used them against antitypical Israel (made mention of the ark of God, 18) caused the crown-lost leaders to fall from their symbolic throne, i.e., to give up their place and authority as leaders (fell off the seat [literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">throne]</span><span class="font3"> ), in despair (backward), thus declaring </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">publicly</span><span class="font3"> their giving up the leadership (by the side of the gate). They will lose all will power for leadership (and his neck brake), and thus will cease acting as crown-lost leaders (and he died). This they will do at the dictates of wisdom (old man) and gravity (heavy), after having as a class been the leaders in Christendom throughout nearly the entire Gospel Age (he had judged Israel forty years). We are not to understand that Eli's death represents the actual physical death of the crown-lost leaders; for they, as well as the bulk of the rest of the Great Company in Babylon, will survive Armageddon, and come into the Truth, as other Scriptures show, and serve it (Rev. 7: 14; Num. 8: 5-26). Rather, Eli's death represents the crown-lost leaders' ceasing in Armageddon to be such; for at that time or shortly afterwards they will own that the Lord had cast off Babylon in 1878, and had been using the Priesthood especially as his mouthpiece</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">since that time, as well as the Great Company since 1917 as mouthpiece toward the public.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(46) In the Divine law both the Romanist Church and the Protestant Church have been daughters-in-law to the crown-lost leaders. Nothing in this type is said of the Romanist daughter-in-law of antitypical Eli; but something very marked is typed of his Protestant daughter-in-law, the symbolic wife of the Protestant clergy, antitypical Phinehas (his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, 19). The Protestant section of the nominal church had in her midst her section of the Great Company, who, by the Truth preaching and writings and by the signs of the times, particularly those of the Epiphany, and most particularly those connected with Armageddon, will be about prepared to leave Babylon, only waiting until the Protestant section of nominal Zion will be in travail in Armageddon (was with child, near to be delivered; Is. 66: 8). The Protestant nominal church loves her stewardship and other truths, and is and has been most deeply pained at the news that the &quot;Russellites&quot; and conservative labor had these truths in their possession and used them against antitypical Israel (heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken), that the crown-lost leaders had publicly renounced their office and authority as such and that the Protestant clergy had been refuted and literally slain (that her father-in-law and her husband were dead). United Protestantism thereupon will bow down to the travail of her Armageddon sufferings (bowed herself and travailed, for her pains came upon her), and these (Is. 66: 8) will be so intense that she will be unable to survive them. The Societyites will not only have stirred up antitypical Jehu to bring the Roman and Greek Catholic Churches gradually to their destruction in Armageddon, but will have done the same with him as to the Protestant Churches. And it is these sufferings of Protestantism as a whole that are the antitypical pains of v. 19. And because it will be as she goes into destruction and thus experiences its pains</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that her part of the Great Company will leave her as a movement, separate and distinct from her, the Bible represents her as travailing in birth, in v. 19 and in Is. 66: 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(47) It will be at the time of the death of Protestantism as a whole (about the time of her death, 20; as soon as Zion travailed, Is. 66: 8) that the remnants of the Protestant denominations (the women that stood by her) will seek to keep her in life with the prospect of a symbolic son being born, /. e., of the Great Company as a whole leaving Protestantism to become a separate movement, to continue the name and office of antitypical Phinehas (Fear not, for thou hast bome a son). But expiring Protestantism as a whole will make no fitting response (she answered not), nor will she be heartened thereby (neither did she regard it; literally, set her heart [to it]). Summing up her little remaining strength she will give a name to the Great Company movement as it is being born, a name that will indicate the three unutterable losses that she will have experienced, especially the greatest of the three—that from her the stewardship and other truths (the ark) have been taken and have fallen into the hands of her enemies— Ichabod </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Where is the glory?</span><span class="font3"> 21). What of Truth she had with her leaders and clergy was the glory of Protestantism in her better days; but they will now have been lost to her and hers forever. Yea, she will have lost the glory! It will have departed from her and gone to her enemies, the overthrowers of herself, her clergy and her crown-lost leaders (The glory is departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband)! The unutterableness of her woe will almost surpass human power of thought to perceive and appreciate, which appears from the repetition of the statement: The glory is departed (22). The chief part of her sorrow will consist in the consciousness that her stewardship and other truths will have been yielded up by their defenders to their and her enemies (for</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the ark of God is taken). Yea, Romanists and Protestants will be most sorely tested (tormented, i.e., tested, Rev. 14: 10) by the destruction (fire and brimstone) of their respective cherished institutions: the beast and Catholic Church, and its image and the Protestant Church, which they believe are Divine institutions, in full view of the Church (holy angels) and Christ (the Lamb). The memory of this sore trial will not only never be forgotten; but it will come up in the minds of men forever (the smoke of their torment [testing by the destruction of their revered and supposedly Divine institutions] ascendeth up for ever and ever, Rev. 14: 11). If we should take the view of the Biblically unenlightened natural man, the destruction of these powerful institutions would be one of the last things in the world to expect, especially in so short a time as the Bible indicates; but, Biblically enlightened, we can see the day of Babylon's destruction hastening rapidly on. Surely, the next few years will have witnessed the most stupendous events of history. And our study of 1 Sam. 3 and 4 helps us the more thoroughly to see this rapidly approaching destruction coming on apace. How glad we should be that the institutions that have so grossly caricatured God's holy person, character, plan and works are soon to be sunk irretrievably into the sea of destruction, and that the true Zion will shortly begin her grand and glorious reign (Rev. 18: 20). Halleluiah! For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth (Rev. 19: 6)!</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">CHAPTER II SAMUEL (Continued) 1 SAM. 5-8</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">THE ARK AT ASHDOD; AT GATH; AT EKRON. WORK OF THE PHILISTINE LORDS. BETH-SHEMITES. KERJATH-JEARIMITES. WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES. DESIRING A KING.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AS WE SAW that the line of thought in 1 Sam. 3, 4, differed from that of 1 Sam. 1, 2, in that these two sets of two chapters did not type things chronologically successive, so the same remark applies to chapters 5, 6; for the things typed in these two chapters began in the second century of the Christian era and ended in the seventeenth century. The possibility of such a reaching so far back in this Age for the beginning of the antitype of these two chapters lies in the definition given to the antitypical ark of the covenant—the full depositary of God's arrangement as seen in the Truth due at any time in question. Another thing that suggests that the antitypes of chapter 5 reach so far back into the Age from our time is the nature of the antitypical Philistines and their five cities: antitypical Ashdod, Gath, Ekron, Askelon and Gaza (1 Sam. 6: 17) . For the Gospel Age the Philistines </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(villagers)</span><span class="font3"> represent sectarians at any time during the Age. Their five cities represent the five chief Gospel-Age sects, i.e., those that have been during this Age united with the state as state churches. These are the Greek Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, the Lutheran Church and the Calvinistic Church. Is. 19: 18 describes these five denominations. It calls them cities, because in Bible symbols a city represents a religious government. This we can see from the city of Babylon representing the nominal church as a religious government (Rev. 14: 8; 16: 19; 17: 5, 18;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">18: 2, 10, 16, 18, 19, 21), and from Jerusalem as representing the true Church (Matt. 5: 35 [the word, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">is,</span><span class="font3"> here means </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">types}',</span><span class="font3"> Is. 66: 13; Zech. 14: 4, 8, 17, 21; Rev. 21: 2, 10—22: 3). Accordingly, these five cities represent five religious governments, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> five religious denominations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) These five religious governments are spoken of in Is. 19: 18 as being in Egypt, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> symbolic Egypt, which is the present evil order of affairs (Is. 19: 1, 12-25; 20: 3-5; 30: 13; 31: 1-3; 52: 4; 63: 10-14; Rev. 11: 8). In symbolic Egypt antitypical Pharaoh, Satan, is king or god (Ex. 1—15; John 12: 31; 14: 30; 16: 11; 2 Cor. 4: 4; Eph. 2: 2). And certainly, these five denominations, united with the state, are in this Egypt in the sense of being parts of Satan's empire. They speak the language of Canaan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> of the Canaanites, error (Zech. 14: 21), not the language of the Hebrews, the Truth (Rev. 9: 11; 16: 16; Neh. 13: 24). All five of these have required consecration of their clergy and of their laity. It is true that in most cases the consecration was not a true one, but they required it to be made at the ordination of their clergy and at the confirmation of their laity, all five of them practicing confirmation in European countries, where they are united with the state (swear to the Lord of hosts, Is. 45: 23). And one shall be called, the city of destruction. This one is the Roman Catholic Church, to which such a name is applicable, not only because it goes into a more emphatic destruction than the others, but also because it has wrought destruction more emphatically than any of the other four denominations. These five denominations in the Gospel-Age picture that we are now studying are typed by the five cities of the Philistines. Our study will show us that Ashdod types the Greek Catholic Church, that Gath types the Roman Catholic Church and that Ekron types the Church of England. The other two cities represent the Lutheran and Calvinistic Churches, Askelon probably the Lutheran Church and Gaza probably the Calvinistic Church.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Perhaps later the Lord will give us certainty as to which types which; the most that we now can say thereon is &quot;probably.&quot; It is the typical significance of the three first-named cities that enables us to locate the time setting of this and the next chapter's antitypes. The general reasons why we understand Ashdod to type the Greek Catholic Church is the time setting and the fact that Chapter 5 gives it as the first of the three denominations especially afflicted by symbolic plagues, sifting errors and siftings; for the same general reasons we understand Gath to type the Roman Catholic Church in these two chapters; and for the same general reasons we understand Ekron to represent the Church of England. This will come out more clearly as we examine the details further on in this chapter.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) The ark of the covenant (1) at the time of the antitype of v. 1 was the doctrine that the Apostle John used to begin the movement that was later by crown-lost leaders perverted into the Greek Catholic Church. As we have already learned in EH, 225-236, this was the doctrine of our Lord's pre-human, human and post-human natures and offices as God's appointed Executive. As John gave this doctrine, and as Polycarp fostered it, it being the Truth then due, it was the antitypical ark of v. 1. Under the manipulation of crown-losers, like Justin Martyr, Origen, Dionisius of Rome, Athanasius, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory Nazianzen and Gregory Nyssa, gradually over a period of about 250 years while holding the office of our Lord more or less after a manner in harmony with St. John's teachings, they increasingly grossly perverted his teachings on our Lord's natures into the God-man theory. This perversion was completed by 381 A. D., at the second general council, the first of Constantinople, the God theory of it having been completed by 325, at the first general council of Nice. Hence, the stewardship doctrine of the Greek Catholic Church was more or less perverted, even as every other denomination of Christendom more or less perverted its stewardship doctrine. The antitypical Philistines (Greek Catholics) took the pertinent doctrine from the apostolic Truth (Eben-ezer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stone of help).</span><span class="font3"> Please note the difference in the antitypical significance of the Philistines, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> here from that of them in Chapter 4, though always they stand for sectarians. Ashdod </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(stronghold)</span><span class="font3"> here types the Greek Catholic Church, to which the crown-lost leaders pervertingly brought the stewardship doctrine under consideration. The bringing of the ark to the house of Dagon (2) types the efforts of the crown-lost leaders to harmonize it with the errors that they taught on Christ's person and office, and their setting it beside the image of Dagon types the crown-lost leaders' claim to have harmonized the two teachings. Dagon was an image consisting of a part fish and part man figure. His lower part was the image of the body of a fish without a head and his upper part was the image of the body of a man without legs. His lower part types the man in the God-man theory and his upper part types the God in the God-man theory. Hence Dagon types the nominal church's counterfeit theory of Christs natures. All the while the God-man theory was developing the Truth teachers refuted each of its developing phases (Dagon falling [the literal translation] upon his face to the earth before the ark, 3), the morrow of v. 3 representing the periods after each of such refutations up to the completion of the antitypical Dagon in 381; and the morrow of v. 4 representing the periods after each refutation up to the end of the monothelite controversy, as we will see later. We know that in the heathen religions Satan before Christ counterfeited every part of God's plan of which he could get glimpses, from its parts, as they were gradually revealed. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">E.g.,</span><span class="font3"> he knew from Gen. 3: 15 that the seed of the woman would do a delivering work, and from the expression </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">seed</span><span class="font3"> he concluded that the Deliverer would be human, but more than a human being, else He could not destroy Satan. This he apparently inferred also from Deut.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">18: 15-18, where he saw that a Prophet greater than Moses would come, as he also inferred this from Gen. 22: 17, 18, where the seed is veiledly referred to as heavenly and as bringing the race back from the dead, and from Gen. 49: 10; Num. 24: 17. The chief blessing that Gen. 9: 26, 27 assigns to them Satan also wove into his counterfeit Godman Messiah, Osiris, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) Hence he palmed off a counterfeit of this coming Deliverer as both human and spiritual, by the fish-man god of Ashdod, Dagon. And in due time he made a more exact counterfeit for Christendom; for we are not to forget that, while in the ancient heathen religions Satan, by conclusions erroneously based on God's gradually increasing revelation, sought to anticipate the Lord's plan by what he gave the heathen before the New Testament times, after the full revelation was given by Christ and the Apostles he counterfeited in the papacy every doctrine, practice and organizational feature of The Christ that in an entirety stood before his mental eyes in that revelation. And he used the speculative minds of the second, third and fourth centuries' crown-lost leaders as the means of palming off his counterfeit of our Lord's natures and His office. The mental twists and contortions of these crown-lost leaders produced the antitype of Dagon in the God-man theory. They had the hardest kind of mental gymnastics to perform in their efforts to harmonize even seemingly the teachings of St. John on Christ's natures and office, particularly the former, with their God-man theory. The deepest thinker of all of them, Augustine, had to admit that the God-man theory and the trinity, of which it was a part, were unexplainable. Additionally, they were unreasonable mysteries of iniquity. And all their efforts to make antitypical Dagon and the antitypical ark stand side by side, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> be in harmony with one another, dismally failed. This will appear not only from an analysis of the two opposing teachings as we now see them in the light of the Parousia and the Epiphany, but from a</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">knowledge of the history of the God-man theory from its outstart until it was completed at the first council of Constantinople, 381, where it was decreed as a doctrine of orthodoxy, with anathemas to eternal torment pronounced upon all who taught contrary to it.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) All sorts of foolish conclusions have been drawn from the God-man theory by its exponents. One of these is that Christ's humanity had no personality of its own, though it was alleged that it possesses its own intellect, sensibilities and will—the very essence of personality. Again, they taught that on account of its personal union with His divinity, His human nature shares in the use of the attributes of the Divine nature and vice versa, hence it is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> and that the Divine nature suffered, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> Hence they said that God suffered and died, that God was born of the virgin Mary and that Mary is the mother of God and the God-bearer. It was these latter expressions that occasioned a controversy that resulted in the antitype of the second falling of Dagon before the ark of the covenant (Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord, 4). Keeping in mind that the God-man theory was completed as a dogma of the so-called orthodox faith at the Council of Constantinople, 381, and keeping in mind the abovementioned absurd conclusions that it involves, and the consequent expressions flowing from it, we are prepared to see how such expressions would grate on the ears of reasonable men. The one who was most prominently so affected by these absurdities was Nestorious, the pious, eloquent and learned patriarch of Constantinople, who, next to the pope, was the most prominent churchman of the time. He was trained at Antioch, Syria, where the theology there entertained was opposed to such expressions. He brought with him from Antioch to Constantinople Anastasius, a presbyter, who was offended by the expressions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mother</span><span class="font3"> of God, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bearer</span><span class="font3"> of God, and called them to Nestorius' attention. The latter, handicapped by the hatred of Proclus, his unsuccessful rival for the Constantinoplitan See, by the rivalry of Cyril, patriarch of Alexandria, and by the resentment of Coelestine, patriarch of Rome, for his having protected the exiled Pelagians, began to denounce the view of the God-man that warranted such expressions to be used of it. He opposed it with a modified error that so emphasized both natures as contemporaneous in contrast with each other that it made Christ really two persons, which also was wrong (1 Cor. 8: 6). The error of both views is that they made Christ have, while on earth and since, two natures contemporaneously. The Truth on the subject is: Christ had only one nature at a time, though during the transition from the Logos to human nature the Logos' disposition was decreasingly had until it entirely passed away, changed into Jesus' human disposition, and during the transition from the human to the Divine nature the human disposition was decreasingly had until it was entirely changed into the Divine disposition in our Lord; but in each of these modes of existence He had only one nature at a time, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e..</span><span class="font3"> for the first, the Logos' nature, for the second, the human nature and for the third, the Divine nature. Hence while He was the Logos, He had only the Logos' nature; while He was a man, He had only the human nature (John 1: 14); and when He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15: 45), He had only the Divine nature. We might here say that at that time there were, apart from the true view, three views: (1) the one held by the Syrian theologians, that so separated the human and Divine natures while supposedly now existing in our Lord as to have made Him two persons; (2) the one held by the Alexandrians, which so fused the two natures supposedly existing now in our Lord as to have made them but one nature combined out of the two; and (3) the Roman view, that held the two natures now supposedly existing in our Lord as separate and distinct as natures, but forming a union into one person. The third view</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">united what the &quot;orthodox&quot; considered the truths in the other two views and avoided what the &quot;orthodox&quot; considered their errors. All three views are erroneous.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) The debate over this matter was long (428-444) and acrimonious, particularly on the side of Cyril of Alexandria, who was shrewd enough to conceal in his view what the Roman bishop would reject, and to emphasize in Nestorius' view what he knew the pope rejected, and in this tricky way he won the pope over to fight with him against Nestorius. In the same way he won over to his side the patriarch of Jerusalem and the bishop of Ephesus, there being then five patriarchs. Thus on one side were three patriarchs and on the other two: John of Antioch and Nestorius. And the entire Syrian Church, with their patriarch, John of Antioch, took Nestorius' side. The Emperor's family was also divided, some siding with Nestorius, and some, especially his sister Pulcheria </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(beauty),</span><span class="font3"> with Cyril. These two patriarchs were irreconcilably opposed. The pope (430) demanded that Nestorius recant within ten days; Cyril (430) held a synod at Alexandria through which he anathematized Nestorius on 12 counts. Nestorius returned the compliment on just as many counts. To settle the trouble the Emperor called the third general council, that at Ephesus (431). The Emperor and his plenipotentiary sided with Nestorius. Cyril appeared with many bishops and monks, the latter ready to vindicate their side with their fists. Additionally, the bishop of Ephesus had an immense retinue of bishops, priests, monks and laity who also were ready to use the same kind of proof for their orthodoxy. Before the bishops of the West, the pope's legates and the Syrian bishops arrived, Cyril in inordinate haste opened the council and had by </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">its infallible</span><span class="font3"> (?) decree Nestorianism condemned, Nestorius excommunicated and Cyril's 12 propositions adopted as the standard of orthodoxy. The pope's legates acknowledged the council's decrees as genuine; but not so the Emperor and his plenipotentiary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) During this and the subsequent disputes the Arians maintained the Truth as we gave it above; and thus they refuted both sides in the argument. This refutation and the following refutations are the antitype of Dagon falling to the ground face downward in the presence of the ark, losing head and hands (behold, Dagon was fallen [literally, falling—present participle] upon his face to the ground and the head of Dagon and both palms of his hands were cut off, 4). While active as to antitypical Ashdodites, all of the disputants for the two natures coexisting saw their Godman refuted (Dagon falling). Their efforts to save the antitypical Dagon from being refuted is the antitype of the efforts of the Ashdodites in setting up Dagon again in his place (3) . Thus the scene in v. 4 finds its antitype in the controversy on what in Church History are called: dyoprosopism or Nestorianism, the doctrine which virtually taught that since His carnation our Lord was, because of allegedly having two natures, two persons; monophysitism, the doctrine that the human and Divine natures are united by a mixture into but one nature—the Divine, and monothelitism, the doctrine that though Christ supposedly now has two natures they have but one will. The first of these was fought out first, as described above, then afterward the other two arose and were fought out. We will briefly explain the second and third controversies as the further antitype of v. 4. Cyril's successor, Dioscurus, though less acute than the former, exceeded him greatly in ill temper and tyranny. The aged head of a Constantinople monastery, called Eutyches, taught monophysitism, claiming that since Bethlehem our Lord had only the Divine nature and that His human body as the supposed body of God was not in substance like ours. First, Domnus, patriarch of Antioch, and then Theodoret, his chief theologian, intrigued against him, but in vain appealed to the Emperor against him. Then they began to write against him. Dioscurus, the patriarch of Alexandria, entered</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the hay on the side of Eutyches. He won over the Empress and the prime minister, and through these worked on the Emperor in his favor, resulting in the Emperor's passing severe measures against the Syrians, especially Theodoret, whom the Emperor forbade to pass out of his diocese. In a synod held under Flavian, patriarch of Constantinople (448) Eutyches was accused of heresy, and despite the Emperor's favor and protection was excommunicated and deposed as abbot of his monastery. He and Flavian appeared before Leo I of Rome for his favor; Leo, taking Flavian's side against Eutyches, wrote acutely against monophysitism. The Emperor called a general council at Ephesus (449) to discuss the question. Here Dioscurus presided and would not allow Flavian and his party to be heard. The absence of Theodoret, the chief opponent of monophysitism, by the Emperor's order above-mentioned, handicapped his side.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) This council was one of extreme arbitrariness and violence and is called in Church History the Robber Synod. It condemned the doctrine of two contemporaneous natures, and when Eusebius, bishop of Doretaeum, in Phrygia, sought to defend it, the Egyptians shouted, &quot;Away with him! Burn him! Tear him into two pieces, as he has tom the Christ.&quot; Both Flavian and Eusebius appealed to Pope Leo I, called the Great. But they were excommunicated and anathematized by the council. When certain bishops expostulated with Dioscurus, he called soldiers, monks, ruffians and an unruly rabble, who raised a riot. In it Flavian was killed and a speedy flight alone saved the Roman legates and Eusebius. Eutyches was restored and his leading opponents, Theodoret, Ibas and Domnus, one of the five patriarchs, were deposed and excommunicated. Under Leo's protest the Emperor changed sides. A new general council was called at Chalcedon (451), which deposed and banished Dioscurus and condemned monophysitism and Nestorianism, and decreed the following, dictated by Leo as orthodoxy:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Christ is true God and true man (dyophysitism), according to His Godhead begotten from eternity and like the Father in everything, according to His humanity born of Mary, the Virgin and God-bearer in time, and like to us men in everything, only without sin; and after His incarnation the unity of the person (monoprosopism) consists in two natures which are conjoined without mixture and without change, but also without rending and without separation.&quot; This council war marked with almost as much violence as &quot;the Robber Synod at Ephesus.&quot; The Egyptians, the monophysites, were as violent against Theodoret as their party had been against his supporters at the Synod of Ephesus. Years later in the efforts to win back the monophysites a concession was made by many, even by Pope Honorius (who is the classic example of a pope erring while speaking </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ex cathedra,</span><span class="font3"> and is an inescapable thorn in the sides of the infalliblists), to them, to the effect that, while, since His becoming human, our Lord has two natures, the false claim of orthodoxy, yet He had only one will. This question led to much controversy until the error was finally accepted as orthodox, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> that our Lord has since Bethlehem two contemporaneous wills. The Truth on the subject is that our Lord having only one nature at a time, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> as Logos, the pre-human Son of God, as the man, Jesus, the human Son of God, and since His resurrection, as the glorified Christ, Divine Son of God, there could not at any one time have been more than one will in Him, if His sinlessness is to be maintained. The one-will doctrine was called monothelitism (from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">monos,</span><span class="font3"> one and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thelema,</span><span class="font3"> will).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) All these heresies arose from the errors on the Son's alleged consubstantiality, coequality and coeternity with the Father, as a part of trinitarianism. From the standpoint of these three errors, from Bethlehem onward there had to be two natures held as subsisting in our Lord at once, leading to the gross error quoted above and decreed at Chalcedon, which</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">gross error condemned Nestorianism and monophysitism, and which logically from its wrong position involved the denial of monothelitism, when later it arose. All the time these errors were combating one another (for it will be noted that by them Satan was opposing the various forms of error against one another, so that the Truth on the subject would be forgotten), the Truth on these subjects was held by the Arians, and it overthrew both the contemporaneous two-natures idea and the form of the one-nature idea presented against that two-natures idea, and also overthrew the two-will and the one-will ideas as they were opposed to one another. The refutative effect of the Truth against the doctrine that finally became established as orthodox, one person in two contemporaneous natures with two wills, is also typed by Dagon's falling down and having his head and hands cut off, the two natures being represented in the human body and fish body and the one person as held by the orthodox in the severed head; and the refutative effect of the Truth against the doctrine that finally became established as orthodox, two contemporaneous wills in Christ: one in the human, the other in the Divine nature, is typed by Dagon's two hands being cut off—the will being the real active agency in personality, two wills are well typed by two hands, the active agents of one's body (4). The Ashdodite Philistines' arising on the morrow of v. 4 types the Greek Catholics' proceedings after each refutation by the Truth, i.e., in the Nestorian, in the monophysite and dyophysite (two natures) and in the monothelite (one will) controversy (arose early on the morrow, 4). The expression, only Dagon was left on him (the words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stump of,</span><span class="font3"> as shown by the italics, were interpolated), shows what the Truth left of the God-man theory; it left its antitype without any real will and without having a real personality. It is because the two contemporaneous natures and wills were officially declared to be the orthodox teachings that the type</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">does not specifically point out in v. 4 dyoprosopism, monophysitism and monothelitism. These, with their opposing errors, are brought out in the plague of vs. 6, 7, as will be later shown.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) The Greek Catholics, clergy and laity, proceed by mental steps to the theory of their God-man with two wills. But their thoughts (steps) pass over from figurative steps into figurative leaps in making their mental trips to the theory of their God-man with two wills (priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold [they leap over it] of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day, 5). That is, they stop thinking out the various mental steps that must be taken as to their God-man with two wills and spring to the conclusion, contrary to correct and Scriptural reasoning, which at the very entrance to this theory refutes it; and thus, not to tread upon the ground on which their theory lies prone in utter defeat, they jump over such Scriptural reasoning, i.e., evade it, under the plea that this is not a matter to reason out, but to be believed; hence they thus leap over the ground where their God-man with two wills lies refuted. And they continue this course unto the present and will continue it until their theory through Armageddon's devastations will utterly sever from it the exponents of that theory. Thus in vs. 3-5 we see typed the Truth (not the errors) controversies on the God-man with two natures, but in vs. 6, 7, we see the types of the great errors and siftings connected with these errors that set in among the antitypical Philistines in the Greek Catholic aspects. Above, we sketched only the controversies that were connected with the God-man with two wills, in order to show how the Truth refuted the involved errors, without referring to the great siftings that these occasioned among them. This is because vs. 3-5 type these controversies in so far as the Truth refuted them, without referring to the divisions that they occasioned and accompanied. These divisions and errors are typed in vs. 6, 7, which</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">will be taken up for our study now. In Bible types and symbols siftings, with the errors that are their heart, are set forth as plagues. This we have already seen in the types of the five great harvest siftings (1 Cor. 10: 5-14). The sixth sifting, i.e., the Epiphany sifting, with its errors, is set forth in Ps. 91: 6 as the pestilence that walketh in darkness. From all six of these the Parousia and Epiphany Little Flock is, in Ps. 91: 7-10, promised immunity for its faithfulness. And in principle such immunity from each error as it arose was promised to, and enjoyed by, the Little Flock always.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) But not so the unfaithful and the nominal people of God. As an illustration of the latter fact, the account in 1 Sam. 5: 6, 7 shows typically how the Greek Catholic Church was plagued and rent by these pestilences of error. The plague of vs. 6, 7 seems to be the bubonic plague, which is spread by rats and mice. This thought is suggested by the emerods of that plague and by the golden mice offered the Lord by the Philistines as an atonement. In describing above the errors and the conflicts on them, we did so in order to make clear what the errors were that the antitypical Ark, the Truth (brought out by St. John as the stewardship Truth of the Greek Catholic Church, by it more or less perverted), in its unperverted form refuted, viz., the God-man and two-wills-in-Christ theories. This made it necessary to say some things on the plague antitypical of vs. 6, 7. We will now explain other things on this plague. Let us remember that a symbolic plague is a sifting error and the sifting that it occasions. Thus seen, the abovedescribed errors were a part of the plague typed in vs. 6, 7. Now we will describe the other main sifting activities and resultant divisions that marked the antitypical plague. The ancient Greek mind was primarily a theoretical and speculative mind, contrasted with the practical mind of the Romans. In our times these two aptitudes are respectively well represented by the German mind, on the one hand, and the English and American mind,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">on the other hand. And the Greek speculative mind was exactly the kind of a mind for Satan's purposes in palming off, on the assumption that the basal error was true, in seemingly logical consistency various errors involved in the trinity and the God-man theories. To the speculative Greeks these mysteries (in truth, mix-upteries) were indeed a sweet morsel to roll on their symbolic tongues; for it was among the Greeks that the pertinent errors and siftings arose and were fought out. Nor must we conclude that only the theologians and clergy occupied themselves with these matters, though they, humanly speaking, originated them; additionally the so-called laity took an ardent part in them. For these questions were discussed by the families of the emperors and peasants, in the stores and shops, in the churches and homes, in synods and councils, in the factories and ships, in the market places and parks, in the barber shops, dressmaking shops and shoe shops, in the theatres and hippodromes, and in the Emperor's cabinets and courts. In a word, they were the principle topics of conversation and debate in all ranks of society and walks of life. Crowds even on the streets debated these questions and everywhere sides were taken. They were as lively topics of the day as the New Deal was in the 1936 campaign.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) Yes, indeed, on all hands sides were taken, households were divided, even in the Emperor's palaces various members of the imperial families were lined up on opposite sides, which lining up made parries of the various members of their officers and servants. Of course, the party spirit was enkindled and increased until there were great divisions made, the first of these being that between the so-called orthodox and the Nestorians. Literally millions left the Greek Catholic Church and organized the Nestorian Church, which included, first of all, a large party of the Syrian Church, whence Nestorius and his doctrine came; then it spread to Persia, where it took over the whole of that church as its adherents. Thence it passed on into</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">India; and in the dark age it spread widely in China and Tartary. Thus Nestorianism as a creed and as a sect was a part of the plague upon the orthodox. Part of it was also their own pertinent error. While Nestorianism was nearer the Truth than orthodoxy, to the orthodox it and orthodoxy's own errors were some of the emerods (great boils of the symbolic bubonic plague) upon the men of antitypical Ashdod (6; Greek Catholicism), and the antitypical coasts thereof (the Roman, Syrian, Egyptian, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> Catholics). The Lord smote them by putting His Word on the pertinent subjects in its peculiar form (the hand of the Lord was heavy upon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.),</span><span class="font3"> and by stirring up the sectarians, as well as the faithful, against them. The same things in principle were carried out as the antitype of v. 6 in the monophysite and monothelite controversies. Almost all of Egypt was committed to the monophysite teaching; and it and the breaking away of almost the entire Egyptian Church from the Greek Catholic Church, as well as the orthodox pertinent error, were the symbolic emerods on all the orthodox. Monothelitism was offered by some of the orthodox as a concession to the monophysites in the hope of winning them back to orthodoxy and the Greek Catholic Church. But the conciliators only stirred up more controversy and, while winning back some of the monophysites, made the consistent ones among them all the firmer against the orthodox. And as the Nestorians persist to our day in Syria, Persia, India, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> so in the Coptic Church of Egypt and Ethiopia the monophysites and monothelites continue to our times.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(13) Throughout these controversies on the two natures and two wills the so-called orthodox fought the truths on these subjects. Indeed, they began to fight the Truth on the various natures in Christ and His relation to the Father in His pre-human, human and post-human natures long before the dyoprosopic and monoprosopic, monophysite and dyophysite and monothelite and dyothelite controversies. As said above,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">about 140, through Justin Martyr, who introduced the human immortality and eternal torment theories into the Church from his Platonic philosophy, the first squints toward trinitarianism were made. Origen, about 235, introduced the Son's alleged coetemity with the Father, while yet holding to His subordination to the Father. Dionesius of Rome, about 270, introduced His alleged consubstantiality with the Father, and Athanasius, about 320, His alleged coequality with the Father. Each of these steps in the development of this gross error was taken against the protests of the defenders of the pertinent Truth that St. John set forth on the Son, that Polycarp fostered, that many others defended before Arius, and that the latter and his supporters defended against these gross errors. With his usual subtlety Satan set defenders of the extremes of error on these subjects against one another, that the Truth lying between these extremes might be lost from sight. This course marked the controversy from Origen's time until Arius in 318 stepped forth in the defense of the Truth against the errors of Christ's alleged coetemity, consubstantiality and coequality with the Father. The refutations of these three errors were the first of antitypical Dagoris falls in the presence of the antitypical Ark, while the truths brought out refutatively against the so-called orthodox views—dyophysitism and dyotheletism—in the Nestorian monophysite and monothelite controversies, were the antitypical Ark's second felling of antitypical Dagon and of its bereaving him of his head and hands. The efforts of the orthodox to refute and banish the pertinent Truth is the antitype of the Ashdodites' determining to send away the ark from their midst (The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, 7). This began with Origen's efforts to suppress the Truth on Christ's having been created in time as distinct from His being eternal. This started the first emerod on the Greek Catholics; Dionesius' error started the second; and Athanasius' invention started the third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Others came during the later controversies above-mentioned—the full fixing of the God-man theory at the first Council of Constantinople, 381, and the use of this doctrine against Nestorianism, monophysitism and monothelitism (His hand [the Lord's] is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god); for certainly the orthodox and their God-man were sorely put to it by the Truth during those four centuries of controversy. Their many subterfuges, twists and self-contradictions, their hiding in the hole of mystery (mix-uptery) and their inability to give a clear, reasonable answer to the Truth in these controversies, are the antitype of the statement, the men [leaders] of Ashdod saw that it was so.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) The calling and gathering together of the hierarchs in numerous councils and synods to discuss the involved questions were the antitypical calling and gathering together of the lords of the Philistines (8). And all of these gatherings decided to sendaway the pertinent Truth—reject the truths and anathematize its holders—from the Greek Catholic Church (answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath, the type of the Roman Catholic Church). It is noteworthy that in all these controversies the bishop of Rome was appealed to by the so-called orthodox Greeks; sometimes their antagonists did this also; and the pope (as is to be expected of Satan's special representative on earth) with but three exceptions, two of which are more or less doubtful as such, Pope Honorius being the only sure exception, gave the answers that were accepted as orthodox. This fact gave the pope more influence in these councils, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> than any other hierarch. There is also another thing typed in deciding to send and in actually sending the ark to Gath—it indicates typically the way of the transition of the Truth from tormenting the Greek to its tormenting the Roman Catholics: The Greeks ridded themselves from the necessity of defending the Truth that they in common with the Romans held on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">there being but one Church, which is the steward of the Truth and the agent of salvation; for they had plenty of occasions to raise the question controversially through the divisions that arose in their midst; but they did not so do, but left it to the Roman Catholics to fight out the controversies on that subject. In his sense also they sent the antitypical Ark to antitypical Gath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(wine or oil press,</span><span class="font3"> which certainly the Roman Catholic Church has been to the true Church). We have seen in these columns that through Irenaeus, about 180, the Lord gave the stewardship Truth that aroused a Little Flock movement, later perverted by crown-losers, especially by Cyprian and Augustine, respectively of Carthage and Hyppo, of North Africa, into the Roman Catholic Church. It was about 251 that Cyprian began to pervert this doctrine by setting forth the one Church as being summed up in the bishops as the alleged successors of the Apostles.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) Cyprian started the course that raised this emerod (they had emerods, 9) on the members of the Roman Catholic Church as follows: There were divergent views in the Carthage Church on how to treat those who in times of persecution abjured Christ. Some favored a mild course, allowing them to come back with a mild acknowledgment of this wrong; others a stricter course, refusing to receive such at all. Cyprian at first favored the latter course. When he returned, 251, from his flight to the desert during the Decian persecution, the mild party fought him. This resulted in a division. Cyprian set forth the thought that in separating themselves from him, their bishop, they severed themselves from the Catholic Church, whose unity, he alleged, is centered in its bishops as successors of the Apostles. When the persecution was renewed Cyprian went over very largely to the milder practice of the other party, and thus he ended the schism at Carthage. But the same questions arose in disputes at Rome. The party that stood for the strict practice came under the lead of a presbyter, Novatian.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The Roman bishop Cornelius (251-253) stood for the mild practice. Novatus, the leader of the mild party at Carthage, fought Cyprian for his strict practice, for which Cyprian excommunicated him. Thereupon Novatus went to Rome. There he took up with the strict practice group; and with it he opposed Cornelius' mild practice. He did this under the lead of Novatian, the unsuccessful candidate for the bishopric of Rome as against Cornelius, in 251, and the leader of the strict party in the Roman Church. In the strife a division came; and the rigorists elected Novatian as their bishop. Both heads of these parties by correspondence and messengers sought to obtain the recognition of the most celebrated churches. Cornelius falsely represented Novatian, who was a blameless man and elder, as a monster, intriguer and long-standing evil-doer. Cyprian, and Dionesius, head of the Church of Alexandria, took sides with Cornelius, the former being in part influenced thereto by Novatus' adherence to Novatian. Forgetful of the facts that he had up to very recently espoused the same principles as Novatian, and that for those principles he had excommunicated Novatus, Cyprian with the zeal of a new convert attacked Novatian's view to the effect that while Christ might forgive His deniers and gross sinners who fall after their baptism, the Church as the communion of saints had no right to absolve them, even after they had undergone ecclesiastical repentance; for Novatian argued that the Church consists and must consist of the pure only. Both sides went to an extreme. The Novatianists spread all over the Roman Empire, having many and large churches, and stood with the orthodox in their controversies against the Arians. The Council of Nice, 325, consisting in the main of the Greeks, maintained a friendly attitude toward them, so did the first Council of Constantinople (381), though in the mean time the Occidental Church (Romanist) persecuted then as heretics, but Emperor Honorius, who in the West succeeded Theodosius, the convener</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of the first Constantinopolitan council, persecuted them, at the instigation of the Occidental Church. The Novatianists persisted into the 6th century.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(16) Both sides had some truth and some error. The error of the Novatianists was that they attempted to cast sinning ones as crown-losers out of the true Church, a thing that must be left to the Lord alone, who forbade such judging until the Second Advent (1 Cor. 4: 5) . Moreover, He forbade a judging between wheat and tares before that time (Matt. 13: 28, 29). Yea, the fulfilment of the parable's prohibition occurred during the pertinent controversies. But a worse error was on the other side—the loss of the thought that the true Church consists of the saintly only, and the defense of the thought that the true Church consisted of all who profess faith in Christ, living under and in obedience to the bishops as the center of the Church's unity. This second thought Cyprian elaborated in his celebrated treatise on The Unity Of The Church. Here, then, we see the first antitypical emerod breaking forth on the leaders and led of antitypical Gath (and they had emerods [the expression, in their secret parts, is a mistranslation; it is in fact an interpolation], 9). Here, then, the hand of the Lord (9) is seen to be heavy on the Roman Catholic leaders and their leadings as well. It was indeed a very great destruction from the Lord. But 60 years later a greater and longer-drawn-out controversy over practically the same question broke out and made a by far greater division in the Roman Catholic Church. We refer to the Donatist controversy, which continued from 311 to 415. As the root question was practically the same as that in the Novatianist controversy, we need not here enter into its details. The Donatists were the strict party that wanted only saints in their churches. The Catholics, claiming that the Church consists of all professed Christians who are united under obedience to the bishops as successors of the Apostles, objected to the excommunicating of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">everybody who did not seem to be saintly, as practiced by the Donatists. The controversy spread all over North Africa. The Emperor, the bishop of Rome and a great Western synod at Arles, 314, decided against the Donatists. Persecution set in against them, which but increased their zeal, as always in the sincere.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) They rebelled against the civil power, which brought the army out against them, none of which things crushed them. So things continued throughout the fourth century. In 400 Augustine started his long-drawn-out controversy with them, in general using the same truths and errors against their error as Cyprian did, but with greater dialectical skill. He at first counseled mild measures, but their stubbornness moved him to advocate, on a misapplication of Luke 14: 23, the use of force (the word should be rendered, constrain, not compel) to draw them back from damnation into the ship of salvation. Thus Augustine became the father of the doctrine that force should be applied to heretics to restore them to the Church, a principle that reached the height of its hideousness in the crusades against heretics and in the Inquisition. Previously, he had sought to draw their leaders into a debate with him; but they declined, fearing his superior ability as a debater. Finally, they were by the Emperor forced to enter into a debate which was held at Carthage, 411, Petelian and Primian being the chief Donatist debaters and Augustine and Aurelian the chief Catholic debaters, and 279 Donatists and 286 Catholic bishops being in attendance. No real results were gained thereby. In 415 the Donatists were by the Emperor declared bereaved of all rights and death was threatened upon all who attended their meetings. The Vandals (Arians) in conquering Africa oppressed both Donatists and Catholics as being both in the wrong. This led to the reunion of Donatists and Catholics. In this controversy the question was also debated as to whether bishops who were unbishoply in character forfeited their powers as bishops, and thus could perform no valid bishoply acts, like the valid administration of the sacraments and the valid conference of ordination, confirmation and absolution, the Catholics affirming that they could, and the Donatists that they could not. Both of these parties erred in ascribing the conference of grace by the mere application of the sacraments and other sacred rites just mentioned. Had they held to the truth that neither water baptism nor the Lord's Supper conferred grace, but that grace came through the actualities symbolized by these two acts and that the other three rites were human inventions, they would have seen that they were debating the extremes of error against one another and were forgetting the pertinent Divine Truth altogether. As a result of this phase of the debate the Roman Catholics had another antitypical emerods break out on them, /. e., that the sacraments of themselves convey grace where no stubborn resistance is offered to their administration. The Truth on these controverted subjects in the Donatist controversy was especially defended by Tichonius, a member of the Pergamos star.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(18) But the worst of all of the antitypical emerods that broke out upon the Roman Catholic leaders and leadings were the further developments of the hierarchical idea. This was embedded in the doctrine of the Apostolic succession of bishops, and out of this view sprang its higher expression: Archbishops over the bishops in the various provinces of the Empire; five patriarchs of equal standing in the entire Church over the archbishops; and finally, the pope as supreme, supported by his college of cardinals, who were originally the presiding priests in the various churches at Rome, and who were later exalted over all archbishops, but not over the other four patriarchs, for the reason that in the meantime they became Greek as opposed to Roman Catholic patriarchs. These antitypical emerods reached their most festering and foul condition in the exaltation of the pope to absolute supremacy and infallibility. While there were minor differences between the Greek and Roman Catholics that led up to temporary divisions among them, like the 35 years' division due to the monophysite controversy and the split of 50 years due to Pope Vigilius' vacillation during the later parts of the monophysite controversy, connected with the Emperors' efforts to make peace, new fuel was added to the fiery feeling between the East and the West over the monothelite controversy, on account of Pope Honorius' heresy making a division, which was soon healed, following his excommunication and anathematization by a general council. But the Trullan Council at Constantinople, 692, added more fuel to the fires burning between the two halves of the Catholic Church. There were six matters there passed displeasing to Rome: (1) Disapproving certain of Rome's canons and approving 35 of which Rome disapproved. (2) Disapproving Rome's enforcement of the celibacy of the presbyters and bishops. (3) Forbidding certain of Rome's enjoined fasts. (4) Renewing the decree of the Council of Chalcedon, predicating the equality of the patriarch of Constantinople with the pope. (5) Disapproving Rome's permission to drink blood and eat things strangled, forbidden by God (Gen. 9: 4), when He gave them permission to eat meat, as the Apostles also charged (Acts 15: 29). And (6) prohibiting the Roman custom of representing Christ by a lamb, a thing quite general in the West.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(19) These six points stirred up more or less feeling between the two parts of Catholicism, and later, especially point (4), were to play an important role in the separation between the Greek and Roman Catholic Churches. Rome's continued and increasing claims of the pope's supremacy, which was at the background of many practical differences between the East and the West, at last made the breach so wide as to lead to a final division between the Greek Catholic and the Roman Catholic Churches. Photius, the patriarch of Constantinople, 867, held with the eastern patriarchs a council at Constantinople and charged the popes with</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">falsifying the creed by adding to it the phrase that the Holy Spirit in their sense proceeded from the Father </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and the Son. </span><span class="font3">This resulted in great controversies, with reciprocal anathemas and conspiracies on both sides. These differences came to a head in the controversies between Caerularius, patriarch of Constantinople, and Pope Leo IX. The result was that, while hitherto their reciprocal anathemas had been hurled at individuals and their followers, now, in 1054, the pope excommunicated the whole Greek Catholic Church; and the four Greek patriarchs returned the compliment solemnly to the whole Roman Catholic Church—the papal supremacy being at the root of the trouble. Despite many efforts at reunion, none was ever achieved. Thus each antitypical emerod (error) led to a division among the Roman Catholics, in fulfilment of v. 9.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) We now come to a study of the antitype of v. 10, which types the Church of England. The Roman Catholics' worst emerod, the unify of the Church is summed up in the absolute supremacy and infallibility, of the pope, was the cause of the Church of England's coming into existence as a sect, separate and distinct from Romanism; hence Rome's pertinent emerod made this division also. This will appear as the facts are considered, surrounding the presentation of the stewardship Truth of the Church of England, which was used by Thomas Cranmer, supported by Hugh Latimer especially, to start a Little Flock movement, later by crownlosers perverted into the Church of England. The circumstance that led to the promulgation of the pertinent Truth was this: Henry VIII of England, for whom no Truth person would hold a brief, was right in being conscience-troubled over his marriage to his brother's widow, a thing forced upon him by his father, Henry VII, against his solemn protest. It is not necessary for us to go into the pertinent details here, since 'we have already given them in EH, 254-265. Suffice it to say that due to the pope's temporizing on the matter of the divorce, the question was raised by Cranmer as to who had the right to grant divorce, the pope or the civil power. Cranmer answered the question as follows: The State, not the Church. He gave two main reasons for it: (1) Marriage, being an earthly, not a spiritual matter, was subject to the rules set up by the State, according to God's ordinance. (2) The Church in earthly matters is subject to the State, not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa,</span><span class="font3"> as Rome claimed. Hence, as Rome views the question, in ultimate analysis the matter of Henry's marital relation touched the question of the unity of the Church as being in an infallible and sovereign pontiff—one of Rome's worst emerods; hence Rome stood out for its alleged powers in the matter. This resulted in the English Church separating from Rome, and the resultant controversy was the sending of the antitypical Ark from antitypical Gath to antitypical Ekron (Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">settlement, </span><span class="font3">10). And in the Church of England a resultant deadly destruction went on (for there was a deadly destruction, 11), and certainly the Lord permissively sent them many emerods, as we will now proceed to show (the hand of God was very heavy there) from the many pertinent facts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(21) Let us not forget that the Truth which Thomas Cranmer, especially supported by Hugh Larimer, taught was the following: God has subjected the true Church in civil matters to the civil powers. Of course, God did not subject The Christ to the civil powers in spiritual matters; for it is His will that The Christ preserve the Truth and its Spirit against all assaults from the civil powers or from any other human source (Acts 5: 29). Hence only in His earthly interests was the Christ subject to the civil powers (Rom. 13: 1-6; 1 Pet. 2: 13-16). But Catholics being used to having an earthly head, the Church of England as such accepted the English king as its &quot;head under God,&quot; who was, therefore, in the pope's stead made &quot;by the grace of God [Divine right] under God head of the Church of England.&quot; This was the first and chief emerod (12) that afflicted the clergy and laity</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of the Church of England, and it proved to be a sore boil indeed, as the after history of the English Church proves. This made the tyrant, Henry VIII, control the English Church at the outstart of Cranmer's promulgation of the pertinent Truth and of the Anglican Church's separation from Rome (as the ark of God entered Ekron, 10), and he used that control in matters of doctrine, organization and practice to the great injury of the Reformation. Hence he gave a Romanist doctrinal setting to the Church of England, which on his death was considerably modified in an antiRomanist sense. He appointed the hierarchy and decided its form, and he maintained most of Rome's evil practices, including the burning of heretics. He had a law enacted called the Six Articles, which must be believed in England, requiring the following points: (1) transubstantiation; (2) non-necessity of communion in both elements; (3) celibacy of the clergy; (4) obligatoriness of all vows; (5) private masses; and (6) auricular confession. Unconditional burning was the penalty for denying the first; and for the others deprivation of goods and imprisonment for the first offense, and death as felons for the second. The marriage of priests, monks and nuns were dissolved. If they married again they were to be hanged. Abstaining from attending mass and confession was held as offenses against these articles. Under former laws, if heresy was abjured the abjurer was spared; under this, whether he abjured or not, he was unconditionally exposed to its penalties. This was the most bloodthirsty law ever inscribed in English law books, and Henry VIII originated it, required its passage and saw to its enforcement. Hence, almost solely apart from the question of papal supremacy Henry was a bigoted (Roman) Catholic. At least 30 were put to death under this law. There were, according to Burnet, the historian of the Anglican Reformation, at one time 500 persons in prison by virtue of its penalties. All these six laws, or one law in six parts, were antitypical emerods that came upon the clergy and laity of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Church of England by virtue of the antitypical emerod, that the king was by the grace of God under God head of the Church of England, which doctrine was a gross perversion of the stewardship Truth of the Church of England, that The Christ is by God subject in earthly matters to the civil power, and not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) Henry VIII died in 1547 and was succeeded by his son, Edward VI, a mere lad, but a sincere Protestant. Guardianed, trained and influenced by Cranmer, he favored Protestant reforms in doctrine more on Calvin's than on Luther's foundations. Under him the law on the six articles was revoked, Romanists were tolerated but not favored, the book of Common Prayer was promulgated and a confession of faith in 42 articles was sanctioned by law, both these devotional and doctrinal features being, with Ridley's help, largely Cranmer's work, who as a part of antitypical captive Samson ground out the grain for the antitypical Philistines. This service book and confession of faith proved to contain some more emerods. In these 42 articles as a matter doctrine the king's headship was set forth and this error was soon (in Mary's days) to produce worse results than it effected in the days of Henry VIII; for Edward VI died in 1553, before attaining his majority, his nominee as successor, a cousin, Lady Jane Gray, a real Protestant, was set aside and a bigoted Romanist, Mary, a daughter of Henry VIII, ascended England's throne. She dismissed all Protestant high officials, beheaded Lady Jane, her husband and father, and charged those, including Cranmer, who advised her successorship, with treason, beheading all of them, except Cranmer, whom she spared to reserve him for burning as a heretic. All the pro-Protestant laws of Edward VI she then abrogated and reinstated the law of her father, Henry VIII, on the six articles. Then she reinstated Romanism as the state church. While she annulled the law making England's sovereign head of the church, which for her the pope was, she used all the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">power that that law gave the sovereign in restoring and operating Romanism. All Protestant bishops were displaced by Romanists. Those who could not escape she imprisoned. The bigoted Bishop Gardiner, made prime minister, enforced the law on the six articles. The Protestant leaders were all imprisoned, the bones of their eminent dead leaders were exhumed and burned, and married priests with their wives and children were by the thousands driven out of the land. In 1554 the exiled Cardinal Pole returned as papal legate, absolved the penitent kneeling Parliament and received back into the Romish den all England. The next year, 1555, the literal fires of persecution were lit at Mary's order, who, therefore, became known as bloody Mary, and whose cruelty became so great that almost the whole nation, ashamed of having such a fiend on England's throne, hated her and rejoiced at her death, 1558.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) The persecution was indeed a very sore one. The legal records of the burning of 288 Protestants have been discovered, and how many more (for there were more) were burned cannot now be proved by the records of men; but we may be sure the Lord has kept an accurate record of this barbarity and will publish it to the praise of His name and the vindication of His suffering children. During 1555, among many other Protestants, four Protestant bishops: Latimer, Ridley, Ferrar and Hooker, were burned; and Archbishop Cranmer, the primate of all England under Henry VIII and Edward VI, a Philadelphia star-member, was burned the next year. In 1554 Mary had married Philip II of Spain, one of the most bigoted and cruel Romanist monarchs of all times, who kept arousing Mary to her persecuting career, for especially from the time of her espousal and marriage onward she acted the persecutor in true Spanish style. His return to Spain in 1555, never again returning, greatly depressed her, which made her hate and persecute Protestantism all the more. She instituted a heresy tribunal after the pattern of the Spanish Inquisition under the presidency of &quot;bloody Bonner,&quot; bishop of London, who consigned to the flames crowds of faithful Protestants, clerical and lay, men and women, old and young. Beside those who were burned at the stake, literally thousands died of starvation and exposure for their faith, while awaiting trial for heresy, in Englands prisons; for in those days the prisons were not heated, nor did jailers feed or medicate the accused, who had to starve unless friends fed them. After the persecution had raged for nearly five years Mary died of a rupture of the heart and dropsy, unwept, unmoumed and unloved, a female hyena in human form. As though by a providential visitation nearly all of her main assistants in persecution died within a year of her death, some just before, some just after it. Of all Englands sovereigns she easily carries off the palm for cruelty, inhumanity and bigotry. Her persecuring course raised up in England such hatred for Rome, as the embodiment of cruelty, as has not yet, after nearly four centuries, died out. The terrible suffering and many deaths incident to Mary's persecution were a part of the deadly destruction throughout the Church of England (there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city, 11). The sufferings and deaths due to Henry's persecution were also a part of these deadly destructions. But these were not all of them; some more of these came in Elizabeth's day; yea, also in the days of James I, Charles I and II and James II, all of them more or less due to making England's sovereigns head of the Church of England, and all of them acting as though they were such. While the Romanists, bloody Mary and James II, refused to use the title, they did use the power of that office, in favor of the pope, as loyal Romanists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) At Mary's death Elizabeth, the only then living child of Henry VIII, Mary's half-sister, ascended the throne. How she faced the exacting problems germane to the political and religious situation in England and Europe, we described with some detail in EH, 272-278.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">However, she accepted the position of head of the Church of England. Cranmer had educated her in the Protestant faith of her mother, Anne Boleyn, who, though innocent, was by Henry VIII beheaded, under the accusation of adultery. She was one of the ablest sovereigns that ever lived; and her 45 years' reign almost obliterated Romanism from England. She abrogated the law on the six articles, stopped the persecution of Protestants, burned no Romanists for heresy, though she caused not a few of them to be beheaded for treason, especially for attempting to depose her and to assassinate her. She proceeded with great prudence and moderarion, so that the pope for a while was deceived into believing her to be a Romanist. In 1559 Parliament passed the Act of Uniformity, which reasserted the royal supremacy over the Church, fixed penalties of loss of goods, imprisonment and exile for perversion to Romanism, and death for a repetition, as treason to the country. It was the pope's, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> attitude and course in the Marian persecutions, a repetition of which would have been ruinous to the country, that caused Elizabeth to declare the effort to embrace, spread and reintroduce Romanism as treason to the country; for such it is in deed and in truth, because of Romanists' doubled allegiance, the allegiance to the pope superseding that to the state in case of conflict between them. A revision of the book of Common Prayer was made. Cranmer's 42 articles were reduced to 39 and adopted as the creed of the Angelican Church. As adopted, the 39 articles swerved away from the Calvinistic character of the 42 articles and took on a form half-way between Calvinism and Lutheranism. These 39 articles were adopted by convocation in 1562, and were made a fundamental law of the land by Parliament in 1572, subjecting all England thereto.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(25) Thus the Anglican Church was set up by law as the state church, with an episcopal form of government, claiming Apostolic succession, under royal supremacy. It thus became the law of the land that uniformity of worship with diversity of creeds was to be practiced; hence severe penalties were meted out on attendance at other than Anglican Church services, attendance thereat being compulsory. This caused persecution to fall to the lot of non-conformists, and endless troubles to come between Anglicans, on the one hand, Puritans (Presbyterians), Independents (Congregationalists, Baptists and Quakers), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> on the other hand, leading to house searching, to torture of the suspected and to not a few deaths for treason, as nonconformity was regarded. Thus the Act of Uniformity proved to be another emerod, and caused endless troubles with the non-conformists, which those who would not accept and practice uniformity were called. And these troubles increased in England during the days of James I, 1603-1625, in the sense that the nonconformists increased in numbers and power. James' son, Charles I, 1625-1649, even more arbitrary than his father, sought with his Divine-rights ideas to down the ever-increasing nonconformists in church and state, and exercised such tyranny as to rule for years without Parliament, and through England's primate, Laud, sought to high-church the Church of England and to suppress the non-conformists, to such a degree as to force a bloody and long-drawn-out revolution, as a result of which both he and Laud were beheaded. Then followed the ascendancy of the Puritans and Cromwell's protectorship, with all the bloodshed attending the various religious wars at that time in England, Ireland and Scotland. When the son of Charles I, Charles II, was restored, the Church of England again became the state church, but persecution of the Puritans was diminished. And to offset Charles' favoring Catholicism Parliament passed the Test Act, requiring all civil, military and naval officers to deny under oath transubstantiation, the worship of saints and allegiance to the pope, as well as to be communicants in the state church. Charles II died, surrounded by his many mistresses and bastard children, after</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">receiving papal communion and extreme unction. His brother, James, was a bigoted Romanist, who in Rome's interests decreed religious liberty, and then proceeded to fill all civil, military and naval offices in England with papists. Then he started on a course intended to disestablish the Anglican Church, preparatory to introducing the Romanist Church. This led to a revolution, in which, as James II declared, for the mass he lost three kingdoms: England, Scotland and Ireland; for the Protestants called in from the Netherlands James' son-in-law, William of Orange, in 1688, as their leader, by whom James II in England and Ireland was defeated. His and his Irish Catholic army's defeat at the River Boyne, Ireland, July 12, 1690, still celebrated by the Irish Protestants and Orangemen, ended Rome's serious blows at English Protestantism. William's Toleration Act exempted all English non-conformists, but not papists, because of their double allegiance, from all civil disabilities. Thus we see that the royal supremacy as a most malignant ulcer— emerod—wrought deadly destruction in England for over 150 years. Indeed, the Lord's hand was heavy upon the Anglican Church and England because of this emerod.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(26) Above, without detailed references to vs. 1012, we have given their antitypes. We will now briefly summarize the antitypes. After the stewardship Truth given by Cranmer made its entrance into, and spread over the Anglican Church (after they had carried it about, 9), trouble began to come upon its members (a very great destruction) through the error of the royal supremacy in the Church, as we saw in the pertinent acts of the English sovereigns from Henry VIII to James II; for the Lord permitted this trouble because of the great error (emerod) on the sovereign being head of the Church (the hand of the Lord was against the city). Certainly, trouble was upon all of them, high and low alike, during those over 150 years, particularly during the first 70 of them, due to this great error and its evil consequences (He smote the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods). While v. 9 applies to antitypical Gath, the things there typed are the same in principle as those that came upon the men of antitypical Ekron, hence we used v. 9 to illustrate the principles operative in antitypical Ekron. Note that just as the antitypical Ark entered antitypical Ekron trouble started, as Henry began, immediately after Cranmer's true teachings went forth, to insist on his headship in the Church of England (as the ark of God came to Ekron, 10). And the antitypical Ekronites began to cry out against the troubles incidental to the immediate abuse of the pertinent stewardship Truth, as the facts given above prove (the ark of God ... to slay </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">me</span><span class="font3"> [so the Hebrew] and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my</span><span class="font3"> [so the Hebrew] people). The leaders of the Anglican Church sent for help to the leaders of other churches, some sending for Lutherans (in Henry's day), others for Calvinists (in Edward's day); some to Romanists (in Mary's day) and some to the Greek Catholics (in Elizabeth's and James I's day), to counsel over how they could rid themselves of their evils, actually due to their misusing the stewardship Truth (sent and gathered the lords of the Philistines, 11) . The gatherings were in the many councils, synods, colloquies and convocations of those days, as we will show when explaining 1 Sam. 6. The Anglicans briefly explained their sad experiences to the antitypical lords of the Philistines, and that by the experiences themselves (said, Send away . . . very heavy there). In v. 12 we are not to understand that those who died were not smitten by emerods and that those who did not die were. Rather, all were so smitten, some mortally, others not mortally. This types the fact that some of those who were injured by the gross error became through their gross errors Second Deathers, others not (And the men that died not were smitten with emerods, v. 12). Certainly, the great sufferings in persecutions, wars, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> occasioned such distress as touched God (the cry . . . went up to heaven).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(27) From our study of 1 Sam. 5 we have learned that sectarians (Philistines, 1 Sam. 6: 1) began to exercise control as to Truth teachings from early in the Smyrna period, i.e., from about 140 A. D., and, gradually securing that control, kept it until about the middle of the sixteenth century, when they began to relinquish it. This means that gradually one after another the five involved denominations, the Roman Catholics (1564), the Anglicans (1572), the Lutherans (1577), the Calvinists (1581) and the Greek Catholics (1576) , began to let go their hold upon the truths of God's Word, and dismissed them from their midst at the dates just indicated for each one. Thus the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">completed</span><span class="font3"> period from 140 A. D. to about 1581 is the antitype of the seven months of v. 1. Just before the end of this period, varying with each denomination, as the abovegiven dates indicate, each of the denominations set into operation the antitype of v. 2; for in each of these denominations there was a gathering together (called for, 2) in council, synod or convocation, accordingly as they variously called their authorized legislative bodies, of their higher ecclesiastics (priests) and theologians (diviners) to pass such ecclesiastic teachings and laws as would in creed form be their authorized confessions of faith and practice, by which they dismissed the antitypical Ark. We are not to understand that in so many words such leaders inquired in each denomination of one another how they could get rid of God's Truth as due. (What shall we do to the ark of the Lord? Tell us [literally, Cause us to be made to know] wherewith we shall send it to his place). Rather, as we have often seen, typical speeches are usually antityped in pantomime; what these leaders sought and did was ridding themselves of what really was the Truth as due, though they regarded it as error to be put aside.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) This will appear from a short study of how the antitype was fulfilled in each of these five denominations. The Reformation movements struck hard blows, first of all at Rome. Thus the Lutheran, Calvinistic and Anglican Churches by their stewardship truths struck Rome hard blows; and she sought to defend herself against these blows. Among other ways, she sought to do this through calling the Council of Trent (1541-1543, 1549, 1563-1564), to discuss the involved questions, to define her attitude thereon and to set forth her pertinent defenses and attacks. But, from the Divine standpoint, what they were actually doing was discussing and arranging ways and means to cast off the due Truth from their midst (Cause us to be made to know wherewith we shall send it to his place). The Anglican Church received such blows against her doctrine of royal supremacy in the Church from Romanist, Lutheran, Calvinistic and Independent sources that to defend herself against these she called a convocation together in 1562 and Parliament in 1572, to legislate on this matter. Actually, from the Divine standpoint, their object was to get rid of the pertinent Truth due on the subject. The Lutheran Church received such blows against her doctrine of total depravity (one of her chief emerods), of the real presence and the communication of the Divine attributes to Christ's human nature, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> from Romanist, Greek, Calvinistic and certain Lutheran sources, that to defend herself against these she gathered her chief theologians, 1574-1577, to draw up arguments thereon. Actually, from the Divine standpoint, her object was to get rid of the pertinent Truth due on the subject. The Calvinistic Church received such blows from. Roman, Greek, Lutheran, Anglican and certain Calvinistic sources against her emerod on absolute predestination to eternal life and eternal torment, that to defend herself against these she called in various countries and times various synods, to legislate thereon. Actually, from the Divine standpoint, her object was to send away the antitypical Ark from her midst. The Greek Catholic Church, suffering blows from Lutheran and Calvinistic sources against her mass and Apostolic succession, and under blows from the Unitarians</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">against her trinitarianism, God-manism, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to defend herself against these called the Council of Jerusalem, 1672, to give creedal authority to the reply of Jeremiah II, Patriarch of Constantinople, issued in 1576 thereon. Actually, from the Divine standpoint, these were gatherings to send away the antitypical Ark from their midst. Thus was antityped v. 2.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(29) The antitypes of vs. 3-11 occurred at councils, synods and convocations. We would remark that, as usual with speeches, the antitype of the speeches of vs. 3-9 occurred in pantomime. The period from 1530 to 1581 above all other periods in Church history was marked by the meetings of creed-making councils, synods and convocations. The Augsburg Confession, with its Apology, the joint product of a number of Lutheran theologians, Melanchthon being the principal worker thereon, the Schmalcald Articles, written by Luther and signed by the leading Lutheran theologians, his small and large Catechisms and the Epitome, 1576, and Solid Declaration, 1577, of the Formula of Concord, prepared by a number of Lutheran theologians, Andreae being the main author of the former, and Chemnitz the main author of the latter, were all in 1580 incorporated in the Book of Concord, the special creed of the Lutheran Church. The first five of these creedal expressions were brought into existence through the conflict with Rome and the Formula of Concord through the controversies that arose after Luther's death among the Lutheran theologians themselves. It was Chemnitz's part in such creed-making that effected his fall from the Little Flock, a member of which he was while writing the ablest anti-Romanist work of all times, his four-volumed work entitled, The Examination of the Decrees and Canons of the Council of Trent. On the Romanist side the Council of Trent, which sat intermittently, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> 1541-1543, 1549 and 1563-1564, was the great creed-maker of Romanism, publishing its decrees and canons in 1564, in which are refined the Romanist views contrasted with those of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">non-Romanist Churches, particularly their views as against those of Greek Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism and Anglicanism. Its creed-making was supplemented by the work of Pius IX, who </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ex cathedra, i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> officially as pope speaking to the entire Church, in 1854 decreed the Immaculate Conception of Mary, in 1864 issued the Syllabus Of The Principal Errors Of Our Time, and through the Vatican Council of 1870 proclaimed its decrees on the supremacy, absolute authority and infallibility of the pope as Christ's vicar. However pertinent to the Romanist creed these utterances of Pius IX are, they are not included in the things typed by 1 Sam. 6: 1-12.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(30) In paragraph (22), among other things, we showed how Cranmer, aided by Ridley, prepared the 42 articles of the Church of England, largely in a Calvinistic sense, in the days of Edward VI, as a creed for the Anglican Church, and how the convocation in 1562 revised these articles into a sense midway between Calvinism and Lutheranism and reduced them to 39, which, ever since Parliament's legalizing them in 1572, have been the creed of the Anglican Church. While the Lutheran creeds drawn up in Germany between 1530 and 1577 were accepted by the Lutheran churches in countries outside of Germany, the Calvinists of each country where they became the dominant, or a more or less influential Church, drew up for their churches in the involved countries separate creeds. Thus for Switzerland they drew up the Second (1566) Helvetic Confession; for Germany, the Heidelberg Catechism (1563); for France, the Gallican Confession (1559); for Belgium, the Belgic Confession (1561); for Scotland, the Second (1581) Scotch Confession. Later Calvinistic Confessions do not enter into the antitype of 1 Sam. 6. The Greek Church, in a writing of Jeremiah II, Patriarch of Constantinople, co-operated with in its production by a number of higher clerics and theologians, 1576, rejected Romanism, Lutheranism and Calvinism; but she did not deem it necessary to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">decree this rejection as her creed for nearly a century later, when the Synod of Jerusalem, 1672, approved Jeremiah IPs confession and gave it creedal sanction as the doctrine of the Greek Catholic Church. Thus we see that the creedal views of all five of the pertinent denominations were issued by 1581, as a final time-point. And this, we see, is the period to which 1 Sam. 6 assigns them, as was shown above.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) The decision, reduced to an act, to cast off the Truth given by the various star-members was made not as works devoted only to such rejections (send it not empty, 3); but these rejections were made as a part of a larger work that embraced the presentations of their more or less caricatured stewardship truths and gross errors embodied in their creeds. Thinking these caricatures of truths and these gross errors were truths, and feeling that by issuing them they were doing a Divinely-pleasing work, they also thought that such work would make good before God for the evils that they recognized they had committed in pertinent word and act (return Him a trespass offering); for they recognized that they had been more or less faultful amid the controversies that led up to their creed-making, for which faults they thought their creed-making would heal them, e.g., after Luther's death Lutheran theologians fell into great controversies among themselves on total depravity, justification, sanctification, the Lord's Supper, the omnipresence of Christ's human body, things indifferent, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> Much of evil was wrought on all hands by these controversies, and their leading clergy and theologians sought to make good these evils and bring peace about through their adopting the Formula of Concord contained in the Book of Concord. Again, the Reformation caused much controversy to arise among the Roman hierarchy and theologians, all of which the creed-making Council of Trent sought to end by their becoming one, and thus making good for their former wrongs. The same things in principle preceded and marked the Greek, Anglican and Calvinistic creed-making procedures.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">And all of them looked upon their pre-creed-making experiences as calamities from the Lord (be known why His hand is not removed from you), which calamities they thought their creed-making would end, despite the fact that hitherto they could not clearly understand why they came to them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) The antitypical Philistines, having received the answer antitypical of that given in v. 3, inquired of the leading clergy and theologians by what service (What shall be the trespass offering, 4) they could make good the wrong done the Lord, connected with the antitypical Ark. They were told by the acts of the leading clergy and theologians in each of the five involved denominations (the number of the lords of the Philistines), in their creed-making, that the (caricatured) stewardship truths and their (by them unrecognized) errors should be offered to the Lord. Of course, they considered all of these teachings to be true. The (caricatured) stewardship truths (mice) and their (as such not recognized) errors (emerods), by them believed to be true, they thought would be a proper offering to God and would procure peace and healing for them. That they thought that these teachings, as supposedly true, would placate God, is typed by the fact that they were to be of gold, which symbolizes something divine (five golden emerods and five golden mice). But that these creedal teachings, as set forth in the creeds, are erroneous, is evident from the fact that mice were among the unclean foods (Lev. 11: 29; Is. 66: 17—here Protestant error, as the swine flesh is Romanist error, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">abomination</span><span class="font3"> being the mass). That the emerods represent errors is apparent not only from our previous study, but also from the fact that they were sores, ulcers (Lev. 13: 42, 43; Rev. 16: 2). We know that image (5) in the prophets represent creeds (Ps. 97: 7; Is. 21: 9; 30: 22; 41: 29; 42: 8, 17; Jer. 50: 2,t38, 51: 47, 52). These creeds, therefore, are alike error (one plague was on you all, and on your lords). But these antitypical Philistines, not knowing the true God, and thinking their prospective creeds</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">would be true, thought that they would be just the thing to glorify the Lord (give glory to the God of Israel). So doing they expected to obtain relief as to themselves (lighten His hand from off you), their doctrines (gods) and the sphere of their spirit (land).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(33) The clergy and theologians in each of the five involved denominations considered their creed-making work one of making harmony in their respective denominations, hence a work that would please God, and hence not to do it would be a hardening of the involved hearts, a thing against which they pleaded by word and act among those opposing their plans and purposes (Wherefore, then, do ye harden your hearts, 6). The chief of the clergy and theologians in each of the five denominations, in exhorting one another to creed-and-harmony-making in the sense of each involved denomination, cautioned their fellows not to harden their hearts against such activities, since that would be worse than the course of the Egyptians and Pharaoh, who, while temporarily hardening their hearts, finally under the plagues relented and let the people go (wrought wonderfully . . let the people go, and they departed). Then they advised that a new organization be formed (make a new cart, 7), consisting of a council, or synod, or convocation, newly organized, to meet the crisis in each of the five involved denominations. They further advised that a new statement of their doctrines (one of the two milch cows) and practices (the other of the two milch cows) be drawn up, requiring that these doctrines and practices be such as had not before been put into creedal form (on which there hath come no yoke). But the implication products (calves) of such doctrines and practices that would interfere with the progress of these doctrines and practices should be kept out of sight, buried in oblivion (bring their calves home from them). Upon council, synod or convocation (cart) was to be placed the responsibility of carrying away the star-members' teachings from among the five pertinent denominations (take the ark. . . lay it upon the cart, 8); and the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">caricatured stewardship truths (those &quot;jewels of gold&quot; that consisted of the golden mice) and the pet errors of these sectarian Churches (those &quot;jewels of gold&quot; that consisted of the golden emerods) were to be given a place of (supposed) authority (by the side thereof) over the star-members' teachings (the ark) in their creeds (coffer). In this way they felt sure they would rid themselves of the star-members' teachings (send it away, that it may go).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) At the time of the creed-making described above, all five denominations, while fighting one another, were a unit in fighting the so-called Independents (Beth-Shemesh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of the sun,</span><span class="font3"> 9). These Independents consisted of undenominational Christians, Baptists, Unitarians and Congregationalists, all of whose stewardship teachings the creedists rejected, because they were not polluted then, as were the stewardship teachings of the pertinent five denominations. God considered such to be the house (Beth) of the Bible (Shemesh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sun),</span><span class="font3"> while the five denominations considered them to be arch heretics. The supposed errors (actually truths, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Ark) of the star-members the higher clergy and theologians thought would be cast off, and as such would naturally go to the Independents. If they did, they would consider that they were plagued for having the errors, actually the truths, of the star-members in their midst (if it go ... to Beth-Shemesh ... He hath done us this great evil). If the antitypical Ark did not go to the Independents, all of whom the creedists believed to be gross heretics, the antitypical Philistines would conclude that their plagues were an accident (then we shall know . . . not His hand . . . it. . . happened to us). The advice of the higher clergy and theologians was carried out (the men did so, 10); for they united (tied) their councils, synods and convocations (cart) to the pertinent creedal doctrines and practices (two milch cows), by causing these to make such creedal doctrines and practices—those of the councils, synods and convocations. And they carefully kept among themselves, away from their published creedal doctrines and practices, certain distracting implications (calves) as the recent products of such creedal doctrines and practices (two milch kine). For example, the Papists kept out of the decrees and canons of the Council of Trent the doctrine of the pope's infallibility and its resultant practices; the Lutherans kept out of their published Book of Concord matters like the creation of the soul (in their sense of the word) and the omnipresence of Christ's humanity as the basis of their doctrine of the real presence; the Calvinists kept out of their creeds the question of supra-lapsarianism (God's predestinating Adam's fall and everything else that happens, i.e., among other things, sin); the Greeks kept out of their creedal statement references to the Divine omnipresence being communicated to Christ's humanity; and the Anglicans kept out of their creedal statements all discussion of the Bible's directly teaching Apostolic succession. All such questions as are the direct products (calves) of their doctrines and practices (milch cows), because of their containing, to them, very inconvenient implications, they studiously kept away from their published creedal statements; but they have discussed these privately (at home) among themselves individually.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) The higher clergy and theologians, accordingly laid upon their councils, synods and convocations (the cart, 11) the duty of carrying away from them the antitypical Ark (ark), together with the duty of making their caricatured stewardship doctrines and practices (five golden mice) and their false teachings, viewed by them as true (five golden emerods), accompany the star-members' teachings, since they embodied all of these in their creeds (coffer): some (the truths) as rejected and anathematized teachings, the others (the caricatured stewardship truths and pet errors) set forth as truths held by the denominations and therefore fit to be offered to the Lord. Their doctrinal teachings and practical precepts (the two kine, 12)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">led the councils, synods and convocations to direct the pertinent teachings straight at the Independents (the straight way to the way, direction, of Beth-Shemesh). This was done publicly (went along the highway), announcing, in their propounders, their thoughts continually (lowing as they went). These teachings kept on developing, as aimed by their propounders, in the direction of the Independents, without turning aside at all (turned not aside to the right hand or to the left). The leaders of the five denominations (the lords of the Philistines) kept on accompanying (supporting) their councils, synods and convocations, which were taking away from the antitypical Philistines the star-members' teachings, at the same time causing to accompany them their various caricatures of their stewardship teachings and errors embedded in their creeds. This they continued to do until this combination of things reached the Independents (the border of Beth-Shemesh).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(36) In construing this type we must remember that as the Philistines were not believers in the antitypical Ark and in the God that it represented, so the higher clergy and theologians were not believers in the star-members' teachings and in the God that they represented. When the facts of the case are considered in the way these five denominations by their creed-making cast off the starmembers' teachings, the symbolisms of vs. 2-12 certainly give us the understanding of the pertinent acts as outlined above. And we must marvel at God's wisdom in clothing the prophecy of these transactions in the story under study. Who of us would have thought that such a remarkable piece of typology is embedded in the story of the ark's experiences while in the hands of the Philistines? Certainly human wisdom and ingenuity could neither have put into, nor have taken out of this story such a remarkable piece of typology! Let us praise God for the gift of this understanding, as another evidence of His grace bestowed upon us richly and upbuildingly.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) It may strike some as contradictory that in the camp picture we teach that the five above-mentioned denominations are called the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Gad, Judah and Ephraim, while here they are called the five cities of the Philistines. This is due to the fact that they are viewed from different standpoints in the two pictures. In the camp picture they are represented as the nominal people of God as existing in the pertinent denominations, as such doing some good service for God, even as some of them are called the honorable women of Christ's court, in Ps. 45: 9; while in the picture under study they are pictured forth as sectarians opposing certain of God's teachings. Thus the different aspects of their activities account for their being typed by such antagonistic peoples. We find that Israel is variously used typically. In their good representatives and in their doing well they represent the real people of God during the Gospel Age, and in their bad representatives and in their bad acts they represent the nominal people of God. 1 Cor. 10: 1-4 shows the former and vs. 5-11 show the latter line of thought. The same principle is seen in Israel and Moab, and Israel and Ammon, in their varied relations. Thus the phenomenon under study is in principle of frequent occurrence in Biblical types.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) The Independents of all kinds-the Baptists, the Unitarians, the Congregationalists and undenominal Christians from 1564 onward, in the case of the Congregationalists from about 1581 onward, were gathering very many adherents to themselves, as their contemporaneous history proves (And they of Beth-Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest, 13) amid more or less oppressive conditions (in the valley). At this particular juncture of history they were engaged in earnest study of Scriptural subjects (lifted up their eyes) and, among other things, recognized the dismissed starmembers' teachings (and saw the ark). Thus the Baptists, Unitarians and Congregationalists saw the Truth on the true Church in its</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">nature, organization and government, as opposed to Greekism, Romanism, Anglicanism, Calvinism and Lutheranism; the Unitarians in some of their representatives saw the full teaching of star-members on Christs person and office, others saw them on His office; while undenominational Christians saw more or less of the star-members' teachings on all lines rejected by the five denominations. These facts made such believers rejoice greatly, for they loved these teachings and were glad that they were fieed from the sectarian perversions and possessions of the five involved denominations (rejoiced to see it). This combination of things: the antitypical Ark, which by now consisted of eight star-members' teachings, cart (in their acts), kine, golden mice and emerods and coffer, came into the sphere of activity of the most salutary laborers (field of Joshua, Jehovah is salvation, 14) along Bible lines (the Beth-Shemite). There among them stood the great teaching (a great stone) that the Bible is the sole source of faith and the main rule of practice. They severed to pieces the councils, synods and convocations, i.e., they destroyed them refutatively as such and used such remnants of them as were Scripturally available for sacrificial purposes (clave the wood of the cart) and used the remnants of the doctrines and practices (the kine), i.e., such as were in harmony with the Lord's Word for sacrificial purposes in a way that manifested God's acceptance of their sacrifices under Christ (a burnt offering to the Lord). The manifest acceptance of God was recognized in the blessings with which He owned the services of the involved antitypical Joshua; for through their labors the star-members' truths were widely spread, many were won for the Lord, and error was refuted.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) Antitypical Levites (faith-justified ones) took part in this service by offering linguistic, interpretational, historical and systematic helps that forwarded the involved star-members' teachings (took down the ark, 15). Doubtless among these antitypical Levites</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">were many crown-losers, whom God before the Epiphany, as we have seen, anticipatorily viewed as anti typical Levites (Num. 16: 8-11); for among the Unitarians crownlosers, leaders like Faustus Socinus, Valentine Schmalz, Johann Voelkel and Johann Crell, did very much in the way of taking down the antitypical Ark. Among the Baptists crown-losers, leaders like Christoph Ostorvat, Gregorius Paulus, John Smyth, Peter of Cologne, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> contributed their part to taking down the antitypical Ark. Among the Congregationalist crown-losers, leaders like Henry Barrowe, Henry Ainsworth, John Robinson and William Brewster, did their part in taking down the antitypical Ark. Among the undenominationalist crown-losers, leaders like Jacob Arminus, Hugo Grotius, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> took a helpful part in taking down the antitypical Ark. All of the above took a large part in laying hold of the creeds (coffer) in order to bring out in their proper light the caricatured stewardship doctrines (golden mice) and the peculiar doctrinal errors (golden emerods) of the five involved denominations (wherein the jewels of gold were). They submitted these to the test of the teaching that the Bible is the sole source of faith and the main rule of practice (put them on the great stone). And under their linguistic, interpretational, historical and systematic studies they vindicated the starmembers' teachings (ark), cleansed the stewardship doctrines (golden mice) from their defilements and overthrew the errors of the creeds (golden emerods). In doing these things, which they did with the hearty and joyous co-operation of their like-believing denominational and undenominational brethren, they all, leaders and leadings, in the three involved denominations, as well as those apart from denominations, offered up antitypical burnt offerings, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> performed services in which God's acceptance appeared manifestly (offered burnt offerings), amid which they yielded up much of their humanity to God (sacrificed sacrifices), especially as they did this work amid many persecutions heaped upon them. This sacrificing occupied a period of about 80 years (the same day), according to the pertinent facts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(40) All these 80 years the leaders of the five involved denominations (the five lords of the Philistines, 16) were mental observers (had seen) of what the antitypical men of Beth-Shemesh did to the antitypical Ark, cart, kine, coffer, golden mice and golden emerods. These things were observed amid the controversies connected with the involved matters. While not plainly indicated in this type, these five groups of leaders did their observing by taking a more or less lively part in the involved controversies, and in them repudiated the antitypical Ark and defended their antitypical golden mice and golden emerods as things fitting to be offered to the Lord. England, becoming the chief sphere of the sacrificing of the antitypical Beth-Shemites, especially during the second half of the involved 80 years, the brunt of the controversy in defense of the creeds was allowed to fall upon the theologians of the Anglican Church (they returned to Ekron the same day). The leaders of the five denominations did a creed work that they felt sure pleased God in the sense of appeasing Him (a trespass offering to the Lord, 17); for to them their antitypical emerods, which were errors, seemed to be Truth.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">(41) As vs. 17 and 18 recapitulate the thought of vs. 4 and 5, designating expressly what was not so expressly stated in vs. 4 and 5, that one golden emerod and one golden mouse was for each of the five cities of the Philistines, we will here recapitulate the antitypes. The grossest error (emerod) of the Greek Catholic Church (Ashdod, 17) is the trinity with its involved God-man, and its stewardship truth (mice, 18) is the pre-human, human and post-human office of our Lord Jesus Christ; the grossest error (emerod) of the Calvinistic Church (Gaza [?] ) is absolute predestination of all things, including sin, according to the supralapsarians, and of some persons to eternal bliss and the bulk of the race to eternal torment and its steward</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">ship truth (a mouse) is: The bread and wine are a symbolic representation and commemoration of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus; the grossest error (emerod) of the Lutheran Church (Askelon [ ?]) is total depravity or the doctrine of the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, with its implied doctrine of the omnipresence of Christ's humanity, and its stewardship doctrine (a mouse) is justification by faith; the grossest error (emerod) of the Roman Catholic Church (Gath) is the mass, and its stewardship doctrine (a mouse) is the doctrine that there is but one Church, which is the custodian of the Truth and its administrator for salvation; and the grossest error (emerod) of the Anglican Church (Ekron) is its doctrine of Apostolic succession of bishops, and its stewardship truth (a mouse) is the doctrine that the Church in secular matters is subject to the state. These were sent to the real people of God (returned) as a trespass offering of the five leaders of the five denominations (the number of all the cities of the Philistines/or [literal translation] the five lords). Thus each of the five denominations (fenced cities) and their sectarian divisions (country village) participated with their leaders in these trespass offerings. The five involved grossest errors and the five involved caricatured stewardship truths were by the five denominations and their five leader-groups sent to the Bible teachers (Beth-Shemite) stationed at the Bible as their sole source of faith and the main rule of practice (returned. . . even to the great stone). And this great symbolic stone, the teaching that the Bible is the sole source of faith and the main rule of practice, abides to this day, when the antitype of the writing of 1 Sam. is taking place in the writing of this series of chapters on it (remaineth to this day), not among all professed Christian, many of whom repudiate the Bible as the sole source of faith and the main rule of practice, but in the sphere of service occupied by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">real and salutary servants of the Bible (in the field of Joshua, the Beth-Shemite) truths as due.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) But some of the antitypical Beth-Shemites did some of the antitypical gazing, speculating (because they had looked into [or at] the ark of the Lord, 19). It is more likely that the translation, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">looked at,</span><span class="font3"> is correct, rather than </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">looked </span><span class="font3">into, for death was the penalty for any one, except the priests, looking at the ark (Num. 4: 19, 20). When it was taken by the Israelites into the battle during which it was captured, it undoubtedly was covered, and in all likelihood it remained covered while in Philistia and until it was placed upon the great stone in Joshua's field. It is very unlikely that Israelites would have opened the ark and looked at its contents; hence it is very likely that they merely uncovered it and looked at it. So far as the Hebrew is concerned, it may be rendered </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">looked at, in</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">into. </span><span class="font3">Antitypically, it would mean that some of the Bible believers and supporters speculated as to the eight starmembers' doctrines, typed by the ark at that time, for at the time of each star-member's bringing out his special truth, it became a part of the ark; hence at this time there were eight star-members' truths in the antitypical Ark. From history we know it to be true that crown-lost leaders speculated at this time, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Faustus Socinus, the first and chief crown-lost member of the Unitarians' crown-lost leaders, speculating on the doctrine of justification by faith, denied the ransom. Others of the Unitarians' crown-lost leaders, speculating on Christ's person, denied His pre-existence, taught that His father was Joseph. Some of the Baptist crown-lost leaders, not seeing the distinction between tentative and vitalized justification, speculated themselves into denying justification by faith alone. Some of the Congregationalist leaders, speculating on the powers of the ecclesia and its elders, came to teach a hybrid doctrine, a mixture of Congregationalism and Presbyterianism on Church government. In such studies they looked at the antitypical</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Ark; and God therefore caused them to die from their standing, i.e., some Little Flock members lost their crowns; some Great Company members sank into the Second Death; some of the justified forfeited their justification and some of the campers became infidels in the form of Deism, which sprang up at that time (even He smote). Their fallen condition was, among other ways, manifest from the large numbers of them who renounced their faith under the rod of persecution. Many undenominal Christians went over to Deism at that time, which spread, especially in England.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(43) The following words (19) are mistranslated in the A. V.: fifty thousand and three-score and ten men. Dr. Young properly renders them as follows: seventy men-fifty chief men. A very similar mistranslation occurs in Mic. 5: 2, in the A. V. and Septuagint </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(thousands</span><span class="font3"> of Judah), which inspiration corrects in Matt. 2: 6 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(princes, i.e:, leaders, chief men).</span><span class="font3"> This mistranslation is due to the fact that the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eleph</span><span class="font3"> may mean both </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thousand</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">leader,</span><span class="font3"> dependent on the connection. Little towns like Beth-Shemesh, a farming community (13), and Bethlehem did not have so many inhabitants as to warrant the translation to imply many thousands of them. Thus there were not 50,070, but 120 smitten, 70 not so prominent and 50 leading citizens of Beth-Shemesh. The proportion of leaders killed to the leadings killed, compared with the probable population, was very large. In the antitype there was a disproportionate number of Unitarian, Baptist and Congregationalist leaders smitten for their speculating, while those of the smitten leadings were comparatively few, considering the many of them. The fact that so many of their leaders and some of their leadings went wrong on various very important doctrines was a great grief to the survivors. This grief was felt amid the accompanying controversies and the resultant apostasies and siftings. The histories of the Baptists, Unitarians and Congregationalists of that time are more or less full of such controversies,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">apostasies and siftings, all of which is a proof that many leaders and leadings were as a result of their speculations symbolically slain (smitten). That the stroke was a comparatively great one (with a great slaughter) is manifest from what we have just stated, considering the fact that these three denominational and the undenominational Christians were comparatively few at that time, even as the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh were comparatively few.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(44) It was by their acts that the inhabitants of antitypical Beth-Shemesh asked, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God (20) ? To stand before the Lord means to minister to Him as a representative of Him. This the crownlosers and their main justified assistants in these three denominations and out of all denominations were. While so ministering certain ones speculated and went badly wrong, as shown above, and the unsmitten ones, i.e., those who did not symbolically die, as described above, recognizing their fall, were very much aftaid of the dangers connected with speculating while engaged in God's service. And it was their fear that was the antityping of the words of the surviving Beth-Shemites, &quot;Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God?&quot; The second question of v. 20 should be rendered, &quot;and to whom shall it [the ark] go up from us?&quot; for they wanted, not to get rid of God, but to get rid of so dangerous a thing as the ark was proven to be for speculating leaders and leadings. This question was also antityped in pantomime. It was by discussing more or less unfavorably the by now eight star-members' doctrines typed by the ark when it came to them, including the doing of the same with the three star-member s' doctrines that the three Little Flock leaders gave whose movements were perverted into the Baptist, Unitarian and Congregationalist sects, and their more or less discussing the perversions of their stewardship doctrines, that the antitypical Beth-Shemites pantomimed the question, &quot;To whom shall it go up from us?&quot; So far as v. 20 is concerned, matters</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">had not proceeded further in repudiating the eight starmembers' teachings than a more or less unfriendly discussion of the eight involved Truth teachings and in a tendency to pervert their three involved stewardship doctrines, i.e., things were taking a turn for the worse as to their attitude toward the involved truths, but they had not yet gone to the extreme of a fixed rejection of these eight truths, nor to a full perversion of their stewardship truths— they were only on the way toward these unhealthy steps.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(45) The books, confessions, reports, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (messengers, 21), that flowed out of the discussions just mentioned, spread among the more faithful consecrated Christians in and out of the then existing denominations (they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[city of the forests</span><span class="font3">—trees represent great ones, among God's people or among the world, here among God's people]). These books, confessions, reports, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> showed that the five large denominations of Christendom had by their creeds rejected the five involved star-members' teachings (saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord). But these books, confessions, reports, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> more or less rejecting as they did all eight involved star-members' teachings, were by this fact an invitation to the more faithful consecrated to receive the rejected star-members' teachings (come ye down and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fetch</span><span class="font3"> it up to you). The break between the chapters should not have occurred at the end of v. 21; chapter 6 should have continued to the end of 1 Sam. 7: 2. These two verses belonging to our subject, we will treat of them here. The more faithful among the consecrated took to themselves these eight teachings (the men of Kirjath-jearim came and fetched up the ark of the Lord, 1). They brought these teachings to their like-minded clergy and principals of the flocks, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> teachers and professors (brought it into the house of Abinadab </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[my father is noble})</span><span class="font3"> and put them into the special care of the ablest and most helpful of these (sanctified Eleazar </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[God is help]</span><span class="font3"> his son to keep the ark of the Lord). The historical facts corroborate this understanding of the antitype, as the following facts will prove: The eight involved denominations above described petrified their beliefs, set forth in their creeds (those of the three denominations were as yet unwritten as such), in voluminous works on dogmatics written by their chief dogmatical writers. This petrification became a putrification, because it led to the period of dead orthodoxy. These dogmatical works reduced the creedal views to the forms of so-called scientific treatises that were drawn up with the precision and dryness of mathematical formulas, and the result was that Christian life became stagnant and dead in these denominations. Concurrently with this dead orthodoxy came the 30 years' war in Germany and the revolution and its resultant wars in England. Thus piety was at its lowest ebb throughout Europe among the bulk of Christendom at the time that antitypical Beth-Shemesh was seeking in their folly to get rid of the ark of the Lord.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(46) But the Spirit of the Lord was not by God allowed to be entirely quenched; for He raised up certain consecrated ones in Germany, France, Italy and Britain (the inhabitants of antitypical Kirjath-jearim) to a closer life with the Lord. Among these were some of the clergy and the principals of the flocks (Abinadab), and also some of the ablest men and women of the time. All of these stood for the true doctrines in their churches, but they insisted on a consecrated walk with God. In Germany they were in ridicule called Pietists, in Italy Heretics, in France Quietists and in England Fanatics. Among the leaders of this movement in Germany there stands out most prominently the name of: Johann Arndt, really the forerunner of the movement and author of The True Christianity, one of the greatest books on Christian living ever written, and one of the ten most widely spread, translated and read books ever written; Philip Jacob Spener, whose influence for good was more powerful than that of any other Pietist in Germany; and August H. Franke, who raised the influence of the Halle University for Christian living to as great a degree as the Wittenberg University had for doctrine and reformation in the days of Luther. In Italy the Spaniard, Michael Molinos, by his book, Spiritual Guide, wrought very fruitfully for Christian piety in the Romanist Church until the Jesuits secured his suppression as a heretic, despite the pope's remonstrances. In France Madame Guyon, Archbishop Fenelon and the Port Royalist scholars: Antoine Amauld, his sister Angelica (abbess of Port Royal), Racine, De Sacy, Pascal, Quesnel andTillemont, some of the ablest and most pious men and women of France, wrought most fruitfully for Christian living as against dead orthodoxy. In England George Fox, a star-member, and John Bunyan, author of Pilgrim's Progress, one of the ten books above referred to, wrought very fruitfully for the consecrated life. These men and women were the cream of all the leaders in this movement for Christian living. They were the antitypical Eleazar of v. 1, while their clerical and other (teacher and professorial) supporters were antitypical Abinadab in Christendom.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(47) These brethren, clerical and lay, professors and teachers, prominent and obscure, consecrated Christians, received the antitypical Ark. Indeed, George Fox was used by the Lord to bring out another truth that then became a part of this antitypical Ark. We are not to understand that all of these received all of the nine involved star-members' teachings. Some of them received more, some less; all of them received at least that star-member doctrine that in his church was perverted into an antitypical mouse. Their ministry was most fruitful, and always received persecution from the dead orthodox. Especially in Romanist countries did the Jesuits persecute these. It was they who secured the condemnation and imprisonment of Molinos and Madame Guyon. It was they who secured the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">suppression of Port Royal, the headquarters of the French part of antitypical Eleazar, son of Abinadab, and the scattering of its able men and women. The period of the activities of these and their successors of like spirit, if we begin them with those of John Arndt, was from about 1610 onward until the Harvest (the time was long, 2); for the typical ark remained at Kirjath-jearim, which is the same as Baalah, or Baali (Josh. 15: 9), until David (type of that Servant) brought it to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 6: 1-11) . The A. V. of v. 2 does not give the sense of the original when it implies that the ark was at Kirjath-jearim but 20 years. Dr. Young renders v. 2 as follows: &quot;And it cometh to pass, from the day of the dwelling of the ark in Kirjath-jearim, that the days are multiplied—yea, they are twenty years— and wail do all the house of Israel after Jehovah.&quot; This rendering gives the sense literally. As a matter of fact, is was there about 90 years, i.e., during the 40 years of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Samuel's</span><span class="font3">s judge ship, the 40 years of Saul's reign and about 10 years of David's reign; for David had reigned 714 years at Hebron, then transferred his capital to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 5: 9). It was sometime thereafter that the ark was brought from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem. The thought of 20 years mentioned in v. 2 is that it was after the ark had been at Kirjath-jearim 20 years that Israel began to repent of their sins (all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord). This—and thus the end of the antitypical 20 years—was antitypically fulfilled just after the time that John Wesley, 1738, began his work as a star-member.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(48) Due to the inroads that the teachings and loose conduct of Deism made on matters of faith and practice among the British people, religion and morality were at a very low ebb in Britain in the second half of the 17th and in the first half of the 18th century. While Deists talked and wrote much on &quot;God, virtue and immortality,&quot; the blighting effects on faith and morals that it wrought depraved the British public as few others things in history did. At first it affected a great stand as loving Truth and righteousness. But the progressive ridicule and disregard of the Bible that it inculcated tore away the foundations of faith and righteousness from under the feet of the people, resulting in the most unblushing iniquity spreading progressively among all classes of society. The leading Deists of the old ethical school were Lord Herbert of Cher bury (died 1648), Charles Blount (died 1693), John Toland (died 1722), Anthony Collins (died 1729), William Whiston (died 1752), Matthew Tindal (died 1733), Thomas Morgan (died 1743), Peter Annet (died 1769) and Conyers Middleton (died 1750). These, one after the other, progressively deteriorated from a more or less respect for the Bible and Christianity into a disbelief in them as a revelation and in its miracles and prophecies. But a second class of Deists appeared who developed principles that undermined Christian ethics, and made ethics a matter controlled by selfishness. The leaders among these were Shaftesbury (died 1713), Mandeville (died 1733), Dodwell (died 1751) and Bolingbroke (died 1751). Their influence was very disastrous on religion and ethics. These were followed by a third class of Deists who will here be briefly described. Hume (died 1776) turned Deism into infidelity. Voltaire (died 1778) combined almost all forms of Deism into his system. He accepted the skepticism of Hume, the natural theology of the first class of Deists mentioned above, and the selfish ethics of the second set of Deists mentioned above. Later on Deism in France went over into irreligion and materialism, as is exemplified in Diderot (died 1784), Holbach (died 1789) and Helvetius (died 1771). Rousseau (died 1778) went back to the position of the first Deists. But the effect of all of these was in final analysis an evil one, undermining religion and morality, as the history of Britain and France proves was the case.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(49) It was this undermining of religion and morality that caused the widespread grief in Christendom typed by the lamenting after the Lord on the part of Israel (all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord, 2), as they saw religion and righteousness ridiculed and unbelief and ungodliness spreading. Amid this condition the ministry of John Wesley set in. In EH, 403-416, we have given the main facts of his life and ministry, and will not repeat them here; rather we refer our readers to these details there. Samuel'ss speech in v. 3 summarizes typically the preaching of Wesley pertinent to the situation created by the first set of Deists. His star-membership dates with his quickening as a star-member in 1738, which he mistakenly called his conversion. From that time on he preached the message antitypical of v. 3. It will be noted that his ministry was a widespread one, described by him in his words, &quot;The world is my parish&quot; (spake unto all the house of Israel). In preaching and writing he greatly stressed a complete, whole-hearted repentance, faith, consecration, its faithful performance and disinterested love (If ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts). These steps he showed implied that they put aside all forms of sin and selfishness and worldliness (put away the strange gods) especially sex sins (Ashtaroth). He strongly urged them to detach their affections from everything that had the tendency of turning them away from the Lord, and to fill their hearts with every affection that would dispose them toward God and things divine (and prepare your hearts unto the Lord). He likewise exhorted them to carry out their consecration by self-sacrificial service, holy meditation and faithful development of the graces of the Spirit (serve Him only). These things done, he assured them that God would defiver them from the doctrines, practices and effects of the Deists (He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines). Here we see that the Deists had become the antitypical Philistines of this particular period. While the antitypical Philistines are always sectarians, they are specifically such sectarians as are sectarianly</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">opponents of God's people in the particular times and forms of sectarian opposition. Hence we find the antitypical Philistines to be many different sectarians—but they are always such of them as fight God's people, and usually such as oppose these as they are led by the star-members.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(50) Wesley's ministry certainly had the effect typed by the statements of v. 4. The movement that he led is called the Great Awakening, or Revival. It is often called the revival of religion in Britain. George III, England's king during the latter part of Wesley's ministry, said of him, of his associates, and of the Great Revival, that they did more for religion and the common people of Britain than the entire established Church of England. The ungodliness and infidelity that Deism produced met their Waterloo from the Great Revival. The immense throngs that listened to Wesley and his assistants, and the great numbers that read the literature that this movement produced and circulated, felt themselves pricked to the heart by the thunderous appeals to repentance, by the tender pleas to faith and by the clear persuasives to consecration. And mighty was the effect of such preaching and reading. Literally multitudes repented and believed. Generous numbers took the second step, and got &quot;the second blessing.&quot; Sin, selfishness and worldliness in all their forms were set aside (the children of Israel did put away Baalim [the ending im is the masculine plural in Hebrew, like cherubim, the plural of cherub, and seraphim, the plural of seraph; thus the many idols of Baal are meant] and Ashtaroth [sex sins], 4). The most hardened and degraded sinners were melted to repentance. The sternest unbelievers became believers. The bitterest opponents were made sweet and faithful friends of Christianity everywhere. A cleansing of thoughts, motives, words and acts characterized the converts. Those who became identified with the Wesleyan movement became exemplars of the Christian life and character. They were indeed a holy people (they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">served the Lord only). While repentance and faith with their implications were the main themes preached by this movement to the public, in the meetings for the brethren— parlor meetings, class meetings, band meetings and the larger Church meetings—it was consecration made and carried out with its implications that was the special subject, the chief stress being laid on the cultivation of disinterested love. Holiness was the theme preached and lived by the faithful of this movement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(51) The main other themes stressed among these brethren in their assemblies were watchfulness of conscience and prayer. They were, one and all, by Wesley exhorted to practice the watchfulness of conscience in their thoughts, motives, words, acts, dispositions, surroundings and the influences operating upon them </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Samuel</span><span class="font3"> said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">watchtower,</span><span class="font3"> 5). Carelessness as to these seven objects for watchfulness of conscience was shown to be dangerous. All exhorted one another to practice daily the watchfulness of conscience (Gather all Israel). And Wesley, who was mighty and prevalent in prayer, as many examples of the Lord's answering his prayers prove, not only gave them the example to pray, and not only exhorted them to pray, but also promised them to pray for them (I will pray for you unto the Lord). The brethren gave heed to Wesley's admonitions and, encouraged by his promise to pray for them, in their consciences practiced selfexamination and watchfulness (And they gathered together unto Mizpeh, 6). This they did not only privately, but also in their class meetings and bands; for Wesley arranged various kinds of meetings for them for their development in grace, knowledge and service. They faithfully studied the good Word of God, gathering out of the Bible, the well of salvation, those Truth teachings due at the time (drew water). These teachings they did not study for their personal enjoyment alone. While deriving therefrom great personal blessings, they also used them for the blessing of others; for they spread the good Word</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">by word of mouth, by distributing pertinent literature, by arranging for meetings where practiced preachers would deliver the message and by inviting friends, relatives and neighbors to such and other helpful meetings. Thus they spread the Truth widely as a religious service pertinent to, and in the interests of the Lord (poured it out before the Lord). They did these things through self-denying and world-denying service, for which those disciples are noted (and fasted on that day). Added to this in their watchfulness of conscience they humbly made confession of their shortcomings (said there, We have sinned). There were special class meetings held in which such confessions of shortcomings were a regular part of the service. In all these works Wesley acted as their leader, directing the Lord's work among these brethren in respect to their watching and prayer, somewhat after the manner in which Bro. Russell directed the Lord's work in the Parousia (Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(52) This great Revival with its attendant righteous and holy living and serving soon attracted the inimical attention of the Deists, whose loose moral principles had a bad effect on the people, but whose doctrines, apart from undermining the faith of not a few, especially among the higher classes, gained no great acceptance with the common people, because of their abstruseness and lifelessness (the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, 7). The Deist leaders of the second group above-described (the lords), partly through previous writings and partly through contemporaneous writing and speaking, sallied forth against the brethren, who in ridicule were called Methodists (went up against Israel). This immense deistical literature and oratory frightened the pious Methodists (they were afraid of the Philistines), when they became cognizant of it (heard it). Naturally in their fears they came to their leader, Wesley (the children of Israel said to Samuel, 8), for comfort, protection and intercession before the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Lord (Cease not to cry . . for us), that God might deliver them from the Deists (He will save us, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.).</span><span class="font3"> Wesley thereupon raised up the Methodist ministry, consisting in the most part of consecrated laymen, mainly circuit riders, and in small part of a few ministers, like himself, his brother Charles, Whitefield, Fletcher, Perronet, etc., and encouraged them to sublime heights of sacrifice in an evangelistic work at least equal in love, zeal, fervor, selfdenial and loyalty to any ever raised up between the Harvests. As a rule his lay preachers were uneducated and unrefined, but in all their efforts they were spurred on by Wesley's words, direction and example, to a most faithful and fruitful ministry (Samuel took a fat [not, suckling] lamb, 9). This ministry was by God manifested as acceptable to Him through our Lord's merit (a burnt offering). And it served with an eye single to the Lord's glory (wholly unto the Lord). Wesley by his strenuous ministry and ardent and believing prayer entreated the Lord on behalf of His people (cried unto the Lord for Israel); and the Lord answered in a most marked way (the Lord heard him). It was amid such sacrifices and prayers that the Deists launched their attack upon God's people (as Samuel was offering ... the Philistines drew near to battle, 10). But the Lord stirred up a great controversy against them (the Lord thundered with a great thunder. . . upon the Philistines). Just as in their part of the controversy the Deists used past writings and current writings and speeches against the true believers, so did the true believers use past writings and current writings and addresses against the Deists.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(53) A brief mention of such writings and writers would be in place here, as showing with what great controversies God opposed the Deists. First we will give the names of the past pertinent writers, with their birth years and their books: Cudworth, born 1617, and his book, The Intelligent System Of The Universe; Boyle, 1626, Things Above Reason; Stillingfleet, 1635,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Letters To A Deist; Sir Isaac Newton, 1642, whose intellect was one of the greatest ever to grace a man, Observations On Prophecy; Leslie, 1650, A Short Method With Deists; Lowth, 1661, Vindication Of The Divine Author Of The Bible; King, 1669, Origin Of Evil; Samuel Clark, 1675, Evidence Of Natural And Revealed Religion; Waterland, 1683, Scripture Vindicated; and Butler, 1692, Analogy Of Religion To The Constitution And Course Of Nature. Because of their appropriateness to the controversy now under description, these works, though produced from 8 to 75 years before the controversy broke out, were republished and circulated by the antitypical Israelites. God had assisted the writers of these and subsequent ones that will shortly be mentioned (the Lord thundered with a great thunder). Of these so far mentioned undoubtedly the last one mentioned (Bishop Butler's Analogy), first published in 1736, was the most convincing; for it met the Deists on their own ground, and so thoroughly defeated them that to this day no Deist or other unbeliever has attempted to answer it. It is one of the few apologetic books that the intervening centuries have not antiquated; for its fruitful ministry still persists. The same is true in a less degree, however, of Leslie's Short Method With Deists. Among the able anti-deistical writers and books that appeared during the controversy under discussion, the following deserve special mention: Lardner, 1684, Credibility Of The Gospel History (a work of eight crown octavo volumes, which and Butler's Analogy are the two ablest works used in this controversy. It is still after two centuries the chief depository of learning on its particular subject. Though begun before the controversy had started, it was not completed until after it was in progress); Leland, 1691, View Of Deistical Writers, and Advantage And Necessity Of Revelation; Chandler, 1693, Definition Of Christianity, On Prophecy; Bishop Warburton, 1698, The Divine Legislation Of Moses; Bishop Warburton, 1698, The Divine</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Legislation Of Moses; Bishop Newton, 1704, On The Prophecies; Richard Watson, 1737, Apology For Christianity (against Gibbon), also Apology For The Bible (against Paine); too numerous to mend on are the writers and writings against Hume; and, finally, Paley, 1743, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Horae Paulinae.</span><span class="font3"> Evidences Of Christianity, and Natural Theology. Paley brought to a successful close the controversy with the Deists.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(54) In this way the Lord answered Wesley's prayers; and thus He nonplussed the Deists (discomfited them); for they were surely defeated by antitypical Israel through the lines of thought indicated in the titles of the above-mentioned books (smitten before Israel). From their positions of conscientious watchfulness (Mizpeh), which implies, among other things, a study of the errors that attack the Truth and of the ways to refute them, as well as a quick conscience to perceive right and wrong, these warriors of the Lord and their less able fellow-soldiers attacked and stormed the positions of the Deists, followed them in their retreat from the field of battle (pursued the Philistines, 11), and pushed the attack beyond the utmost powers (Beth-car, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of the battering ram)</span><span class="font3"> of the Deists to resist. Wesley was by no means an idle spectator of this controversy. He participated in it by exalting the Bible (Samuel took a [Hebrew, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">one]</span><span class="font3"> stone and set it, 12) as the Truth and as the Divine Revelation. He set it forth as the object of study, both by Christian watchfulness in its function of conscience (between Mizpeh) and by sanctified reason (Shen, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">crag), </span><span class="font3">both of which are heights on which one is to stand in studying the Bible. In his defenses of the Bible Wesley repeatedly appealed to the Christian conscience, which is a chief factor in successful watching, and to sanctified reason as supported by it. Well did he do in setting forth the Bible as the strengthener of the Christian conscience and as the helper of the Christian reason from the beginning to the end of the Age (Ebenezer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stone of help).</span><span class="font3"> In many ways he proved this to be true of it,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g..</span><span class="font3"> from its reasonableness, its harmony, its fruitfulness, its beauty, its strength, its sublimity, its adaptability to our needs, its efficacy, the character that it ascribes to God and Christ, the character it develops in the faithful, the honesty of its portrayals of its agents and foes, its harmony with all well-authenticated secular history and archeology, its effects on the nations, proportionate to their responsiveness, its prophecies, its miracles, its solution of the problem of creation and of the permission of evil, its refutation of all objections, its preservation against all assaults, and its transcendent superiority to the authoritative books of all other religions. Yea, by these things he proved that this unbreakable Rock has been a great means whereby God has been &quot;our help in age past, our hope for years to come&quot; (saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(55) In this controversy the Deistical sectarians were thoroughly refuted and brought into full defeat and subjection (the Philistines were subdued, 13). Their grounds are now no more taken by serious thinkers; for sectarian unbelief has shifted its grounds from those of refuted rationalistic Deism, and has taken other grounds, e.g., those of atheism, agnosticism, materialism, pantheism, evolution and higher criticism. Thus Deism during the later days of Wesley made no more inroads among real Spiritual Israel (came no more into the coast of Israel); for God, through the writers and writings above-mentioned and the ministry of Wesley and his associates, successfully opposed them all the days of Wesley; and ever since they have been effectless in whatever efforts, feeble as they have been, they have put forth to discredit the Bible as the Divine Revelation. The teachings (cities, 14) that the Deists had taken from Christianity, e.g., the natural revelation, God, virtue, the hereafter (which the Philistines had taken from Israel), and had perverted unto the subduing of some Christian doctrines under error, were retaken (restored), purged from Deistical error and used in harmony with</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Biblical thoughts. Not one of these teachings taken from Christians was left in the hands of Deists (from Ekron even unto Gath). Any Deistical teachings that touched on Christian thought were taken from Deists by Spiritual Israel (coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines). Sinners of all kinds were subdued by the Wesleyan movement (peace between Israel and the Amorites). Wesley presided as teacher and executive in the Priestly movement up to the end of his long life, living 88 years, 53 of which were spent by him as a star-member (Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life, 15). He continued unto old age to ride his circuits, where he addressed the nominal people of God (Bethel, 16), those rejoicing in justification with its various crises (Gilgal) and those living in the conscientious watchfulness of consecration (Mizpeh), and presided among all three of these classes as teacher and executive (judged Israel in all those places). But his habitual spiritual abode was in the height (Ramah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[height] . . .</span><span class="font3"> house, v. 17) of Christian character. Therein did he preside as teacher and executive; and there he gathered unto the Lord choice spirits like himself as sacrificers and comforters of sacrificers, prominent among whom were his brother Charles, the greatest hymn-writer of all times; Whitefield, one of the greatest pulpit orators of all times; the saintly Fletcher, a mighty controversialist; the humble and loyal Perronet; Richardson, the faithful companion of Wesley's last twenty years and the prayer and praise meeting leader of Wesley's last hours, and the conductor of his funeral; the devoted Asbury, the most of the Christ of that time (there he built an altar unto the Lord).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(56) In 1 Sam. 8 the antitype turns back to the Jewish Harvest and then covers certain phases of the Gospel Age until about 1850. Aged Samuel (old, 1) represents as developed the twelve Apostles and the seventy prophets in the Jewish Harvest, also the twelve star-members and their twelve special helpers shortly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">after beginning the twelve Little Flock movements, which were later perverted into the twelve denominations of Christendom, in their capacity of arranging for elders in the ecclesias (Acts 14: 23; 20: 17; 1 Tim. 5: 17; Tit. 1: 5; Jas. 5: 14; 1 Pet. 5: 1) . In the days of the Apostles these elders were of two kinds: the abler or leading elders, and the less able or more or less led elders. This distinction was not based on there being different grades officially among the elders. Rather, it was based on the difference in them from the standpoint of the spirit of consecration, talents and providential situation. Officially they were all equals; but among these equals some were abler in the three standpoints just mentioned. The ablest in these three matters became in the Lord's providence and arrangement the first among equals, and as such doubtless were entrusted with the most responsible and important services, just as occurs in our day, and as occurred in our Pastor's day; for we know that in this way God sets by the ecclesia's vote the leaders in local ecclesias where there are several elders varying in the above-mentioned three things. This is the way matters stood with the elders, i.e., bishops, until the death of St. John, though during the Apostles' day, but by their disapprovals, some were already striving in unholy ambition for more power (2 Thes. 2: 7; 3 John 9—11) . This distinction did not imply two grades among the elders, or bishops, but by the way of designating some as the first among equals in office, all of them executing the duties of their office as decided by the ecclesias (judges over Israel). These two kinds of elders, or bishops, are typed by Samuel'ss two sons at the beginning of their judgeship.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(57) Shortly after John's death the leading elder or bishop by way of distinction began to be called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font3"> elder, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span class="font3">bishop. At first this was merely used as an emphasis on the idea of a first among equals; but in only a few years, /. e., about 115 A. D., under the lead of Ignatius of Antioch, the distinction was emphasized</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">into a real difference in office, the name </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bishop</span><span class="font3"> being restricted to the actual ruling teaching official and the name </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elder</span><span class="font3"> to the not ruling teaching officials of the ecclesia. This misdevelopment increased into the creation of a graded hierarchy as distinct from the lower clergy, called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">priests,</span><span class="font3"> a corruption of the Greek word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">presbyter, elder. </span><span class="font3">Samuel'ss two sons in their continued deterioration continued to represent these two deteriorating classes among the clergy. The firstborn, Joel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jehovah is mighty, 2),</span><span class="font3"> types this misdeveloping hierarchy; and the second born, Abiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(my father is Jehovah.),</span><span class="font3"> types the misdeveloping lower clergy. Thus we see that at first they typed the elders as God constituted such, but later as Satan perverted such. In each of the twelve Little Flock movements before their perversion into sects set in we find two kinds of elders, like those of the Apostolic days; and shortly after these twelve Little Flock movements were being perverted into sects they began in most denominations to change into the misdevelopments mentioned above. Thus we see a twelve-fold fulfilment of the type of this entire chapter, as we will find it also to be the case in certain of the experiences of Saul, who types the crown-lost leaders. At first they were teachers of Truth (judges in Beersheba, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">well of the oath',</span><span class="font3"> the Oath-bound Covenant being the sum of the Gospel Age truths). In their falling and fallen condition these two clerical classes sought riches of money, honor, position, power and luxury (lucre, 3), took bribes to effect the promotion of the bribers or to favor the bribers against others (bribes), and perverted the true teachings into error (perverted judgment). This these two classes did in every denomination of Christendom, as Church history abundantly proves, especially that of the larger denominations. Thus they did not follow in the paths of the star-members and their special helpers (not in his ways).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(58) The better leaders consulted over this situation (all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, 4). They also submitted the situation to the starmembers and their Little Flock colaborers (came to Samuel) in their well-developed Christian characters (Ramah). These set forth the evil condition of these two clergy classes in the twelve denominations (thy sons walk not in thy ways, 5) and Samuel'ss inability to keep them in line with Truth and righteousness (thou art old). Then they requested in all twelve denominations leaders who would have power sufficient to curb these two evil clergy classes, to teach aright and act as executives in what they regarded as the Lord's affairs, like the leaders in the older denominations, the Greek and Roman Churches alleging the example of the Jewish kings and hierarchy (make us a king to judge us like all the nations). This matter grieved the star-members and their Little Flock colaborers, for they saw that it was not the best thing for the people, since it implied their rejection of the Divinely commissioned teachers and executives for the Lord, a thing sure to be fraught with evil consequences (the thing displeased Samuel; literally, the thing was evil in Samuel'ss eyes, 6). These star-members and their special colaborers did just what they should have done under those circumstance prayed over the matter, bringing it to the Lord for His decision (Samuel prayed unto the Lord). God, knowing that the waywardness of the people could best be cured by the experiences of evil attendant on the course that they were intent upon following, gave the star-members through His Spirit, Word and providence to understand that the will of the people be granted (Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee, 7). God corrected His faithful servants who felt hurt at the rejection of themselves as teachers and executives and showed them that the real one rejected was not they, but He Himself from being their teacher and king (not. . . thee but. . . Me . . . not reign over them). Both the type and antitype here show that God at times yields His preference to that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of others (Ps. 106: 15) . The Lord then gave His faithful antitypical Samuel some comfort to be derived from a consideration of the fact that they were being treated unkindly, ungratefully and neglectfully, in fellowship with Him, by the same class as had so treated Him continually, despite His having brought them out of the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of His dear Son, and had always helped them (the works which they have done since . . . out of Egypt. . . wherewith they have forsaken Me and served other gods, so do they also unto thee, 8).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(59) By His Spirit, Word and providences the Lord gave antitypical Samuel at the transition of each Little Flock movement into a denomination to understand that he should accede to the people's demand (hearken unto their voice, 9). At the same time and by the same ways God gave antitypical Samuel to understand that he should protest against their demand (protest solemnly unto them), and that he should seek to persuade them to give up their will to have a king by describing to them the unfavorable course of kings with their subjects (show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them). Thus while the Lord at times yields His preference to that of others, He at the same time offers them earnest advice and protests against their desired course, pointing out to them the disadvantage of rejecting His in favor of their preference. As charged by God, so antitypical Samuel did (told ... the people, 10). He showed them just what their crown-lost princes would do to them (this will be the manner of the king, 11): They would in their interests make their stronger ones (sons) serve their organizations and their organizations' officers (appoint. . . for his chariots and [literally] for his horsemen) and in their interests make them apologists for their organizations (run before his chariots). They would in their interests appoint some of them to be their subordinate officers for warfare purposes (captains over thousands and. . . fifties, 12). They in their interests</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">would make them prepare people for hearing the crown-lost princes' message (ear his ground; literally, plow his plowing) and win ripe ones for their interests (reap his harvest); make them prepare controversial treatises (make his instruments of war) and treatises to vindicate their organizations (instruments of his chariots). They would make their weaker ones (daughters, 13) prepare appetizing spiritual foods (confectionaries), hunger-satisfying spiritual foods (cooks) and strengthening spiritual foods (bakers) for them. They would take from Spiritual Israelites their spiritual service-spheres (fields, 14), their Truth-producing spheres (vineyards) and grace-producing spheres (oliveyards), including even those that belong to the Little Flock (best of them) and give them to their favorites. They would require that they give up their consecrated rights in the Word [&quot;the seed is the Word&quot;] and its teachings (take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards, 15) and let their favorites, great (officers) and small (servants), have them for their aggrandizement, to the detriment of those thus spoiled. They would take the Little Flock brethren (menservants, 16), the Great Company brethren (maidservants), the best Truth students and warriors (your goodliest young men) and their teachings (asses) and make them serve their interests (put them to his work). They would take their symbolic flocks, the Lord's people, as consecrated to them (tenth of your sheep, 17) and reduce them to be their servants (shall be his servants). These things would distress those who wanted such leaders and they would cry to the Lord to free them, but God would . . . not hear, 18.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(60) The earnest counsels, expostulations and protests that the star-members and their special colaborers made against the people's taking the crown-lost leaders in their place as their special teachers and executives were unavailing; for the people refused to heed these counsels, expostulations and protests (the people</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">refused to obey the voice of Samuel, 19). They remained obdurate in their determination to take the crown-lost leaders as their special teachers and executives (Nay; we will have a king over us). This refusal to listen and determination to have their own way set in toward the end of each of the twelve Little Flock movements introduced by the twelve star-members, whose movements were perverted into the twelve denominations of Christendom. They wanted in each successive case from the third to the twelfth denomination to be in this respect like the Greek and Roman Churches and the others preceding each new sectarianizing movement, while the Greek and Roman Churches wanted to be like the Jewish Church in this respect (we . . . like all the nations, 20), believing that the crown-lost princes would be more </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">practiced</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">efficient </span><span class="font3">than the pertinent star-members, as special teachers and executives (kings may judge us), leaders and warriors (go out. . . fight our battles). The star-members and their special colaborers in all the twelve Little Flock movements, undergoing sectarianizing perversions toward the twelve denominations into which they later developed, listened to the people's reasonings (Samuel heard... the people, 21) and properly referred their words and course to the Lord (rehearsed them... the Lord). The Lord by His Spirit, Word and providence gave the star-members and their colaborers to understand that He was yielding to the people's preference (Hearken unto their voice, 22) and commissioned them to train the crown-lost princes for their office (make them a king). Accordingly, they charged the people to abide in their particular stewardship truth (Go . . . unto his city).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(61) As shown above, the antitype of 1 Sam. 8 occurred in every one of the twelve Little Flock movements that were later perverted into the twelve denominations of Christendom. Above we gave merely a general description of the antitypes, without offering</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">illustrations of how it was actually carried out. We will do it here by the example of the Wesleyan movement, as it was being turned into the Methodist Church. The corrupt, time-serving and worldly bishops and presbyters of the 18th century in the Church of England, in which Wesley remained until death, well illustrate the antitype of Samuel'ss two corrupt sons; the Wesleyan movement's efforts and failures to reform these two classes of the Anglican clergy, that of Samuel'ss efforts and failures at reformation of his two sons; the dissatisfaction of the better elements of that Church in the Wesleyan movement with the corrupt ways of its bishops and presbyters and with Wesley's inability to change matters, that of the Israelites dissatisfied with Samuel'ss sons and his inability to reform them; these better elements' desiring, through what proved to be crown-lost leaders, a reformation that Wesley was unable to affect, that of the Israelites' desiring of Samuel a king as a more effective method and agent of conducting Israel's public affairs. These requests came from Wesley's preachers, who for the most part were not ordained, and thus could not, according to high church ideas, administer the sacraments: through certain ones, like Dr. Coke, desiring ordination as bishops at Wesley's hands; through the desire for the deed of declaration that, when adopted, went far toward sectarianizing the Wesleyan movement; and through the conference of 100 preachers pushing the matter of a separation of the Wesleyan movement from the Anglican Church. Wesley's many-years-long protests against the desires of the Methodist people, with pertinent reasons against sectarianizing his movement by separating it from that Church, correspond to Samuel'ss protests and reasons' against a king. Wesley's final yielding to the clamors corresponds to Samuel'ss similar yielding. Wesley's telling the people to abide by their stewardship teaching, and to wait on the Lord corresponds to Samuel'ss charge to them to abide each one in his city, waiting</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">on the Lord's providence. Wesley's referring all the pertinent matters to the Lord corresponds to Samuel'ss bringing the similar matters to the Lord. The Lord's answering Wesley's queries by His Spirit, Word and providences pertinent to the case corresponds to His answering Samuel'ss queries. Thus we see the antitype's fulfilment, as it was wrought out in connection with the Wesleyan movement. But the same general lines of procedure occurred in the. transition from the other eleven Little Flock movements toward the eleven denominations into which later they were perverted. But it will be unnecessary to trace these things in all of them, the one example of the operation of the antitype sufficing to clarify that in each of the twelve movements.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark21"></a>SAMUEL AND SAUL I SAM. 9-15</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">SAUL MADE KING. HIS VICTORY OVER NAHASH. SAMUEL'S VINDICATION AND EXHORTATIONS. SAUL'S EIRST WAR WITH THE PHILISTINES. HIS DISOBEDIENCE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE FIRST eight chapters of 1 Samuel center about Samuel; and the following seven (1 Sam. 9—15) center about Samuel and Saul. For these reasons our studies of these first eight chapters were entitled Samuel, and our studies of 1 Sam. 9—15 are being given the title, Samuel and Saul. We trust that the readers have had enjoyment of, and edification by the study of 1 Sam. 1—8, and we pray the Lord to bless to them the study of 1 Sam. 9—15. In 1 Sam. 9-15 Samuel continues to type the Little Flock as a whole, especially in its more prominent members, and more especially in the star-members and their special helpers during the Interim. In these chapters Saul types the crown-lost leaders, more especially the most prominent of these, in cmcial times, in each of Christendom's twelve denominations. There is, therefore, a twelve-fold antitype to the types of 1 Sam. 9—15, i.e., these chapters have had their fulfillment in the history of each of the twelve denominations, in so far as it concerns the crown-lost leaders of each of them. Time and space will not here permit a detailed description of each antitype as it was fulfilled in each of the twelve denominations, but an illustration of the fulfillment as an example of their fulfillments in the other denominations will be offered for each episode in a different denomination; and thus a fair idea of the involved principles applicable to all will be given. In our studies of the Gospel-Age Princes, based on Num. 7, we have given many details on the crown-lost princes in their capacity of perverting the twelve Little Flock movements</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">into the twelve denominations of Christendom, as well as on the refutations, corrections and ethics that they offered on the twelve stewardship doctrines of these twelve denominations.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(2) Crown-losers (man of Benjamin </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[j'oh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of the right hand],\)</span><span class="font3"> as a class were a figurative bow (Kish [bow]) that shot out figurative arrows against their opponents, powerfully, (Abiel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[my father is mighty}),</span><span class="font3"> as they held together (Zeror </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[bundle])</span><span class="font3"> as a company of new creatures (Bechorath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[firstborn])</span><span class="font3"> refreshed (Aphiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[refreshed])</span><span class="font3"> by the Little Flock brethren, whose chief favorites (Benjamite) they were, as they were able warriors (mighty man of power). They chief of these crown-losers were the crown-lost princes, or leaders (a son . . . Saul </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[desired, asked], 2). </span><span class="font3">But as our Pastor indicated, Saul primarily types in general the Jewish Age Israelites and in particular Israel's main political leaders of the Jewish Age, just as in contrast he showed that David represents the Gospel Age Little Flock, particularly its leaders, and Solomon, the Millennial Age Christ, Head and Body. But as more timely we have been giving the Gospel Age antitype of Saul, the Parousia antitype of David and hope to give sometime the Epiphany antitype of Solomon. Accordingly, in the present chapter the crown-lost leaders are presented as the Gospel Age antitype of Saul. These were very gifted (choice) and in the beginning of their careers were of fine character (goodly). Among Christians as a whole (children of Israel) none were better in character than these; and in mental talents they were far above their brethren (from his shoulder. . . higher . . . people). The mere mention of names such as Origen, Augustine, Chemnitz, Calvin, Simon Menno, (Faustus) Socinus, Barrows, Barclay, Coke, Campbell and Himes, as the chief crown-lost leaders of their respective denominations, proves this of them. In fact, Origen, Augustine, Chemnitz and Calvin are generally considered as having intellects that rank among the ablest of the race. The various sets of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">crown-losers (Kish, 3), as embracing in their number the crown-lost leaders (Saul) before the rise of each of the twelve denominations, had lost hold of various of their doctrines (asses . . . were lost), e.g., before the Greek Catholic Church arose, due to various errors on the relation of the Father and the Son arising during the second and early third centuries, crown-losers lost the Truth on the three natures of Christ and various features of Christ's office; again, due to various controversies arising among Lutherans, crown-losers lost considerable truths that Luther had presented. The crown-losers (Kish) sent out their ablest representatives (said to Saul... go seek the asses) to seek to find these lost truths. They sent along with them in this search the doctrinarians among the faith-justified, Uzzielite Levites (Take . . . servants with thee), which fact we construe, first, from the fitness of sending just such ones along for the search, and, second, from the fact that the Uzzielites, as the fourth group of the Kohathite Levites, had a fourth part of the Kohathite Truth teachings (a fourth part of a shekel of silver, 8).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) Up to his anointing Saul represents the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prospective </span><span class="font3">crown-lost leaders, who as such were undergoing preparatory work to fit them later to become crown-lost </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">leaders.</span><span class="font3"> These in their turn made (1) searching investigations for the lost truths throughout Christendom (passed through mount Ephraim, 4); (2) they did the same as to the lectures and publications of the third (land of Shalisha </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[third part]</span><span class="font3">) main group of the Gospel-Age faith-justified, i.e., the Kohathites, in their linguistic, exegetical, historical and doctrinal lectures and works; (3) they specialized in this search on the subtile theologians' teachings of past times (land of Shalim [/bvey|); (4) they examined the labors of the crown-losers (land of Benjamites), but all was in vain (they found them not). So many, varied and contradictory were the pertinent teachings that none satisfied them so far. Finally, in their search, as they came (5) to the teachings of Little Flock writers (land of Zuph </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[honeycomb].</span><span class="font3"> 5), the prospective crown-lost princes suggested to their faith-justified doctrinal companions that the search be given up, as in vain (Saul. . . servant... let us return), fearing that their crown-lost brethren would give up anxiety about the lost teachings, would think of them as gone astray into error and would thus be distressed about them (father . . . asses and take thought for us). These faith-justified doctrinarians (he, 6) in their study of doctrine and its history, recognizing that Little Flock brethren (man of God), especially their leaders, more especially their star-member ones, had brought forth lost truths, called (said) the attention of the prospective crown-lost princes to the writings and persons of such Little Flock leaders, as active in Little Flock movements from time to time in various denominations of the nominal church (in this city). They spoke highly of their characters (honorable man) and of the truthfulness of their teachings (all. . . cometh surely to pass); therefore they suggested that they consult them (let us go thither), in the hope that they might show them the way to the lost truths that they sought (peradventure he can shew... we should go); for we are to remember that the Little Flock brethren who began the movements later perverted into denominations started them in previously existing denominations and always worked in the denominations until 1846. The prospective crown-lost princes objected that they had no truths to present to these, as the reason for requesting an interview (what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent... no present to bring, 7). In humility they deprecated their condition (what have we?). To this the faith-justified dogmaticians answered that they had doctrinal features to offer (I have . . . fourth part. . . silver, 8), which would show the Little Flock brethren their Christian faith, offered them for their use to influence them to help (I give ... to tell us our way).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) Here a linguistic remark is parenthetically made by the authors of 1 Sam. (Samuel, Gad and Nathan seem to have been the authors of 1 and 2 Sam., 1 Chro. 29: 29), to enable their readers to see that the seer of former times was the prophet of their times; for in vs. 11, 18, 19, the obsolete word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">seer</span><span class="font3"> (not </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prophet,</span><span class="font3"> the current word) is used, to prepare the readers, for whose use the linguistic explanation (9) was made. The prospective crown-lost leaders recognized the propriety of the dogmaticians' remark (said Saul . . . Well said, 10), and agreed to his proposal (let us go); and both went to these Little Flock brethren in the denomination where their movement was active at the twelve pertinent times respectively (they went. . . where the man of God was). They surmounted the difficulties (hill [literally, ascent], 11) in the way of gaining access to the pertinent denomination (city). Amid such difficult experiences they met providentially some newly consecrated brethren (young maidens) who were seeking Truth in the Scriptures (draw water). They asked these the position of the Little Flock leaders (Is the seer here?) as, e.g., Calvin at various places in France and in Geneva inquired of newly consecrated brethren concerning the views of Zwingli and Oecolampadius, the Swiss reformers and starters of the Little Flock movement that Calvin later perverted into the Presbyterian Church. Such consecrated ones offered them not only what they asked (answered . . He is, 12), but volubly and detailedly gave them information not asked for, but calculated to help them. It is just like the newly consecrated to give more than they are asked for! They told that the Little Flock leaders had preceded them (before you); they urged haste (haste), for they had during that period (today) come to that denomination (city) to serve their, truths (sacrifice) on behalf of the people (of [literally, for] the people) throughout the denomination (in the high place). They assured them that they would find them in the denomination's most public</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">place (as soon as [literally, at your entering, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> at the gate] ... the city. . . find him, 13). They urged that they see them before they became engaged with others, which would preclude a speedy interview, for their engagements made it hard to gain such an interview (before . . . eat). Otherwise, like the rest of the people, they would have to wait to see them until after they had performed their service and all had partaken thereof (people will not eat until... he doth bless the sacrifice . . . they eat that be bidden). Hence they urged haste (get you up . . . shall find him). These typical maidens were as observant as they were newsy, for they observed Samuel'ss habits very well, and were not at all secretive as to telling them, which is just as true of the pertinent newly consecrated ones!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) These brethren overcame the difficulty of approach to the pertinent denomination (went up into the city, 14). Hence (into the city) they came into contact with the Little Flock brethren, who approached them (Samuel came out against them) on their way of ministering their Truth in the pertinent denomination (to go up to the high place). Providentially the Lord made known ahead of time (a day before Saul came, 15) to the Samuel class the coming of the prospective crown-lost princes (Tomorrow... I will send thee a man... of Benjamin, 16), e.g., as we saw that He had done to William Miller as to Elders Buckley, Himes, White, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (EC, 35-38). The Lord providentially made these Little Flock leaders recognize that they should train (anoint) such crown-lost leaders to become a class of leaders in the Little Flock movements (captain over my people Israel). These God chose to deliver His people from sectarian attackers of those who accepted the teachings of the Little Flock leaders (save my people . . hand of the Philistines), e.g., (Faustus) Socinus' attacks on the trinity delivered Unitarians from the sectarian attacks of Trinitarians. God assured antitypical Samuel that He was so arranging, out of pity for His people's</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">oppression at the hand of sectarians (looked . . . their cry). The Little Flock leaders' need of such assistance and the coming of such able men unto them was doubtless the way the Lord indicated to antitypical Samuel that they whom he was meeting were the promised helpers and leaders (Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said ... the man whom I spake to thee of. . . reign over my people, 17). The crown-lost leaders approached antitypical Samuel (Saul drew near to Samuel, 18) in a public way (in the gate), asking in what teachings of doctrine and practice the Little Flock leaders dwelt (Tell me. . . the seer's house). These by their teachings made their identity known (I am the seer, 19). They bade them attend in the pertinent denominations, which the Samuel class did not yet leave, their public ministry (go up before me unto the high place). They likewise invited them to partake of a feast of Truth that day (eat with me today); and when they would be sufficiently fed on the Truth (tomorrow) they would send them on the way of their future service (let thee go). They likewise promised to explain whatever questions were pressing on their hearts (tell thee all that is in thine heart).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) They assured them that the teachings that had been lost from the Apostolic days until the Parousia (lost three days ago, 20) were no longer to be worried about, since they were discovered in one or another of the twelve denominations (set not thy mind on them; for they are found). Then, noting the great learning, exceptional talents, deep humility and devoted spirit of service in these, antitypical Samuel assured them that they and their fellow crown-losers were both the hope and the desire of God's people (all the desire of Israel... on thee . . . father's house). By their acts the prospective crown-lost leaders indicated that they were crown-losers (a Benjamite, 21). By their acts they also indicated their humility in recognizing their unworthiness to be in the Little Flock (smallest of the tribes of Israel, 15: 17) and the least part of this class (my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin). Hence they earnestly demurred at antitypical Samuel'ss so speaking to them. Such a spirit of humility shines out in all the crown-lost leaders at their outstart, especially in Origen, Augustine, Simon Menno, Barclay, Campbell and Himes, as their biographies testify. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">E.g.,</span><span class="font3"> The Confessions of Augustine show this spirit in a most praiseworthy way. Thereupon antitypical Samuel took antitypical Saul and the faith-justified dogmaticians into the banqueting room of Truth (took Saul and his servant. . . into the parlour, 22) and gave them the honor place, thereby bestowing chief attention on them (sit in the chiefest place), though not neglecting other guests at the feast (them that were bidden). The guests were all of natures lower than the Little Flock (30 persons [30 is a multiple of 10]). The Little Flock leaders charged themselves, in their capacities as preparers of the spiritual food (cook, 23), with the work of giving the special stewardship truths to antitypical Saul, as the thing especially set aside for the purpose (Bring the portion... Set it by thee). As charged, so was it done to Saul with the pertinent twelve stewardship truths and their related detailed matters (cook . . . shoulder . . . upon it. . . before Saul, 24). Antitypical Samuel heartily commended to antitypical Saul for his appropriation some detailed features not given to others (which is left [literally, reserved] . . . eat), encouraging them to put it into a condition for partaking (set it before thee) and assuring him that it was reserved until then for them from the outstart of their inviting others to the feast (this time . . . kept. . . invited the people). The prospective crown-lost leaders in the twelve pertinent periods partook of the twelve stewardship doctrines and of certain related details from and with antitypical Samuel, e.g., Chemnitz received the pertinent Truth from and with Melanchthon, Alexander Campbell from and with Thomas Campbell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) Thereupon antitypical Samuel and Saul drew back somewhat from the respective denominations' activities in which they had been engaged (come down from the high place into [literally, of] the city, 25). Following this they set the Truth forth before antitypical Saul with a restful result in the latter (communed [additional reading, he spread a couch—Ginsburg's notes; see Rotherham]) in a public way before the Little Flock movements (top of the house). On this Truth antitypical Saul rested himself (he lay down, Ginsburg's notes; see Rotherham. These words are not in the A. V., but instead a variant and incorrect reading has been rendered in the A. V. of v. 26, &quot;and they arose early&quot;). Very early in the next stage of affairs, publicly before the Little Flock movements, antitypical Samuel hastened antitypical Saul to go to their proper denominations (about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to [literally, on] the top . . . up . . . away, v. 26). Aroused from their rest in the Truth (Saul arose), antitypical Samuel and Saul proceeded in association to activities in the pertinent denominations, e.g., after Thomas Campbell had measurably indoctrinated Alexander Campbell in the teaching that the Bible is the Christian's sole creed and center of union, both of them in unison (both of them, he and Samuel) taught this feature of Truth in the Presbyterian Church, of which both were members. The same thing in principle was done in the other eleven denominations. This course brought them farther and farther away from harmony with the pertinent denominations (going down to the end of the city, 27). At this juncture, as they were falling out more and more with the respective denominations, antitypical Samuel, desiring privacy for their qualifying antitypical Saul for leadership, indicated their desire that the faith-justified dogmaticians be sent away, asked antitypical Saul to remove these from them (Samuel said to Saul . . . pass on before us), which was done (passed on). Then antitypical Samuel asked</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">for antitypical Saul's undivided attention (stand thou still a while), in order that they might further instruct them in the Lord's Word pertinent to the circumstances in which they were (shew thee the word of God).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) 1 Sam. 10 treats of Saul's being made king of all Israel, and as such types the crown-lost leaders' being made the leaders of the twelve denominations of Christendom. Up to this point in the antitype the teachings that antitypical Samuel, the Little Flock leaders, had been giving antitypical Saul, the prospective crown-lost leaders, apart from a few details that their superior gifts enabled them to understand better than the rest of the consecrated, were given in no more detail to antitypical Saul than antitypical Samuel had given them to other brethren, but from here on full qualifications for the pertinent leadership in the way of enlightenment and encouragement were given by antitypical Samuel to antitypical Saul (Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, 1), explaining that they were so doing to them, because the Lord had chosen and qualified them unto leadership over His people (Lord hath anointed thee . . over his inheritance). Antitypical Samuel assured them that in the period of their leaving the Little Flock as mouthpieces of the Lord (departed from me today, 2) crown-retainers and crown-losers (two men), in connection with the help and the remembrance of the two Gospel-Age spiritual covenants (by Rachel's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[ewe] </span><span class="font3">sepulchre), near the border of crown-losers' sphere (in the border of Benjamin), in protection against too hard trial (Zelzah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[heat—shade]),</span><span class="font3"> would assure them that the lost teachings had been found (asses ... are found), and that their long quest therefore was worrying crown-losers (sorroweth for you), who instead of worrying for the lost teachings (left the care of the asses), feared that they had gone astray (What shall I do for my son). This could be told them, since the wide-awake crown-retainers and crownlosers had from</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">antitypical Samuel learned these truths. Again, antitypical Samuel assured antitypical Saul that, as they would turn from the subjects of the two Gospel-Age spiritual covenants (go. . . thence, 3) and would advance to the strength of high character (come to the plain [literally, oak] of Tabor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[height]</span><span class="font3">), they would be met by consecrated ones of the Little Flock who would present themselves to them in three aspects (three men) : In the first of these aspects they would appear as believing in the sin-offering of Jesus, the burnt offering of Jesus and the sin-offering of the Church (one carrying three kids); in the second they would appear as believers in the deeper teachings of these three matters (another carrying three loaves of bread); and in the third they would appear as explainers of the easier matters of sacrifice (another carrying a bottle of wine). It would be natural for the crown-lost leaders to meet Little Flock members so engaged when crown-lost leaders had just left their leaders, though we are not to conclude from this that, the philosophy of the Church's share in the Sin-offering was then clearly understood; rather the simple fact that the Church is privileged to suffer with the Lord for righteousness was doubtless the thing then being taught and lived out. Hence the things that they imparted to antitypical Saul were not the deeper teachings on all three of these matters, but the deeper teachings of Jesus' suffering as atoning for sin—sin-offering, and receiving the manifestation of God's acceptance—burnt offering (salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread, 4). Antitypical Samuel, who knew that the ransom sacrifice was the allimportant Truth for the consecrated, charged antitypical Saul to receive the two antitypical loaves (which thou shalt receive of their hands).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) Antitypical Samuel told antitypical Saul that he would have a third experience, which would be in the twelve denominations of the nominal church (hill of God, v. 5), in which the pertinent twelve Little</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Flock movements would be working. They assured them that in each of these, where there would be a body of sectarian fighters (garrison of the Philistines), there would come to them companies of preachers (company of prophets), after ending certain features of their services for their respective denominations (coming down from the high place). These would be working in favor of their conceptions of their written creeds (psaltery), books of devotion (tabret [cymbals]), books of hymns or sermons (pipe) and the Bible (harp) and preaching (prophesy) as they proceeded on their course of work. Furthermore, antitypical Samuel told antitypical Saul that the Lord's Spirit would so prevail over them (come upon thee [literally, prosper over thee], 6) that it would move them to preach among such preachers (shalt prophesy, with them), and the effect of this upon them would be to alter them entirely, i.e., make them opponents to the respective sects in which the Little Flock movements began (turned into another man), e.g., Dr. Coke would be changed into an enemy of the Church of England, in which the Wesleyan Little Flock movement began; Alexander Campbell would be changed into an enemy of the Presbyterian Church, in which the Barton W. Stone and Thomas Campbell Little Flock movement began. After these three experiences would be fulfilled (when these signs are come, v. 7), antitypical Samuel charged antitypical Saul to do whatever the circumstances would point out for them to do (do as occasion serve thee), because they would be the Lord's indications for their activities (God is with thee).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) Antitypical Samuel assured antitypical Saul that the latter would come into various turning points of crucial events before the former would come to their assistance (shall go down before me to Gilgal [circuit, rolling away], 8). Then they would come to their succor by fruitful services, expressing God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice (I will come . . . offer</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">burnt offerings), in fulfillment of their consecration vows (peace offerings), impressing upon them the thought that they should await antitypical Samuel'ss full time of coming (seven days shalt thou tarry) and not take things into their own hand without his presence (till I come). These things done, antitypical Samuel would tell them what they should do (shew thee what thou shalt do). After antitypical Samuel'ss instructions had been delivered to antitypical Saul, the latter pursued their mental journey away from the former (turned. . . from Samuel, 9). God gave them the heart of organizers and servants and defenders of their stewardship truths and their related doctrines (God gave him another heart). And the three forecast sets of experiences of vs. 2-6 occurred to and in them in the respective periods (those signs came to pass). Particulars connected with the first two are not given at their fulfillment, but on the third they are given in vs. 10-13. V. 10 simply states the fact of the third's fulfillment just as stated prophetically in vs. 5, 6; and vs. 11-13 relate certain accompanying experiences. Antitypical Saul's acquaintances from times gone by (all that knew him before time, 11) looked upon them (saw) and behold, they witnessed them moving themselves to preach among preachers (behold, he prophesied among the prophets). They questioned one another incredulously (people said one to another [literally, every man to his friend]) as to the meaning of this unusual happening (What is this ... the son of Kish?), and questioned wonderingly whether these controversialists (Kish [bow]) were also preachers (Is Saul also among the prophets?).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) But a class in the same denomination (one of the same place, 12) answered their question by another question, to the effect that no one could tell how prophets came into being, i.e., that they became such, not by human birth or training, but by God's appointment, and that as ones that others would not expect to be made such. The lives of every one of the twelve</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">chief crown-lost leaders exemplify this unexpected thing (who is their father?), e.g., Augustine's, Calvin's and Campbell's previous lives gave no hint of such an office coming to them later on. Secondary crown-lost leaders, like deacon Athanasius, in the Greek; lawyer Cyprian, in the Roman; lawyer Beza, in the Presbyterian; and superintendent Andreae, in the Lutheran Church, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> are examples of the same. This fact is so frequent an one that it has become recognized generally as a matter of ordinary providential dealings, yea, even a Scriptural teaching (therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also [literally, even Saul] among the prophets?) Such prophesyings were in favor of the respective stewardship truths, and the result was that it brought antitypical Saul into oppositional prominence in their respective denominations (end of prophesying, he came to the high place, 13), e.g., Chemnitz to Rome, Augustine to the Manichaeans and Donatists, Calvin to Rome, Coke to the Church of England, Campbell to the Presbyterian Church, Simon Menno to Rome, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc. </span><span class="font3">This course of theirs led the theological professors as a class, who were the doctrinal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> leaders in their respective denominations (uncle [Ner, who, as well as Kish, was a son of Abi el, 9: 1; 14 : 51, which facts prove Saul and Abner, the future captain of Saul's army, to have been first cousins], 14), to speak to antitypical Saul and their associated faith-justified doctrinarians (Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant), asking on what theological subjects they had been making mental journeys (Whither went ye?). They answered that they had been searching for the theological teachings of Truth that had been lost out of their respective denominational beliefs (said, To seek the asses). They further said that, failing in their search (they were no where), they sought interviews with Little Flock leaders (came to Samuel). The theologians, long suspicious of, and hostile to antitypical Samuel, eagerly inquired as to their teachings (Saul's uncle said, Tell</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">me, I pray thee, what Samuel said, 15) . Antitypical Saul told the theologians (said unto his uncle, v. 16) that anhtypical Samuel said clearly (plainly) that these lost and sought truths had been re-discovered (asses were found), and explained them to the theologians, but told nothing of their choice and training by anhtypical Samuel for crown-lost princeship (kingdom ... he told him not).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) Antitypical Samuel made it known that those interested in Lithe Flock movements in the respective denominations should enter before the Lord into the condition of watchfulness and prayer, in view of critical times among them (Samuel called the people . . . unto the Lord to Mizpeh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[watch-tower],</span><span class="font3"> 17). There they reminded the Lord's people (the children of Israel, 18) of God's past favors in delivering them (1) from Satan's evil order of affairs (I brought up Israel out of Egypt), (2) from his servants (out of the hand of the Egyptians), (3) from the domains of sin and error (of all kingdoms) and (4) from sin, error, selfishness and worldliness (of them that oppressed you). They added that, despite these delivering acts of God (saved you . . . adversities and tribulations, 19), the Lord's people had rejected their God (ye . . . rejected your God), refusing to accept Him as their King, by clamoring for leaders to be their symbolic king (set a king over us). Therefore, acceding to their clamors, they told them to come in their denominations (tribes) and in their sects or leaders (thousands [or princes]) before the Lord, that He might choose them a set of leaders as a symbolic king. Under Divine testings on all Spiritual Israel administered through antitypical Samuel (Samuel caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, 20), the crown-losers were brought forward as having among them the ones qualified as such figurative king (the tribe of Benjamin was taken). Under Divine trial effected through antitypical Samuel upon the crown-losers (he caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near, 21), the choice simmered down to its specially Truth-studious and Bible-spreading leaders (family of Matri </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[rainy]</span><span class="font3"> was taken); and from these the choice narrowed down to the most capable, faithful and humble of these (Saul the son of Kish was taken). These were looked for among those who were conspicuous, but in vain (sought him, he could not be found).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(13) Such leaders not coming to the fore, the antitypical Israelites again looked into the principles of the Lord's Word and into His Spirit and providence for information respecting their whereabouts (enquired of the Lord further, 22), asking if such leaders would yet come to the fore (man should yet come). The Lord, through the principles of His Word and through His Spirit and providences, gave answer that they were to be found concealed in humility, occupied among lowly ministries and things (answered. . . hid himself among the stuff [literally, vessels, teachings]), e.g., Augustine, when so desired, sought in humility to hide himself in studies and lowly occupations among the brethren. This is true also of Calvin, Chemnitz, Coke, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc. </span><span class="font3">But the antitypical Israelites brought these rericent ones out of their student privacy and lowly occupations (ran and fetched him, 23). Under these conditions antitypical Saul presented themselves before the people (when he stood [literally, had presented himself] among the people). Here their great talents and fine spirit were found to be very much superior to those of their fellows and brethren (higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward). Generously antitypical Samuel introduced the crown-lost leaders to antitypical Israel (Samuel said to all the people, 24) as the Lord's chosen for them (the Lord hath chosen), ornamented with incomparable talents and good spirit (none like him among all the people), e.g., Farel so introduced Calvin; Melanchthon, Chemnitz; Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to the antitypical Israelites. Antitypical Saul was heartily</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">received and acclaimed by the people as their special leaders (people shouted. . . save the king). Antitypical Samuel laid before antitypical Israel the reciprocal dudes and privileges of antitypical Saul and Israel, not only orally, but also in writing, as matters pertinent to the Lord (Samuel told. . . wrote . . . before the Lord, 25), and sent the people on their way to their respective denominations (Samuel sent. . . every man to his house). Antitypical Saul went to his position in the nominal church, accompanied by devoted colaborers (Saul... to Gibeah .... with him a band . . . God had touched, 26). But in each denomination there were opponents who belittled, despised, rejected them, showing no devotion (children of Belial [worthlessness] said . . . this man save us ? . . . despised him and brought him no presents, 27). But they acted as though they did not hear their opponents (heldhis peace [literally, he was as deaf]).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) 1 Sam. 11 treats of Saul's first war in deliverance of Israel from their enemies. It types how in each of the twelve denominations the crown-lost leaders had to wage controversy in defense of its stewardship and related truths. This matter, for clearness' sake, as an illustration of all twelve experiences, will be shown as to how especially Martin Chemnitz and John Gerhard, others cooperating, delivered antitypical Israel in the Lutheran Church from the attacks that the ablest Jesuits and other Romanist theologians as clericalists (Nahash </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[serpent]</span><span class="font3"> the Ammonite </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[from the people,</span><span class="font3"> clericalists], 1), as the special standardbearers of Rome, waged against it. The Council of Trent (intermittently held between 1545 and 1563), largely dominated by Jesuits, issued its decrees and canons as the modern creed of Romanism; and papacy, through the Jesuits, in harmony with the Council's views, sought to win back (encamped) to Romanism the Lutherans, who, like all other denominationists shortly after the respective Little Flock movements were perverted into sects, became dried up and hardened as to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the spirit of their respective Little Flock movements (Jabesh-gilead [dry rocky land] ). Prior to the Council of Trent the religious controversies in Germany, the emperor siding with Rome, made the Lutherans desire to come to an understanding with the Romanists (all the men of Jabesh said . . . covenant with us . . . serve thee) and thus end the prolonged political and religious disorders in Germany. The Council of Trent was convoked, among other reasons, to end these disorders in favor of Rome; and the emperor, as the Romanist ally, and the hierarchy (Nahash, 2) sought to make as a condition of this understanding (condition. . . covenant) the rejection of the Reformation Truth and the acceptance of the decrees and canons of Trent as the papacy's creed, which would have blinded the main one of the eyes of understanding of the Lutherans (thrust out all your right eyes) by propaganda efforts to refute Lutheranism and prove Romanism. In the furtherance of the scheme to produce this spiritual blindness Jesuit propagandists in large numbers were sent into Germany, and made subtle attacks on Lutheranism. The proposed apostasy was intended as a reproach to all Protestants (a reproach upon all Israel). The Lutherans in Germany were hard pressed, especially by the emperor's political measures in favor of Rome and against them, and by the keen, but sophistical arguments of the Romanist theologians, especially of the Jesuits (encamped against Jabesh-gilead). As a result many, yielding to the political and theological pressure, fell away to Rome from the Lutherans. The leaders (elders, 3) asked for a truce (Give us seven days' respite), which was given them in various treaties, the object of the Lutherans being to gain a sufficiency (seven) of time to gain succor from their allies (send. . . man to save us). If such succor should not come in a reasonable time they would give up to the Empire and Papacy (we will come out to you).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) It was especially to the Lutheran Church as the sphere of crown-lost leaders (to Gibeah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[height] </span><span class="font3">of Saul, 4) that the word of this threatening disaster came (messengers . . . told . . the people). This caused the deepest concern and distress among the Lutherans, high and low, civil and ecclesiastical (all the people . . . wept). Before this the crown-lost leaders were occupied with their studies along other lines and with pastoral work (Saul came after the herd out of the field, 5). The grief of the people coming to their notice, they inquired for the reason (What. . . that they weep?). Then they were apprised of the threatening situation (told him... of Jabesh). In the earlier stage of this sorrow, i.e., about 1560, the Jesuits, under the leadership of the Portuguese Jesuit, Payva d'Andrada, a member of the Council of Trent, made a strong attack on the Lutheran catechism. Its object of deception and its distressing effect on the Lutherans becoming known to Martin Chemnitz (1522-1586), a representative of antitypical Saul among Lutherans, he became greatly aroused (Spirit of God came upon Saul. . . those tidings, 6); and the more and more deeply he meditated on d'Andrada's sophistries, the more and more sharply angry he became (anger was kindled greatly). He sent word and evidence (messengers, 7) of his sacrificing his humanity (yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces), everywhere in Germany, through his book in defense of the catechism against d'Andrada, issued in 1562, entitled, The Main Points of the Jesuits' Theology (sent. . . coasts of Israel). He assured all his fellow Lutherans that if they would not come to the support of himself and his co-workers (Saul) and Luther and Melanchthon (Samuel), their human rights would be destroyed (by their Romanist captors). Everywhere the Lutherans were aroused, in their reverence for God and Truth, as though they were one man, to fight for their faith under the lead of these servants of God (fear of the Lord . . . come out with one consent). But this was after a considerable number had fallen away to Rome. Antitypical Saul defined, described, limited and explained these sup</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">porters by the Truth (Bezek </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[lightning],</span><span class="font3"> 8); both the common run of their supporters (Israel) and the leading ones of them (Judah) were such as indicated a lower standing than that of the Divine class (300,000 ... 30,000 [multiples often]).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(16) The first controversial message of Chemnitz, Gerhard, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> were the messengers (messengers, 9) to the besieged Lutherans (men of Jabesh-gilead) that in due time (tomorrow), when the full needed Truth would come (sun be hot), they would bring help (help). Chemnitz's first message was the abovementioned book of his; that of Gerhard (1582-1637) was his incidental refutations of Romanism found in his great dogmatic work entitled, Theological Topics, which in the Lutheran Church is considered the greatest work on dogmatics ever written. Other Lutheran anti-Romanist writers produced similar works of secondary importance, contrasted with the prime importance of the first anti-Romanist books of these two Lutheran standard-bearers. All of these came as messengers of help to the antitypical Jabesh-gileadites and rejoiced their hearts (messengers came ... to the men of Jabesh . . . glad). The course of the Lutherans in Germany gave the Romanists the impression that they would shortly surrender and accept the blinding effects of Romanist doctrines and practice (said, Tomorrow ... ye shall do . . . seemeth good unto you). D'Andrada in 1564 published two answers to Chemnitz's reply to his criticism of the Lutheran catechism. The first of these answers, together with the decrees and canons of the Council of Trent, came into Chemnitz's hands; and as a result of his study of them he decided to issue a thorough refutation of Romanism and defense of Lutheranism. This he did in his work, in four large parts or four large volumes, in Latin, entitled, The Examination of the Tridentine Council, issued 1565-1573. This work and Gerhard's Catholic Confession are undoubtedly by far the greatest anti-Romanist works ever produced. Chemnitz's large</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">quarto did Rome more damage than any other book of that period. D'Andrada repented many a time for provoking the controversy. This book stopped the Romeward movement in the Lutheran Church, and put the Romanists very much on the defensive. In consequence of its effects the Lutherans invented the proverb, &quot;If Martin [Chemnitz] had not come, Martin [Luther] would not have stood.&quot; The book went through many editions. A copy of the fourth edition, published in 1578, five years after the first edition was completed, is in the writer's library. It was translated into German and French, and in 1861 a Latin edition appeared.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) So mighty an attack on Romanism and able a defense of Lutheranism the Romanists could not leave unanswered. Many replies to it were issued. The ablest of these was by the Jesuit, Cardinal Bellarmine (1542-1629), who is by far the greatest controversialist of Rome against Protestantism. Bellarmine aimed to answer every objection ever urged against Romanism in four huge quarto volumes entitled, Disputations, issued 1581-1593. The importance and weight that he attached to Chemnitz's work can be seen from the fact that he devoted 5/6 of this huge work to his answers to Chemnitz's Examination. Unlike most Romanist controversialists, who set up straw men and kick them over, Bellarmine stated truthfully and clearly, with its proofs, each Protestant argument, and then attempted to refute it. Its fairness offended the pope, who, fearing that it would injure more than help Romanism, at first put it on the Index, but later removed it therefrom. Bellarmine was undoubtedly mentally a very gifted man, a great scholar and an exceedingly able debater, but his difficulty was that he had a poor cause to defend. Yet he did as capable a job as probably highest human ability backed by Satan's special help could have done with the bad cause that he had to advocate. He was answered more or less tersely by many, especially by Gerhard in his Theological</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Topics; and the latter answered him detailedly and most destructively in his large four-volumed-quarto work entitled, The Catholic Confession, issued 1634-1637. Of all of Bellarmine's and other Romanist controversialists' antagonists, Gerhard is the most dreaded by them. He pulverized the Romanist positions. No two Romanist controversialists can agree on answers to him. The writer is the happy possessor of the chief pertinent works of Chemnitz, Ballarmine and Gerhard, which stand side by side, now in perfect peace, on one of the shelves of his main Romano-Protestant bookcase! Between Chemnitz and Gerhard lesser Lutheran anti-Romanist controversialists wrote. These gave the Romanists added misery in the fight, but Gerhard practically ended the battle, though later antiRomanist Lutheran controversialists, e.g., Calov, the fourth greatest Lutheran theologian, in his Papistical Mataeology (Vaindoctrine), issued 1647, wrote against Rome, as a pursuit of a defeated and fleeing enemy. The result of the fight to Romanist warriors was, as v. 11 puts it: &quot;They which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.&quot; The fight was well planned by antitypical Saul, who, as planned, waged it along (1) doctrinal, (2) historical and (3 ) exegetical lines (put the people in three companies, 11), and attacked the Romanists early (morning watch) and continued the fight for over three-quarters of a century (heat of the day [mid-afternoon, the full day here standing for a century]). In similar ways the other eleven crown-lost-leader groups overthrew the antitypical Nahash that attacked their respective denominational views. But the example of how the Lutheran part of antitypical Saul's battle was fought will suffice to illustrate the other eleven forms of the battle, as well as to clarify the entire type, since our space will not permit the presentation of the involved details of the other eleven parts of the antitypical Jabesh-gileadites' and Saul's pertinent parts therein.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(18) After antitypical Saul's great victory in each of the twelve denominations, their adherents desired of antitypical Samuel (people said unto Samuel, 12) that they be permitted to disfellowship the sons of Belial who said that antitypical Saul should not be their leaders (Who . . . said, Shall Saul reign over us? [ Ginsburg's notes read: Saul shall not reign over us; thus not a question, but an affirmation] bring the men ... to death). This the crown-lost princes forbade, saying that no one should be disfellowshipped at that time, since God had then wrought deliverance for His people (not a man. . . death this day; for today. . . salvation in Israel, 13). Antitypical Samuel counseled the people to meet the turning points of their crises by giving renewed energy to the leadership of antitypical Saul (said Samuel ... go to Gilgal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[turning, circuit],</span><span class="font3"> and renew the kingdom, 14). Accordingly, the people at the turning points of their crises renewed the energy of antitypical Saul's leadership as a matter pertaining to the Lord (made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal, 15). At the turn in their affairs they fulfilled their covenant vows in matters pertaining to the Lord (sacrifices of peace offerings before the Lord), and the crown-lost leaders and their supporters were very glad indeed for their victory and the resultant strengthening of the crown-lost princes' leadership. This occurred in the pertinent turning points of the twelve denominations' controversies with their enemies, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Origen's victory over Beryllus of Arabia on the Father's and Son's being the same person in different forms (Modalism); Augustine's victory over the Donatists on rooting out the unsaintly (tares); Calvin's and Beza's victory over the Romanists on transubstantiation and over the Lutherans on instrumentalization and on the alleged communication of the Divine attributes to Christ's humanity, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> omnipresence, omniscience, Omnipotence, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc:,</span><span class="font3"> Simon Menno's victory over Lutherans and Calvinists on Anabaptism; Faustus Socinus' victory over Romanism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Anglicanism, Anabaptistism and other so-called orthodoxies on trinitarianism;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Barrowe's and Greenwoods victory over Papacy, Episcopacy and Presbyterianism on ecclesiaism; Coke's victory over Calvinism on predestination, irresistible grace, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc:.</span><span class="font3"> Campbell's victory over Romanism on the Bible as the true creed and center of Christian unity; and Hime's victory over post- Millennialists on the chronology.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(19) Next 1 Sam. 12 will engage our attention. It treats of Samuel'ss defense of his ministry, of his reproof of the people for their various apostacies, among others, in desiring leaders other than Little Flock leaders, of his exhorting them to obey, of his giving a sign from God as a proof of this sin, of their asking for mercy through Samuel'ss intercession, after being convinced of their wrong by the sign, of Samuel'ss continued exhortation to them to walk before the Lord in uprightness, of his promise to pray for them, of his repeated exhortations and of warnings against the effects of sin. At each turning point of antitypical Israel's crises, antitypical Samuel took occasion to inculcate some needed lessons, as well as to defend himself against the charges of the sons of Belial, which he here proceeds to do (Samuel said unto all Israel, 1), in connection with their evil desire which expressed itself in their clamoring for another set of leaders than those of the Little Flock as direct representatives of the Lord, and which under protest was granted them by the Lord and His Little Flock representatives (I have harkened. . . and have made a king over you). They pointed out these leaders in each case, after the turning points of their crises came (behold, the king walketh before you, 2); but at the same time the Little Flock leaders were well worn out (old and gray-headed). We see this, e.g., in Wm. Miller's words in 1846, when he declared himself as too old and worn out to bear the burdens of the service much longer, and that he must let the younger men take it up (EC, 35 (32)). Others of the Little Flock leaders at the involved turning points of antitypical Israel's history did the same thing. They called attention to the fact</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that the more prominent and less prominent clergy were also ministering to God's people (my sons are with you). They further declared at each of such periods that they as a class had made themselves serve God's people from early in the Gospel Age (have walked [literally, have made myself walk, i.e., conducted myself properly] before you from my childhood [literally, youth] unto this day). Thereupon they challenged anyone to step forward in their presence (Behold, here I am, 3) with the proof, not a groundless surmise, of their ever having wronged anyone in their ministry, and to do it before God and antitypical Saul (witness against me before the Lord, and before His anointed).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) Then they threw out the challenge on particulars: Had they taken away from anyone his privileges as to our Lord's sacrificed humanity or as to the services of the Truth (whose ox have I taken) ? Had they taken away from anyone his privileges as to the Truth or the Truth literature (whose ass have I taken) ? Had they unjustly taken anyone's rights from him (whom have I defrauded [literally, oppressed])? Had they crushed anyone in heart and right hopes or in any other particular (whom have I oppressed [literally, crushed]) ? Have they received from anyone a bribe that would move them to close their eyes to the briber's wrong-doing (received any bribe to blind [literally, cover] mine eyes therewith) ? They asserted that if such things could be proven against them, they would make restitution (I will restore it [rather, them; there is no corresponding word in the Hebrew, so the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">them </span><span class="font3">should be italicized] you). No such things having been done by the Little Flock leaders, who, instead, gave up their all on behalf of the brethren, and the brethren all knowing this, they with one voice answered negatively (not defrauded [oppressed] us, nor oppressed [crushed] us, neither hast thou taken ought of any, 4). Thereupon antitypical Samuel called the Lord and antitypical Saul to witness as between them</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and the people on this subject (the Lord is witness . . . and his anointed. . . this day . . . not found ought in my hand, 5). To this all agreed (they answered, He is witness). It is a fact of history that in proportion to the prominence of the Divine uses and faithfulness of the Little Flock leaders, in that proportion have the sons of Belial </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[worthlessness] </span><span class="font3">surmised and charged evil against them, which fact has compelled them more or less elaborately to defend themselves against such charges, in order that the ministry be not blamed and injured, e.g., our Lord, Paul, John, Arius, Claudius of Turin, Berengar, Abelard, Marsiglio, Wyclif, Hus, Wessel, Savonarola, Luther, Zwingli, Hubmaier, Servetus, Cranmer, Wesley, T. Campbell, Miller, Russell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> This should not surprise us, since they are the special targets at whom Satan shoots his arrows, even bitter words. But they have all had these satisfactions, that they have been innocent of the charges, that the brethren knew that none of them were true, and had no real charge against them, as vs. 4 and 5 typically prove and as Matt. 5: 10-12 literally proves to them. Amid such experiences of slander they have been comforted with the Lord's promise that in due time He will bring forth their righteousness [purity of character] as the light and their judgment [teachings] as the noonday (Ps. 37: 6).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(21) Thereupon antitypical Samuel brought to the people's attention (Samuel said unto the people, 6) some of the main acts of God on behalf of His people during the Gospel Age and their frequent apostasies, as admonitions against a repetition of the wrongs. They called their attention to His raising up of our Lord (Moses) and the Church (Aaron) and His bringing them out of the kingdom of darkness (brought your fathers out of the land of Egypt) into the Kingdom of His dear Son (Col. 1: 13), which made them His people. In view of this fact antitypical Samuel requested their special attention (therefore stand still [literally, set yourselves, i.e., to listen], 7), in order that they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">might teach (not reason) them in matters pertaining to the Lord (reason . . . before the Lord), all the glorious attributes of God (all the righteous acts [literally, righteousnesses of the Lord]), which He exercised toward them lately and earlier (which He did to you and your fathers). He showed that after the Lord's people had come to symbolic Egypt (Jacob was come into Egypt, 8) and were oppressed by Satan, sin, error and death and cried for deliverance (your fathers cried unto the Lord), God sent Christ (Moses) and the Church (Aaron), who by the preaching of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus brought them out of Satan's kingdom into God's reckoned Kingdom in justification, and caused them later to come into the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit (made them dwell in this place). Further, they taught the Lord's people that when in various of their generations they forgot the Lord (forgat the Lord, 9), He gave them up (he sold them) to the power of the leaders of the armies of the nominal church (Sisera </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[binder in chains},</span><span class="font3"> captain of the host of Hazor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[enclosedplace}), </span><span class="font3">to the power of the sectarians in the various denominations (hand of the Philistines) and to the power of the papacy as the most autocratic of all rulers (hand of the king of Moab </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[from father}</span><span class="font3"> ). These waged long warfare against the Lord's captive people (fought against them). Yet when they repented and cried for deliverance, confessing their sins (cried . . . said, We have sinned . . . forsaken the Lord, 10), and acknowledged that they had served Satan in his power-grasping and lording representatives (Baalim [/ords]) and the adulterous union of church and state ( [literally, the] Ashtaroth </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[the beauty, i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the goddess of love, Venus of the Romans, Astarte of the Greeks; Ashtaroth was the Phoenician name for this goddess, whose rites were accompanied with licentiousness and prostitution] ). They prayed for deliverance from these enemies (deliver us . . . enemies),</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">promising to serve the Lord, if delivered (we will serve thee).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) God raised up for their deliverance our Lord (Jerubbaal [striver with Baal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lord, i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> Satan as powergrasper and tyrant], 11), the star-members beginning with those of the Thyatira Church and ending with those of the Laodicean Church (Bedan </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[j'oh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of Dan\</span><span class="font3"> Hebrew, Ben-dan, contracted into Bedan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> Samson] ), the anti-Romanist star-members of the Philadelphia Church (Jephthah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[He— God—opens])</span><span class="font3"> and the Little Flock leaders (Samuel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[name—</span><span class="font3">character—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of God]).</span><span class="font3"> By these God delivered His people from all their enemies and oppressors mentioned above (delivered. . . enemies on every side) and made them dwell in safety from such (dwelled safely). They declared that when antitypical Israel was threatened by the clericalists (Nahash </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[serpent],</span><span class="font3"> king. . . Ammon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[from people],</span><span class="font3"> 12), they clamored for the very ablest as their leaders to be appointed by antitypical Samuel (me . . . king shall reign over us), despite the fact that God was their Leader (God was your king). Then antitypical Samuel pointed to their desired leaders as Divinely given them (13) . They then told antitypical Israel the things that, if done by them, would make them put God before them and their leaders (shall both ye . . . king. . . continue following the Lord [literally, ye . . . king shall be after the Lord, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> shall put God before them—God first—Ps. 16: 8; the A. V. does not give the thought of the original], 14). They told them what these things are that, if done, wall set God before them and their leaders: (1) reverence for God (fear the Lord); (2) carrying out their consecration of sacrifice (serve Him); (3) practicing His Word (obey His voice); (4) submissiveness as against revolutionism (not rebel). They further told antitypical Israel that disobedience to the Lord's Word (not obey the voice of the Lord, 15) and rebellion against His precepts, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> arrangements (rebel against the commandment</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of the Lord), would turn God against them, as it did before (against you, as . . . your fathers).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) They then called their special attention to a great work that God was about to perform in their sight (16). As it was unexpected for rain and thunder in Palestine to come during wheat harvest (wheat harvest today, 17), so during the times that great numbers were won by the sectarianizing and stewardship-truths-perverting work of the crown-lost leaders, it would be unexpected that at the prayer of the Little Flock leaders (I will call unto the Lord), the Lord would raise up Little Flock controversies (thunder) against such works and give new Truth (rain) through them. This unexpected thing would give antitypical Israel clear evidence of God's disapproval of their great wickedness in asking for the gifted sectarian and perverting leaders for whom they clamored (perceive and see that your wickedness is great. . . asking you a king). At antitypical Samuel'ss prayer (Samuel called, 18) the Lord raised up a controversy (thunder) against the sectarianizing work and the perverting work on the respective stewardship doctrines, and sent truths (rain) to set this matter right through the Little Flock leaders, e.g., Little Flock leaders praying for the Lord's help were by Him enabled to controvert, and give new truths against, the perversions of Athanasius on Christ's person, of Augustine on the one Church, of Calvin on the Lord's Supper, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc.</span><span class="font3"> This had the effect of arousing great fear toward God and antitypical Samuel in the people (greatly feared the Lord and Samuel). Recognizing from these controversies and truths their great wrong in choosing such leaders (added. . . sins this evil, 19), they besought antitypical Samuel'ss prayers that they might not be cut off from being God's people (pray. . . that we die not). Noting the people's repentance, antitypical Samuel comforted them with the thought that, though they had done the great evil involved in seeking leaders after their own preference (done all</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">this wickedness, 20), yet they should no longer fear (Fear not), for there was yet hope for God's favor, if they would not turn in apostasy from Him (turn not aside from following the Lord), but serve Him heartily (serve . . . heart). They exhorted them to avoid apostatizing (turn ye not aside, 21), which, if done, would lead to their going after things of emptiness, unprofitableness, unsalutariness and disaster, such as sin, error, selfishness and worldliness in their varied forms (after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver); for promise whatever they might, they are but unavailing (vain [literally, emptiness]).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) The reasons why they should take comfort were: (1) that the Lord's oath to His people would keep Him in honor-bound faithfulness to them (for His great name's sake, 22); and thus He would not forsake them; and (2) His pleasure in choosing them as His people was also a guarantee of this (pleased the Lord to make you his people). Moreover, as for antitypical Samuel, they felt it a sin and an abomination against God, from which they prayed the Lord to deliver them (as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord, 23), that they should give up praying for the brethren (in ceasing to pray [literally, making myself pray] for you). Not only this, but they promised to continue instructing as to the good and right teachings of the Lord (teach you the good and the right way). They stressed again the thoughts that the people should surely reverence God and serve Him most heartily in harmony with the Truth (fear . . . serve him in truth . . . heart, 24), which to help them do, they exhorted them to study God's magnifying works toward them (consider how great things he hath done for you [literally, see that which he is magnifying for you]). But if, despite God's continued goodness, mercy and longsuffering, the people would persist in willful wrong-doing (still do wickedly [literally, sinning you sin], 25), the Lord would see to it that they and their chosen leaders would come to ruin and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">extinction, and thus come to an end as God's people (consumed [literally, come to an end], both ye and your king). Thus in this entire chapter by word and act antitypical Samuel sought to bring the people to repentance for past wrongs, to the determination to serve God with their whole heart in the Truth, to the exercise of hope for good and fear of sin in its nature and consequence, and so to safeguard them as God's flock; and, so doing, they proved themselves the faithful friends, brethren and shepherds of God's people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(25) 1 Sam. 13 types the conflict between believing Christian teachers and what is called vulgar rationalism, as well as the aftermaths of that conflict. It was a struggle that occurred mainly in Germany in the last third of the 18th and the first third of the 19th centuries. Rationalism was sown in Germany (1) by the deists of England and (2) by the infidelistic naturalists of France, who themselves were an outgrowth of English deism, and who through the religious indifferentism of Frederick the Great found an entrance into Germany; for he welcomed at his court some of the great French infidelistic naturalists, e.g., Voltaire, d'Argens, la Mettie, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> Vulgar rationalism was in Germany fathered by John S. Semler, theological professor at the Halle University, a very gifted man who used his great talents in a way that, contrary to his purpose and expectation, undermined faith in the orthodox views of the Bible and current dogmas. Thus as to the Bible he sowed to the wind and reaped the whirlwind. When he came to see the evil effects of his teachings, he sought to stem them, but, failing therein, died of a broken heart. A close second to him in this mischievous work was Reimarus, professor at Hamburg, who forged the so-called Wolfenbuettler Fragments, as allegedly very ancient documents. These taught that Christianity was originated by frauds and deceptions. Lessing, one of the three greatest lights of German literature, took up a defense of these Wolfenbuettler Fragments in a controversy</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">with Goeze, chief pastor of Hamburg. Semler supported Goeze, but Lessing's literary standing and great ability gained much favor for the fraudulent Fragments among many, resulting in the discrediting, not only of the current orthodoxy, but also of the Bible and the idea of a Divine revelation, the virgin birth, atoning death and resurrection of Jesus, as well as everything supernatural, like miracles, prophecies, providence, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> From Sender's school went forth the heroes of vulgar rationalism, e.g., Teller, Leffler, Gabler, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> An infidelistic philosophy gave impetus to this theory; and ere long almost all theological professors, church counselors, pastors, teachers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> of Germany rejected the Bible as a Divine revelation and proclaimed only three doctrines as their theology: the existence of a God, the practice of righteousness and a belief in the soul's immortality (&quot;God, virtue, immortality,&quot; as they put it), with an acceptance of reason as the source and rule of faith and practice.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(26) As they used the word, reason, it could mean anything from the most depraved to the most exact intellects and the most true and the most erroneous understandings of the most ignorant to those of the most intelligent. According to their idea of reason, it was an exceedingly ambiguous term; for no matter how mistaken one's knowledge and understanding were, they were reason to vulgar rationalists. Accordingly, reason to them meant as many different things as there were individuals in the world. Hence it is the most unstable and variable source and rule of faith and practice imaginable, and therefore utterly unreliable as such a source and rule. We understand reason to mean the normal thinking faculties and their true contents. To normal true thinking faculties belong proper perceptive, reproductive, imaginating and analytical powers, as well as the powers of rational intuition, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> those faculties that take in thought, that remember thought, that invent thought, and that ratiocinate on thought, as well as the powers that take in and think</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">self-evident truths (rational intuitions), like 2+ 2 = 4; 3 X 1 = 3, things equal to the same thing are equal to each other, the shortest distance between a point on earth and a point in the sky is a straight line between them, a thing cannot be in two places at the same time, a father is older than his son, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc.</span><span class="font3"> The great mistake of vulgar rationalists was their failure to allow for the depravity, yea, varying depravity, of man's perceptive, reproductive, imagining, ratiocinating and rational intuitive faculties and for the resultant erroneous and imperfect contents of these faculties. This varied depravity in itself and in its erroneous contents disqualifies reason from being the source and rule of faith and practice. At best it can be a vessel into which can be poured the contents of the true source of faith and main rule of practice, and which can hold such contents and reject contradicting contents, as well as pour the former out to others. The only true source of faith and main rule of practice is the Divine revelation, the Bible; while the sole source of faith and main rule of practice is the Bible, the secondary rule of faith and practice is the Spirit of God in His people. The latter is not such a source, but is such a rule, because in the intellect it holds the Truth already gotten from the Bible, and requires that all subsequent things offered to it as Truth be in harmony with the already received Truth, and rejects everything contrary to it, and because in the heart is requires that all things offered to it as matters of conduct be in harmony with the graces of the Spirit already developed in God's people, and rejects every thing contrary to them. Thus the Spirit as a rule of faith and practice in the intellect is sanctified reason, and in the heart holy affections and a holy will responsive to righteousness and holiness and rejective of unrighteousness and unholiness; and because truth is harmony with reality, Biblical and related facts are included in the Spirit as intellect, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> sanctified reason accepts Biblical and related facts as belonging to it as a rule of faith and practice. Accordingly, there is but</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">one source of faith and one main source of practice, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Bible, and two rules of faith and practice.; the Bible, and the Spirit of God in His people, while vulgar rationalism takes man's depraved intellect and its erroneous and imperfect contents as the sole source and rule of faith and practice. We have made these preliminary remarks on reason, the Bible and the Spirit of God in God's people the better to pave the way to an understanding of 1 Sam. 13 and parts of 1 Sam. 14.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(27) The literal rendering of v. 1 alluded to in the margin means, according to the Hebrew idiom, that Saul was one year old at the commencement of his reign. The A. V. text is not a correct rendering of the Hebrew, whose text as it now stands has evidently suffered the loss of a numerical adjective, perhaps </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">forty;</span><span class="font3"> for in the second year of his reign (2) Saul had a son, Jonathan, old enough to be the second in command of his army; hence perhaps the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">forty </span><span class="font3">dropped out of the text. Saul's reign being one of trialsomeness, additional to his son Jonathan's age at Saul's second year of reigning, makes us think that his age likely was 40 (40 representing trialsomeness) when he began to reign. If it is the missing word, v. 1 should be rendered: Saul was forty years old at his [beginning to] reign. At any rate the Hebrew idiom of the pertinent words proves that some numeral adjective has fallen out of the text of v. 1, but none of the ancient Hebrew MSS. contains here a variant reading, which proves that the omission is a very ancient one. V. 1 and a part of v. 2 should be rendered as follows: Saul was [40] years old when he [began to] reign. And he had reigned two years over Israel [the words so far quoted are not found in some of the best recensions of the Septuagint, which likely means that they were not in the Septuagint translators' Hebrew text three centuries before Christ. If that is the case, of course, there is no difficulty, as to the point treated above], when Saul chose for himself 3,000 men from Israel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> So far our exegetical remarks on certain difficulties</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">in vs. 1, 2. Now for the explanation of the antitype: Maturity for trial marked each member of the crown-lost leaders when he became such </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(forty</span><span class="font3"> years, 1), and shortly after becoming such each of them surrounded himself with the ablest controversialists in antitypical Israel (chose 3,000 . . . Israel) The majority of these were especially attached to the crown-lost princes (2,000 with Saul) in the field of treasured knowledge (Michmash, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">treasure)</span><span class="font3"> and in the administrative part of the Church (Mount Bethel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of God),</span><span class="font3"> and a minority (1,000) of them were attached to the most faithful of the crown-losers (Jonathan) in the humbler positions of character development in the Church (Gibeah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">height,</span><span class="font3"> of Benjamin, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">son of the right hand).</span><span class="font3"> The rest of the matured antitypical Israelites worked at ordinary pursuits (the rest. . . tent) .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) This was the condition at the time that the most faithful crown-losers (Jonathan, 3) aghast at the teachings and doings of the vulgar rationalists, gave them a thorough refutation. . As indicated above, not only did the latter reject the errors of the orthodox, but with these their truths, particularly that the Bible was the Divine revelation, and, of course, that it was inerrant, they sought to bring everything of teaching and practice down to the low plane of the rabble. So greatly did their religious tastes degenerate that at Christmas the highest thoughts that the manger scene could arouse in them were the kinds of fodder to supply the beasts of the stall; and the best lessons that they could draw from the Easter scene were the benefit of early rising and (because they taught that Jesus did not die, but merely swooned) the symptoms of seeming death, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., swooning.</span><span class="font3"> Flatness and superficiality developed to the nth degree characterized their thoughts, lectures, sermons, teaching and conversations. The noble hymnology of the Reformation and its following century they watered to the grossest flabbiness and tastelessness. If able men had deliberately set out to make religion dull, flat and repulsive, they could not</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">more completely have succeeded in their purpose than the vulgar rationalists did to rob religion of its strength and clearness of thought, depth and fulness of feeling and vigor and activity of will, e.g., Abraham Teller, the president of the Berlin University, openly declared that &quot;the Jews because of their faith in God, virtue and immortality, should be recognized as genuine Christians&quot;; and K. F. Bahrdt, who was one of the leading vulgar rationalists, who was dismissed from the ministry and his professorship in the Halle University's theological faculty for loose living, and who finally died of a venereal disease, thought, while acting as a bartender in a saloon, that it was a good place from which to dispense his theological knowledge to the people. The notorious so-called &quot;German Library,&quot; published by the book-seller Nicolai, of Berlin, made itself the judge of literature and a veritable Inquisitorial tribunal, condemning every literary effort that attempted to set forth anything of deeper and sounder import than the mob- and rabble-appealing vulgar rationalists in their shallowness and unsoundness gave forth from the professor's and consistorial counselor’s chair, the pastor's pulpit and the teacher's desk. Yet these heroes of superficiality, shouting out their watchword, &quot;reason,&quot; as their forte, and &quot;unreason,&quot; as their pet aversion, were the leaders in university, consistory, church and school in those unhappy 60 to 70 years, denying everything supernatural, like the virgin birth, miracles, prophecy, atonement, Christ's resurrection, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc.</span><span class="font3"> They led the religious mob and rabble of those days with the most superficial platitudes as expressions of the acme of wisdom.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(29) But the Lord left not Himself without His 7000 witnesses in this evil time, when he was considered a full Christian who believed there is a god, that virtue is to be practiced and that the soul is immortal.

Schleiermacher, who was one of the greatest and most influential theologians of Germany during the 19th century, to great activity in preaching, lecturing and writing, among other things, against vulgar rationalists (Saul blew the trumpet. . . Let the Hebrews hear). In his first activities he was only a step ahead of them in belief but miles ahead of them in depth of thought, fulness of feeling and energy of will. As time went on he grew more and more in positive views of Christianity. Though he never succeeded in reaching correct views on the canon, integrity and authority of the Bible, yet by sheer force of intellect, warmth of feeling and energy of will he drew after him a number of the ablest intellects and most pious hearts of Germany. Though a deep thinker and writer, he was a very popular preacher who knew how to make himself understood and appreciated in his sermons by the common people. Additionally, he was a very able leader and executive, and was privileged to be the antitype of Saul at the juncture of affairs typed by Saul in 1 Sam. 13. He was the leading professor at the Berlin University, as well as the first preacher and theologian of Germany, and after a power fill ministry he died in 1834, leaving E. W. Hengstenberg, also of the Berlin University, as his successor in the Saul antitype as set forth in 1 Sam 14. But he and the faithful members of antitypical Jonathan were in a small minority; and the vulgar rationalists, who possessed almost all the theological chairs in the universities, the executive posts in the consistories (the church government</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">committees in the various states of Germany), the pulpits in the churches and the desks in the schools, took note of antitypical Jonathan's pertinent activities (the Philistines heard of it). Believers everywhere heard of their refuting the vulgar rationalists (all Israel heard say that Saul [through Jonathan] had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, 4). The proud vulgar rationalists from their heights of alleged reason looked down upon, and despised the true believers as alleged hypocrites, superstition's devotees and unreasonable fanatics (Israel. . . abomination with the Philistines). Heartened by the re futaffair of the vulgar rationalists by antitypical Jonathan, the true believers, practicing an energehc piety in consecration, were reached by Schleiermacher's appeals to follow after his standard against the antitypical Philistines (people were called together after Saul), but it led them into an everincreasing crisis (Gilgal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">circuit).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(30) This smiting of the vulgar rationalists had the effect of arousing those rationalists who were not of the vulgar kind, but who were of the higher critical sort, many of them being very scholarly men of large knowledge and acute intellects, to gather themselves together to right the Biblebelievers; for they instinctively felt that the principles of these Bible-believers were opposed to their principles, and that the time had come for a clash to set in between these two groups of opposing principles (the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, 5). They consisted of comparatively numerous organizations (30,000 chariots) and numerous teaching leaders (6,000 horsemen); and their supporters were innumerable (people as the sand. . . sea shore in multitude). They took up their position in the treasure store of vast knowledge (Michmash), but their position was an erroneous one (eastward from Beth-aven, , </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of idols</span><span class="font3"> [erroneous theories] ). The true .believers, seeing these enemies encamped against them, in their distress realized that they were in a difficult position (men of Israel ... in a</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">strait. . distressed, 6). Thereupon they sought to dodge the pertinent conflict, looking for protection: some in church secret societies, i.e., in local congregations (caves), some in general alliances of great ones, like the Evangelical Alliance (thickets), some in the strong fortresses of society, like the Evangelical Union (rocks), some in high places (societies, like the Gustav-Adolph Society), some in home missionary societies (pits) and some in foreign missionary societies (Hebrews went over Jordan [Christendom] to the land of Gad </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fortunate, company}</span><span class="font3"> and Gilead </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[heap,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rock witness},</span><span class="font3"> 7) .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) At this time Schleiermacher was in a crisis (Saul was yet in Gilgal); and his supporters clung to him with much fear and many forebodings (followed him trembling). After waiting for what seemed to him the full time (tarried seven days, 8) to receive from the Lord's special mouthpiece (Samuel), here the Philadelphia star-members in their writings, the message and service of the Truth that the latter had to give him, and after these did not come to him at the time expected in his crisis (Gilgal), and when his supporters in large numbers left him (the people were scattered from him), Schleiermacher, very unclear on many a truth held properly by believing nominal-church theologians, and failing to wait for clarification thereon, called for his supporters' co-operation (Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings, 9) in his presentation of his (unclear) views. Accordingly, he began to present his quite immature and erroneous views-a case of less palpable error fighting more palpable error (he offered the burnt offering). Just after each of Schleiermacher's presentations of his more or less erroneous views and service to the Lord, antitypical Samuel appeared in the Philadelphia starmembers' writings (as soon as he had made an end of offering . . . Samuel came, 10). Schleiermacher made many mental journeys to reach clearness on their views of things, just as his presenting</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">his partially erroneous views and services was a long-drawn-out affair involving as it did the presentation of various unclear views at different times, antitypical Samuel coming to him after each of such times (Saul went out to meet him) and at each of such times antitypical Samuel came to minister some good to him (salute [literally, bless] him [the grammatical structure of the Hebrew sentence shows that it was Samuel who came to bless Saul] ). At each of these times antitypical Samuel in his writings expostulated with him as to his immature teachings and services (Samuel said, What hast thou done? 11) . At each of such expostulations Schleiermacher made excuse that his supporters were mentally scattered from him (scattered from me), that he could not get the help from the Philadelphia star-members, T. Campbell and Wm. Miller being their only living representatives during his lifetime, the deal ones coming to him and expostulating with him in their writings, which, indeed, was the way that Campbell and Miller expostulated with him, and all of them offering such written helps each time only after he had done the pertinent presenting of a mixed message and service (thou earnest not). He further made excuse that they failed him in his need when he expected help from them (within the days appointed).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) Furthermore, he excused himself on the ground that the historico-higher-critical allies of the defeated vulgar rationalists were assembling themselves in the field of special treasures of knowledge, whereby they became especially threatening (Philistines gathered... at Michmash). Therefore, fearing an attack upon him, he concluded that the historico-higher critics would pounce upon him while he was in a crucial situation (said I, The Philistines . . . upon me to Gilgal, 12). For such a thing to happen to him before he had by teachings and services against the historico-higher critics sought to gain God's favor (not made supplication; literally, entreated the face) was to his mind an</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">unseemly thing; hence he claimed that he forced himself to present such teachings and services as he had contrary to the historico-higher critics (forced myself. . . offered a burnt offering), which was not a Divinely pleasing service. Servants of God should not enter into any teaching and ministry before the Lord has made the teaching clear to them, and has indicated what the service should be, otherwise they would be running ahead of the Lord. How much Schleiermacher, a large Gospel-Age crown-lost leader, was in this matter like a certain little Gospel-Age crown-lost leader, who said in his heart, My Lord delayeth, i.e., does not do things fast enough to suit me! Hence he took them out of His hands and hurried them along as seemed good to him. The Philadelphia star-members in their writings, as well as by their example of waiting quietly on the Lord, until His due time would come, rebuked his course as a foolish one (Samuel said to Saul, Thou has done foolishly, 13), telling him that thereby he had violated the command that God gave him, i.e., to wait upon the Lord, and to let Him direct his teachings and services (not kept the commandment of the Lord). Had he obeyed the Lord in this matter, the Lord would have given him the privilege of leading the Lord's people in the fight against the historico-higher critics to a completion (now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever). But the repeated failure of Schleiermacher unto a completion to wait on the Lord to reveal His message and service as due moved the Lord to reject his leadership over antitypical Israel's warriors (thy kingdom shall not continue, 14). The Philadelphia star-members assured him in their writings that the Lord had selected a crown-lost leader whom He could heartily approve for the pertinent work. So far as Schleiermacher the individual is concerned, God had selected a successor, Hengstenberg, under whose supervision as leader the Lord would entrust His warriors against the historico-higher critics, but in so far as all through the Age</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the crown-lost leaders did in principle the same thing as Schleiermacher did in this matter, not wait on the Lord, the successor of these crown-lost leaders as a class was to be Bro. Russell as that Servant (commanded him to be captain over his people), the reasons for the Lord's course being repeated for emphasis.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(33) After each of such failures of Schleiermacher to wait upon the Lord, the Philadelphia star-members withdrew from him in the sense that their pertinent teachings failed to influence him to betterment, until such leavings came to a completion, despite his thereby being left in a crucial condition (Samuel arose and gat him up from Gilgal, 15). And at each of such leavings they in their teachings went to the most faithful of the crown-lost servants of the Lord, antitypical Jonathan, who were in that height of the humbler character of the Church attainable by crown-losers (unto Gibeah of Benjamin). Schleiermacher after each of these experiences examined and analyzed his supporters and found them quite few and faultful humans and new creatures (Saul numbered the people . . . 600 men). After each expostulation from antitypical Samuel Schleiermacher took up a position in the height of the humbler character of the Church for crown-losers, attainable by amendment of his course, with the most faithful of the crown-losers and their supporters (Saul and Jonathan and the people abode in Gibeah of Benjamin, 16), while the historico-higher-critical (not vulgar) rationalists took up their position in the treasury of their scientific theological knowledge (Philistines encamped in Michmash). The father of the rationalistic historico-higher critics was De Witte, an encyclopedia scholar, a sharp thinker: a thorough linguist and a great writer. The historico-higher-critical rationalists engaged in three lines of destructive anti-Clmstian work (the spoilers ... in three companies, v. 17). The first of these was philosophy. At first by making the basis of their theology the pantheistic natural philosophy of Schelling, and a little later by</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">making the basis of their theology the pantheistic idealistic philosophy of Hegel, the historico-higher-critical rationalists worked destructively and anti-Christianly against the idea of the Bible as a Divine revelation and against its contents as inspired, unto subverting the faith of most theological professors and pastors (one company turned ... to Ophrah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[gazelle,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the doctrine of philosophy] . . . Shual </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fox,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the subtility of Schelling and Hegel and their colaborers] ). The second of these was that of philology, embracing especially the dead language, Hebrew and its cognate tongues and Greek, whereby they sought to undermine Biblical teachings. The leaders in this line of misuse of philology were Gesenius in Hebrew lexicography and Ewald in its grammar, and Wahl in the lexicography and Winer in the grammar of Biblical Greek. While the former two did some very useful lexical and grammatical work in the elucidations of the Hebrew of the Old Testament, and the latter two did the same for the Greek of the New Testament, their and their colaborers' efforts were in the interests and spirit of rationalistic historico-higher criticism; hence their work was in many ways anti-Biblical (another... to Beth [7zow^e]-horon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[grave-like,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the dead language], v. 18).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) The third of these was Biblico-historical criticism, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font3">higher criticism proper. Baur of Tuebingen, thoroughly imbued with Hegel's philosophy, and a talented scholar, was the main leader of this company or school of thought, and Strauss and Vatke were its chief lieutenants. The first claimed that there were two antagonistic schools of thought among the Apostles: Peter leading the particularistic— Jewish—point of view, and Paul leading the universalistic—Jewish-Gentile—point of view, and that in the battle the universalistic overthrew the particularistic point of view, and thus became the surviving view of the Christian Church. He denied the genuineness of all the New Testament, except Romans, 1, 2 Corinthians and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Galatians. The origin of all its other books he assigned either to the last quarter of the second or to the third century. Strauss's main destructive work was done by his Life of Jesus, the Gospel accounts of which he claimed to be myths, assigning the Gospels' writing to the third quarter of the second century. Vatke treated the Old Testament destructively and anti-behevmgly with the same spirit and methods as Baur and Strauss treated the New Testament. This third school was by far the worst of the three as to destructiveness and anti-Christianity (another turned to . . . border that looketh. . . Zeboim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[serpents,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hyenas,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to its Satanic destructiveness] toward the wilderness [in allusion to their disregard of organized churchianity] ). They all started their destructive attacks in 1835, the year that we have elsewhere shown that the darkening of the symbolic sun and moon began, as it was indeed their work that began this darkening. From Semler's opening the attacks that led up to vulgar rationalism in this four-volumed work on the Canon (1771-1776) to about 15 years before the attacks of Vatke, Baur and Strauss (1835), increasingly the literary molders of public religious opinion ceased in Germany to be Bible -belie vers among theological professors, consistorial counselors, pastors and teachers, until, with but the exception of antitypical Saul and Jonathan, there were none of such there (no smith found throughout. . . Israel, 19). For the authorities, to prevent such becoming Bible-believers, filled with rationalists of both classes the theological professorships, which resulted in prospective theological professors, consistorial counselors, pastors and teachers becoming either vulgar or historico-higher-critical rationalists, and which resulted in Bible-believers' being made unfit to prepare controversial discourses and lectures or to write controversial books (Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears). This had the effect that all Bible-believing exponents had to go to the rationalistic professors, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (all</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Israelites went down to the Philistines, 20), to fit for use (sharpen) their correctional (share), ethical (coulter), controversial (axe) and doctrinal (mattock) discourses and books. However, they had the writings (file, 21) of the starmembers and their assistants for their doctrinal (mattocks), ethical (coulter), correctional (forks), controversial (axes) and hortatory (goads) helps, to fit for use (sharpen) their discourses, lectures and books. Excepting in the case of antitypical Saul and Jonathan, this resulted by 1835 (day of battle, 22) in no Bible believer's being able to prepare up-to-date controversial discourses, lectures and books (there was neither sword nor spear found. . . but with Saul and Jonathan). When 1835 came the historico-higher-critical rationalists went forth to battle, as described above, on the difference between their fund of knowledge and that of Bible-believers (garrison. . . went out to the passage of Michmash, 23).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) Immediately following the appearance of Baur's and Strauss's books in 1835, antitypical Jonathan, catching their drift, began to consult with his chief scholarly supporters on answering them (upon a day Jonathan. . . said. . . bare his armour ... let us go .. . garrison . . . other side, 14: 1). The chief members of antitypical Jonathan at that time on the New Testament phase of the controversy were Neander, a converted Hebrew, the father of modern New Testament and church history, Ullmann and Tholuck; and the chief members of the antitypical armour bearer on New Testament apologetics were Nitzsch, Mueller, Domer, Rothe and Lange. The chief members of antitypical Jonathan taking part in defense of the Old Testament were Bleek, Umbreit and Keil; and the chief members of his armour bearer were Delitzsch and Lange, also mentioned above as working in defense of, the New Testament. But above all Hengstenberg, the antitypical Saul of this time, did the earlier best work on the Old Testament against the historico-higher-critical rationalists. Indeed, his disproofs of some of their Old Testament</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">positions are among the strongest ever written, and to this day have not been refuted. This is particularly true of his Genuineness of the Pentateuch and Daniel, His Christology of the Old Testament and his Egypt and the Books of Moses, which are classics on these subjects. But, owing to his too controversial attitude, the then members of antitypical Jonathan held aloof from him, and let him know nothing of their plans; for they were head and heart theologians compared with him, who seemed to be mainly a head theologian (he told not his father). Hengstenberg took an ever-increasingly radical conservative position which made him in character far inferior to men like Neander, Tholuck, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (Saul tarried [literally, dwelt] in the uttermost part of Gibeah, 2), fighting every manifestation of rationalism in his magazine, The Evangelical Church Newspaper (under a pomegranate tree), which more or less continuously fought every kind of religious error advanced by the higher critics (in Migron, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">overthrow).</span><span class="font3"> But his supporters were a very small, imperfect and faultful set of humans and crown-losers (about 600 men). The Priesthood (wearing an ephod, 3) at that time stressed the God-man theory of Christ (Ahiah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah's brother)</span><span class="font3"> as a good brother of the race (the son of Ahitub, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my brother is good) </span><span class="font3">and as a supporter of freedom (Ichabod, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">where is the glory </span><span class="font3">?) in Protestantism (Phinehas), where for centuries the crown-lost princes were to be found (Eli, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">high one).</span><span class="font3"> But none of these knew the mental journeys of antitypical Jonathan as against the historico-higher critics.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(36) Antitypical Jonathan occupied a strong believing position (sharp rock . . . Bozez, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shiny,</span><span class="font3"> 4) on the matters at issue between the believing theologians and the historico-higher critics, and the latter a strong unbelieving position thereon (a sharp rock . . . Seneh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">peak,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">point)', and </span><span class="font3">between the two positions there was a very deep and steep passage way of thought down one and up the other, so that it was easy to miss one's mental footstep passing from one to the other</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(between the passage); and for coming to an understanding of both positions there was a necessity of sharp thought (sharp rock); and many a traveler from one to the other lost his mental footing. Down and up these mental paths the members of antitypical Jonathan and their special supporters had laboriously to travel. Antitypical Jonathan's position opposed that of the rationalistic historico-higher critics (the forefront [edge] . . . northward over against Michmash, 5); and the position of the rationalistic historico-higher critics opposed that of antitypical Jonathan (the other southward over against Gibeah). The proposal of antitypical Jonathan was that they and their special supporters (Jonathan said... let us, 6) study with the purpose of opposing the views of the rationalistic historico-higher critics (go over unto . . these uncircumcised), but do it in the faith that the Lord cannot be limited in His help, regardless of whether His servants are many or few (Lord will work for us ... no restraint... by many or by few). To this plan their special supporters with encouraging words agreed .(do all. . . heart... I am with thee, 7). Antitypical Jonathan then said that they would do the necessary involved study (we will pass over, 8) and show themselves as opposed to them (discover ourselves unto them). Furthermore, they said that if their opponents would by their course suggest that they were going to attack them, they would wait for them to attack and would defend the position of the believers (T arry until we come to you; then we will stand. . . not go up unto them, 9); but that if by their course their opponents would indicate that they would act defensively, if attacked, the believers would take the aggressive against their errors (Come up unto us; then we will go up, 10), believing that the Lord had decided victory for them (the Lord hath delivered them into our hand). To antitypical Jonathan's suggestion both agreed (this . . . sign to us). Accordingly, these servants of God by word of mouth and in their writings</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">made it known that they were opposed to the theories of the rationalistic historico-higher critics (both of them discovered themselves unto ... the Philistines, 11), who in their pride ridiculed these servants of God as cowards venturing out of their shelters (come out of their holes where they had hid themselves). After ridiculing these servants of God, they challenged them to attack their positions (Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing, 12).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) Antitypical Jonathan took his cue from their proud challenge that they and their chief supporters were to take the aggressive, and, therefore, encouraged the latter to follow them into the fray (Come up after me), assured that the Lord had delivered the rationalistic historico-higher critics into the power of God's people (the Lord hath delivered them into the hands of Israel). Thereupon antitypical Jonathan as leader and their special supporters as followers did the necessary very difficult mental work to put them into the position to attack (climbed, up upon his hands and feet. . . armour bearer after him, 13) and by their lectures and publications attacked Strauss's and Baur's, positions, thoroughly refuting them (they fell before Jonathan; and his armour bearer slew after him). Neander was the first member of antitypical Jonathan to attack Baur's and Strauss's challenges and books of 1835. Against Strauss's Life of Jesus Neander in 1837 published his Life of Christ, which is the ablest and most complete refutation of Strauss's mythical theory as applied to the Gospel narratives ever made. In 1832, before this controversy broke out, he had published, as an introduction of his great Church History, a history of the Apostolic Age, entitled, The Planting and Training of the Christian Church. After Baur's attacks on the Acts and Epistles appeared, Neander revised this book, making it, among other things, a thorough refutation of Baur's entire theory of the Apostolic Age. Undoubtedly Neander was under God the chief agent in restoring a living faith in the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Bible to Christian theologians the world over as against the unbelief of the rationalistic historico-higher critics, for these books were translated into many language and therein widely circulated. In 1838 Ullmann, another very able member of antitypical Jonathan, published an able refutation of Strauss's Life of Jesus, entitled, Historical or Mythical; and against the rejection of Jesus' virgin birth and sinlessness he published his very fine Sinlessness of Jesus (1842). His Essence of Christianity likewise was a hard blow against the rationalistic historico-higher critics. Other members of antitypical Jonathan, mentioned above, also joined in the battle successfully. Not only so, but the members of their chief supporters joined in it very fruitfully, especially Mueller, in his book, The Doctrine of Sin, and Lange, in his able and detailed Life of Christ. Thus in defense of the New Testament the above-named brethren and others waged a very successful fight. Umbreit, Bleek, and especially Keil, supported by Delitsch and Lange, as their special helpers, waged a noble fight in refuting some attacks of the rationalistic historico-higher critics on the Old Testament, as that higher criticism was known in the documentary theory and in the late origin of the Old Testament before its later manifestations, by which through Wellhausen, Graf and Kuenen it left the partly refuted positions of the rationalistic -historico-higher critics and took on the form of evolutionary higher criticism, with which believing scholars battled during the Harvest. But, as shown above, Hengstenberg gave the rationalistic historico-higher critics on the Old Testament the strongest of their partial refutations. Nevertheless antitypical Jonathan and their special supporters started the defeat of the rationalistic historico-higher critics (first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armour bearer made, 14), who were in many cases very exceptionally able apostate new creatures of highest human culture (about twenty men); especially did they refute them in the domain of the New Testament (an half acre of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">land [half of God's revelation]) as written by God's inspired Apostles (a yoke of oxen, 1 Cor. 9:9; 1 Tim. 5: 18).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) These staunch defenders of the veracity of the Bible, especially of the New Testament, started a revolution in Christian society against the rationalistic historico-higher critics, who were up to that time almost omnipotent in influence in German Christian society (the earth quaked, 15). Their refutations were so powerful and the revulsion of German Christian society at, and its revolution against the rationalistic historico-higher critics were so great, that a paralyzing fear overtook the latter's whole host (host) in their world of activity (field) and among their supporters, their camp followers (all the people). The leaders among the rationalistic historico-higher critics (garrison), yea, all three groups of destructive companies, i.e., philosophers, linguists and historico-Biblical critics, trembled (the spoilers, they also trembled); there was indeed a paralyzing fear that overtook these (a very great trembling). Hengstenberg's guards (watchmen of Saul, 16), ever on the alert to note the goings on among the rationalistic historico-higher critics, from their vantage ground of the believing positions in the humble height of Christian character (in Gibeah of Benjamin), gave close heed (looked) to the commotion among the rationalistic historico-higher critics, and saw that the latter were diminishing in numbers (multitude melted away) and were fighting one another in their confusion (went on beating down one another). Hengstenberg asked that his supporters be investigated (said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number, 17), that they might learn who had left them to fight with the rationalistic historico-higher critics (see who is gone from us). Then, from the investigation, it was learned that antitypical Jonathan and their chief supporters were not among them; for these had withdrawn from co-operation with Hengstenberg because of the violence of his controversial spirit and expressions</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(Jonathan and his armour bearer were not there). Thereupon Hengstenberg asked that the consecrated brethren bring to him all the truths of God's plan then due, that from them they might select ones fitted for use in that condition, according as God through the consecrated should indicate His will (Saul said unto Ahia, bring hither the ark of God, 18); for at that time the believing theologians brought together and held all of the truths previously and then due (the ark of God . . . with the children of Israel).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) While Hengstenberg was consulting with the consecrated brethren over what the Truth required them to do at this juncture of affairs (while Saul talked unto the priest, 19), the debate, the confusion and the flight of the rationalistic historico-higher critics became very tumultuous (noise ... of the Philistines . . . increased). Then Hengstenberg charged the consecrated brethren to cease their efforts to get a response from the Truth, as it now was by the providential situation shown what course to take (withdraw thine hand). Thereupon Hengstenberg with all his warriors by Divine providence was called out to battle (Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves; literally, Saul was called and all the people that were with him, 20). Accordingly, they joined the controversy (they came to the battle). Here they noted that the rationalistic historico-higher critics, in their, efforts to answer the arguments that antitypical Jonathan and his chief supporters used against them, fell to contradicting and fighting one another (every man's sword was against his fellow), resulting in their utter defeat on the involved New Testament matters (a very great discomfiture). Some of the Lord's real people under deception had joined in with the rationalistic historico-higher critics as fellow warriors (Hebrews that were with the Philistines before . . . went up with them into the camp, 21). These received the opening of their eyes through the arguments of antitypical Jonathan and their chief supporters and joined</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">their real brethren who were with antitypical Saul and Jonathan (turned to be with. . . Saul and Jonathan). And those real believers who, dodging the issues, hid themselves in various protective organizations of Christendom (men. . . hid themselves in mount Ephraim, 22), seeing that the rationalistic historico-higher critics were being refuted and put to flight (heard that the Philistines fled), joined in the controversy, to the further undoing of the foe (followed hard after them in the battle). Thus at that time, from 1837 to from about 1860 to 1865, God delivered His people from the rationalistic historico-higher critics (The Lord saved Israel that day, 23); and the controversy entered the phase of the creed idols (the battle passed over unto Beth-aven).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(40) Hengstenberg was so conservative a man, made all the more so by his very many controversies with unbelievers, that anything claimed to be a new truth, advancing light, was looked upon by him with gravest suspicion; and he put his followers under a strict charge to eschew anything not taught previously (Saul had adjured . . . saying, Cursed be the man that eateth. . . until evening, 24). This resulted in the people famishing for positive Truth (men of Israel were distressed that day), since in the controversy they were refuting error, and not getting advancing Truth. Hengstenberg gave this solemn charge, because he desired to vindicate himself against his foes, and because he feared that the new views accepted would compromise the victory that he desired to win for God's cause and for himself (that I may be avenged on mine enemies). Accordingly, his supporters kept the charge, and eschewed accepting any new views during that controversy (none of the people tasted any food). Just at that period the Lord's people came to certain great ones of the Lord, like Bros. Miller, Storrs, Stetson, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> who taught the sweet hopes of the message of Christ's Millennial reign of blessing in the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit (all. . . came to a [literally, the] wood [trees represent great ones either among the Lord's people or among the world] . . . honey upon the ground, 25). Hengstenberg's supporters coming in contact with these sweet hopes of the message in their writings (when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped, 26), heeding their leader's charge, would not accept the sweet hopes of the Millennial message (no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath). But, as shown above, antitypical Jonathan, offended at the too severe polemics of Hengstenberg, left the sphere of his activities. Hence they did not know of his solemn charge to the people (Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath, 27). They, in various of their members, accepted with their official sanction some of the sweet hopes of the Biblical teachings on the Millennium (put forth the end of the rod . . . and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth). This gave them great enlightenment, not only on this, but on many other doctrines, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (his eyes were enlightened).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(41) Certain of Hengstenberg's heresy-hunting followers (one of the people, v. 28) disapproved of their accepting and giving their official sanction to the doctrine of the Millennium, stating that Hengstenberg had solemnly forbidden such a course (Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day), even though the people should be hungry for advancing Truth (the people were faint). Antitypical Jonathan replied that Hengstenberg by such a prohibition had wrought evil results for the Lord's people, giving them both head and heart difficulties (hath troubled the land [container for thing contained], 29). They politely called (I pray you) the attention of the people to how the Millennial doctrine clarified the mental vision of them as parts of God's people on Biblical subjects otherwise unclear (see. . . how mine eyes have been enlightened), emphasizing the fact that this was because they had accepted</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the Biblical doctrine of the Millennium (because I tasted a little of this honey). These brethren were certainly right, for that doctrine is sweetness itself to God's true people; for its blessed prospects give them hope and joy amid their conflicts, trials and suffering; for this doctrine was some of the spoil taken out from under the rubbish with which the rationalistic historico-higher critics had covered it. Accordingly, antitypical Jonathan stated that if all the opponents of rationalistic historico-higher critics had accepted this doctrine as part of the spoil that they had taken from the latter, they would have had much more enlightenment on God's ways (How much more . . . had eaten . . . spoil. . . they found, 30), and would consequently have refuted their foes with greater thoroughness (much greater slaughter). As it was, instead of making the slaughter complete on both New and Old Testament matters, it was complete only on the treasures of knowledge on the historico-higher criticism of New Testament matters (they smote . . that day from Michmash, 31). While there were defenses of the Old Testament against higher criticism made by antitypical Saul and Jonathan, these were incomplete (to Ajalon, place of gazelles [Josh. 10: 12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;moon</span><span class="font3"> in the valley of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aijalon. ” i.e.. Old Testament</span><span class="font3"> in the sphere of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Historico—Higher criticism's doctrines]).</span><span class="font3"> The comparative weakness of antitypical Saul and his supporters against the Old Testament historico-higher criticism was due to their lack of the riches of knowledge in the Old Testament on prophecies and types as to the Millennium (people were very faint).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) As all erroneous systems have some Truth mixed with their error, so rationalistic historico-higher criticism had some Truth mixed in with its error; in fact, in some cases the error was quite well hidden and the amount of connected Truth was so large that the error was not apparent without considerable thought and knowledge; for Satan knows that without some Truth he cannot deceive many. This pertinent</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Truth is in v. 32 represented by the flesh, and the hidden error by the blood left in the flesh. Hengstenberg's followers (the people, 32) with zeal mentally accepted the truths that they took away from the rationalists (flew upon the spoil). Some of these truths pertained to the justified (sheep), some to the humanity of Jesus (oxen) and some to the humanity of the consecrated (calves); and without proper examination of them and without the full elimination of the hidden error from them, which would be complete figurative bleeding of the figurative flesh (slew them on the ground [did not hang them up so that all the blood would flow out of them] ), and with the pertinent truths, they imbibed the connected and hidden error (the people did eat them with the blood). Many brought the knowledge of the fact to Hengstenberg (told Saul. . . sin . . . eat with blood, 33), who in his characteristic hatred of, and opposition to error, even in its most attenuated form, denounced the wrong-doers as traitors and their wrong as treason (Ye have transgressed; literally, Ye have dealt treacherously). Thereupon he charged that the doctrine that the Bible is God's inspired and inerrant revelation be analyzed, proved and upheld as a tester for him of all religious thought for that period of time (roll a great stone unto me this day). Furthermore, he charged his main supporters to mingle everywhere among his ordinary supporters (Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, 34) and teach them to submit, in a work done as in his presence, to his test doctrine all teachings that they had taken as booty from the rationalistic historic o-higher critics (Bring me hither every man his ox. . . sheep) and study them in submission to his test doctrine (slay them here [on the rock]), and if they by that test doctrine have all the error emptied from them, then they should accept them (eat); but he cautioned them not to sin against the Lord by partaking of the bootied truths containing error, be it ever so little (sin not. . . eating with the blood). All his supporters with their full power did as</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">he charged (every man his ox with him; literally, by his hand), and did this before the Parousia day dawned (that night), and thus properly studied them, purging out of them whatever was erroneous (slew them there).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(43) Hengstenberg developed his followers as a compact consecrated body for sacrificial purposes on behalf of the Lord (Saul built an altar unto the Lord, 35) . While previous crown-lost princes built sects in which consecrated, justified and unjustified ones were members, and thus were not the real Church, Hengstenberg would have none in this special company who not only professed, but practiced consecration, which was possible, because the so-called Pietists at that time, who to a man were consecrated, stood with him and recognized him as their leader (the same was the first altar that he built unto the Lord): Hengstenberg desired and, therefore, exhorted his supporters to join him in pursuing and devastating the rationalistic historico-higher critics on their Old Testament theories, and that immediately (Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, 36) and thus make a complete job of the conquest (spoil them until the morning light. . . not leave a man of them). To this plan all acceded (Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee). But the consecrated brethren asked that they should first approach God and learn His will on the subject (draw near . . . unto God), and that in connection with the doctrine of the Bible as God's inspired and inerrant revelation (hither). Thereupon Hengstenberg sought to find out the Lord's will from His Spirit, Word and providence (asked counsel of God, 37) on whether the battle against the rationalistic historico-higher critics on their Old Testament theories (Shall I go down after the Philistines?) should be pushed unto the limits of a complete victory thereon (wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?). By not giving them the necessary refutative arguments thereto, and by not giving favoring providences, God withheld a reply at that period, from about 1850 to about 1865 (answered him not that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">day). This lack of God's manifesting His will on the subjects under consideration convinced Hengstenberg that there was something wrong done by some of the leaders among his supporters. Hence he asked that .these should undergo a Divinely indicated examination on the subject of the alleged sin that hindered the completion of the victory (Saul said, Draw ye near, all ye chief. . . know and see wherein this sin hath been this day, 38). He solemnly affirmed that if the fault was even in antitypical Jonathan, his chief new-creaturely supporters, they would have to be disfellowshipped (though it be in Jonathan. . . surely die, 39).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(44) This struck all his supporters as too harsh; for it was generally known that antitypical Jonathan accepted the Millennium, which Hengstenberg, as an adherent of the (Luthern) Augsburg Confession, rejected. Hence none of his supporters gave him any encouragement on his rash determination (not a man among all the people that answered him). It struck him that the blame should lie either in the main leaders or in the rest of the warriors (all Israel. . . one side, and I and Jonathan. . . other side, v. 40). To this his supporters assented (people said. . . what seemeth good unto thee). Then Hengstenberg prayed that the Lord might properly direct the discussion and vote to the discovery of those allegedly at fault (Lord. . . Give a perfect lot, 41). Thereupon the discussion and vote eliminated all except him and antitypical Jonathan (Saul and Jonathan were taken; but the people escaped; literally, went out). Thereupon Hengstenberg declared that the discussion and voting should be as between him and antitypical Jonathan (Cast lots between me and Jonathan, 42). The discussion and voting revealed the fact that antitypical Jonathan had by his acceptance and commendation of the Millennial doctrine introduced a condition among Hengstenberg's supporters that in their opinion diverted attention from the fight against the rationalistic historico-higher critics, and brought a new controversy among the former,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">which influenced the Lord to decide against the prosecution of the anti-infidelistic battle in the interests of a subject more edifying for this people (Jonathan was taken). Thereupon Hengstenberg demanded an explanation of antitypical Jonathan's pertinent course (Tell me what thou hast done, 43) . These then very frankly confessed their faith in the Millennial doctrine (I did but taste a little honey) and their sanctioning it with the office that was in their power (with the end of the rod that was in mine hand). They also recognized that the unbending conservatism of Hengstenberg would cut them off from the fellowship of their fellow sympathizing antitypical Israelites (lo, I must die).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(45) Thereupon the unbendingly conservative Hengstenberg by word and act most solemnly pronounced the sentence of disfellowshipment upon these, under pain that he would receive it or worse yet, if he refrained from acting it out on these (God do so [to me] and more also [if I do not see to it that] thou shalt surely die, 44). But Hengstenberg had miscalculated the attitude of his supporters as to antitypical Jonathan, for they loved the latter more than him, because they had nobler and more lovable heart qualities than he. Reminding him of their more effective part in the conflict with the rationalistic historico-higher critics than his (who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel, 45), they in no uncertain, and with unanimous voice questioned his decision (Shall Jonathan die?). Then most solemnly they declared against his decision (God forbid; as the Lord liveth) and most determinedly insisted, not only that these be not disfellowshipped, but that no other evil, not even the least one, come to them for their course (there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground); for they argued that these had cooperated with God throughout the period of the involved controversy (for he hath wrought with God this day). Hengstenberg, as strong-willed as he was, had to bend to the storm of indignant protests that his severity had aroused in all his supporters, with the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">result that his own supporters rescued these from the disfellowshipment that he had determined against them (so the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not). The dissension in the ranks of his supporters on the Millennial question and their unanimously standing by antitypical Jonathan as against him made him give up that phase of the controversy that was implied in attacking in detail the positions of the rationalistic historico-higher critics on Old Testament matters (Saul went up from following the Philistines, 46); and these critics went on with their theories (the Philistines went to their own place), which were developed by the Wellhausen-Graf-Kuenen schools into the theories of the evolutionary higher critics of the Harvest time. These latter views have been refuted by the antitypical Levites, who rallied to antitypical Moses' call (Ex. 32: 26-28). Among these antitypical Levites the outstanding ones were Koenig, Moeller and Ruprecht, of Germany; Robertson, On, Sayce, Rawlinson, Finn and Urquhart, of Britain, and Bartlett, Bissell and, with Koenig, the ablest of all opponents of evolutionary higher criticism, Green, of America.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(46) Thus by defending the twelve stewardship and other doctrines throughout the period of denominational mouthpieceship against their attackers, the crown-lost leaders took the leadership of antitypical Israel (So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, 47); and they had no easy time; for they had to meet opponents on every phase of truth due in their times (fought against all his enemies on every side), particularly against the autocrats, like the hierarchies in the Church (Moab), the clericalists (children of Ammon), the secular rulers who sought to control the Church (Edom), the radical religious leaders (kings of Zobah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">encampment)</span><span class="font3"> and the sectarians (Philistines). Their great abilities enabled them to be very troublesome to whatever opponent they met, it making no difference who those opponents were (whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them). Yea, they wrought</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">mightily, as can be seen by the properly informed at the mere mend on of names like Origen, Augustine, Gerhard, Calvin, Menno, (Faustus) Socinus, Jewel, Barro we, Barclay, Watson, Campbell and Hines, besides many other very able members of antitypical Saul in each of the twelve denominations, of whose crown-lost leaders only one for each is mentioned in this sentence. These able new creatures were certainly calculated to &quot;vex&quot; opponents in error. Not only so, but they saw to the gathering and training of able controversialists as their assistants (he gathered an host, 48), as they also waged for a time a successful war against sin in themselves and others (smote the Amalekites) and by their controversies delivered antitypical Israel from all who corrupted for them their Truth teachings (delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(47) They had, especially, three groups of helpers (the sons of Saul, 49) : (1) the ablest and most faithful of the crownlosers (Jonathan), (2) the less able consecrated crown-losers and the faith-justified ones, who in both classes were linguistic, interpretational, historical and systematic scholars (Ishui, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">level, just),</span><span class="font3"> and (3) the least able consecrated ones and the faith-justified ones, who acted as evangelists, missionaries and pastors (Melchi-shua, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my king is saved,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to antitypical Saul's being delivered as their leader from their attackers' arguments). They had especially two powers (two daughters) : (1) that of writing, preaching and lecturing before immense public audiences (the name of the firstborn Merab, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">increase, abundance)</span><span class="font3"> and (2) that of addressing church gatherings (the name of the younger Michal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">brook).</span><span class="font3"> Their office was that of being winsome chief leaders of God's nominal people (the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my brother is pleasant,</span><span class="font3"> 50); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font3"> those whom they made leaders of their warriors were the theological professors (name of the captain of his host was Abner, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">father of light),</span><span class="font3"> who were very closely associated with</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the crown-lost leaders (Saul's uncle); and they were indeed depositaries of knowledge (son of Ner, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">light). </span><span class="font3">Controversialists by their controversial knowledge (Kish, bow, 51) were their developers (father of Saul); and the light, knowledge (Ner) that developed the theological professors, and that developed antitypical Saul was powerful (Abiel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mighty father</span><span class="font3"> [who was the father of Kish also], 9:1). But throughout the period of denominational mouthpieceship for God (all the days of Saul, 52) the crown-lost princes in each denomination had severe controversies with the sectarians in the other denominations (sore war against the Philistines). And they were on the lookout for able scholars and controversialists, and on finding them enlisted them among their warriors (when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(48) From chapters 9 to 14 antitypical Samuel'ss and Saul's conflicts with error receive almost exclusive typical descriptions, but in chapter 15 their conflicts with antitypical Samuel appears as more than a conqueror, while antitypical Saul falls short thereof. And chapter 15 closes with the statement that typifies antitypical Samuel'ss sorrowfully keeping himself aloof from antitypical Saul. The types of chapters 9-12 have had twelve progressive fulfillments, one in each of the twelve denominations. The types of chapters 13 and 14 have had but a single fulfillment, members of various denominations having part therein. But like the types of chapters 9 to 12, the types of chapter 15 have had a twelve-fold fulfillment, one progressively in connection with each denomination. So much prefaced, we will with the Lord's help proceed to the explanation of chapter 15's antitype, and with it will end the discussion of Samuel and Saul.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(49) Antitypical Samuel in each denomination first, in order of time, aroused antitypical Saul to wage controversies against errorists who were injuring God's true people. Later, in point of time, they exhorted sin in and about them are typically set forth. Here these to amendment of life and development of an overcoming character, and with such exhortations they (Samuel, 1) reminded these (said unto Saul) that they were by God commissioned to qualify them for leadership in antitypical Israel (The Lord sent me to anoint thee king . . . over Israel), and made this fact the reason of their exhorting these to obedience to them as the mouthpiece of the Lord's Word (therefore hearken thou unto the voice [mouthpiece] of the words of the Lord), the sequel proving that in this exhortation amendment of life and development of an overcoming character were the things charged. Then antitypical Samuel points out the reason why this exhortation coming from God should be fulfilled. The treacherous efforts of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sin</span><span class="font3"> to impede and prevent God's people from developing character unto fitness to reach heavenly Canaan in their journey thereto from the present evil world (saith the Lord, I remember that which Amalek, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">laborious,</span><span class="font3"> did to Israel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prince or warrior of God,. . .</span><span class="font3"> when he came up from Egypt, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortress, 2).</span><span class="font3"> Therefore the Lord charged antitypical Saul utterly to destroy sin in themselves and to help other antitypical Israelites to do the same in themselves (smite Amalek, 3), and not only so, but utterly to destroy every form that sin has (utterly destroy all that they have), not sparing it or any of its forms and expressions (spare them not), killing all of them (slay), regardless of whether they were strong (man) or weak (woman) or partly developed (infant) or just begun to be developed (suckling) or were in the humanity of the consecrated (ox) or justified (sheep) or in an organization (camel) or in a teaching (ass). To carry out this charge antitypical Saul assembled antitypical Israel (gathered the people, 4) and described them in their sin-oppressed condition (numbered them in Telaim, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">oppression),</span><span class="font3"> detailing the nature of sin, their fallen dispositions and their sinful expressions, showing that the majority of them were very depraved (200,000 footmen) and that a minority of them were</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">less depraved (10,000 men of Judah, praised). The first effort was made against sin as an organized empire, i.e., the natural depravity of their dispositions (Saul came to a [the] city of Amalek, 5) and they fought in the advantageous position of the Truth and its Spirit (laid wait [literally, strove] in the valley).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(50) Since this antitype concerns the overthrow of sin, certain human talents inherited and acquired (Kenites, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">acquisitions,</span><span class="font3"> 6) and usable in the Lord's service were not included in the order of extirpation. Hence antitypical Saul by his course separated these (Go, depart, get you down), which often are used as servants of sin (among the Amalekites), from such sinful uses, that they might not be destroyed as inseparable from sin, when it would be destroyed (lest I destroy you with them), the reason being that these natural and acquired talents have been helpful for the Lord's people in carrying out their consecration (showed kindness to . . . Israel, when they came up) during their journey from this present evil world (out of Egypt). Accordingly, antitypical Saul and Israel severed their natural and acquired talents from sinful uses (Kenites departed from among the Amalekites). Antitypical Saul and earnest antitypical Israelites bravely attacked all of their actual and verbal sins and all of the willfulness that formerly lodged in them (Saul smote the Amalekites, 7). This they did in the sphere of their isolated condition away from the world (Havilah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sandy</span><span class="font3"> [Israel's 40 years' journeys were in the sandy wilderness] ) to the fortifications of sin (Shur, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortress')</span><span class="font3"> guarding the present evil world (over against Egypt). They even did more: they made a captive of sinfulness itself (Agag, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">giant,</span><span class="font3"> 8), which as the depraved condition of a fallen disposition is the king sin (king of the Amalekites), and overthrew its expressions in word and deed (utterly destroyed all the people) with the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God (with the edge of the sword). But they made the great mistake of cutting off the branches of the tree of sin and leaving</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">its trunk unfelled and its roots unuprooted (Saul and the people spared Agag, 9); not only so, but they spared, some the besetting sins of their justified humanity (best of the sheep), some the besetting sins of their consecrated humanity (best... of the oxen), some even other than besetting sins (and of the fallings; literally, even seconds), some their recently developing sins (lambs), and in general what of sin that was dear to their depraved dispositions (and all that was good), refusing to make a full end of these (would not utterly destroy); but all of sin that was distasteful and unappealing, hence rejectable, they destroyed (but every thing [literally, every work] . . . vile and refuse . . . destroyed utterly).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(51) The Lord's Word condemning such a course, opening up to anti typical Samuel (then came the word of the Lord unto Samuel, 10), impressed them with the thought that God had decided to change His procedure in having antitypical Saul continue to be God's leader for Israel (repented me that I have set up Saul to be king, 11), God giving as His reasons therefore that antitypical Saul had turned away from the Lord (he is turned back from following me), and that they had failed to fulfill the charge of God as to fully overcoming sin (not performed my commandments). Naturally antitypical Samuel was greatly saddened by the two things: antitypical Saul's disobedience and the Lord's purpose to uncrown him (it grieved Samuel). These two things moved him with much supplication to entreat the Lord not to uncrown them, but to give them another chance to reform (cried unto the Lord all night). Assured that God would not change His decision, antitypical Samuel quickly (rose early, 12) betook themselves on a mental journey to meet antitypical Saul as soon as possible (to meet Saul in the morning). Antitypical Saul was on all hands being praised to antitypical Samuel as being very fruitful in their undertakings (told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fruitful garden),</span><span class="font3"> as having made a great reputation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">for themselves as a reminder of their fame (set him up a place; literally, a monument), as exhibiting, i.e., showing off, themselves in many places (gone about, and passed on) and as descending into a crucial condition (gone down to Gilgal). Thus they who had begun so humbly were now developing pride, unholy ambition, arrogance and hunger for honor and applause, thus proving that few of God's people can stand greatness and popularity. If we look at men like Origen, Athanasius, Cyprian, Gregory the Great, Illiricus, Whitgift, Calvin, (Faustus) Socinus, Calov, Coke, Campbell and Rutherford, we see this principle illustrated in antitypical Saul. How necessary in the prominent servants of God that they be filled both with deep humility and loving zeal; otherwise they will come to their Gilgals and therein come to a fall!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(52) Of course, in antitypical Samuel'ss coming into contact with antitypical Saul (Samuel came to Saul, 13), the latter were sure to speak graciously to the Lord's faithful (Blessed be thou of the Lord), and yet to boast in hypocrisy (I have performed the commandment of the Lord). But antitypical Samuel'ss sharp eyes and keen ears were quick to perceive and understand the evidences of unovercome sins in the justified (Samuel said, What meaneth then this blearing of the sheep in mine ears, 14) and in the humanity of the consecrated (the lowing of the oxen which I hear?). Then to save their face and to make an appearance of piety (for hypocrisy does love to palm off its evil doings as a service of God), they asserted that the qualities e.g., compromises with the world and its ways to win more followers, exercising worldly and selfish qualities against consecration to influence otherwise unwinable persons to accept a compromise of Christianity as the genuine article, were proper things to offer to God in sacrifice, though connected with some sin (Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites ... to sacrifice unto the Lord, 15). They claimed that these were the best of fallen humanity's qualities (best of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">sheep and of the oxen) and were really useful to exercise with certain kinds of people, to win them for the Lord. And the dispositions not useful in this way they claimed were all overcome (the rest we have utterly destroyed). This untruthful and deceitful answer prompted antitypical Samuel to ask antitypical Saul to give attention to the pertinent message that the Lord had just recently given them (Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord hath said to me this night, 16). Antitypical Saul asked them to tell it (Say on) . Antitypical Samuel then asked antitypical Saul whether it was not true that in the days when they were full of deep humility they were made the leaders of the denominations of Christendom (When. . . little in thine own sight. . . made the head of the tribes of Israel, 17) and whether it was not then that the Lord qualified them to be such leaders (the Lord anointed thee king over Israel?). Furthermore, they reminded them that God had commissioned them utterly to overcome sin in itself and in all its forms (the Lord sent. . . and. said . . . utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, v. 18) and to continue perseveringly in this spiritual warfare, until they would fully conquer them (fight against them until they be consumed). Then antitypical Samuel asked antitypical Saul why they had not obeyed the Lord's charge (Wherefore . . . not obey the voice of the Lord, v. 19), but instead yielded to sin's sway for advantage (fly upon the spoil), and had done evil in God's sight (didst evil in the sight of the Lord?).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(53) Self-righteousness and self-justification characterized antitypical Saul to so great a degree that he presumed in his pride positively to contradict the rebuking star-members </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Yea,</span><span class="font3"> I have obeyed the voice of the Lord, 20). They insisted that they had gone the full length of their mission (gone the way which the Lord sent me). Then they boasted that they had gotten sin under their control (have brought Agag, the king of Amalek) and had fully overcome the words and acts of their fallen flesh (have utterly destroyed the Amalekites).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Selfishly they sought to shift upon their supporters (the people took of the spoil, 21) the burden of sparing such allegedly allowable features of sinfulness in the justified and in the humanity of the consecrated (sheep and oxen) as could be used fruitfully in an alleged service of God, instances of which were cited above (the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto... thy God in Gilgal). To this deceitful answer antitypical Samuel gave, partly in question form, a classic answer (Samuel said, 22; in the type the answer is put in poetic form): Does the Lord delight in services allegedly acceptable to Him and in sacrifices made contrary to obedience as much as He does in obedience, even if unaccompanied by sacrifice? Does He in any sense delight in such service and sacrifice contrary to obedience? (Hath the Lord. . . delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as [He delights] in obeying the voice of the Lord?). Then antitypical Samuel read them a lesson very essential for all of God's people to learn, especially those of them in high places in His service, to the effect that to practice justice is better than to practice love contrary to justice, and to obey is better than alleged acceptable services rendered contrary to obedience. If, therefore, such cannot in harmony with obedience sacrifice, let them omit sacrifice, but obey; for justice must precede love. If both can be done together, that is best (Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams). Then, because antitypical Samuel were dealing with a crown-losing class, and therefore in God's sight with Levites, they used language appropriate to the situation, to the effect that revolutionism—the sin of antitypical Levites —is the sin of especially deceiving false teaching (rebellion is [the word for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font3"> is not in the Hebrew, as its being in italics shows] the sin of witchcraft, v. 23), and willfulness-a special characteristic of revolutionists leaders—is disharmonious with justice and is self-worship (stubbornness is [again the word for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as</span><span class="font3"> is</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">not in the Hebrew, as the italics show] iniquity and idolatry).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(54) Thereupon antitypical Samuel, with a sad, but obedient heart, announced the Lord's decision, telling antitypical Saul, with words doubtless choked with deep emotion, and in some of their representatives with tear-filled eyes, that since they had refused obedience to the Lord's Word, the Lord had rejected them from being the leaders of His true people (rejected the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king). Then, pricked to the heart and facing the situation honestly, antitypical Saul, their natural and acquired humility returning, acknowledge to antitypical Samuel that they had sinned (I have sinned, 24). Then they confessed the weakness that prompted to the sin—fear of opposing the wishes of the people by a resolute insistence on their overcoming sin (I feared the voice of the people and obeyed their voice), for which they were willing to disobey God and the star-members (transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words). Here is brought out a danger to leaders: fear of losing the popular favor leading them to compromise Truth and righteousness. Let those who are leaders be on their guard against this snare. If they give God their supreme devotion and bust, they will be delivered from &quot;the fear of man that bringeth a snare,&quot; a snare that in a more attenuated way is a danger to all of God's people. Surely our hearts bleed for typical Saul, and more so for antitypical Saul, for having been caught in this snare unto their undoing as leaders of God's people! Antitypical Saul earnestly and humbly entreated antitypical Samuel for forgiveness (I pray thee, pardon my sin, 25); moreover they made the same kind of a request that antitypical Samuel withdraw not their cooperation with them in their service of the Lord, which they greatly desired to further (turn again with me, that I may worship the Lord). This antitypical Samuel refused to do, for they knew that the rejected ones' service henceforth would not be acceptable</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(I will not return with thee, 26) . They gave as their reason a repetition of the pronounced sentence, that their rejecting God's Word resulted in God's rejecting them from leadership in antitypical Israel. This made it inadvisable to act in a way contradictory to the resultant situation (rejected the word of the Lord. . . rejected thee . . . king over Israel).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(55) So saying, antitypical Samuel turned to leave antitypical Saul, so far as acting as though they were sanctioning their administrative acts any more (turned about to go away, 27). Thereupon in remonstrance antitypical Saul forcibly took away from antitypical Samuel some of their power, and thus did violence to it; for these crown-lost princes resented antitypical Samuel'ss refusal to recognize their leadership, but they did it in the hope of changing their minds and course (laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent). The remonstrance of antitypical Samuel at Calvin's burning Servetus is a good illustration of the antitype of 1727; others abound. This unseemly course of antitypical Saul prompted antitypical Samuel to point out how by that violence antitypical Saul had figured forth God's taking the leadership in antitypical Israel from them (the Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee, 28) at that time (this day), which occurred with the various individuals on their rejection in each denomination and, finally, with all of them through God's choice of Bro. Russell to be put in their place. They said that God would give it to a brother in Christ worthier than they (give it to a neighbour . . . better than thou). They further asserted that God, who is the Strength of His people, would not make His decision become a falsehood (the Strength of Israel will not he, 29); nor would He, as men usually do, change His mind (nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent). Heartbroken, poor antitypical Saul again acknowledged their sin (I have sinned, 30). Despite this, they pleaded that antitypical Samuel do them the respect, that the other leaders, as well as</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the people, seeing, would still continue to support them as their chief leaders (honour me . . . before the elders . . . and before Israel). Antitypical Saul pleaded this that they might serve the Lord (turn again. . . worship . . . thy God). Deeply touched through their love and pity for antitypical Saul, antitypical Samuel relented and showed fellowship while antitypical Saul continued to serve the Lord (Samuel turned again . . . Saul worshiped the Lord, 31) .</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(56) But antitypical Samuel did not use the occasion to compromise with, but to destroy sin in themselves. Before the whole assembly they required sin as a subject to be brought to the fore (Bring hither to me Agag, the king of the Amalekites, 32). In its possessors this seemed to be thought to mean that they would very tenderly be spared overcoming it (Agag. . . delicately. . . said, Surely the bitterness of death is past). But they miscalculated the character and purpose of antitypical Samuel, who declared that as sin by its mortal power had caused the death of all men, as the children of human nature and of God's covenant with Adam and the race in him (Hos. 6 : 7; as thy sword hath made women childless, 33), so should lust in its various forms, the mother of sin (Jas. 1:15), become childless, through antitypical Samuel'ss overcoming it (so shall thy mother be childless among women). Thereupon antitypical Samuel overcame sin in the presence of antitypical Saul and Israel, by making no compromises with it, but overcoming all inducements that it offered them to compromise with it, which to accomplish they had to sever themselves from antitypical Saul and all who had their spirit (hewed Agag in pieces), and that publicly in the Lord's service amid crucial experiences (before the Lord in Gilgal). Thereupon antitypical Samuel returned to the heights of developing and maintaining a more than overcoming character (Then Samuel went to Ramah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">height,</span><span class="font3"> 34). And antitypical Saul ascended to office powers in the heights of a crown-loser's character (Saul went up to his house to Gibeah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[height]</span><span class="font3"> of Saul). But these experiences ended antitypical Samuel'ss fellowship with antitypical Saul (Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death, 35); for after the Adventist crown-lost leaders went to the bad, the last of the twelve fellowship removals occurred, which fellowship removals were kept up until their careers ended, early in the Harvest, when Bros. Storr and Stetson, some of the last representatives of antitypical Samuel, died. Despite antitypical Samuel'ss disappointment in antitypical Saul, they still continued to love these, which occasioned them to grieve deeply over the fall of these (Samuel mourned for Saul), which, however, did not alter God's determination to change His procedure whereby He had made antitypical Saul the leader of antitypical Israel (the Lord repented [changed not His mind, but His procedure] that he had made Saul king over Israel). Let us learn the lessons chiefly inculcated by Samuel and Saul, i.e., that by God's grace we stand, as we abide faithful, taught us by antitypical Samuel'ss life, and that, despite God's grace, we fall, as we prove unfaithful, taught us by antitypical Saul's life. .</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font1">CHRONOLOGICAL HARMONIES. EARLIER PARALLEL PROTESTANT MOVEMENTS. THEIR MANY CONTROVERSIES. ANTITYPICAL ELHAH AND ELISHA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FOR CENTURIES chronologians have striven, and, for the most part of the problem, in vain, to harmonize the comparative chronologies of the kings of Judiah and Israel. In EC, 144 (97)—145 (99), is shown the harmony in the synchronisms of Jehoshaphat's and Ahab's houses. But that harmonization merely scratches the surface of the problem in comparative chronology presented in the books of Kings and 2 Chronicles; for, viewed from the standpoint of the surface evidence as presented in these books, the comparative chronology seems unharmonizable. Indeed, chronologians up to the last half of the 19th century gave up the problem as insoluble. Since then, at the expense of the Bible's inerrancy, most of them have attempted to adjust the data given in the two Kings and 2 Chronicles to the Assyrian Eponyms for as far back as the latter extend— a dangerous thing, among other reasons, because these Eponyms are admittedly deficient and in error in certain particulars. To clarify the problem, first of all, the seeming discrepancies in the comparative chronologies of Judah's and Israel's kings will be pointed out, and that in two tables: (1) up to the death of Ahaziah of Judah and Jehoram of Israel, who died within a few hours of each other; and (2) from their death until the death of Hoshea, Israel's last king, in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign; and after each of such presentations the harmonization will be given. The first comparative table will give the years of the respective reigns of Judah's and Israel's kings up to the death of Ahaziah of Judah and Jehoram of Israel.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(2) Rehoboam and Jeroboam began to reign a few days apart (1 Kings 12: 1-24); and Ahaziah (of Judah) and Jehoram (of Israel) died within a few hours of each other (2 Kings 9: 22-27). Nevertheless the sum totals of the years' reigns of the six involved Judahite and the eight involved Israelite kings differ, according to the tables, by three years, whereas, according to the facts given in the preceding sentence, they should be of the same length. Knowing the Scriptures to be inerrant, and there being no differences in the involved years' reigns in the Hebrew MSS., we found ourself face to face with the problem that chronologers hitherto had been unable to solve. But the solution had to be found, otherwise the 2520 years parallels for both sets of kings could not be worked out, a task that this book undertakes to do. Knowing that there must be a' solution for this difficulty, where else should we go except to the Lord the Giver of the three involved books (1,2 Kings and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">2 Chronicles) and the Source of Truth, for the needed enlightenment? And, praised be His holy name! He gave it; for as we meditated and prayed over the problem, the thought struck our mind: Since the chronology, the Parallel Dispensations, the Parallel Seven Times and the Pyramid measurements prove that the chronology as given in 2 Chro. as to the lengths of the reigns of Judah's kings is true, and since 1 and 2 Kings agree with these reign lengths, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">why not take the lengths of the reigns of Judah's kings as the basis and calculate the lengths of the reigns of Israel's kings as they are given in terms of the years of Judah's kings and thus see what results would be reached?</span><span class="font3"> Thought and done! And the result was complete harmony between the two chronologies! We heated as cardinal numbers the ordinal numbers in terms of which the years of Judah's kings are given when compared with the beginning and ending years of Israel's kings, because, as was the case with Judah's kings, undoubtedly whatever was lacking in full years in the reigns of Israel's kings was made up by the succeeding kings before the years of their own reigns began to count chronologically. So only could a correct chronology be construed; for various of the kings of Israel and Judah died at other times of the year than April, when the various reigns are made to start chronologically. We will now set forth the chronological harmony of these reigns from the standpoint just given.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(4) Thus by giving the lengths of the reigns of Israel's kings in the compared terms of those of Judah's kings, the chronology of the involved six Judahite and the eight Israelite kings is found to be harmonious.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) The seeming discrepancy between the lengths of these two sets of kings from the deaths of Jehoram of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah until the death of Hoshea, Israel's last king, in the year 6 of Hezekiah, which period will next require our study, is much greater when the separately mentioned lengths of each pertinent set are added, but are perfectly harmonized when the lengths of the reigns of Israel's kings are given in the terms of the compared years of Judah's kings, as just shown of the six and eight kings above.

<p><span class="font3">(6) Here is a seeming discrepancy of 22 1/2 years. But it is harmonized by the same method as was used above, i.e., giving the kings of Israel the number of reign years that their reign years are given in terms of the reign years of Judah's kings, as follows, placing after the years the difference plus when more, and minus when less, than the separately given years in the preceding table:</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) Since both tables would give Shallum one month and since that is included in the year of Zachariah, we have omitted Shallum's one month from both tables, as neutralizing one another, and as being neutralized, because included in the one year of Zachariah's reign in terms of the reign of Azariah, as for a similar reason we omitted mend on of the 7 days' reign of Zimri (1 Kings 16: 15) in the first table. It will be seen that one table gives the kings of Israel 22¼ years less than the contemporaneous reigns of the kings of Judah, while their years in terms of the kings of Judah are 22¼ years more, which harmonizes the seeming discrepancy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) But, one may ask, Why does the Lord in the separately given reigns of the kings of Israel make the latter 3 years longer in the first table and 22¼ years shorter in the second table than the harmony shows to be the true datings? We reply that in the datings in terms of the years of Judah's kings the Lord arranged the matter so as to give the dates and events of the large parallel, the one of 2520 years, and in the separately given years of Israel's kings, so as to give the dates and events of the small parallel, which comes out in its second member in terms of days. In this book we will present the large parallel, which to be worked aright required the chronological datings to be made in terms of the years of Judah's kings; hence the foregoing chronological discussion, to clarify the subject. In EJ 333418 we discussed the small parallel, pausing here, however, to remark that we have given above Athaliah's reign as 7 years, even as the three passage there cited prove it to have been; for, though she died sometime during her seventh year, Jehoash (Joash) filled out the balance of that year before his reign years began to count chronologically, even as every other Judahite and all Israelite succeeding kings did with the balance of their predecessors' last year before their reign years began to count chronologically; otherwise a consistent chronology could not have been formed, since all of them evidently did not die on</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Nisan 1. Moreover, as we have elsewhere seen, it is the, regular Hebrew way of counting a fraction of a day or year a full day or year. Our Pastor, ignoting the fraction of Zedekiah's last year, counted the period of the kings as 513 years, whereas, according to his data and the fact that Zedekiah reigned 10¼ years, he should; if noting the fractions, have given it as 512¼, since he counted Athaliah as reigning but 6, instead of 7 years. The exact length of the period of the kings was 513¼ years, which, as required by the other features of the chronology, the Parallel Dispensations, the parallels of the two Seven Times and the Pyramid, requires us to reduce the 44914 years of the judges' period to 448¼ years. The expression, &quot;about the space of 450 years,&quot; in Acts 13: 20 is flexible enough to permit this to be done.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) The dates and events of the 2520 years' parallels require Athaliah's reign to be 7 years, otherwise their dates and events cannot be harmonized. Accordingly, in Studies, Vol. II, 374-376, 380, please change the figures 512¼ to 512½ for the period of the kings to 513¼ and 513½, and those of 44914 and 449 6/12 for the period of the judges to 448¼ and 448½. This will also require us to understand the expression in 1 Kings 6: 1, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;fourth</span><span class="font3"> year of Solomon's reign,&quot; to mean year 4, as we saw above to be the regular usage with the ordinal numbers of the reign years of Judah's kings. Please also make the pertinent corrections of the expression, 3 years, to 4 years, and the figures, 129¼, to 130¼, in Studies, Vol. II, 376, end of par. 1. All these references to Studies, Vol. II, are, of course, to the notes in our edition of that Volume. We are not to think that there is in any sense a contradiction between the length of years expressly assigned to the various Israelite kings' reigns as given in 1, 2 Kings and the number of years in the comparative chronology of their and the various Judahite kings' reigns; for the length of the formers' reigns apart from the comparisons is stated to cover only such years in which they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">were active as marked specifically the first and last acts of their reigns required for the working out of the small parallel, i.e., only such years are expressly given as the length of their reigns as were revelatory of God's designs as to the length in days of the second member of the small parallel. Hence in some cases these typical acts as royal acts were performed before they actually ascended the throne and in some cases these typical acts as royal acts were performed as the last ones of their years of life before they really ceased to reign; and in either case the matter was Divinely arranged so as to fit the chronology of the small parallel. Hence there is absolutely no contradiction between the actual lengths of the reigns as the comparison above shows and the years expressly assigned to their reigns in 1, 2 Kings, if we look upon matters as just explained, since the different sets of lengths of the separate reigns are given to mark different sets of acts in the two sets of parallels.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) Solomon in the good acts of his reign, as these are given in 1 Kings 1-10 and 2 Chro. 1-9, types in the large picture the Christ in the good acts of the Millennial reign. Certainly, his reign's evil acts of 1 Kings 11, which are entirely omitted in 2 Chro., cannot type anything in the Christ's Millennial reign, which will in every way be good. It will be noted that the evil acts of 1 Kings 11 are represented as bringing resultant evils upon Solomon's reigning descendants. And from this we get a broad hint as to the antitype of Solomon's wicked acts of 1 Kings 11. That the books of Kings are typical prophecies we know from the fact that they are by God put among the books— Joshua, Judges, Ruth and the two Samuels—which God calls, &quot;the earlier Prophets.&quot; That Joshua, Judges, Ruth and the first % of 1 Samuel are prophetic types we are assured by the fact that St. Peter by inspiration tells us that Samuel thereby prophesied (Acts 3: 24). In fact, so far as we now know, there are three applications of prophetic types in these two books; and the same is true of their</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">companion book, 2 Chronicles. The first of these three applications is that of general pictures more or less detached, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e. g.,</span><span class="font3"> Solomon in his good acts typing in the large picture the Millennial Christ and in his bad acts, the papacy before and early in the Reformation; from the reign of Ahab on to the death of Zachariah (Jeroboam Il's son), when Elijah and Elisha performed their parts in the history, we have a history of the whole Gospel Age up to nearly the time of Anarchy. Then specialized pictures, especially concerning America, are given by the kings of Judah from Rehoboam on to at least Amaziatis time. These and others are general pictures isolated one from the other. Then the three books that treat of the kings of Judah and Israel have a second set of applications, i.e., the 2520 years' parallels, beginning with the reigns of Rehoboam and Jeroboam, 1,000 B.C., and ending with Jerusalem's and the land's desolation, 607 B.C., in its first member, and in its second member beginning in April, 1521, with the first workings of a division among the two Reform movements and ending about Oct., 1914, with the setting in of trench warfare in the World War. Then there is a third application, a small application of the parallel of Judah's and Israel's kings in its first member and certain Truth leaders, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> in 1916 and 1917, wherein the years of the first member of the parallel stand for days in the second member of the parallel. The years of the third application in the first and second parallel's members in the Judah and American features are 392*4 years and days respectively, while the years and days of the third application in the first and second parallels' members in the Israelite and British features are 241*4 years and days respectively. It is of the second application that several chapters of this book will treat.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) Describing the wicked acts of Solomon, 1 Kings 11 serves as an introduction to the second and third applications, the large and the small 2520 years' and days' parallels. In order to keep this book within reasonable bounds, since it will cover the contents of 1 Sam. 1—15, nearly the whole of 1 Kings, the whole of 2 Kings and nearly the whole of 2 Chro., we will have to be exceedingly brief; and the reader will have to have his Bible, better two, one at each of the accounts, constantly before him, to compare type and antitype; for we will merely by parenthetical chapter and verse citation, or occasionally by parenthetical word allusion refer to the type and state the antitype very briefly. Briefly, we would say that Solomon's wicked acts of 1 Kings 11 type the preReformation wicked acts of the papacy which led up to reformatory movements and to God's people in Protestantism dividing into two parties and into sets of movements, which were repeatedly antagonistic to one another, as Judah's kings and Israel's kings were repeatedly antagonistic to one another. And later (after Israel's kings had disappeared from the scene) as Judah's kings alone were on the throne, acting out various good or evil things, so various movements of varying good or evil operated among God's people in American Protestantism until utter apostasy, so far as the parallel is concerned, came to a head from 1893 to 1914. Thus we have given a brief outline of the introduction to, and progress of the 2520 years' parallel in both its members; for we are to remember that there are no parallel dates and events in the first member of this parallel before April, 1,000 B.C., and that these ended Oct., 607 B.C., while the parallel dates and events in the second member began April, 1521, and ended Oct., 1914. We gave in EJ, 333-418 the third application. In THE PRESENT TRUTH we have discussed many of the pictures of the first application, the rest coming, in due time, as the Lord opens the way.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) Now a few details on the wicked papal practices of the pre-parallel events and dates, typed by Solomon's wicked acts. The papacy greatly desired many cooperating organizations, like synods, councils, orders of monks, nuns, universities, various orders and kinds of professors, authors, nobles, as well as kings, canonists, officials, armies, guilds, burghers, servants, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> some more influential, others less so (1 Kings 11: 1, 3 ), forbidden by God to His real people (2). This was especially true in the Sardis period of the Church (4). It fostered a union of state and church (Ashtoreth, Venus, 5), the doctrine of eternal torment (Milcom, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> Molech, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">king,</span><span class="font3"> 7) and of purgatory (Chemosh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">subduer)</span><span class="font3"> and other false doctrines which were urged by its various orders, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (8). This aroused God's displeasure against the papacy (9, 10). Repeatedly through the Sardis star-members God threatened to disrupt it (11) , but put it off temporarily (12) and said its disruption would not, for the sake of the true Church, be total (13). Early in the Philadelphia period God raised up three adversaries against the papacy: (1) a reform (v. 14, Hadad, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sharpsighted)</span><span class="font3"> political party demanding the reformation of political Romanism, especially in Germany, when it sent to Rome a set of 100 grievances, demanding redress (14-22). It worked favorably with the reigning political powers for awhile (17-20), then left them to pursue its own policies (21, 22); (2) the reforming humanists, learned scholars, who revived Latin, Greek and Hebrew learning, prominent among whom were the learned Reuchlin, Melanchthon's uncle, and Erasmus this party (Rezon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prince,</span><span class="font3"> Eliadah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God-enlightened</span><span class="font3"> 23) was a thorn in the flesh of the papacy, and did preparatory work for the religious reformation (24, 25); (3) the Lutheran reform party (Jeroboam, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">striver of the people,</span><span class="font3"> Nebat, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aspect</span><span class="font3"> 26) from 1517 to 1521. The individuals who later formed this party previously to their reform activity worked valiantly for the papacy (27, 28); but when they formed the Lutheran movement, the sharpsighted ones (Ahijah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is my brother</span><span class="font3"> 29) among these forecast that it would disrupt papacy and also make a division among some of papacy's religious adversaries (30-32), declaring that this was because of papacy's wickedness (33), yet they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">said that some would be left with the good part, those who had the Lord's Spirit (34-36), and promised the Lutheran movement much success, if it would be loyal to God. (37, 38), while punishing the others measurably who as Protestant people of God would retain some features of God's Spirit (39). Hearing of the action of these forecasters, the papacy persecuted the Lutheran movement, which fled to certain civil rulers of Germany for refuge, from about 1518 to 1521 (40). Details, among other things, on papacy's wicked acts are found in the star-members' writings (history of Nathan, 41; 2 Chro. 9: 29), the writings of leading early Lutherans (prophecy of Ahijah) and later Lutheran authors on Lutheranism (vision of Iddo).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(13) From here on our comments will be on Kings and Chronicles; and we will abbreviate these by their initial letters, K. and C., in the first reference to each chapter's number; after that in the chapter we will merely indicate the verse, without repeating the name of the book and the same chapter number, giving first the Kings citation and, second, that of Chronicles, with the semicolon between the verses of the two books; but when only one citation is made the Kings' citation is followed by the semicolon and the Chronicles' citation is preceded by the semicolon, thus: 2; 3 mean verses in both books, 2; means a Kings' verse and; 2 means a Chronicles' verse. As already pointed out, the first parallel dates with parallel events in the 2520 years' parallel are April, 1,000 B.C. and April, 1521 A. D. In giving the parallel date of the parallel's second member we will in parenthesis often give the date 2520 years before. The parallel events were the division of the typical kingdom into the two-tribed kingdom of Judah and the ten-tribed kingdom of Israel, and the division of God's Gospel-Age people in Protestantism into two movements: (1) the Reformed movement, mainly in Switzerland, corresponding to Rehoboam </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(who enlarges the people),</span><span class="font3"> and (2) the Lutheran movement, corresponding to Jeroboam. Little Flock</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">leaders and good crown-lost leaders were leaders in both of these movements. As a rule, but not always, the leaders of the movements that correspond to the succeeding kings of Judah were Little Flock and good crown-loser members; and as a rule, but not always, the leaders of the movements that correspond to the succeeding kings of Israel are crown-lost leaders, good and bad. But in some cases the latter set of movements are almost entirely political, infected with the Divine-right-of-kings doctrine. In the first set of movements they are always religious; however, in some of these cases the religious movement is apostate in character, corresponding to the apostate character of some of Judah's kings. The Lutheran movement began as a purely priestly movement, with Luther's nailing the 95 Theses to the doors of the Wittenberg Castle Church, Oct. 31, 1517, and continued such for about a year, when Luther and his colaborers began to lean on the civil rulers of Saxony, and by April, 1521, under Luther's leadership, his movement was quite strongly leaning on the arm of the civil power.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) The Zwinglian movement began in 1519 in very attenuated ways, mainly through Zwingli's efforts; and by April, 1521 (1,000 B.C.) under Zwingli's leadership it was an independent movement characterized by more strictness as to Christian life, and was thus more Little-Flock-like, than was the Lutheran movement. It was on this point that the ever-widening rupture between these two Protestant movements set in. At first this movement approached in friendliness the Lutheran movement, which reciprocated. It expected to have the ascendancy over the latter (1 K. 12: 13; 2 C. 10: 1-3). The Lutheran movement desired to give it such, but requested that it ease its too strict demands on the people and accept the more easy-going demands of the Lutheran movement on the people (4; 4). The matter was taken under advisement (5; 5). Wiser heads advised compliance (6, 6, 7). Less wise, but more intimate heads advised stricter demands to be</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">made on the people (8-11;). After a time the Lutheran movement returned for the answer (12; 12). A refusal accompanied with stricter demands was given by the Zwinglian movement to the Lutheran movement (13, 14; 13, 14). Thus was effected the condition leading up to the division forecast by the enlightened ones in the Lutheran movement (15; 15). Thus by a very small beginning set in the division between the Zwinglians and Lutherans (16; 16). As the years went by this division became wider, as the Zwinglians made their practices stricter, and the Lutherans made theirs more lenient. When emissaries from the former sought to win over the latter to their stricter practices, the latter refuted these by stronger arguments (18; 18); however, in some states of Germany, the Zwinglian movement got the upper hand (17; 17). Thus the division set in and continued among the two groups of Protestants (19; 19); the Lutherans, in the great majority, recognized and supported their movement (20). This led the Zwinglian movement to plan war against the Lutheran movement (21; 2 C. 11: 1), from which it was dissuaded by the Divinely-raised-up peace party in their midst, convincing them that God so willed matters (22-24; 2-4). The Lutheran party then proceeded to develop the German field as congenial, and from there developed the Scandinavian field (25;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) The Zwinglian movement developed itself in the Protestant cantons of Switzerland, in certain principalities of Germany and provinces of France (5-10), strengthened its principles, appointed able defenders of these and put in them hard and easy teachings with much of the Spirit (11). In all of these political units it placed defensive and offensive controversial writings and strengthened them and maintained itself as a movement (12;). Generally speaking, the more consecrated public servants of God left the Lutheran movement and adhered to the Zwinglian movement, since these were cast off by the Lutheran movement and its representatives as extremists, whom they would not permit to minister among them (13, 14;). The Lutheran movement appointed such clergy as would serve the nominal people, sectarianism and clericalism (15;). Not only so, but the more faithful consecrated laity followed the example of the more consecrated public servants of God by leaving the Lutheran and adhering to the Zwinglian movement (16;). This, of course, gave real spiritual strength to the latter, though the former had the more numerous followers. This continued for three years, 1521 to 1524 (1,000 to 997 B.C.), when the Zwinglian movement began to persecute the Little Flock movement started by Balthasar Hubmaier, which later was sectarianized by crown-lost leaders into the Baptist Church (17). But the Lutheran movement, to keep its own from going away to the rival movement (26;), sought to hinder their fellowshipping with the latter, in order to prevent their casting it off and turning to the latter (27). Hence it developed Lutheran sectarianism and clericalism as their deliverers from Satan's empire, to ease matters for its adherents (28, 29;), which became great evils (30;). In every Lutheran dominated country these two evils were served; and in most cases unconsecrated preachers and professors were made servants of these (31;).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(16) This movement counterfeited the class standings of the antitypical feast of tabernacles and served these counterfeit class standings in their Church, particularly by its doctrines of the Lord's Supper, Person of Christ and Romanist sacramental efficacy (32, 33;). Able Zwinglian movement brethren, e.g., Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Bucer, Capito, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., </span><span class="font3">testified against this spurious Church, its servants and their gross errors as the Lutheran movement served these, and forecast that a pure teaching movement would arise and expose as vile sectarianism the Lutheran Church and ministers with their memories (1 K. 13: 1, 2), and gave as an evidence of this a rending of the Lutheran Church and a rejection of its sacrifices (3;). The Lutheran movement on noting this witness exerted its power against these witnesses controversially to injure them; but that controversial power withered, under the refutative answers that these witnesses gave, and could not be made effective (4;). Great divisions set in the Lutheran Church and its pertinent sacrifices were rejected, as these witnesses had forecast (5;). The impotence of the Lutheran movement appealed to these witnesses to labor for its pertinent healing, which was granted (6;). Thereupon the Lutheran movement desired their fellowship in doctrine and practice (7), which, as forbidden by the Word, they refused to give (8, 9;). They were charged to return to their usual service in a somewhat altered way of presenting the teachings, which they did (9, 10;).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) Various of the Lutheran leaders, like Luther, Melanchthon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> were told the actual effects of these happenings by some of their supporters (11;); and the latter indicated the changed form that the representatives of the Zwinglian movement gave their teachings, particularly on the Lord's Supper. This influenced Luther, Melanchthon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to make certain adjustments to their pertinent teachings, in order to use them for the purpose of reestablishing fellowship with them (12, 13;). They met, and after discussions </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pro</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">con</span><span class="font3"> (14-18;) fellowship in doctrine and practice were agreed upon, particularly between Luther and Melanchthon, with their chief colaborers, on the one hand, and Bucer and Capito, with their chief colaborers, on the other, some of the Lutheran representatives, particularly Melanchthon and the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, acting more or less uncandidly in the matter (19;). But some of them, particularly Luther and the Elector of Saxony, seeing through the course of Bucer, Capito, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> as disloyal to their own principles, forecast that they would become non-existent as pertinent messengers of the Lord, and would lose the respect of their fellows (20-22;). Adjusting their</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">pertinent doctrine, Luther, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> sent them away as disloyal (23;). By their course, being a surrender of the Truth on the Lord's Supper as taught by Zwingli, Satan destroyed them as God's messengers; and as such Satan and their doctrine remained with them as teachers of error and no longer God's messengers; and they were seen to be such and proclaimed as such in Lutheran sectarianism (24, 25;), especially by the main Lutheran leaders (26;), whose supporters adjusted for them the real Lutheran doctrine of the Lord's Supper (27), and thereon they went and found the above-described condition, Satan not having done the unfaithful and their pertinent teachings further harm (28;). They gave them as a former Divine mouthpiece suitable respect, as they would have desired for themselves (29, 30;), and desired their supporters to treat them with the same respect as due a real prophet when their role as such was over (31, 32;). But these things effected no reform in the Lutheran movement, which continued in its special wrong teachings and practices (33;). And these evils led to God's casting off the Lutheran movement (34;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(18) The Reformed movement developed a considerable number of sub-movements in Switzerland, Germany, England and France, through which many groups of supporters were developed (18-21;) , the chief of which was the English Cranmer movement (22;). It wisely distributed these supporting groups in the various principalities, cantons, provisions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> of these countries as means of strength, giving them teaching support and seeking to give them organizational helps (23;). But as its strength increased, it and all its supporters did evil by becoming persecutors of Hubmaier and his associates, particularly the latter in late 1525 and early 1526 (2 C. 12: 1). Immediately thereafter the papacy (1 K. 14: 25; 2) began to make in-roads upon it with huge forces (3); beginning in Switzerland and proceeding in France, through religious, political and military fights, resulting in severe</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">defeats for the Zwinglian movement in cantons and provinces, endangering the heads of the movement (4;). The more pious of them denounced their wrongdoings as resulting in their defeats, which produced confession and repentance of sin in them and acknowledgment of God's justice (5, 6;). This moved the Lord to send them a message of partial mercy (7), though forecasting some oppression upon them from the papists in contrast with the mildness of God's rule (8;). The papists took away some of their religious and political privileges and some of their arguments (26; 9), in lieu of which the movement made less costly but stronger arguments for its leaders who guarded it (27; 10), and who used these in their religious and political spheres (28; 11).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(19) These calamities producing repentance, the Lord relieved it of its evils, since good was found in its adherents (12;). Thereafter it strengthened itself until it ceased to be dominant in the Lord's affairs, despite its clericalistic principles (21; 13). The movement and its adherents were not wholeheartedly loyal to God, resulting in their displeasing God above the primitive believers (22; 14); for they formed sects, had evil leaders and united state and church in each principality, canton and province under great leaders (23;) and furthered such by alliances between various states and more or less continued papal practices (24;). Various historians described its doings, particularly its controversies with the Lutheran movement (29, 30; 15). In the year 1538 (paralleling 983 B.C.) this movement ceased to function as the Lord's more favored movement, though it was remembered as such, and the Cranmer movement succeeded it (31; 16). The Cranmer movement, 1538-1541 (983-980 B.C.), did this good, that it furthered Bible distribution, but it was mixed up with Henry VIII's evil policies (1 K. 15: 1, 2; 2 C. 13: 1,2), and was guilty of some of the evils of the Zwinglian movement (3;). But for the little Flock's sake God used it (4, 5;); and as between the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Zwinglian movement and the Lutheran movement, so was there strife between it and the latter (6, 2); because of the evils of the Lutheran movement the Cranmer movement would not sanction an alliance between England and the former, which sought to bring it about by intriguing through the marriage of Anne of Cleves and Henry VIII. This by various arguments the Cranmer movement opposed and annulled, to the discomfiture of the Lutheran movement, after the former had reproached the latter for its iniquities (;3-18), and overthrew its sectarianism, clericalism and creedism (;19), from which defeats it did not recover before the time the Lord cast it off as a less favored movement (;20). On the contrary, the Cranmer movement prospered, gaining many organizations and strong and less strong supporters (;21), and its history is written in the writings of many (7; 22). But the Lord set aside this movement in 1541 as a Little Flock remembered one; and the Unitarian movement became the more favored one (8; 2 C. 14: 1).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) The Unitarian movement took its place as the Divinely more favored movement for 41 years, i.e., 1541-1582 (OSO-OSO B.C.), i.e., it began while the Lutheran movement was still active (0, 10;). The Unitarian movement was one of the best of all the Divinely more favored movements, acting like the Little Flock (11; 2). It set aside those who favored international alliances and the creedal idols of the Cranmer movement, the false churches, their leaders and union of state and church (12; 3). It even set aside those who nourished it in its weakness, when they set up a creed idol favorable to union of state and church, and overthrew it (13;2C. 15: 16); yet it did not set aside the sects, though it was loyal almost to the end (14; 17). The good thought of Bible spreading of the Cranmer movement and its own teachings unity of God, mortality of man, death as the wages of sin, Christ as Son of God, it deposited in the Church (15; 18). It laid great stress on the Lord's people living aright (; 2 C. 14: 4), and thrust out among its adherents the sects and Satan's way of service, thus securing prosperity among its adherents (;5); and there were no special controversies for ten years (1541 to 1551 [980-970 B.C. ]). During these years Servetus had leisure to study much and wrote his great work, The Restoration of True Christianity (;6). By prayer, speech and example he encouraged several colaborers to cooperate in reconstructive work (;7).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(21) There was a movement begun by the Luther-an movement and its supporters that for years labored for a settlement of the religious troubles in Germany by a national council participated in by Romanists and Protestants, intended to bring about peace (1 K. 14: 1). The Lutheran movement in its secular leaders sent certain of its supporters, who were instructed by it to disguise their relations to the former and inquire of the most enlightened leaders of it, like Luther, Melanchthon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (2;), as to what the prospects of the peace movement's designs as to a German National Council's convening and settling Germany's troubled religious parries might be, and to take along ingratiating gifts for these leaders (3;). These supporters undertook the mission to the unsuspecting leaders (4;). But the Lord opened the latters' minds to discern the identity of these supporters (5;). These leaders, therefore, on being approached by the supporters, told them of their relationship to the secular leaders of the Lutheran movement (6;) and told them to return as answer a denunciation of the evils of the Lutheran movement, both in its religious and its secular aspects (7-9;) , and to announce the Lord's rejection of the Lutheran movement, as corrupt, from His favor (10;) and of His cutting off every feature of its various movements, whether restrained or free, by sectarians and rebels (11;). Particularly did these leaders forecast the death of the Lutheran peace movement when they, the supporters, would reach their secular commissioners (12;), which would cause mourning to all adherents of the Lutheran movement; for this peace movement had commendable features in it (13;). They further forecast that another movement would displace the Lutheran movement as that of the less favored of God's people (14;). They even forecast the overthrow of the autocracy of the Divine-rightist civil powers, because of their state and church union (15;), all because of the evils that the Lutheran movement introduced into Protestantism (16;). This message was carried back by the supporters to the secular leaders of the Lutheran movement; and on their arrival the peace movement died (17), to the great grief of German Protestantism (18;). Lutheran historians have set forth in detail the acts, controversies and rule of the Lutheran movement (19;). The above phase of the Lutheran movement ceased to be recognized by the Lord in 1543 (978 B.C.), after lasting 22 years, and was succeeded by a sickly Lutheran movement that lasted but one year, from 1543 to 1544 (978 to 977 B.C.), striving through Luther's willfully beginning a controversy (20;) on the Lord's Supper against the Calvinistic movement, which refuted it as evil, with the other evils of the former movement, while the sickly Lutheran movement was striving against sectarian Romanists (25-30;). This weak phase of the secondary Lutheran movement is described by , Lutheran and other historians (31;).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) The Calvinistic movement became in 1544 (977 B.C.) the less favored movement of the people of God, and was active as such until 1567 (954 B.C., 1 K. 15: 33); but this movement, like both Lutheran movements, was guilty of sectarianism, clericalism and union of church and state; and additionally it incessantly fought the Unitarian movement (16, 32, 34;), which was the more favored movement of the people of God. The Unitarian movement had a large number of leaders who wrote able expositions of, and able refutations of attacks on, their doctrines, like Servetus, the two Socini, Davidis, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> and a large number of lesser lights who by word of mouth, especially by questions,, were able to do likewise (;2 C. 14: 8). Against them contended the Greek and Roman Catholics, the Lutherans, the Calvinists and the Anglicans (;9); but the former came forth courageously to meet these, especially on the doctrine of the trinity (; 10). The Unitarian movement made earnest, humble and trustful prayer to God, as His more favored representative (;11). God enabled them successfully to defend Unitarianism and to overthrow trinitarianism in an utter defeat (;12, 13); and at the same time they overthrew and captured the doctrines related to trinitarianism (;14) and won to their faith many former Trinitarians (;15).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) This victory moved the Unitarian leaders (;2 C. 15: 1) to exhort by the Lord's Spirit their brethren to remain faithful to the Lord, who would, if they did, continue on their side (;2). They reminded them of the apostasies of nominal Spiritual Israel and their consequent unhappy experiences, and of the Lord's mercies returning to them on their repentance (;3-6); and from this they drew the lesson to be faithful and promised blessings to follow thereupon (;7). The Unitarian movement, encouraged by these exhortations, put away more and more errors and renewed the true Church publicly in its sacrificing course (;8). This resulted in numerous converts to the unity of God, especially in Italy and Switzerland, where Laelius Socinus (1555, 963 B.C.) mildly questioned the trinity in favor of the Unity (;9, 10). Consecrations and their carrying out marked their course (;11, 12), as they agreed to disfellowship the unconsecrated, and solemnly made their vows to the Lord amid preachings of the Word (;13, 14), for which reason they rejoiced in their wholehearted consecrations as manifesting the Lord to them in blessing (;15). Then this movement lapsed into silence until in 1566 (952 B. 'C.; v. 19 should read year 25, not year 35, since Baasha died in year. 26 of Asa) Faustus Socinus, nephew and disciple</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of Laelius Socinus, held aloft the Unitarian banner (;19). In 1567 (951 B.C.) the conflict between the Calvinistic movement and the Unitarian movement broke out again (1 K. 15: 17; 2 C. 16: 1) , because the former desired to prevent further fallings away to the latter, and therefore developed trinitarianism further. To meet these arguments the Unitarian movement made a combination of arguments from upholders of Scripture and reason to renew a former combination of these (18, 19; 2, 3). Upholders of reason and Scripture agreed to this renewal of their former alliance; and reason attacked and refuted the idea of there being three gods in one God, as well as the pertinent arguments (20; 4). This moved the Calvinistic movement to desist from further elaboration of trinitarianism and to go about its proper business (21; 5). Thereupon the Unitarian movement called upon all its adherents to take away the Calvinistic points based on perverted Scripture and to develop the Unitarian thought on the relationship between the Fattier and the Son and the Holy Spirit (22; 6).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) But some of the adherents of the Unitarian movement, speaking the truth, rebuked it for making an alliance with reason's upholders, as unbelief toward God, and said that it would result in Romanist trinitarians evading its arguments (;7), reminding it of its victory over all nominal-church trinitarians in their former controversy, because of trusting in the Lord (;8); for God seeks such believers; and folly was the quality of the other act, which would bring continual warfare (;9). The movement became enraged at these and restrained their influence among its adherents, at the same time in Poland and Transylvania it enacted oppressive church laws (;10). Certain ones of the rebukers of this movement rebuked the Calvinistic movement, which from little was by God made great, for committing the same sins as both Lutheran movements, to the Lord's displeasure (1 K. 16: 1, 2, 7); therefore they foretold that the Lord would set aside</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the Calvinistic movement from His favor, as He had done with the Lutheran movement (3;), and sectarians and lawless ones would plunder them (4;). Calvinistic historians have given a history of this movement (5;). In 1567 (954 B.C.) the Calvinistic (continental) movement gave way to the Calvinistic Knox Scottish movement as the less favored movement among the Protestant people of God (8;); but after a career of but one year this movement, drunken with its external success, came to grief through an oppositional Scottish politico-religious movement (1568 /953 B.C.], 9, 10;)</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(25) At the same time it set aside every vestige of both Calvinistic movements in its leaders as adherents of the less favored movement, even as was forecast (11, 12;), because of the iniquities of both phases of this movement against which God was displeased (13;). Its historians have described this secondary Calvinistic movement (14;). This Scottish politico-religious movement was of very short duration; for the Anglican movement under, the lead of Elizabeth, at that time fighting against sectarian Romanism, displaced it as the less favored movement of the people of God, in 1568 (953 B.C.; 15, 16;) by an oppositional movement (17), for which the Scottish politicoreligious movement gave up (18;); for it, too, in its brief life was guilty of the evils of the Lutheran movement (19;). The historians of this movement have accurately described it (20;). From the cases of the houses of Jeroboam and Baasha we construe of all the dynasties (houses) of Israel's kings, that each such house or dynasty in its various ruling members stood for as many variations of the antitypical movement as were ruling members in the pertinent dynasty or house; thus, as there were two ruling members in the Jeroboam house or dynasty, so were there two Lutheran movements in the parallel or antitype, and as there were two ruling members in the Baasha house or dynasty, so were there two Calvinistic movements in the parallel or antitype.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(26) In Britain there were two Protestant parties those who desired a more Scriptural relation of church and state, Protestants in a purer sense, called Puritans, and those who desired a close union of state and church, the latter being led by Elizabeth (with the idea of royal supremacy) and the Anglican hierarchy, which prevailed (21, 22;). The first phase of the Anglican movement was from 1568 to 1579 (953-942 B.C.; not in the year 31, but 27 of Asa; compare 1 K. 16: 15-22 and 29 with 23; hence here in v. 23 is a copyist's error). In its first six years it was mainly a religious movement; and in its last five years it was mainly a political movement (23, 24;), force by law sometimes being used to compel conformity to the rites and worship of the Anglican Church from 1574 (947 B.C.) onward. This persecuting phase of the Anglican movement included not only fines and imprisonments, but the burning at the stake of two Baptists in 1575 and another in 1579, to the disgrace of Elizabeth, the leader of this movement. It proved to be, so far, the most wicked of all the less favored movements of the Protestant people of God, and it was set aside in 1579, doubtless as a result of the third heresy burning bringing to a head its wickedness; for we are to remember that both the civil and religious powers supported this movement's wickedness, committing all the evils of the Lutheran movements and more besides, to the Lord's displeasure (25, 26;). Historians of this movement have described it (27).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(27) This phase ceased, being buried in politics; but it was succeeded by even a worse phase (28;). This worse, yea worst, phase of the Anglican movement was from 1579 to 1600, (942-921 B.C., 29, 30;). This movement not only continued the evils of the Lutheran movements, but became united with the Anglican Church through Elizabeth, furthered by the Royal Supremacy idea, and became the servant of power-grasping and lording (31;). Riding roughshod over all rivals: the Puritans, Baptists and Congregationalists,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">it erected the Church of England as the servant and supporter of power-grasping and tyranny (32;), making the union of state and church firmer, and displeased God more than any other former one of the less favored movements of the people of God (33;). The hierarchy and its literary supporters so developed the Episcopal Church in its Divine-right-of-bishops doctrine and powers and in its promoting to power and influence the supporters of the same as to alienate the Little Flock leader, Robert Browne, and his supporters and the Puritan crown-lost leader, Thomas Cartright, and his supporters, as the Lord forecast of such cases (34;). In 1582 (939 B.C.) , thus during the second phase of the Anglican movement, the Unitarian movement ceased to be the more Divinely favored one of the Protestant people of God. It was respected as more or less in harmony with the Little Flock (1 K. 15: 24; 2 C. 16: 12—14). Toward its end its practices turned still more to the worse, seeking a cure by encouraging its leaders to sectarianize it more or less, instead of seeking the Lord's help in His spirit, which brought about its rejection by the Lord (23; 12). Its historians adequately described its course (23; 11) with much praise of it (; 14).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) The Unitarian movement was succeeded by the Congregational movement as the more favored one of God's people (24; 2 C. 17: 1), in the year of 1582 (939 B.C.), and prevailed as such until 1607 (914 B.C.); but, though well armed, it was a movement deserted by its Little Flock leader, Robert Browne, and by the English government, so far as protection is concerned (22: 41, 42; 20: 31). Like the Unitarian movement, it did right, thoroughly avoiding the sins of all the less Divinely favored movements; but the Congregational movement failed to put down false religious service (43; 32, 33), but condemned unholy alliances between various states, even those not condemned by the Unitarian movement (46;). It developed its views on church government very strongly as against the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">papistical, the episcopal and the presbyterian forms of church government (;2 C. 17: 1), training its adherents thoroughly to use the proofs of the congregational form of church government defensively and offensively against the opposing errors (;2). The Lord blessed it, because it clung to Little Flock ways and opposed power-grasping and lording over God's heritage (;3); and because it acted in harmony with the Word, seeking the Lord and avoiding the evils of the apostate movements (;4). Hence the Lord strengthened it, its adherents gave it good support, and its riches were of truth and the respect of its adherents (;5). It was exalted in character through walking in the Lord's ways, and removed from its midst the false religious services that the Unitarian movement failed to do, as well as all combination of church and state (;6). Moreover, in 1585 (936 B.C.) it raised up deacons, elders and pastors, specially trained, who went about preaching the Truth then due, especially on church government, using the Bible as their sole source of faith and main rule of practice (;7-9). While the Anglican Church through Elizabeth persecuted this movement, her clergy, hierarchy and professors did not specially carry on doctrinal controversies with it, their hands being full with their controversies with the Presbyterian Puritans (;10). Some of the sectarians and politicans, doublefaced as they were, e.g., Cecil (later Lord Burghley), Leicester, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> especially the civil rulers of Holland, whither persecution drove many of its adherents from England, gave it special favors (;11), under which conditions it waxed stronger and developed its principles in greater detail. It trained its adherents thoroughly in its principles, and made a large proportion of them warriors for them (;12, 13) chiefly in five countries: England, Scotland, Holland, Germany and America (;14-19).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(29) Starting off with Robert Browne, 1582, the new creatures in the Congregational movement faced the second Anglican movement with the statement that surely no Truth could come apart from their ministry (1 K. 17: 1;). The Lord's Word, Spirit and providence prompted them to withdraw from the Anglican Church to the Truth that could be gotten in isolation between that Church and the race under the curse, which they accordingly did (2-5;), where Dutch sectarians gave them some relief (6;). When they could get no more assistance there, they in part returned to England and in part went to America and received nourishment among outcasts of the Anglican Church in England and America (7-10;). These outcasts, consisting of some Baptists and more Puritans, assured them that they had almost no spiritual food; but such as it was they were seeking to prepare it with the thoughts of anti-hierarchism and anti-superstition (11, 12;). They told these outcasts to give them of their spiritual refreshments; and thereafter there would be enough for them and their anti-hi erarchic al and anti-superstition movement until the Lord would send abundance of truth (13; 14;). Said and done; and the forecast of the new creatures in the Congregational movement was fulfilled (15, 16;). After a time, as the Elizabethan persecution against the nonconformists continued, resulting in the imprisonment and hanging of many nonconformists, including some of the new-creaturely leaders of the Congregational movement, the anti-hierarchical and anti-superstition movement became inactive (17). The outcasts blamed the new-creaturely members of the Congregational movement for this result (18;); and these by a threefold effort, that led by Browne, that led by Barrowe and that led by Ainsworth, the most learned of all early leaders of Congregationalism, resuscitated it and presented it as such to the outcasts (1923;) , who were thereby fully persuaded of the Divine mouthpieceship of these new-creaturely leaders in the Congregational movement (24;).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(30) The providence of God moved Barrowe and his colaborer, Greenwood, to carry their case before the civil powers, through which they hoped that the Truth would get a wide circulation; hence they sought to do this (1 K. 18: 1, 2;). Their activities brought them to the attention of a more liberal and very prominent section of the Anglican movement (Lord Burghley, Leicester, etc.), who favored the leaders of the Congregational movement, and who with the Anglican movement went forth to obtain refreshment for it (3-5;). One class sought by ecclesiastical, the other by secular means to find the needed refreshment (6;). The liberal section came in contact with Barrowe, Greenwood and certain of their colaborers, mainly while these were in prison for their faith's sake, and under questioning (7), found them to be new-creaturely members of the Congregational movement, and were told to make them known as such to the Anglican movement (8;). The liberal party demurred, thinking it would injure them with the Anglican movement (9;), protesting earnestly against its inimical attitude toward the Congregational movement (10, 11;) and claiming that the Congregational movement, shifting its lines of thought, would expose them to evil from the former movement (12;). These liberals testified of their care for the Congregational movement, as well as for the Baptists, as against the Anglican Church working through Elizabeth's ire, e.g., Burghley's repeatedly securing Browne's release from prison, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (13;). Nevertheless, by the aid of these the new creatures and the Anglican movements met, especially in the persons of Barrowe, Greenwood and other imprisoned new creatures who insisted on confessing their faith in the pertinent Bible teaching (14-16;).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) The Anglican movement at their meeting accused them of disturbing God's people (17) , which charge was thrust back into their teeth with proofs of the truth of the counter charge (18;). The attitude of these new creatures was a challenge to the Anglican movement to bring into debate with them the power-grasping and lording Anglican hierarchy and clergy</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and those of them who stood for the union of state and church, who were supported by the Anglican Church, headed by Elizabeth (19;). This was, therefore, done by the Anglican movement (20;). The new creatures called for a decision on the part of the people as to the Bible organization of its Church or the hierarchical organization of the Church of England, but the public did not respond either way (21;). Then they called attention to their few numbers and the large numbers of the hierarchy, their clergy and followers (22;). Further, they suggested that each side through their respective sacrificial service demonstrate whether the hierarchical or the Congregational position on church government is right (23, 24;). They deferred to the other side as the more numerous one, who should sacrifice first (25;). The defenders of Episcopacy, therefore, proceeded to set forth, especially in writing, their views, the chief writers being Drs. Bancroft, Hooker, Saravia and Bilson, as a cry that hierarchism might be proven the prevailer, but no response came, though they eamestiy busied themselves about their church (26). The Congregational new creatures by act derided them with the indifferent and unresponsive attitude of their principle of power-grasping and lording (27). Their more or less mutual contradictions lacerated them to their great injury (28;). They continued their discussion for a number of years, but to no avail (29;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) The Congregational new creatures lovingly appealed to the people to be in spirit near them, and then refuted the error, and set forth the truth on the true Church (30;). Then taking twelve truths in harmony with God's real people (31;) , they by these gathered the true Church in God's name, and set forth the Word, in a large measure, full of Truth on the false church and the true Church (32;). They arranged well the pertinent truths and made large sacrifices, including the surrender of their liberty and going to prison for their faith in the Word, laying down especially four truths: (1) justification, and (2) consecration, showing that not English citizenship, but justification and consecration were necessary for membership in the Church, (3) Christ, and not the State in the Sovereign, is the head of the Church, and (4) the Bible alone is the determiner of the faith of the Church (33;). This was done, as charged, three times: (1) by the Browne movement, (2) by the Barrowe movement and (3) by the Ainsworth movement (34;). Those truths filled the true Church and the beliefs of the brethren (35;). Then these new creatures began their sacrifice, partly by writings; in Barrowe's and Greenwoods case it was done, first, by their writing tracts in prison, smuggling these out one page at a time through visitors daily, and sending them to Holland, and, second, by defending the Truth in their examination by the Church of England prelates and scholars; and their efforts were a prayer to God to demonstrate their being His mouthpieces (36;), and that the people recognize that the Lord is God in truth, and thus be converted to Him (37).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(33) God manifested His accepting their sacrifice in using for His purposes the sacrifice, the Bible passage, truths and historical testimonies and practices (38;). This convinced an ever-increasing number of people who reverenced and acknowledged Jehovah (39;). Then the new creatures called for an all-round refutation of the defenders of hierarchism and clericalism, which by the Word was done (40;). Furthermore, they invited the Anglican movement to refresh itself; for there was evidence of preparation to issue truth literature (41;). This was done while the new creatures ascended to the sphere of prayer for a downpour of truth (42;). They encouraged their supporters to seek evidence of such approach of truth, and found it only after a sevenfold search performed by their supporters in the movements of the seven churches that they had founded. It was only after the seventh movement was formed that the evidence, first small, but ever</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">enlarging, appeared, when they charged these to tell the Anglican movement to prepare their organization to escape the downpour (43, 44;). The downpour came in the form of books and tracts; and the Anglican movement fled before it, the new creatures leading the way by the Truth, to their condition of union of church and state, which had its highest expression in Elizabeth as English sovereign and head of the Anglican Church (45, 46;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) The Anglican movement reported to the Anglican Church, especially to Elizabeth, its head, what the Lord's mouthpiece had done, especially how he refuted with the Truth her hierarchy and clergy (1 K. 19: 1;). Angered, Elizabeth and the Anglican Church set into operation the instruments of persecution, causing Barr owe, Greenwood, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to be hanged for denying her royal supremacy in the Church, imprisoning some others, and exiling still others, and, finally, exiling all who were imprisoned (2;). This course made the other members of the Lord's mouthpiece flee into isolation, some to Scotland, but most of them to Holland, where a liberal government gave them refuge, and where they separated themselves at the well of truth from every little sectarian movement of the seven congregations that confessed Congregationalism (3;). Journeying still further in their isolation, they under the civil protection of Holland fell into much melancholy and desired to give up their office as mouthpiece (4;). While these were asleep as to the real condition, the Lord's messenger, first, Johnson, second, Ainsworth, aroused them into vigorous action in Holland, where they issued to the British authority an important statement on their faith, strengthened in this by Ainsworth's teaching and preaching (5-8;). This enabled them to stand their hard journey to the completion of their task of maintaining the organization of the embryo Church intact (9;). Their hard plight, as well as their words, spoke their discouragement, believing themselves alone and desolate (10;). The Lord</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">gave them to foresee great theological fights, revolutions and anarchy coming upon the second Anglican movement, and after that a better time (11, 12;). This made these new creatures look into matters more openly in the exercise of their office powers; and in their discouraged condition their words and attitude again told the Lord of their zeal and of the disloyalty of the people, the overthrow of the Church and the cutting off of the Lord's mouthpieces (13, 14;). By His providence the Lord indicated that they should mingle among the Puritans, train certain younger new-creaturely. leaders to take up their work, stir up the Puritans to fight the Anglican movement and some of its supporters to rebel against it, which three things would thoroughly refute the Anglican movement (15-17), the Lord assuring them that there were faithful ones in England who had not grasped for power and lorded it over God's people, nor supported such (18;). Mingling with the members of various denominations, particularly with the Presbyterians (Puritans), they found immature new creatures, and joined them with themselves, and by that association they let them partake with them in their office powers (19;). Some selfishness and worldliness held these immature ones back for awhile, which drew from the faithful a needed rebuke (20;). Renewing their consecration, and benefiting the people, they followed the mature new creatures, ministering to them (21;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) The two long theological controversies that the second Anglican movement had with the Puritans (Presbyterians) are typed in 1 Kings 20. The first of these was from 1583 to 1586, in which the Puritans sought by argument, Parliamentary acts and influential people in the government to set aside: (1) the Anglican hierarchy and to establish Presbyterianism in its stead, (2) the Book of Common Prayer and to substitute for it the Book of Discipline written by the Puritan leaders, Cartwright and Travers, and (3) the 39 Articles of religion and to substitute Calvinism in their</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">stead. The second of these controversies, begun by the Martin Mar-prelate controversy, was from 1588 to 1593, both controversies ending in failure for the Puritans. We will briefly describe each one of these as typed in 1 Kings 20. Presbyterianism, which in contrast with the second Anglican movement was radical, while the latter was conservative, mustered all its warriors, including 32 special leader movements, with their teachings and organizations, and attacked the Anglican movement, especially through the House of Commons and some of the leaders in the government (1). They sent word to the Anglican movement politically that by right they had the Divine Truth and the Anglican movement's organizations and leading members on their side (2, 3). Overawed to find that the bulk of the members of the Anglican Church and their organizations had by the Puritan methods of boring from within been won over to their side, the Anglican movement was ready to succumb (4). But when the Puritans wanted to set aside the Episcopate, the Prayer Book and the 39 Articles and substitute their Presbyterian system, discipline and creed for them (5, 6), the Anglican movement called its leaders, the two archbishops, especially Whitgift, Archbishop of Canterbury, the primate of all England, their bishops and leading clergy and professors, telling them what concessions it made (7); these advised it strongly to deny all concessions, except those offered before (8). This answer the Anglican movement gave to the Puritan party (9). Angered at this answer, the Puritan party threatened to bring, its immense following in clergy and laity, its majority in the House of Commons and its supporters in the government and universities against the Anglican movement (10). Their pride moved the Anglican party to answer, by act rather than by word, that before victory it behooved no one to boast of it (11). This message moved the Puritan party, feasting with its leader movements, to charge that they open up the controversy, by literary works, sermons, lectures and ordinances introduced into a Puritanmajority Parliament that would have set aside the three above-mentioned things and introduced the three Puritan substitutes therefore (12).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(36) At this juncture certain teaching members of the Anglican movement, led by Archbishop Whitgift, through their resolute and confident stand encouraged the movement with the prospects of certain victory (13), assuring them that the leaders of the nobility, with Elizabeth as their head, would be the ones to effect victory, and that the movement as a whole should take up the aggressive (14). Under the lead of the archbishop it, accordingly, did the following: The archbishop went to Elizabeth and moved her to forbid the House of Commons to pass the legislation which its majority favored passing, and to give as her reason that the tricky legislation that they were about to pass was unconstitutional, since it would nullify her royal supremacy in the church and change the national religion. She also sent word to the House of Lords that if the Commons should pass the legislation, they should reject it and read the Commons a much needed lesson. Overawed by the Queen, Commons dared not pass the ordinance, and it was certainly given a severe reprimand by the House of Lords. The Council, the most powerful body in the kingdom, was on the Puritans' side and sought to discipline Whitgift for some of his official acts; but as they were busy-bodying in his matters the Queen curtly silenced them, for she supported him in everything, having unbounded confidence in him. In spite of every effort of the Puritans against the Anglican movement, they were defeated on all fronts of the fight by the Queen and the nobility, backed by most of her cabinet members and the conforming clergy and laity. The new Parliament turned against the Puritans and their cause was lost (15-19). New measures were enacted that put to flight the remaining efforts of the Puritans, whose ministers were forced to vow loyalty to the Episcopate, the Prayer Book and the 39 Articles, or lose their places. Thus the Puritan movement was crushed temporarily, and forced from the field very greatly discredited, with their principles repudiated and their organizations overthrown by the full weight of the Anglican movement's attack (20, 21). But the teaching members of the Anglican movement, knowing the character of the Puritan adherents, encouraged the Anglican movement to strengthen its position and act with great circumspection; for they said that as soon as they could recuperate the Puritans would return to the conflict (22). This the Anglican movement did along all lines, i.e., with the Queen, her cabinet, the nobility, the House of Commons, the universities, the hierarchy, the clergy and the laity, unto readiness.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) The second onslaught against the second Anglican movement was begun and carried forward by the Puritans, first, through a series of anonymous booklets, printed by presses that they had to move from place to place to evade the searching officers, and entitled, Martin's Mar-prelate, and later, by sober literary products. The former were gotten up as satires on Anglicanism in the forms of dialogues in which a number of persons spoke their parts. They were filled with disparaging, yea, even scurrilous personalities against the Anglican hierarchy and clergy and their supporters, and gave rise to a new form of English literature-satire. These were first answered almost as effectively by the Anglicans in the same vein, and later by learned discussions, including the ablest treatises on Episcopacy in itself and in its contrast with Presbyterianism ever issued. Bancroft, Saravia, Bilson and especially Hooker were the main warriors for the Anglican movement; and Hooker's Laws of the Ecclesiastical Polity is the finest example of English prose ever produced. In prose he is the equal of Shakespeare in poetry. Of course the Puritans produced sober treatises, too, in this battle; but they were overmatched. However, it was a case of error fighting error, and the abler champions of error were on the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Anglican side; and they were, accordingly, victorious in the fight. These general remarks will prepare us for the details typed in vs. 23-30. The leaders of the Puritans said that in an encounter that involves the civil powers, the power of the Anglican movement was too much for them, but in a merely intellectual battle among the common people they could overcome the Anglican movement (23). Hence they counseled the Puritans as a body to enter a literary debate with the Anglican movement, setting aside their statesmen favorers and putting their theological debaters into the fiay (24), with all their doctrines and organizations restored to the battle line, by which they promised them victory. This counsel was accepted and acted upon (25). The Puritan party mustered its forces for what they supposed to be certain victory and took a powerful position (26). The Martin Mar-prelate booklets then set in their appearance. This aroused the Anglican movement to muster its few fighters as against the many on the other side (27). The faithful in this movement, as the Lord's mouthpiece, assured it that as the Puritans had said that the Anglican movement could hold its grounds only by the civil powers, it would be proved that in argument it would more than defeat them by God's power (28).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) There were preliminary attacks by satirical booklets on the Anglican movement by individual Puritan writers, but the real fight set in with the appearance of the first of the Martin Mar-prelate booklets entitled, The Epistle. Its tone was sharp, its exposures of the evils of certain bishops and higher clergy were most damaging, and its satire most devastating. A second shortly afterward appeared, entitled, The Epitome, which was even more damaging than the Epistle. The authorship of the Martin Mar-prelate booklets is unknown, but there were a number of writers who cooperated thereon. Almost at the same time as the Epitome appeared the first answer to the Epistle by a Mr. Nash appeared. Thereafter in quick succession the two sides assailed one another, and that satirically, but the satire of the Martin Mar-prelate booklets was severer, keener and deadlier. Each side had much of damaging facts against the other; for the bulk of the clergy and leaders of both sides were far from being saints; but when the conflict changed from the satirical and personal to the scholarly and doctrinal, the Anglican side, having abler mouthpieces, won an overwhelming victory (29). The remnant of the Puritan fighters, fleeing to their fortress on presbyters as against bishops, found that under the blows of the Anglican movement's writers, its powers fell; for they refuted still others; and the Puritans sought refuge in secret works (30).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) Some of its representatives suggested that they humbly ask from the Anglican movement for concessions permitting Puritanism to survive, which suggestion was accepted (31); and these in an humble attitude asked for such concessions. Anxious for peace, the Anglican movement expressed a fraternal concern for the Puritan movement. The messengers made the most of such fraternity, and a reconcifiation took place, (33). The Puritans promised to surrender the advantage that they had won under the first phase of the Anglican movement, and to give the Anglican movement the corresponding advantage. The Anglican movement accepted the proposal. It softened somewhat the demanded subjection to the Episcopate and made the subscription to the Prayer Book and the 39 Articles non-obligatory for renewal, which was before demanded, to those already in the ministry, but did require it of new candidates for the ministry (34). With this agreement a temporary peace was made between the two movements. Certain ones of the Lord's mouthpieces asked others of this class to treat them as partially refuted, which was refused, and the refusers were told that the nominal church would rend them, which took place (35, 36). This same group of the Anglican movement asked a Puritan mouthpiece group to do this to them, which was done unto the formers'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">wounding (37). Thereafter the first mouthpiece group disguised itself to the Anglican group and told a pertinent illustration to it, which, not seeing the application, condemned the mouthpiece group (38—40). Then the mouthpiece group revealed its real identity, which was by the Anglican movement recognized as such (41). Then the mouthpiece group pronounced the sentence of the Lord, in principle pronounced by the second Anglican movement, that because the second Anglican movement had spared the Puritan movement, the latter would refute it (42), which saddened and displeased the second Anglican movement in its dealings in church and state (43).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(40) The English Congregationalists, Separatists, as they were then called for their separation from the union of state and church, had a sphere of activity all their own, but close to the office functions of the second Anglican movement (1 K. 21: 1). Their sphere of activity, separation from the state church, the Anglican movement desired to take from them and offered them, instead, incorporation into the state church, or special privileges otherwise (2). But the Separatists declined to give up their separatism, believing it to be the one given them by the Lord in the original constitution of the Church (3). This saddened and displeased the Anglican movement, which betook itself to its creed, became disgruntled and would accept no refreshment (4). Its complaints, voiced through its leaders, particularly Archbishop Whitgift of Canterbury and Bishop Aylmer of London, reached the Anglican Church headed by Elizabeth, which and who inquired for the reason of its indisposition (5). It answered as indicated above in the explanation of v. 2 (6). They encouraged it to resume its former refreshment and cheer, promising to take the privilege of separation away from the Separatists and to give it into the second Anglican movement's power (7). Through the proper officials they caused word to go out to the leaders and officials in church and state to appoint a time of self-mortification</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">in the state church for the spread of nonconformity, to single out the Separatists for special prominence as the worst pertinent offenders, and to make the state and ecclesiastical leaders witness against them as heretics against God and rebels against the second Anglican movement, and then, depriving them of their rights, as blasphemers and rebels, to hurl their teachings against them unto their cutting off (9, 10). The officials did as commanded (11).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(41) They appointed a period of self-mortification in view of the disorders in state and church, and put the Separatists into the place of prominence by the unfavorable publicity given them (12). And, true enough, the state and ecclesiastical leaders appeared as witnesses against them as heretics and rebels, and they were condemned as the former by the highest church court, Whitgift and Aylmer being their chief condemners therein, and as the latter by the civil court, the two chief justices being their chief condemners therein. The processes and hearings were numerous for the individually accused ones, but the upshot of it all, the persecution from beginning to end lasting in its imprisonment phase from 1582 to 1597, was Browne's being imprisoned 32 times, six being hanged,, including Barrowe, Greenwood and Penry, the first a barrister and the second and third ex-Anglican clergymen, hundreds being imprisoned, among whom at least 26 died from prison severities, and hundreds being exiled to Holland, etc., and some as Pilgrim fathers leaving England and Holland for Massachusetts. Indeed, all others of them were by law sentenced to exile. Public sentiment, contrary to the hierarchy's ordinance introduced into Parliament, would not allow more hangings; and therefore, emptying the prisons, Parliament decreed their banishment. Frances Johnson, first the pastor of the London, and afterwards of the Amsterdam Separatists, seems to be the last released from jail, in 1597, after four years' incarceration (13).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) When the Anglican Church headed by Elizabeth learned of the persecution of these, it told the second Anglican movement to take control of the privileges of the Separatists, whose persecution, they assured it, was a reality that cut them entirely off (14, 15). At this news the Anglican movement advanced to take possession of their privileges (16). The principles of the Lord's Word charged the faithful new creatures to face, by literary products, the Anglican movement, which was mixed up in politics, in its taking possession of the privileges of the Separatists (17, 18). These principles suggested that the faithful new creatures remind it of its cutting off of the Separatists and possessing itself of their sphere of activity. The forecasts of the Word moved them to announce to the Anglican movement that in the sphere of persecution, where sectarians took away the life powers of the Separatists, would sectarians take away the life powers of the Anglican movement (19). It demanded of the faithful new creatures as its enemies whether they had arrived at a Biblical knowledge of it;' and it was told that such was the case, and that because it had for a price given itself to do evil in matters related to God (20). Then they announced the Lord's judgment of destruction against it and its immediate successors and descendants, whether bound or free (21), that God would do with the phases of the Anglican movement as He had done with the two phases of the Lutheran movement and the two phases of the Calvinistic movement, and that for its God-provoking wickedness and for making its adherents do evil (22). Furthermore, that sectarians would devour all the policies, powers, arrangements, clergy, hierarchy, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> that the Anglican Church headed by Elizabeth had established in the state church (23), that sectarians would devour all of the offspring of the Anglican movement that would remain in its state church, and that revolutionists would do that for those of them who would leave it (24). Of all the less favored movements of the Protestant people of God, none did so wickedly as the second</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">phase of the Anglican movement, and that from 1579 to 1600, stirred up thereto by the Anglican Church headed by Elizabeth (25). It did especially wickedly in various forms of evils, after the manner of the sins of pride, so contrary to the ways of God's real people (26). These rebukes had a corrective effect upon the second Anglican movement, which repented of its course and amended its ways (27). From the Word the faithful new creatures observed this repentance and amendment, and from it they learned that the Lord would delay the execution of the threatened punishment until the end of the Anglican movement's fourth phase (28, 29).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(43) There were two controversies involving the Anglican movement after the controversy that it had on Episcopacy versus Presbyterianism: One was on Calvinistic predestinarianism, in which the dispute was mainly among themselves, in which the Calvinistic theory, held by the Puritans and Separatists, as well as by one side in the Anglican movement, was decidedly worsted. Hence it cannot be typed by the war of Ahab and Jehoshaphat against the Syrians in 1 Kings 22; 2 Chro. 18. The other was the Sabbath controversy. In this controversy the Anglican movement, antitypical Ahab, and the Congregational movement, antitypical Jehoshaphat, took the liberal side and the Puritans (Presbyterians), antitypical Ben-Hadad, took the strict or radical side, applying to Sunday all that the Old Testament applies to the Jewish Sabbath. Previous to this controversy Sunday was generally regarded as a day whose morning should be devoted to church attendance and the rest of the day to worldly sports, business, feasting and pleasure. In 1595 a Puritan divine, a Dr. Bound, wrote a book advocating a strict keeping of Sunday after the manner of the Jewish Sabbath, whose commands and prohibitions he applied as obligatory for Sunday as the alleged place-taker for Christians of the Jewish Sabbath. Shortly thereafter several other Puritan divines published books advocating</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the same ideas. In 1597 Dr. Rogers in the preface of his book on the 39 Articles threw out a caution that this &quot;new view&quot; was doubtless being advocated to reflect upon the church holidays (taken over from Rome). But a couple of years passed before the matter broke out as a controversy, which by the Spring of 1600 resulted in a defeat of the defenders of the prevalent loose views of Sunday observance and the triumph of the Sabbatarians. It is this controversy that is typed in 1 Kings 22 and 2 Chro. 18, which will be set forth.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(44) The controversy on Episcopalism and Presbyterianism tapered to an end from 1594 to 1596; and the Sabbath controversy lasted about a year, from the Spring of 1599 to that of 1600 (1 K. 22: 1). The Congregational movement possessed much Truth on church government and much honor through its brave stand amid persecution, which resulted in Parliament's abolishing the death penalty and imprisonment against its advocates, though still banishing them (2 C. 18: 1). In 1599, agreeing with the Anglican movement on Sunday's not being the Sabbath, and thus not obligatory upon Christians in the sense of the Jewish Sabbath's being obligatory on the Jews, the Congregational movement joined the former against the Puritans (Presbyterians) on the subject (2; 2). This agreement influenced the Anglican movement to show its specially favored attention and desire for its cooperation to wrest through the Sabbath controversy the place of preeminence from the Puritan Presbyterians, which these had taken from it, and which it claimed for itself (3; 2). It, therefore, proposed to the Congregational movement that it join it in the pertinent controversy, which the Congregational movement agreed to do (4; 3). More careful to carry out the Lord's will than the Anglican movement, the Congregational movement proposed that they learn the Lord's present will on the subject (5; 4). The Anglican movement gathered its numerous mouthpieces to inquire what they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">considered the Lord's will thereon to be. These encouraged it to enter the controversy, promising it that the Lord would give it victory (6; 5). Still hesitating, the Congregational movement inquired whether there were not a class of mouthpieces who recognizedly spoke in harmony with the Lord's principles (7; 6). The Anglican movement replied that there was one such group of Anglican movement brethren, which it disliked, because it never spoke well, but always evil of the Anglican movement. The former remonstrated with the latter for such sentiments (8; 7). Thereupon the Anglican movement sent for this class to be brought quickly (9; 8). These two movements in their full authority came before the public in political respects; and all the mouthpieces were thus speaking on their affairs (10; 9). One set of these mouthpieces as advisers presented strong arguments for the two movements' position and assured the Anglican movement that thereby they would be able utterly to overthrow the Sabbatarianism of the Puritan Presbyterians (11; 10). This view all the other mouthpiece groups corroborated (12; 11). Those sent to bring the Truthspeaking class told it how all the other mouthpieces foretold prosperity and suggested that it do the same (13; 12). This mouthpiece ,group solemnly answered that only according to the principles of the Lord's Word would it speak (14; 13).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(45) On its coming into contact with the Anglican movement, the latter asked whether it should struggle for the preeminence on the Sabbath question or not, and, if so, whether it would be successful, to which questions this mouthpiece group gave an ironical and sarcastic answer implying the opposite thought of what a non-ironical and non-sarcastic answer would convey (15; 14). In doubt as to the import of the answer, the Anglican movement remonstrated that it had often solemnly to demand from it a true answer according to the principles of the Word (16; 15). Dropping its irony and sarcasm, it foretold a crushing defeat that would result in the death of the second phase of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Anglican movement, leaving the Anglicans on the pertinent subject without a leader, with the principles of the Word implying that they would have no real teacher thereon, and that the Anglicans would give up the fight on the Sabbath question (17: 16). On hearing this answer the Anglican movement appealed to the Congregational movement to witness that it had foretold, not a prosperous, but a calamitous answer and outcome (18; 17). This mouthpiece then declared that it had seen a set of circumstances manipulated by the Lord (19; 18) whereby God's course showed that He desired to take the supposedly wise Anglican movement in its own craftiness (Job 5: 13) , which circumstances, so manipulated, appealed for someone to inveigle the Anglican movement into the fatal step of fighting for preeminence with the Puritan Presbyterians on the Sabbath.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(46) Some of these circumstances suggested certain, and some, other courses (20; 19). One of these circumstances suggested a specially deceitful course (21; 20). It was Divinely manipulated to indicate that it would impress the various sets of the Anglican movement's mouthpieces with the thought of certain victory for it; God's favoring this circumstance foretold by act that the ruse would be successful (22; 21). Then, the Truth-speaking mouthpiece declared that the Lord's providences suggested to the false prophets a deception as true, but that in truth the principles of the Word forecast calamities upon the Anglican movement (23; 22). Thereupon the boldest group of the false mouthpieces denounced the true one, challenging it to prove that the Truth went from the smiter to the smitten one (24; 23). The latter answered that when the coming defeat would drive the former to hide itself in shameful confusion, it would see how it was (25; 24). Indignant, the Anglican movement charged that the true mouthpiece be handed over to corrective officers (26; 25) and by them be restrained and disciplined with rigor until it would return in triumph (27; 26).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">To this the true mouthpiece answered that if it would return in victory in the Sabbath controversy, the Lord would not have spoken by that mouthpiece; and this statement it called upon all to note (28; 27).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(47) Thereupon the Anglican and Separatist movements undertook the campaign to gain the position of preeminence on the Sabbath question, a subject on which both sides were in more or less error, though there was less truth thereon with the Puritan Presbyterians than with the other two movements. It was here the old story of one extreme of error fighting another extreme of error, with the truth lying between them forgotten (29; 28). The Anglican movement proposed that it would hide its real pertinent thoughts, and' that the Separatist movement express its real pertinent thoughts, which was done (30; 29). The Presbyterian movement, desiring to defeat the Anglican movement, and not caring so much about the relatively small-numbered Congregational movement, charged its champions to fight against the Anglican movement only (31; 30). Thus they entered the controversy, in which the Separatists expressing their real sentiments, were taken to be the Anglican movement, and the Presbyterians, concentrating on these, soon put them to such distress and expressions of distress as betrayed their real nature, whereby the Lord helped them and moved their attackers to cease their attacks on them (32, 33; 31, 32). A group among the Puritan Presbyterians by hit-and-miss methods struck the Anglican movement in a vulnerable part of its armor— the view that Sunday was the same kind of a day as any of the other festivals of the church year, e.g., like a saint's day, on which after service every kind of worldly sports, competitions, pleasures, business, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> could properly be indulged. Feeling this blow keenly, it asked that the managers of its organization take it out of the ftay, pleading by its condition that in the argument it was sorely smitten (34; 33).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(48) The controversy increased in intensity and the Anglican movement set itself firmly in its organization until April, 1600, when it gave up in complete defeat and its vitality oozed out even unto the lowest adherents of its organization (35;34). The Anglicans and Separatists by that time were so completely worsted in the controversy, that immediately thereafter the latter accepted the Presbyterians' pertinent position and the Anglicans were more or less driven to a certain kind of compliance, the result being that the British people are the strictest Sunday observers of all peoples (36). Thus the Anglican movement gave up on the main phases of the question, and was brought over to political questions and there entered oblivion on the subject (37). The Anglican organization had to be purged from the death evidences of the second phase of the Anglican movement; and sectarians appropriated these evidences by the aid of the teachings with which the state churches sought to purge their defilements (38). All this was in fulfilment of the Lord's word against the most wicked phase of the less favored movements of the Protestant people of God. The Anglican and other historians have accurately described the history of this movement, as well as the powerful system that it built and its dioceses. So ended the second phase of the Anglican movement; it was succeeded by the third phase of that movement, which had to do with the subject of ecclesiastical versus civil courts (39, 40).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(49) The Separatist or Congregational movement, after the Sabbath controversy, returned to its own sphere of service (2 C. 19: 1). But the Lord's mouthpiece in it gave it a strong rebuke for its siding with the hitherto most wicked phase of the less favored movements among the Protestant people of God, and told it that the Lord was displeased with it (2). But praise tempered the dispraise, because it had rejected the union of state and church with its main evils, and because it had faithfully set its heart to become one with the Lord (3). This movement remained in its stewardship doctrine, Congregationalism, and sought to convert to its truth all that it could, from the faithful new creatures to the adherents of the Episcopal Church, and succeeded in so doing with increasing numbers (4). It arranged with more or less error the servants of the local ecclesias as follows: (1) pastors, (2) teachers, (3) ruling elders, (4) deacons, (5) helpers and (6) widows (5), enjoining upon them great carefulness as to themselves and the brethren and to exercise their offices not for man, but for God, who would support them in right and Truth (5, 6). It exhorted them to have reverence for God and to exercise it, since iniquity, partiality and bribery do not prevail in the Lord's affairs (7). Moreover, this movement arranged that the various ecclesias could hold conferences through pastor, teacher, and elder representatives sent by each ecclesia, so that each ecclesia might be helped by the collective wisdom of all, given as advice, not by compulsion, in doctrine and practice, especially on controverted subjects. This done, they returned to each ecclesia as a complete thing in itself (8).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(50) Such servants of the brethren were by it exhorted to act in harmony with their consecration faithfully and single-heartedly (9). It told such servants that in all cases of controversy among the ecclesias on matters affecting brethren and brethren personally and on matters of practice and practice, doctrine and doctrine, they should warn the brethren not to be guilty against God, else wrath would come upon them and upon their brethren, and that by so doing the guilt of unfaithfulness would not attach itself to them (10). It also charged that the pastors were their chief servants in the Lord and that the elders were to rule in the concerns of the ecclesias. (This was the corruption of the stewardship truth that Henry Barrowe as a crown-lost leader introduced, whereby he sought to blend Presbyterianism and Congregationalism, against the teaching of Robert Browne, whose pertinent teachings were pure Congregationalism.) It also commended the lesser officers to the brethren, as well as exhorted to courage, with the assurance that God would be with the good (11). During this time Romanism had no chief movement in Britain; it had the mere shadow of a movement secretly led and inefficient (1 K. 22: 47). During this time (1600-1602) the Congregational movement approached the third phase of the Anglican movement, which was very wicked (44; 2 C. 20: 35); and the latter offered to cooperate in making certain groups of scholars seek Divine matters in joint study (48; 36). For this the Congregational movement was denounced by one of the new-creaturely companies and told that this cooperative effort would fail, and that the Lord would destroy its works. This occurred through the learned ones, especially at Oxford and Cambridge, whereby these groups of scholars were unable to make the mental journeys necessary to get the real Divine matters (2 C. 20: 37). This occurred after the Congregational movement refused to accept the scholars of the third phase of the Anglican movement into study groups (1 K. 22: 49).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(51) The second phase of the Anglican movement ended April, 1600, and was succeeded by its third phase, which was also a power-grasping phase, especially seeking to perpetuate its power through the low and high ecclesiastical courts; but it lasted only two years (51). It continued in all the evils of the second phase of the Anglican movement, of the Anglican Church and of both of the Lutheran movements (52), especially grasping for power and lording it over God's people (53). It met with a calamity in connection with its procedure in its low courts and its Court of High Commission. These courts were marred by the same evils as they committed in the days that Romanism controlled them. They were guilty of many tricks to mulct the people of their money and to delay litigation for gain, as well as of bribery from, and favoritism to the great and of severity toward the poor.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Especially did they do evil in cases of marriage licenses, excommunications and clerical litigation. This diseased condition moved this Anglican movement to seek answer to the question as to its curability, not from the principles of the Lord's Word, but from those of self-preservation, disregardful of the proper means used thereto (2 K. 1: 2). The faithful new creatures, as God's mouthpiece, seeing through this evil course, were by the principles of God's Word aroused to expostulate against this course, demanding whether there were no God of Truth and justice among God's people, that the movement made its appeal to wrong principles and methods, as an appeal to Satan and not to God for pertinent information (3). Therefore God's new creatures, as His mouthpiece, announced that the pertinent disease would be fatal, and with this announcement they left the movement's messengers (4).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(52) These returned to the sick Anglican movement and gave the answer given them, after it had expressed its wonder at their so speedy return (5, 6). The movement inquired as to the character of their informants (7). These replied that they were well versed in the Scriptures and served their cause humbly, from which the movement inferred that they were the Lord's new creatures acting as His mouthpiece (8). Partisan warriors of the movement, especially Archbishop Whitgift and certain of his special helpers in 1601, agitated certain reforms as the quick answer to God's mouthpiece, which were in effect, a demand upon it to leave the high grounds on which it had taken its stand and to surrender to them as the movement's representatives (9). By the act of calling from the spiritual sphere refutative arguments God's mouthpiece overthrew their points (10). In January, 1602, Whitgift and his supporters offered other reforms as quick refutations of God's mouthpiece, who again by spiritual arguments refuted their attackers (11, 12). Again, ,but in an humble manner, these came, entreating that spiritual arguments no more be used, as those that refuted them</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">before, but that the practical aspects of the situation be given consideration, as needed by the critical conditions of the movement on the courts' situation (13, 14). God's mouthpiece condescended to take the lower ground, as directed by their leader, and thereon met the movement on its own grounds (15). There he gave the message of death to the movement on the question of ecclesiastical courts, because of their past and present wickedness in acting out Satan's principles in the past and seeking help from them in the present situation (16). This death set in, and was brought about, not by reforming these courts, but by litigants' obtaining prohibitions from the secular courts, which these were only too glad to grant as a curb on the ecclesiastical courts, estopping the executions of the latters' decisions (17). The historians of the Anglican Church describe this aspect of the Anglican movement (18).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(53) In 1603 (918 B.C.) after Elizabeth's death, and on the accession of James I to the English throne, in the fourth phase of the Anglican movement, 16021616 (919-905 B.C.), there arose against the Congregationalists James in autocracy, clericalist Oxford University professors and the statesmen (not Ammonites, but the Meamites, according to Ginsburg's notes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> Edomites; see 2 C. 20: 10, 22, 23), who stood for a union of state and church in a controversy on whether the exiled Congregational movement might return to England and enjoy peace and the protection of the laws (2 C. 20: 1, 2). The Congregationalist brethren tremblingly betook themselves to fasting and to prayer to the Lord (3). All Congregationalism gathered itself out of all their ecclesias and joined therein (4). The Congregational movement set itself in their midst (5) and prayed to God as universal sovereign and irresistible (6), who had hitherto enabled them to defeat all their enemies as against this sphere of the Truth and its Spirit, and who had given it to God's children for a lasting inheritance (7). These dwelt therein and built up the Church unto God's glory (8), saying that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">if controversy, punishment, error or lack of Truth would overtake them, they would appear publicly before the Church, where God's glory dwells, and pray to Him in such trouble, believing that He would hear and deliver them (9). Then they told the Lord that autocratic clericalistic professors and state and church unionistic statesmen, whom God would not permit them to molest when they came out of the kingdom of darkness, and whom they, accordingly, did not harm (10), were now in ingratitude seeking to dispossess them of the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit, their Divinely, given inheritance (11). They asked God to rule them, pleading their powerlessness, lacks as to the opposing host and their confidence in God (12).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(54) This was done in the presence of all Congregationalists in all their classes (13). Certain of the secondary leaders, deacons, animated by the Lord's Spirit, arose in their midst (14), asking for their attention and declaring the Lord's message, to the effect that they should not be terrified, since the battle was not theirs, but the Lord's (15). These encouraged them to set forth their views on the government of the ecclesias, as to what it should be and should not be for the militant Church (16). They assured them that they would not need to carry on an extended controversy, but content themselves in quietness to see the effect of their presentations of their views as a deliverance from the Lord, whose presence with them should remove all terror from them, since they were simply to go forth and present their views and trust His presence (17). This moved the Congregational movement and all Congregationalism and Congregationalists to bow in worship (18). Certain brethren, led by F. Johnson, the main pastor, and H. Ainsworth, their main teacher, prepared themselves to do the speaking and writing part of their case before the three classes of their enemies (19). These in all prepared four writings for the king, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> and went to London from Amsterdam to present their case orally and in writing. The movement itself asked the brethren's attention and exhorted the brethren to faith in God, who would build them up, and to believe in His mouthpieces, which would bring prosperity (20).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(55) With common consent it sent forth the responding messengers, whose presentations of the Word reflected credit upon God (21). These presentations resulted in the autocratic king and the Oxford professors refuting the state-and church-union statesmen, and the autocratic king and Oxford professors refuted one another after the Lord's messengers refuted the position of all three (22, 23). The faithful witnessed the defeat of their enemies and saw them defeated by one another over the statements, especially the 14 points, presented by the messengers (24). Their fourth writing, entitled, An Apology, or Defense of such True Christians as are Commonly (but unjustly) called Browneists, made spoil of their adversaries (25). They thereafter assembled in a condition of blessing; for they praised God (26). Victorious in God's sight and their own, they returned to their usual activities, though unable to obtain permission to return to England, glad that they could confess the Truth before the great ones of England, who were by it put to confusion and mutual refutation (27, 28). Their triumphant confession and its effects made a good impression on many, who recognized that God fought for them, and the result was prosperity (29, 30).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(56) It was just after the first of the fourfold verbal and literary attempts of the Congregational movement to secure permission from James I for their exiled members to return to England and to obtain for those there and the returned exiles the privilege of freedom of worship, assembly and propaganda, that a setting aside of the more uncompromising brethren from mouthpieceship and the obtaining of that office by the less uncompromising brethren was to occur (2 K. 2: 1). The four stations to which Elijah and Elisha went represent four stage in their later united ministry:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">crucial transitory experience (1) with general conditions, (2) with the true Church, (3) with the nominal church, and (4) with the disapproved British peoples. In connection with the first three the more uncompromising brethrens' course proved very trialsome to the less uncompromising brethren who yet overcame the trial; and some of the Congregationalist hangers-on forecast at the second and third stage the completion of the change as to mouthpiece ship which the less uncompromising brethren anticipated, but on which they desired that silence be kept (2-6). As these brethren while progressing toward this change approached and stood before the disapproved peoples of Britain: the king, nobility, hierarchy and liberty lovers, their course was watched by a large company of hangers-on (7). Uniring all their resources the more uncompromising brethren set forth the evils of the disapproved peoples of Britain, severely rebuked them for these evils and denounced their institutions unto destruction, which divided the disapproved peoples of Britain into (1) autocrats: king, nobility and hierarchy, and (2) the radicals: liberty-lovers and opponents of autocracy, between whom in their two kinds the new-creatures passed unhurt to experiences beyond (8). The course of the more uncompromising ones suggested to the less uncompromising ones that they ask a parting boon. Those in the latter attitude then asked for successorship as mouthpiece under condition of obedience to those in the former attitude (9). Those in the first attitude, stressing the difficulty involved in the request, assured those in the second attitude that their request would be granted, if they continued in cooperation until the change set in (10). This they did. The leader of those in the first attitude was Thomas White, and of those in the second attitude was Francis Johnson. The latter got control of the organization of the Holland Congregationalists and forced those of the other attitude into the background (11). During this change those in the second</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">attitude recognized those in the first attitude, were at first distressed at the change and at the condition of their own organization, then refused longer to recognize those of the former attitude as controlling, became guilty of many evils, as well as repudiated their subordinate position, taking the controllership that those in the first attitude let slip out of their hands (12). And with their new powers they by word and writing caustically arraigned, rebuked and condemned the disapproved peoples of Britain alienating them increasingly into the above-mentioned groups, and that under the impression that they themselves were the ones acting by right in this matter. Their arraignment, rebukes and condemnation of the peoples of Britain divided the latter more and more. Then they passed between them to other activities, more or less injured by the peoples of Britain(13, 14).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(57) The hangers-on, especially those of them who were in Holland, and who had taken their stand only as far as the third attempt at freedom from the ecclesias' difficulties, accepted these as in the controlling attitude and work; they approached these and became subject to them in their leaders (15). These in a large company proposed to make a reconciliation between those in the two attitudes and activities, fearing the former had by then office powers been too highly exalted or too deeply degraded. Their counsel was by the now controlling group rejected (16). The former continued with their urgings, until out of sheer shame the latter consented to the effort, which proved after lengthy attempts to be a failure (17). After failure they returned to the position taken in the third attempt at freedom from ecclesias' difficulties, where they found those in the second attitude, and were rebuked with the statement, Did we not tell you not to undertake it, as it would end in failure? (18). The adherents of the now controlling group told these that their sphere of activity was good; but that their &quot;teachings,&quot; despite their Scriptural proofs for each of the involved</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">14 points and a more elaborate explanation of those 14 points, made in a confession of faith to James I and his supporters were bitter and their dispositions were resultantly barren (19). This led, at the controllers' request, to the preparation of a new and milder and more Truthconforming publication; for this request was granted; and the matters were set forth in a public affair of Francis Johnson's in 1606, which, while bettering matters, left still much to be bettered, which from time to time was done (20-22). From this sphere of activity the members of the mouthpiece betook themselves to the Anglican Church, emphasizing the 14 above-mentioned points, i.e., set forth their main constructive views and the opposing views of the fourth Anglican movement in 14 articles or propositions on the real and nominal Church.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(58) Therefore undeveloped nominal-churchists greatly derided them as bereft of the Truth and its Spirit (23). This led to their studying these and to their forecasting evil things to come upon them in the Lord's name. Two groups, one of state, the other of church, shortly came out from among earth's great ones, and in controversy rent 42 dioceses in Britain with contentions (24), until 1607 (914 B.C.), when the Jehoshaphat phase of the Congregationalist movement ended. After these things they had a temporary prosperity, but just afterward they became mixed up in church politics among themselves (25); yea, from here on for a long time the Congregationalist movement, beginning with the development in Truth of John Smyth in 1607 (914 B.C.), corresponding with Jehoram of Judah's reign (914-906 B.C.) , entered into a reactionary course. Indeed, this reactionism set in as a faint beginning 8 years before and increased to a full head by the end of the first phase of the Congregationalist movement, corresponding to Jehoram's co-regency with his father Jehoshaphat 1599-1607 (922-914 B.C.). It took its rise in an attempt of the Congregationalist leaders in 1599 (922 B.C.) to enlist Dutch ecclesiastics</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">to take their side against the Anglican movement, which attempt ended in a flat failure. The second phase of the, Congregationalist movement was from 1607 to 1615 (914906 B. C: ). But before discussing it we will discuss one thing yet that belongs to its first phase, as set forth in 2 Kings 3, as well as a thing that belongs to the fourth phase of the Anglican movement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(59) All the forces of the radicals, James I and the Archbishop of Canterbury at their head, both standing for the Divine right of kings, of aristocrats and of those clergy represented especially in the episcopacy, began a siege of the conservatives, especially in the domain of state and church politics. They put into operation a series of arbitrary acts tending to crush the conservatives in state and church. By their active support and the insistence of the king and Convocation, the highest legislative body in the Anglican Church, they did two things: (1) passed a series of 161 canons, divided into 13 chapters, many of which canons were passed legally by Parliament years before, but some of which were new and actually never received Parliamentary sanction, and thus are not a part of the English Church law; and (2) they required all clergymen to subscribe to them and what they sanctioned, e. g., the 39 Articles, the Book of Common Prayer and Apostolic Succession, certain papal ceremonies, etc., and that with their souls' full approval, which put a test of conscience on the Puritans, many of whom were conservatives, by which course the archbishop secured the ousting of 300— &quot;deprived&quot; 300—of such clergymen from their churches; and hundreds of others resigned before they could be ousted. Additionally, the Court of High Commission arbitrarily sought to push its ecclesiastical jurisdiction beyond its sphere of authority against the conservatives. All of this is typed by the siege of Samaria (2 Kings 6: 24).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(60) These measures reduced the conservatives in the sphere of state and church politics to great stress, in which there was the sorest kind of a famine in state and church rights in teaching edifying matters (25). The conservative party in state and the conservative party in church in their desperation entered into deals with each other for their mutual preservation, in which deals, after the latter had made their promised sacrifices, the former refused to make theirs, a thing that the aggrieved party brought to the conservatives as a whole, greatly distressed as it was in the exercise of its powers (26-29). This horrified these to such a degree as to expose its deep mourning over the situation as it was exercising its power (30). This angered it at God's mouthpiece that had encouraged the conservatives to resist the radicals (31). God's mouthpiece was at that time attending to their work with all their leading brethren before them. The conservatives sent a messenger to bring the threat of expulsion against God's mouthpiece, but before he arrived God's mouthpiece declared to the leaders before them that the descendant of the saint-disfellowshipping second Anglican movement was intent on their disfellowshipment, but they charged their auditors to give no access to such, assuring them that the party as a whole was taking action against them (32). Immediately thereafter the messenger of the conservative party came, whereupon God's mouthpiece recognized this misfortune as being providential, and as indicating that they should no longer withhold the Lord's pertinent message (33), which was to the effect that very shortly the famine of rights would end in an abundance of them easily obtained by all (2 K. 7: 1).</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">(61) But the executive committee upon which the conservatives depended to carry out its measures doubted the word of God's mouthpiece, denying that even Divine power could effect this change, to which the latter replied that it would see this, but not enjoy its fruitage (2). In prominent places were certain fence-straddling crown-lost members of Parliament, of the judiciary, of the deprived clergy and of followers</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of God's mouthpiece, very much distressed by the crisis in which they found themselves, debating over their situation which would bring them to a cutting off from their places, if persisted in (3). Furthermore, they reasoned that if they allied themselves outrightly with the conservatives they would lose their still possessed but diminished privileges, and that if they continued in their present fence-straddling position they would also be cut off. Hence they determined to fall away to the radicals, concluding that the worst that could from these happen to them was a refusal to receive them, whereas they stood a chance to be accepted by these (4). In their uncertainty they assayed to join themselves to the radicals, but when they came to the position of those who were nearest their own position, they found them to have abandoned it (5). The reason was that the Lord had caused to come to them the news of many organizations and teachings of the Parliamentary, judicial, conservative and independent parties working against them, which caused the radicals to think that all the fearful of all parties and all in harmony with British secular affairs had come to the relief of the conservatives (6).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(62) It happened as follows: In Nov., 1610 (911 B.C.) Bancroft, the very radical Archbishop of Canterbury and the Anglican primate, died and was succeeded by the Puritan Abbot, who largely reversed the radical policies of Bancroft. Furthermore, the judiciary and Parliament deprived the Court of High Commission of all its power, except in purely' ecclesiastical matters, and even in these so curbed its power as to give it liberty only in dealing with heresy by imprisonment or death, whereas before it dealt with anything that had an ecclesiastical aspect e. g., marriage, inheritances. In 570 cases the courts set aside the radical decisions of the Court of High Commission, which very greatly compromised its assumed prerogatives. Parliament came to the aid of the judiciary, dissanctioning the radical autocracy of the king in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">state and church and of the radical episcopacy in the church, and demanded the reinstatement of the deprived clergy. Among other things, to the king's great disliking, it caused Dr. Cowel to be imprisoned, as advocating things contrary to the British Constitution in his book, The Interpreter, which advocated the propositions that the king was above the law and that he could void it and acts of Parliament at his pleasure, views that the whole radical ecclesiastical party sanctioned. It also caused his book to be suppressed. It continually opposed the autocratic arbitrariness of the king and the bishops. Public sentiment was greatly aroused against the radicals, because the Court of High Commission at the king's insistence, through the connivance of certain hand-picked radical judges, caused several heretics to be publicly burned for their heresy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(63) All of this, and more too, frightened the radicals, as typedin v. 6; and thereupon they beat a general retreat from advocating their spheres of work, doctrines and principles; in a word, gave up pressing their radical positions and prerogatives into practice, and fled from practicing their radical views in fear of their official lives (7). The fencestraddling crown-losers in their four groups began to enter one position after another, taking as booty the unused and forsaken prerogatives; for they at first made only selfish use of these (8). But they, conscience-stricken, saw through their selfishness and, acknowledging their wrong, decided to break the good news to all the conservatives, 'also fearing that if their course were to become known, they would suffer for it; therefore they resolved to break the news to the members of the conservative party (9). Hence each one told the leaders of his own individual group, declaring that they had come to the position of the radicals and found no defender of it, no advocacy of it, but each doctrine and principle and sphere of activity standing in its place (11). As one man they encouraged the leaders to make the news known to the members of their several conservative parties. The conservatives in their ignorance of the situation suspected a stratagem as being worked against them to inveigle them from their position that they might be overwhelmed outside their defenses; and they told their suspicions to one another (12). But the leaders counseled that of the principles of the British Constitution still remaining with them, five be used to test the condition. These five principles were the inviolability of the Constitution, Parliament as the sole law-making body in Britain, the judiciary as the sole interpreter of the law, the king and his cabinet as the executives of Parliaments laws and the competence of Parliament, concerning British matters, to discuss any subject, a thing that the king denied so far as his matters were concerned, most other principles of the British Constitution having, with their advocates, been crushed (13). Thereupon a committee of Parliament and one of the judiciary with pertinent teachings were sent out to investigate the report of the radicals' retreat (14).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(64) Their investigations disclosed the fact that it was apparent even to the most depraved peoples of Britain that the radicals had fled from their positions; and strewn about all the way were scattered the prerogatives and principles cast away, so far as advocating them was concerned, in their flight by radicals; and this news was by the investigators brought back to the conservatives (15). Therefore the conservatives went forth and took advantage of the defense-abandoned position of the radicals to improve their own position. In the parliamentary elections of 1614 (907 B.C.) almost every supporter of the radicals was defeated; and the new Commons met in a very belligerent mood toward the autocratic power-grasping king and episcopacy. This settled the questions at dispute, so far as the votes of Britain were concerned—they had completely rejected the radicalism of the king and the bishops, the thing here typed. This was the beginning of the end of the pertinent struggle, which as it went</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">forward resulted more and more favorably until the former radicals were utterly defeated in 1646 (875 B.C.) in state and church (16); and this made the conservatives' rights normally maintained and used in great abundance, as the Lord had through His mouthpiece declared would be the case. To secure the inculcation of their principles, the conservatives in their four divisions appointed their fourfold executives to supervise the public operation of this educational work; but the British people, now turned conservative on the questions, took this matter into their own hands as advocates and displaced these executives from their pertinent office, and thus fulfilled the pertinent forecast of God's mouthpiece made when the conservatives came to them to cut them off (17). Vs. 18, 19 are a repetition of vs. 1, 2, made in connection with their fulfilment, hence their antitypes were given above in the explanation of vs. 1,2 and will not be repeated.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(65) God's mouthpiece had told their supporters in the Congregationalist movement, in which they had aroused a public movement, that the Lord had determined that there would be a destitution of rights and privileges unto a completion in the sphere of their teachings and its spirit, and that they should seek a refuge (2 K. 8: 1). Accordingly, such supporters and all they had betook themselves into a sectarian condition until such destitution should come to an end (2), which occurred as the radicals beat a retreat from their domineering over the conservatives in state and church, when the supporters of God's mouthpiece came back from their sectarian position and petitioned the conservatives for a restoration of themselves and their sphere of teaching and its practice (3). At the time of their petitioning Francis Johnson was also engaged in negotiations with the conservatives, who requested him to recount to them some of the great deeds of God's mouthpiece (4). And just at the juncture of his recital of how they had aroused among their supporters into activity a movement toward the public from its</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">deadness, those supporters among whom this movement was from deadness aroused to life petitioned for the restoration of themselves and their sphere of teaching and its practice, which occasioned Francis Johnson to tell the conservatives that the petitioners and their movement were the supporters of God's mouthpiece, and that their movement was the one that from deadness was by God's mouthpiece aroused to energetic activity (5). Thereupon the conservatives asked these supporters of God's mouthpiece about this event and were by them assured that the thing was true; whereupon the conservatives charged the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Puritan Abbot, and through him his fellow bishops to, grant to these the restoration of themselves and their sphere of teaching and practice plus all the benefits that had accrued since they were deprived of these (6).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(66) Now a change came in the picture as it is related by the antitypical Syrians. The Catholic party, consisted of two classes in England at that time: a milder and a stricter class. The former were the Anglo-Catholics in so far as they have been hitherto described (7), and the latter were a more fanatical class, the Roman Catholics. The former were led by an Oxford University Professor, William Laud, who later became, first, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, then of London, and in 1633, the Archbishop of Canterbury. This milder class was somewhat like the Anglo-Catholics of the present time, but in principles and practices further than these away from the Roman Catholics, with whom the present Anglo-Catholics seek reunion, but are kept back therefrom by the doctrine of the pope's supremacy and infallibility. The milder class of Catholics had heard that God's mouthpiece- was occupied, especially in thought, with the Anglo-Catholic and Roman Catholic principles. It was during the primacy of Archbishops Abbott (16111633) and Laud (1633-1640) that the power of the milder Anglo-Catholic party gradually sickened and weakened, and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">at the same time that of the Roman Catholics began secretly, stealthily and gradually to increase, through the intrigues of James I and Charles I. The sickened milder Catholics, learning that those new creatures who actually were God's mouthpiece, but whom they recognized as faithful Christians, were occupied more or less with the radicals, sent some of the more rigid of these by their writings, with courteous exhibitions of amity to inquire of them as to whether they might recover from their increasing loss of power and influence (8). With testful servility, natural to the radicals, these Roman Catholics approached by their writings God's mouthpiece and delivered their inquiry on behalf of the Anglo-Catholics, as if the latter were of the same class as God's mouthpiece (9). While God's mouthpiece through their- writings told the Romanists to tell the milder Catholics that they might recover their power and influence, they, nevertheless, assured the Romanists that the milder party, would utterly lose its power and influence, which would be gained by the Romanist party (10).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(67) God's mouthpiece then fixedly held before the Romanists this knowledge of the situation until they became ashamed, but the knowledge of God's mouthpiece as to what they under the secret lead, first, of James I and then of Charles I, and finally of Charles II, and the open lead of the Romanist James II would do to the Anglican Church party greatly distressed them (11). This distress prompted the Romanists to inquire as to its cause. The former replied that they knew the evils that the latter would heap upon the Anglican Church party, i.e., overthrow their strong positions, refute their warriors, wreck the faith of the weak and destroy violently the fiuit of their labors (12). This statement surprised the rigid radicals (Romanists) in their secret royal allies, who held themselves incapable to do such enormous works. But they were assured by God's mouthpiece through their writings that God had made them understand that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the rigid radicals would become the dominant party of the radicals, yea, that all the radicals would become rigid (13). Leaving God's mouthpiece in their writings, they returned to the weakened mild radicals, who inquired as to what God's mouthpiece had said. The rigid radicals answered that God's mouthpiece had declared that the sick mild radicals would surely recover their strength (14). But the Romanists were intent on suppressing the ascendancy of the Anglo-Catholics. Under the secret lead of James I and Charles I' the secret struggle of the Romanist movement began against the Anglo-Catholic movement, and set into operation the smothering of it unto death (15). Here the remark is to be made that it is to be remembered that the types usually mark the beginnings of the antitypes, just as prophecies usually mark the beginnings of their fulfillments. This principle, among other things, works throughout the 2520 years' parallels, e. g., if we would not apply this principle to the events of the Jehu reign (905-875 B.C.) in relation to the Puritan revolution (1616-1646) against the Anglican Church movement and its struggles against the Romanist (radical) movement, we could not construe the pertinent parallels; for the fourth Anglican Church movement changes from the conservative wing of it into the whole Anglican Church movement, i.e., it includes the low, high and broad Anglican Church movements as the later antitype of Jehoram of Israel, whose death at the beginning of Jehu's revolution types the outcome of the Puritan revolution (1616-1646).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(68) A reactionary Congregationalist movement was in the ascendancy from 1607 to 1615 (914-906 B.C.), beginning with the moving of the first contingent of the Scrooby ecclesia in England to Holland in 1607, the rest of this ecclesia moving there in 1608, with its pastor, John Robinson, who was the main leader in this reactionary movement. This movement had six related movements, each existing in a separate ecclesia, i.e., the four ecclesias at Amsterdam respectively presided in by Thomas White, John Smyth, Francis Johnson</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and Henry Ainsworth, the original church at London and one in western England, from which Thomas White and others of its members emigrated to Holland (8: 16; 21: 2). The purer. Congregationalist movement, as well as their separate ecclesia bodies, had blessed each of these six ecclesias with many gifts of knowledge and grace; but the chief position was yielded to the movement whose leader was John Robinson, because it was the chief of the seven movements (; 3). The acts of the benevolent Congregationalist movement, its first phase, its constructive and refutative powers, are described by Congregationalist and non-Congregationalist historians (1 K. 22: 45; 2 C. 20: 34). It was as an ascendant movement put to an end in 1607 (914 B.C.) and has been kept in memory as one of Little Flock origination (50; 2 C. 21: 1). But after reactionary Congregationalism came into the ascendancy it cut off the other six kindred Congregational movements by withdrawing fellowship from them, as well as cut off the leaders of the Baptist movement from fellowship (; 4). This reactionary Congregationalist movement was quite mature when it came to the ascendancy and passed through an eightfold set of experiences (2 K. 8: 17; 5). But it was marred by sectarianism and clericalism and some autocracy, and reactionarily did some fellowshipping with the spirit of the Anglican Low Church party, even to the extent of advising its followers to attend the ministry of these and the Dutch National Church, with the result that it did evil before the Lord (18; 6). Yet the Lord spared this movement from eclipse; because it in respect to Congregationalism did better than most of the other six movements that it disfellowshipped; and thus God did according to His promise to the Little Flock, for it was a light in the true Church (19; 7).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(69) The oppressed Armenians, who opposedits Calvinism, rebelled against reactionary Congregationalism and, making a leader over themselves, fought against it (20; 8). But it invaded the sphere of Arminianism with its leaders, especially John Robinson, and its organizations, and secretly attacked these, who had put it at a disadvantage, and whom it defeated in the debate (21; 9). Yet the Armenians continued to maintain their freedom against it; and at the same time certain enlightened priests turned against it for its wrong-doings (22; 10). Under John Robinson's lead this reactionary Congregationalist movement sanctioned and cooperated with various sects, like the Church of England and the Dutch Reformed Church, and encouraged its members to fellowship with these sects and their sectarian ministries and members (; 11). While so engaged there came to it a book of Robert Browne, the Little Flock star-member who started the Congregational movement, setting forth the true pertinent doctrine and chastising the very sins that reactionary Congregationalism was committing, rebuking it for departing from the pure and benevolent Congregationalist movement and from the good ways of the Unitarian movement (; 12), for practicing sectarianism and clericalism, for encouraging the brethren to fellowship with harlot sects and for disfellowshipping the other six Congregationalist movements in the other six leading Congregationalist Churches (; 13). Then this book of Robert Browne announced God's judgment on their apostacy: a plague of error on its adherents, its converts, its arrangements and its teachings (; 14), and a disease upon the movement itself that would make it disintegrate internally by a long-drawn-out process (; 15).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(70) This was fulfilled by sectarians from the outside and traitors from the inside attacking them (; 16). These came against the reactionary Congregationalist movement's sphere of teaching and spirit, taking away its attainments, its converts and its arrangements, leaving it with but one policy, autocracy (; 17). Then internal troubles beset it (; 18). And after a lingering disease, due to their desire to escape</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">from the social conditions in Holland, this reactionary form of Congregationalism through loss of its vital powers ceased to have the ascendancy among Congregationalists, which policy was not held in honor among God's real people (; 19), nor was it any more desired by them after passing through its eight stage. Its deeds are recorded by Congregationalist historians (23). It ended as a movement that had some Little Flock aspects, but failed to be a real Little Flock movement (24; 20). It was succeeded by even a worse movement—autocratic Congregationalism, which co-reigned a while with it and which was spared by the traitors in its midst, while the Anglicans were yet in power, who became the antitype of Jehoram of Israel in the changed aspect of his later years (24, 25; 9: 29; 2 C. 22: 1). This autocratic Congregational movement was a fairly developed movement before it came into the ascendancy and it worked on only one line autocracy. It showed its origin to be of the Low Anglican movement; for its spirit was such as in its Athaliah aspect it agreed to accept episcopacy, in order to get the privilege of a character from James I for those of its members who would migrate to America as pilgrims (26: 2; by a copyist's mistake Ahaziah was said in; 2 to be 42 at his accession, whereas he was 22, as given in 26; 42 would have made him 2 years older than his father). The Anglican party was its adviser; and it acted autocratically, to its ruin (27; 3, 4). Following their advice, it cooperated with the Anglican Church party in its fight with the rigid Romanist (Hazael) party for power preeminence (28; 5). In this fight the Anglican Church movement through the double dealings of James I was given with Romanists many reverses (28), from which it sought convalescence from its own Church. It was at this juncture that autocratic Congregationalism joined forces with those of the Anglican Church movement to assist it in its recovery and to fight with it against the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Romanist party as antitypical Hazael working secretly with James I and later with Charles I (29: 6).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(71) The end of the third phase of the Anglican movement has already been discussed. The co-regency of the third phase and the fourth phase, which was contemporaneous with that of the third phase, was from 1600 to, 1602 (921 to 919 B.C.), and during the last named year the sole existence of the fourth phase set in; and it lasted until 1616 - (919-905 B.C.) , 14 years. It started in the year 20 of the first phase of the Congregationalist movement and in the second year of the co-regency of its first and second phase (1602 [919 B.C.]; 2 K. 1: 17; 3: 1). While the fourth Anglican phase did evil, it was not so bad as its second phase, nor as the Anglican Church headed by Elizabeth; for it modified considerably their power-grasping and lording, i.e., their absolutism (2); yet it. served sectarianism and clericalism, the besetting sins of the less favored movements of the Protestant people of God, and persisted therein (3). In Britain the autocracy of the papacy had been subject for years to that of the first and second and even the third phases of the Anglican movement; but in the latter's fourth phase the papacy, through some of its British members, rebelled against the fourth phase (4, 5; 2 K. 1: 1). This rebellion reached its height in the infamous Gunpowder Plot, whereby the Romanist autocratic hierarchy sought to blot out the entire royal family, nobility and Commons (when King James I, accompanied by his entire family and other close relatives, was to open Parliament) by exploding in a vault under the hall where all were to be assembled many barrels of gunpowder. The guilty Guy Fawkes, caught in the vault with matches in his pockets, under rack torture confessed the plot and its conspirators. This, of course, unleashed a great controversy between the fourth Anglican movement, whose chief warriors were Bishop Andrews and Dean Field, the Congregationalist movement and the secular rulers of Britain, on the one side, and Romanist</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">apologists, especially Bellarmine, Rome's greatest controversialist, and Stapleton, on the other side. To this controversy the fourth Anglican movement, using politics, called all its adherents (6). It also asked the Congregationalist movement to be on its side against Rome. To this it willingly consented (7). The latter asked as to the plan of procedure, and the former answered, along statesmanly lines (8). Hence the controversy involved the royal as against the papal power, the Anglican and Congregational and the statesmen, including the king, controverting along that line, and the debating powers of Bellarmine put their supporters to great distress (9).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(72) The Anglican movement fell into despair, thinking all three of the groups were doomed by God to defeat at the hands of autocratic Rome (10). But the Congregationalist movement inquired for a mouthpiece of God, to inquire of the Lord for counsel; and a group of the Anglican movement called attention to the now controlling mouthpiece as well acquainted with God's Word as disciples of the best leaders of the Congregationalist movement (11). Thus all three groups of controversialists went to them for counsel (12). This mouthpiece severely snubbed and reproved with sarcasm the Anglican movement, telling it to get its counsels from the mouthpieces of its autocratic predecessor and the Anglican Church headed by Queen Elizabeth, to which it demurred, expressing its despair that all three cooperaring parties were doomed (13). For the evils of the Anglican movement the Lord's mouthpiece most solemnly asserted by the God whose mouthpiece they were that they would have no regard for, or recognition of the Anglican movement, were it not for their regard for the Congregationalist movement (14). Nevertheless, it called for the Bible that then was undergoing translation into the A. V., and from it at God's enlightenment drew forth teachings against Rome full of refreshment for the Truth-thirsty coming without the ordinary avenues therefore (15-17).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">This would be easy for the Lord, they told them, and added that God would deliver to their power the autocratic papists (18) , promising them that they would refute their every strong choice teaching and overthrow their every leading representative and all their fundamental writings and make barren their every field of activity in Britain (19).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(73) Shortly thereafter there came new truths from the statesmen for their refreshment (20). The Romanist warriors, on learning of the attack planned against them, had rushed to the defense of their views (21). When they saw the start of the new truths coming to their enemies on account of the Bible's light shining upon them, they thought them to be harbingers of strife and overthrowal among the three confederate groups and exhorted one another to fly to the spoil (22, 23). But instead of spoil they found resourceful warriors awaiting them, who, falling upon them, put them to flight, during which the three confederate groups made spirited pursuing attacks and invaded the positions of the pursued (24). Here they refuted their doctrines and made their teachings barren. They overthrew their literary sources, refuted their leading controversialists and exposed the rise of the papacy, leaving only the primitive doctrines intact, but with questions made these useless for the papacy (25). Seeing that the battle was going against it, the papacy, marshalling its chief warriors, made a determined attack upon the statesman group of the three confederates, especially assailing the defense by James I of the Divine right of kings, on which he wrote a book, to overthrow it, but failed (26). Thereupon they sacrificed their chief defenders in power. Great was the wrath of the papal party at the controversy's outcome; and, it ending in victory for the confederates, the latter desisted from further fighting of the papacy, and returned to their work (27).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(74) The episode of 2 Kings 4: 1-7 is connected with 'the fourth statement that the Congregationalist exiles made of their faith to James 1. As the first three petitions that accompanied their first three statements of faith failed, and after their fourth statement, which was a fair-sized book, was prepared, the Congregationalist churches in England were greatly saddened at their being cut off from their exiled leaders and at the prospect of their consecrated and justified adherents' being greatly oppressed in England by the repressive attitude of the government, and, therefore, poured out their plaints to the Lord's mouthpiece (2 K. 4: 1). On the latters' asking them what they had in the way of satisfying the king, they replied that he had assured some of the former petitioners that he was willing to receive any truth of God, and that all should preserve and be allowed to preserve the same -attitude (2). Thereupon these advised that these churches secure as many names in England as possible to petitions to the king, asking him to allow the Congregationalists living in England to have their leaders restored to them from their exile (cut-off condition) in Holland (3). These further advised that secretly there be added to these petitions the request that these churches be allowed to enjoy freedom of assembly, worship and propaganda, setting aside each full petition so added to (4). This these churches did, assisted by their consecrated and justified adherents (5). But desiring more petitions, they asked their two kinds of adherents for more. These answered that, having gone over the ground thoroughly, they could get no more, which ended that work (6). These then told the Lord's mouthpiece what had been done, who told them to present these to the king, which was done. While he would not ask Parliament to change the law, he did arrange for a milder enforcement thereof. As a result the Congregationalists in England were not so severely molested as formerly (7).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(75) While engaged in labors among the consecrated and justified certain new-creaturely leaders as God's mouthpieces found support among the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Congregationalists (8), who secured from their leaders permission to give them special help (9-11). These mouthpieces of God asked their leading helper, Francis Johnson, to gather these Congregationalist brethren into assemblies, which was done (12). They expressed appreciation for the kind support that they received from these, and asked what return they might make, suggesting appeal for them to the Anglican movement and its leaders, which they declined (13). Still wondering what to do for them, they were told by Francis Johnson that they had no concerted work toward outsiders, and that their leaders were without the zeal to arouse them thereto (14). Again God's mouthpiece to the public asked him to assemble them, to which they gave a ready response (15). Thereupon it promised them a movement toward the public, which announcement they received with incredulity (16). Yet the mouthpiece's forecast was fulfilled (17). But this movement's activities met with setbacks from the civil powers, while it was trying to gather into the Congregationalists' fold members from the English public, and soon came to an end, despite the Congregationalists' efforts to preserve it (18-20). They lay this movement on the teachings of God's mouthpiece as in secret (21), and asked their leaders for a helper and a teaching that would assist them to lay their case before God's mouthpiece (22).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(76) Their leaders, seeing no reason for such a step, objected mildly, which was overcome by a reassuring answer (23). Thereupon they prepared the pertinent teaching and asked the furnished helper to make rapid progress to God's public mouthpiece (24), and thus approached them, while they were fruitfully engaged. Seeing these afar, they pointed them out to Francis Johnson (25), whom they charged to approach them, inquiring as to them, their leaders and their movement, To these inquiries these said that all was well (26). Their humble attitude influenced Francis Johnson to attempt to repel them, but the mouthpiece forbade this,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">recognizing that there was something troubling them concealed from them by God (27). Their sorrow could express itself only in saying that the movement, now dead, had not been asked for by them, and that they be not deceived by too bright hopes (28). They then commissioned Francis Johnson to go without delay and exercise his office for the resuscitation of the dead public movement (29). The Congregationalists did not trust F. Johnson to accomplish this, hence solemnly besought the Lord's mouthpiece to go with them, which they consented to do (30). F. Johnson failed in his efforts and reported the failure to God's mouthpiece (31). The mouthpiece gave their attention to the dead movement resting upon their teachings (32). Secretly they labored for its resuscitation (33), applying to it their whole beings, teachings, perceptive powers and energies, and worked with it to arouse it into activity (34). They continued this course repeatedly, until the movement began to give evidence of life and insight (35). Thereupon they had F. Johnson assemble the Congregationalists and presented the movement to them in activity (36). These humbly expressed their gratitude and accepted their resuscitated movement (37).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(77) God's mouthpiece returned to the subject of the Church as God's embryo kingdom; and there was a famine of Truth, no new truth having come to the Congregationalists since Robert Browne's ministry among them. In fact, Henry Barrowe, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> had corrupted the pure Congregationalism of Browne into a hybrid by mixing it with Presbyterianism. This made the hangers-on look to God's mouthpiece for spiritual food, who called for the presentation of the Word as spiritual food (38). A group among the Congregationalists taught the error that, since God's people are to have a watch-care over one another, they should consider one another to point out one another's faults to the end that, seeing these, each one might put them aside. They did not, at first, realize the evil of such a course (39).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">But the acting out of this evil produced evil-surmising, fault-finding, recrimination, quarrelling, self-justification, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> which demonstrated the poisonous effect of this evil practice (40). They, complaining of this evil to God's mouthpiece, who asked that the true teaching on the pertinent subject be brought forward, which being done, he mingled it with their general truths and charged that it be given the brethren, who found it wholesome (41). Attention has already been called to Bro. Thomas White as the leader of the more uncompromising brethren who were pushed into the background by the less uncompromising brethren under F. Johnson's lead. Another leader of the former kind, John Smyth, later discredited by sectarian Congregationalists because of continued advancement in the developing Truth, differed from the new-creaturely brethren among the Anglicans, the Puritans and the Congregationalists, from whom he and kindred spirits had separated. In 1607 he gave out a pertinent booklet entitled, Differences of the Churches of the Separation, friendly to God's public mouthpiece and adapted to correct evils among the brethren, circulating it especially among associates of F. Johnson. This booklet God's mouthpiece charged to be given to these (42); but F. Johnson sought to prevent their reading it, a year later writing a specious answer to it. However, the mouthpiece overruled him, declaring that it was for them to accept what they could approve and reject what they disapproved (43; 1 Thes. 5: 21). This resulted in their reading it, accepting some parts and rejecting other parts of it (44).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(78) Among the Congregationalist brethren there were at first two parties: a radical and a conservative party, and later a party more or less associated with the latter yet somewhat different. The radical group was too rough in its victorious controversies with the Anglicans, Puritans and Romanists, and its leading warriors had thereby contaminated themselves with crown-lost uncleanness (2 K. 5: 1). These radicals made inroads on the sphere of the conservatives, and won for themselves some of the latters' adherents, who served the supporters of the leading radical controversialists (2). These thought and said that God's public mouthpiece, who sided with the conservative Congregationalists, could recover them from the uncleanness that made them abhorrent to the public (3). This statement of these converts to radicalism came, through certain controversialists, to the ears of the radicals, who felt the handicap under which those labored with the public (4). Thereupon the radicals commissioned them to go to the conservatives, sending along a pertinent communication. Thereafter these leading controversialists went, taking along crown-losers with full powers and authority, mingled with some evils (5) , and delivered the communication to the conservatives, asking for the healing of the controversialists from the uncleanness that made them abhorrent to the Anglicans, Puritans and Romanists (6). The conservatives, who for a long time had had all sorts of differences with the radicals, construed the radicals' request as an attempt to provoke controversy between them, doing violence to their graces, protesting that, not being God, they could not effect such a cleansing, and calling upon their supporters to 'note the episode as a trick to provoke strife (7).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(79) But God's public mouthpiece, Ainsworth, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> hearing of the acts of the conservatives, sent word rebuking them for their misconduct and requested that the leading controversialists be sent to them, from whom they would learn that God had a mouthpiece among the conservatives (8). These leading controversialists, with their teachings and church organizations, came before the office functions of God's mouthpiece, brethren like Ainsworth, who held themselves somewhat aloof from the former (9). They told them by a messenger to mingle completely in teaching ways in a friendly and sympathetic spirit with the Anglicans, Puritans and Romanists, and a healing of the faults</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that neutralized their usefulness would set in (10). These leading controversialists, e. g., brethren like Robinson, Johnson, etc., felt offended because the Lord's mouthpiece did not make much ado over them and honor them (11) , exclaiming that the more and less radical groups were more to be considered than the public among the Anglicans, Puritans and Romanists; why not, by mingling among the former, be cleansed? Hence they went away in a rage (12). But some of their supporters reasoned respectfully and tactfully with them, showing them that if the Lord's mouthpiece had asked them to do something difficult, they would have done it; why, therefore, not do this easy thing (13) ? Persuaded, they mingled in a friendly way with the Anglican, Puritan and Romanist public unto a completion; and the promised healing set in, taking all the roughness away from them and making them winsome (14).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(80) Recovered, they returned with their whole company to God's mouthpiece and confessed their faith in the true God of perfect wisdom, love, justice, and power as alone the God of antitypical Israel, and with this confession offered the place of chief power and authority among God's people to His mouthpiece (15). As a true mouthpiece of God, they solemnly, and that against repeated entreaty, refused the reward that the leading controversialists offered them (16). Refused, they asked for some of the sphere of the Truth and of its Spirit as a portion on which they may sacrifice to spiritual Israel's God alone (17). Then these controversialists asked whether they might not with God's forgiving long-suffering give the radicals among the Congregationalists some support in their sacrifices to the god of radicalism (18). This was compromisingly allowed them; and with a, God Bless You, they were sent away (19). But Francis Johnson, who was indeed a power-grasper and lord over God's heritage, saw how he could derive personal gain in power out of the situation (20). Accordingly, he sought the controversial</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">leaders, who, seeing his desire to meet them, approached him, inquiring, if all was well (21). Giving them an affirmative assurance, he said that God's mouthpiece sent for assistance for the pastors and teachers as confirming their power and for the elders and deacons as confirming their authority in the ecclesia (22) [Among the Congregationalists the officers of the ecclesias were supposedly of four classes: (1) pastors, (2) teachers, (3) elders and (4) deacons; whereas we consider the first three to be names for one kind of officers, elders],</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(81) The controversial leaders insisted on what were in reality one' class: the pastors, teachers and elders, getting even double the single power asked, i.e., control over the deacons, as well as over the ecclesias, requiring two sets of their supporters to help deliver the pertinent power and authority (23). But by intrigue F. Johnson manipulated matters so that finally he got the main power in the ecclesia (24). Thereafter he was called in question by God's mouthpiece, Ainsworth, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> and falsified as to his activities, denying that he had been engaged in anything of intrigue (25). Then God's mouthpiece let him know that they knew and, therefore, were saddened at what he had done in intrigue for power-grasping and lording over God's heritage, declaring that at such crucial times it was especially out of order for God's servants to grasp for power, to lord it over God's heritage and to covet controllership over the working spheres of crown-retainers and of crown-losers, over these two kinds of brethren and over the serving brothers and sisters (26). Then they declared that the uncleanness of the controversial leaders would perpetually be upon him and his main supporters in power-grasping and lording. And F. Johnson left their presence leprous with perpetual uncleanness (27).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(82) The unpromising work that the hangers-on did moved them to appeal to God's mouthpiece, Ainsworth, Robinson, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to leave off their pertinent work, which through persecution became too hard for them, and to undertake among the public another work, in which each one, using his human all, might prosper in the work. These were told by God's mouthpiece to undertake it (2 K. 6: 1, 2); but the former desired the latter to partake in that new work, which they agreed to do (3). They as a company got out a book entitled, The Confession of the Exiled Anglican Brethren, which somewhat later fell under the ban of the government and was prohibited from circulation, which very greatly circumscribed its spread. This caused them great distress, as the loss of a thing not theirs but put into their custody for a while (4, 5). Ainsworth, Robinson, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., </span><span class="font3">were appealed to, to restore it to its former circulation. At their request they were told of the circumstances and state of its banned condition. Thereupon they set forth a teaching on the right of God's truth to freedom of circulation; and as a result the Confession was reissued with certain revisions and additions (6); and it circulated in several language in 1607 (914 B.C.) , after Ainsworth, etc., had encouraged them to lay hold on it and circulate it again (7).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(83) In the Anglican Church at this time there were three parties: first, the radicals, the High Church or Anglo-Catholic party, who in their radicalism exalted the king, the nobility and the episcopate with the doctrine of the Divine right of kings, aristocracy and bishops. These, in the picture now to be studied, correspond to the king of the Syrians; second, the conservatives with whom the first party in that Church warred. The second or conservative party was the Low Church, or Evangelical party, which corresponds to the king of Israel (8); third, the Puritans, who sided with the Low Church party in its conflicts with the High Church party, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> sided with the conservatives against the radicals. The radical party had as its champions James 1, the episcopate and most of the higher clergy and nobility, as well as many of the university professors. Apart from these, there were God's mouthpiece, new</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">creatures, particularly, but not exclusively those in the Congregational movement (9). The radicals decided to attack the conservatives on the question of the Divine right of kings (8), but God's mouthpiece cautioned the latter against this as putting in opposition to them James 1, who as shown above held a literary debate with Bellarmine on the subject of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> Divine right. On exploring this question the conservatives avoided the trap set for them (10); as, warned by God's mouthpiece, they also avoided the trap from the standpoint of the Divine right of the clergy and aristocracy; for the radicals bound it up with that of the Divine right of kings. Many moves were made in this matter by the radicals in Convocation and the king's court; but these were sidestepped by the conservatives, who generally were supported by the House of Commons and the courts, which successfully counteracted the moves of the radicals. These evasions of the radicals' traps not only troubled the latter, but made them suspect treachery in their own ranks (11). But certain members of the radical party, denying the charge, blamed God's mouthpiece, the new creatures, some in Holland, like Ainsworth, Robinson, etc., and some in Britain, as giving the conservatives the Truth on the three Divine-right doctrines, enabling them to evade the argument traps, even the most hidden ones, of the radicals (12). Whereupon the radicals charged their main advocates to investigate the position of God's mouthpiece, that the radicals might capture these in their views. Thereupon, they were informed that these stood on the double teachings of the Old and New Testaments (13).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(84) This prompted the radicals to send secretly a great array of their leading scholars with accompanying teachings and organizations against God's mouthpiece, surrounding them in their Old and New Testaments' position (14). Francis Johnson early recognized the purpose of these scholars in attacking this position with all their teachings and organizations; and, greatly fearing and lamenting, and unable to understand how to cope with the situation, he cried out for help to God's mouthpiece (15): In full faith these, telling him to quiet his fears, and assuring him that those on their side were more numerous than those on the other side (16), prayed the Lord to open his eyes of understanding to perceive the real situation. The latter thereupon saw that, not only the Lord and His holy angels and people, but also that under sore trial the House of Commons, the judiciary, the conservatives and the bulk of Englishmen were throughout the kingdom on the side of God's mouthpiece (17). When the learned advocates of the radicals came directly against the Lord's mouthpiece the latter prayed to God to blind them as to their theories by the Biblical Truth used against their position, which the Lord did (18). They pointed out that their Biblical points were inapplicable to the situation, and convinced them that their position was not provable from the Bible, but promised them that if they would follow them they would bring them to see in the true light the men whom they sought. These consenting to their arguments, they brought them to the conservatives' pertinent position as its convinced captives (19).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(85) God's mouthpiece then prayed that by the legal and religious arguments of the conservatives, in so far as they involved God's mouthpiece, the radicals might be given a proper understanding of the applicable principles, which the Lord granted, by enabling them to prove that the Divine rightists in all three of their pertinent positions were legally and religiously wrong, which enabled them to see that they were captives in the power of the conservatives' position (20). Seeing their advantage, the conservatives emphatically requested God's mouthpiece for permission utterly to overthrow the arguments of the radicals' advocates (21). While it was God's mouthpiece's arguments that had captured the former, tactfully the latter spoke as though it was those of the conservatives, who, they said, should play the part of a magnanimous host in refreshing their argument-convinced opponents (22).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Thereupon the conservatives gave them a pertinent mental feast that avoided the controversial aspects of the involved questions, which still more convinced the radicals' advocates of the correctness of the conservatives' position. This done, they sent these back to the radicals; and that ended such advocates' entering controversially the position of the conservatives (23). While among the Congregationalists the chief members of God's mouthpiece were Ainsworth and Robinson, among the Anglicans the main members of God's mouthpiece were Bishop Andrews and Dean Field. The main secular members of the conservatives were Coke, the chief justice of Britain, and the leaders in the House of Commons, while Bancroft, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and most of the bishops and certain professors at Oxford and Cambridge universities were, with King James I, leaders of the radicals.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">SOME MIDDLE PARALLELS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2 KINGS 9—11: 21; 13: 1-25; 14:15, 16, 23-29; 15: 8-12;</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">JEHU. JEHOAHAZ. JEHOASH. JEROBOAM II. ZACHARIAH. ATHALIAH. JOASH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">THE AUTOCRATIC later course of the fourth phase of the Anglican movement (antitypical Jehoram of Israel), especially in the king and the episcopate, exercised through the doctrine of the Divine right of kings and clergy in theory and practice, provoked toward 1616 resentment very widely, which came to the attention of God's mouthpiece. Some of the main members of God's mouthpiece from 1616 to 1646, the period now to be discussed, were Bros. Jacobs, Bolton, Sibbs, Adams, Leighton, Burton, Bastwick, Prynne (the last four had their ears cut off and their noses slit for their opposition to autocracy in state and church), Marshall, Calamy, Milton, Goodwin, Owen, Lightfoot, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> They, therefore, decided from the principles of God's Word and the indications of the Divine providence, that the time had come to arouse, as forecast, the Puritans in their Presbyterian party, who were inclined to be revolutionists (Jehu, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">living,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">energetic one),</span><span class="font3"> to overthrow autocracy in state and church. To this end God's mouthpiece in the Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist and Congregational Churches (Elisha, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mighty deliverer,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">God is deliverance) </span><span class="font3">prepared in knowledge certain of their hangers-on for the work of such arousing; and after the preparation of these in knowledge was sufficient, they exhorted them to undertake this service, telling them to betake themselves to the sphere of power-preeminence (2 Kings 9: 1; Ramoth Gilead, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">height of the rough).</span><span class="font3"> They further told these that they were to seek out from among the groups there</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">assembled the most energetic class of Puritans, the Presbyterians (Jehu, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the living,</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">energetic one),</span><span class="font3"> that, while it was supporting the power-preeminence of the Anglican movement against the Romanist movement, was qualified to execute God's judgments (Jehoshaphat, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah judges)</span><span class="font3"> and to expose the dominant evils (Nimshi, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">exposer),</span><span class="font3"> God's mouthpiece cautioning them to work in secret with that class of Puritans (2). Moreover, they instructed these hangers-on to take the pertinent Divine knowledge, and by this qualify and arouse the pertinent class to the forecast work and to assure it that God Himself was setting it apart to become the dominant party in Britain. Finally, God's mouthpiece charged the hangers-on to depart immediately after this work was done, and for no reason to delay leaving immediately thereafter (3).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) Accordingly, these hangers-on betook themselves at once on their errand (4). By their manner and teaching they aroused the attention of the leading groups that defended the power-preeminence of the fourth Anglican movement against Romanism, and that in such a way as made the Presbyterian Puritan opposers of autocracy in state and church wonder to which one among the groups they desired to give their message. The latter assured the former that it was the one desired (5). Privacy was desired and secured for the intended preparation of the Presbyterian Puritan opposers of autocracy for their work of overthrowing it. Hence privately the hangers-on gave these Puritan opponents of autocracy the involved qualification of head and heart, assuring them that God Himself was qualifying them to be the less favored Divinely appointed movement among God's people (6). They declared further that God charged them to refute and overthrow the fourth Anglican movement, their dominators and all the peculiar institutions of the four Anglican movements; to wreak the Lord's vengeance upon the Anglican Church for its persecution of God's mouthpieces and servants (7); to destroy utterly all autocracy and autocrats and to cut off refutatively and officially from it and them—those who defile the powers of state and church and those who for this course should be restrained and forsaken, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font3"> their supporters, whom they should restrain and abandon for such support (8); for God would desolate Anglicism in its four movements from representing Him as the less favored Divine movement, just as He had done to the two Lutheran and the two Calvinistic movements as the less favored Divine movement (9), and would give the Anglican Church to be devoured by sectarians in its union of state and church, so that none would honor her in her destruction. Having thus discharged their mission, the hangers-on immediately left the scene of their pertinent activities with all speed (10). The main secular members of antitypical Jehu from 1616 to 1646 were Coke, Eliot, Hollis, Pym, Haselrig, Hampden, Vane, Cromwell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> The main religious members of antitypical Jehu were Jacobs, Prynne, Marshall, Calamy, Young, Newcomen, Spurstow, Milton, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> all very able and brave men.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) Before proceeding further it would be well if there are pointed out some facts that will help us to note better the relation of type and antitype in the study of Jehu in their chronological aspects. The chronology for the actual 30 years' reign of Jehu is 905 to 875 B.C., while the antitypical chronology in its parallels is 1616 to 1646 A. D. It will be noted that the only chronology that the Bible gives of Jehu's reign is its beginning and ending (10: 36), except, of course, the comparisons of his reign with that of Jehoahaz, which came at the end of Jehu's, and with that of Joash (12: 1; 13: 1). But to the events of Jehu's reign itself, apart from its start and end, the Bible gives no dates. This fact is important to be kept in mind, because in the antitype the revolutionary acts had only small beginnings from 1616 onward until the Long Parliament assembled, Nov. 3, 1640. These small revolutionary acts consisted of public verbal agitations</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">against autocracy in state and church made by the Puritans at each tyrannous act in church and state, especially in the former, later in protests in the courts at the same for the rights of individuals being outraged and in outcries in the parliament, whose protests led to their repeated proroguing by James I and afterwards by Charles I, both of them ruling for years without parliament's sitting, which was in gross violation of the British constitution. Since we know that Biblical prophecies and types in their chronology usually mark the beginnings of the forecast events, we can see that the above-mentioned protests are marked in the type as the antitype of Jehu's beginning his revolution, though it took 30 years for the antitype to reach the end of the revolution's full success, in April, 1646, when Charles I, utterly defeated in war by the revolutionists, surrendered to the Scots, the English revolutionists' allies, who kept him as a prisoner. This enables us to see how the great events and results of the English civil war were the outgrowths of the seed of small but growing protests as the formers' beginnings. This principle, accordingly, enables us to see how the pertinent 30 years' protests, struggles, battles and triumphs of the British patriots against the tyranny of the two Stuarts, James I and Charles I, and of the episcopate, are the parallel antitypes of Jehu's 30 years' acts as king of Israel.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) The beginning of the 30 years' revolt against Church tyranny was the public formation in London of a Congregational Church under the pastoral care of Mr. Henry Jacobs, who, exiled to Holland, returned to England and formed this Church in 1616, as a protest against the Anglican Church, whose head, the king, James I, was; and the beginning of the 30 years' revolt against state tyranny was Chief Justice Coke's refusal to set aside secular law at the king's command in 1616. The King's Book of Sports, 1618, charging the people to engage in all sorts of games Sunday afternoons, met with much Presbyterian</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Puritan opposition. His condemning the Calvinism of the Presbyterian Puritans and disfavoring them and favoring the Armenians against his former convictions increased the formers' opposition. In 1620 he </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">forbade</span><span class="font3"> parliament to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">interfere</span><span class="font3"> with his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">government</span><span class="font3"> and aroused it to a protest, which he tore out of its minutes. This tyrannous act made many turn against him in and outside of parliament, who before had no sympathy with the oppressed Presbyterian Puritans. His compromising with Romanists to gain their support connected with his negotiating a marriage between the Prince of Wales and the Spanish king's daughter, his leaving his Protestant son-in-law in the lurch in the latter's war with the papists in the Thirty Years' War and his securing a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Henrietta, the bigoted papist daughter of the French king, which resulted in many advantage to the English Romanists, and was accompanied with the usual Jesuit conspiracies in England one and all aroused opposition, while his ruling for years without parliament's meeting could not but provoke resentment among the liberty-loving English.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) Charles I, becoming king in 1625, schooled in his father's absolutism and egged on to tyranny by his Romanist wife, who constantly urged him to be an absolute king like her father, out did his father in tyranny and grossest hypocrisy and dishonesty with parliament and people, all of which met with resentment. His seeking to force parliament to sanction his violations of the constitution, his arousing the episcopacy through the Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber to persecute dissent from the Anglican Church and ritual, his having its hierarchy and clergy preach the Divine right of kings and clergy, to subdue all to him, his proroguing parliament for refusing to sanction his illegalities and for setting forth grievances against his tyranny, his supporting the tyrannies and Romanizings of the episcopate, especially of Laud, the primate, his imprisonment in the Tower of four leading members of parliament for their righteous protests, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> the great and good Eliot detained there until death, his ruling for eleven years without parliament, his permitting prominent opponents of Laudism to be mutilated and pilloried, his making England so uncomfortable for Puritans that many of the best citizens left the country, his prohibiting further exoduses of this kind, his illegal assessing of taxes, his overawing the courts to deny redress to periri oners against these exactions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Hamden's appeal, his allowing the episcopate to draw a half of chancery business into their hand, which it exercised most tyrannously, his allowing them to hold court in their own names, to form new articles of visitation and to put the examined under oath, his seeking to impose the episcopacy upon the Scotch Presbyterians with all their papistical ritualism, his raising an army to subdue them in their opposition, his baiting the long Parliament, his seeking to arrest its five leaders against his tyrannies and his making war on the long Parliament—one and all provoked great resentment against him and the episcopate, especially against its leader, Laud; and these are some of the main events that aroused the actors in the antitype of Jehu's revolution and reign. We will now trace the matter, type and antitype.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) At each of the above-mentioned tyrannies the hangers-on, at the instigation of God's mouthpiece, secretly stirred up the Presbyterian Puritans to revolutionism, and after each of such arousings the latter showed themselves to the groups who were their associates in opposition to Romanists' gaining power-preeminence in England, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Presbyterians, and later on the less loyal Congregationalists and the Baptists and parliament, the low church party in the Anglican Church and the radical liberty-lovers, e.g., Milton, Ludlow, Harrington, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> republicans, who asked whether all was prosperous and what, to them, the fanatical hangers-on desired. They denied knowing what secretively the Puritans told them that they understood</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(11). Not understanding the matter, these Presbyterians denied the Puritans' pertinent statements, whereupon the latter told them, after each of such visits and questionings, that these had told them that God was arousing them to lead a revolution (12). And at each stage of the long-drawn-out arousements to oppose the pertinent tyrannies, the abovementioned groups responded by agreeing to support the Presbyterian opponents of the involved tyranny, offering the support of their several authorities in the heights of their position, and announced by word and act that the energetic Presbyterian Puritan revolutionists were the leader in revolution against the tyranny of king and prelacy (13). Accordingly, the energetic Presbyterian Puritans as executors of God's justice and as exposers of the evils of absolutism in state and church, took counsel with their above-mentioned supporters to overthrow the fourth phase of the Anglican movement, and that at a time it and the rest of Protestants were maintaining its hold on powerpreeminence against the radical Romanists (14). So far in this conflict extreme Anglican arbitrary prelacy, the form that antitypical Jehoram had assumed toward the end of its course, had received severe setbacks through James I's blundering compromises with Romanists in England, compromises that continued for years after 1616 and that sorely wounded the prelates in their ascendancy, as did also their Romanizing tendencies, all of which inclined increasing numbers to give increasing support as time went on to the energetic Presbyterian Puritans, as they were more and more, as time went on from 1616 onward, aroused to oppose prelacy. These, recognizing that they ever increasingly received this support, required that no information of these matters be allowed to reach state and church quarters (15).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(7) Assured of sufficient support, the energetic Presbyterian Puritans with their supporters advanced revolutionarily to attack the fourth Anglican movement as it was combined with the state, and as it was,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">because of its anti-Romanist conflict, helped by the autocratic Congregationalist movement (16). Their progress in such opposition to arbitrary prelacy was noted by the latter's sentinels in state and church united, who reported what they obscurely observed. Ever suspicious, arbitrary prelacy commanded an ecclesiastical investigation to be made, to find out whether the revolting energetic Presbyterian Puritans intended to keep the peace (17). This ecclesiastical investigation was accordingly made, but the revolting energetic Presbyterian Puritans, doubting the sincerity of their question as to peace, restrained them from returning word to their senders, which fact was noted by the united state-church sentinels (18). Then a state investigation was ordered; for antitypical Jehu was active in state as well as in church matters. But this investigation resulted as the first one resulted (19). The investigations, like the other matters connected with the English revolution, were as repeatedly made as their provoking acts were repeatedly committed. Antitypical Jehoram's sentinels reported the results as the same as those of the preceding attempt, and further announced that the progress of the oncomers was like that of revolting active Presbyterian Puritans, whom they described as progressing as insane ones (20). Hearing this, arbitrary prelacy charged that their organization be made ready, which also the supporting arbitrary Congregational movement likewise did; and thus each in his separate organization went forth to oppose the enraged Presbyterian Puritans; and in the sphere and on the subject of persecution of dissenters they became involved in strife, which increasingly progressed for years after 1616 (21).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) Arbitrary prelacy as repeatedly demanded to know whether peace was intended as the Presbyterian Puritans repeatedly advanced in hostility. The latter replied that peace was impossible as long as the Anglican Church so abounded in her illicit union with the arbitrary prelacy and as long as her errors of doctrine</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and practice abounded (22). This answer was as oft given by act as the question was asked. The continuance of strife between these parties caused arbitrary prelacy to seek security by flight, at the same time accusing the Presbyterian Puritans, who also belonged under protest to the Anglican Church, of treachery before the arbitrary Congregational movement (23). Unleashing with all their might their sharp theologico-political arguments against arbitrary prelacy, the Presbyterian Puritans completely refuted the former in their organization; and as the involved 30 years progressed, they took away their powers, prerogatives and office, entirely abrogating these and those of their supporting clergy (24). The revolting Presbyterian Puritans by petitions, demands, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> asked parliament (Bidkar, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stabber),</span><span class="font3"> which increasingly during the involved 30 years, in many of its members, and in the last 5*4 years as a body, led the Puritan revolutionists in their thrusts and warfare against autocracy in church and state, to make autocratic prelacy drink the cup of oppression and persecution which they had made the purer form of Congregationalism drink, because this would be in fulfilment of the word that both of them remembered, and that was spoken by God, while they acted under the second phase of the Anglican movement, which persecuted the mouthpieces and servants of God (25); since God had declared that He had kept in mind the persecution and oppression of His saintly mouthpieces and their supporters, and that He would requite the guilty house of the oppressor and persecutor in the sphere of oppression and persecution. Hence the revolting Presbyterian Puritans requested parliament to throw these into the sphere of oppression and persecution according to the Word of God, which was done (26).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) The revolting Presbyterian Puritans dealt summarily with autocratic Congregationalism in its cooperation with autocratic prelacy, the type of which is found in vs. 27-29 and in 2 Chro. 22: 7, 9. The harmony of the two accounts will appear from our explanation of the antitype. The Lord arranged for the destruction of the autocratic phase of Congregationalism in connection with its cooperation with arbitrary prelacy against the revolting and exposing Presbyterian Puritans whom God had qualified to destroy the phases of that Anglican movement (7). Autocratic Congregationalism sought to escape from antitypical Jehu by evading responsibility for the fruitage that antitypical Ahab sought to get out of his spoils gotten from the oppressed Congregationalists. But the supporters of the exposing and revolting Presbyterian Puritans pursued them and found them involved in church politics, whence they took them and brought them to the Presbyterian Puritans; but they again escaped; and the Puritans charged their supporters to refute them, which they did while they were seeking to ascend to a strong position (Gur, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lion's whelp)</span><span class="font3"> in the presence of a united people (Ibleam, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">confluence of people).</span><span class="font3"> This refutation was a partial one, after which they continued to flee the doctrinal and practical positions of the Puritans; but the effects of the refutation became complete as the opposing forces clashed in destructive conflict (Megiddo, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">destruction).</span><span class="font3"> These were by their supporters given respect as constituting a movement of God's more favored people, but they had no power to retain their office functions after exercising that power a year (27-29; 9).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) Vs. 30-37 type the destruction of the Anglican Church, which the revolutionists began to effect, first by argument and then, second, through the Long Parliament's enactments shortly after its opening. In his desperation at the need of funds, and after ruling unconstitutionally for eleven years without it, Charles I issued a call; April 13, 1640, for it to be elected and later to meet; and it assembled Nov. 11, 1640. While the Presbyterian Puritans, by 1640 joined by the compromising Congregationalists, were fighting the doctrines and practices of the Anglican Church for years</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">before the assembling of the Long Parliament, by Charles I's support the prelates and clergy of that Church remained in power all the years previous to the assembling of the Long Parliament. But the revolutionists in church and state after the assembling of that parliament gave their special attention to the subject of union of the arbitrary prelates and the Anglican Church; and on the Anglican Church noting this fact, it tried to beauty-pari or itself as to its theories and practices into attractiveness to the revolutionists; and in this condition it took a public position to observe the revolutionists' doings (30). Perceiving their unfriendly attitude on the subject and their increasing abridgment of her powers and privileges, she sarcastically upbraided their claims of seeking by reforms to give her prosperity, by asking whether the exposers, refuters and overthrowers of their superior, the fourth Anglican movement, could have prosperity in mind for her (31). Stung by this sarcastic upbraiding, and fixing of their hostile attention upon her in her public position, they by various inimical moves emphatically asked as to who among her adherents would support them against her; for there were many of her supporters (1) in the House of Commons, (2) in the House of Lords, and (3) among her less prominent members, who, however, under the repeated exposures of her wrong-doing, gradually and increasingly, as reform measure after reform measure passed by them was opposed by her, losing confidence in her, became increasingly opposed to her, though when the Long Parliament first assembled the bulk of its members, both in Commons and Lords, were her supporters (32).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) Increasingly the revolting Presbyterian Puritans by their ever-increasing demands for the reform of the Anglican Church's abuses were favorably responded to by the Commons and the Lords and their adherents, with repressive measures that withdrew one power and privilege after another from her, hurling her down by increasing degrees from her high</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">position unto complete disruption; for in the end they not only took away from her all her special powers and privileges, deprived her bishops of the privilege of sitting in the House of Lords as lords spiritual, deprived them of their episcopal office, imprisoned all of them, took away her revenues from church property, cast out her clergy of scandalous lives, withdrew the salaries of her clergy, dissanctioned her creed (the 39 articles), abolished her liturgy, suppressed her superstitious Romanizing usage, displaced her clergy with Puritan clergy, finally dissolving the union between her and the state. Thus they hurled her down from her high estate. In her destruction she defiled the powers of the state and its laws, while the revolting Presbyterian Puritans oppressed her and committed the most debasing indignities upon her (33). Turning from their destructive work against her, the revolting Presbyterian Puritans appropriated whatever was of value in her to themselves, including her property, influence, office of teaching and preaching, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> While thus engaged they charged that, though resting under God's and man's curse, she should be disposed of with as much respect as behooved a church born from the union of the state and Romanism (34). But those who undertook to dispose of her remains found that the only things of her that remained were the memory of her creed, of her conduct and of her ministries (35). Reporting this fact to the revolting Presbyterian Puritans, the latter declared that this was in fulfilment of the forecast that the Lord made through His uncompromising mouthpiece in the days of the second phase of the Anglican movement anent its persecution of the Congregationalists at the Anglican Church's instigation, when the aforesaid mouthpiece declared that sectarians would appropriate to themselves everything belonging to the Anglican Church (except her creed, conduct and ministries) in relation to her union with the Anglican movements (36); for they forecast that everywhere in society the Anglican Church would be regarded</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as refuse anent her union with the Anglican movements, and thus none would respect her memory (37).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) The antitype of 2 Kings 9 gives us the generalities of the Puritan revolution from 1616 to 1646 in Britain, as the less favored movement of the real people of God, in overthrowing the fourth Anglican movement and the Anglican Church; and the antitype of 2 Kings 10 gives us the detail thereon and, additionally, how absolutism in state and church was overthrown; while in a subordinate way the former chapter tells of the overthrow of the more favored movement of God's real people, and the latter chapter gives a few details thereon. These details will come out briefly as we go on in our discussion of chapter 10. The most autocratic of the Anglican movements, the second of these, had developed a counterfeit of the 70 secondarily prophets, in the archbishops and bishops, on the one hand, and in the suffragan bishops, the deans and archdeacons of the Anglican Church, on the other hand, the bulk of whom were, of course, more responsible than any others for the gross abuses of power of which that and the two following Anglican movements had become guilty. These abuses became heaven-crying; and the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans gradually came to the determination to depose all of these. But they did not at first come out plainly on this subject. Rather, their conduct for years became a living and slowly written epistle to the ecclesiastical leaders in the union of the fourth Anglican movement and the Anglican Church, and especially to the leading bishops, like Laud and Williams, and leading helpers of the hierarchy and higher clergy (2 Kings 10: 1), suggesting that they set up another Anglican movement, inasmuch as they had all the organizations, teachings, ecclesiasticism and controversial materials necessary to start up such a movement (2), being sure that they select a good and just one to be enthroned, whom they should defend; for we are not to forget that the revolution at first was an agitation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">merely to reform the evils of Anglicanism, and not to overthrow it (3).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(13) But overawed by the increasing opposition of the Presbyterian Puritan leaders, seconded by the bulk of the nation; which was increasingly angered by the exposures of Anglicanism made in and out of parliament, and frightened by the overthrow of the less favored (the fourth Anglican) and the more favored (the third Congregationalist) movements of God's real people, these leaders, after their efforts at reform failed, concluded that they could no more make headway against the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans (4). Accordingly, by leaders in church and parliament, as well as in the army, they gradually became subject to the Puritan Presbyterian revolutionists, agreeing to carry out their wishes; for it was a remarkable fact of those times that some who were at first supporters of the Anglican church, hierarchy and clergy took a large part in disestablishing the church and overthrowing its hierarchy and higher clergy (5). After they had acknowledged and exercised submission to, and cooperation with the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans, the latter, not only by words and acts, but also by pertinent laws passed by parliament, in which the revolutionaries as the majority were led by men like Pym, Hollis, Vane, Hampden, Cromwell, Haselrig, Selden, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> commanded their supporters as gradually as the pertinent laws were passed, to strip the hierarchy and the higher clergy of power after power, prerogative after prerogative, possession after possession and office after office, until they were unbishoped, undeaned and unarchdeaconed and with their great ones and supporters were made subject to the revolutionists' church arrangements (6). And, peculiarly, it was the former leading supporters of these that, as required by the revolutionaries, enforced these laws, and that within the time limits set by these laws; for they forced the hierarchy and higher clergy and their great ones and supporters to come into subjection to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the new church movement then formed by the reformers into antitypical Jehu; and they were brought there in harmony with the laws that they themselves, acting in one capacity, helped to make and, acting in another, to enforce. Not only were the hierarchy and higher clergy deposed, but the bishops were dispossessed of membership in the House of Lords and were imprisoned in the Tower (7).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) Word of such treatment of the Anglican hierarchy and higher clergy reached the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans as gradually and increasingly as this treatment gradually and increasingly went on; for this was a matter that covered years until it was brought to a completion. Thereafter the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans had them set forth very publicly unto a completion as of two distinct groups, and that through the writings of Puritans, particularly through the pertinent writings of Smectymmeus (a word formed by the initials of its six authors) and of John Milton, the brightest star on the literary firmament of contemporary Britain, as well as through the writings of less prominent lights, all of whom poured out a flood of writings against prelacy and its chief supporters (8). When the task was well done in each of its parts, the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans appeared publicly in their places, attracting the attention of the whole people on the question as to who (it was especially parliament who did it—the one-time chief support of the bishops, etc.) had cut off the bishops and their higher clerical adjutants, acknowledging that they had deliberately planned the overthrow of the fourth phase of the Anglican movement, and assuring the people that they were righteous in the situation (9). Then the Presbyterian Puritans told the people that they should recognize at that time that not a word of God's uncompromising mouthpiece (spoken during and anent the second phase of the Anglican movement and the Anglican Church under Elizabeth for their persecution of the saintly Puritans, Baptists, Congregationalists</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and other independent Christians) was spoken in failure of fulfilment, and that God had fulfilled that word then spoken by His uncompromising mouthpiece, now before their very eyes (10). The Presbyterian Puritans continued their verbal and legal attacks against all the rest who stood for the second, third and fourth phases of the Anglican movement, as these were united with the Anglican Church, even the clergy, the principals of the laity, their sympathizers and their sacrificers, and continued it so long and thoroughly that there remained none of such (11).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) Then the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans turned their hostile attention to church politics, at first particularizing their attention to the part therein taken by the clergy who had been intent on fleecing the flock by tithes, fees, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (12). That the 42 brethren of Ahaziah were his cousins, as in oriental countries cousins are also called brethren, is evident from the fact that Ahaziah was the only son of Jehoram of Judah that was not slain by the Arabians (2 Chro. 21: 12; 22: 1). The supporters of the autocratic Congregationalist movement (antitypical Ahaziah) as alleged special helpers of the star-members (7 sets of these, totaling 49 brethren) are shown to be evil, but the special helpers of such (42 = 6 X 7, 6 being the number of evil and imperfection and 7 being that of the star-member sets, 7 X 7 = 49); for they acted autocratically over, and fleeced the Lord's people, being overtaken in the act by the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans, who being apprized by their acts of their unshepherdly characters, and of their purpose to prosper the supporters of the fourth Anglican movement and the Anglican Church (13) , charged that they all be shorn of all their powers, prerogatives, and offices in connection with the slanders occasioned by the clergy's covetousness, which was also done (14).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(16) Then the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans gave their special attention to the Long Parliament (Jehonadab, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is bounteous),</span><span class="font3"> which, consisting in a good part of revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans, trusting in God's bountiful help and being the manager of organized British affairs (Rechab, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">camel driver),</span><span class="font3"> after it came into session from parliament's nearly 12 years' dissolution, became the reforming power in England in matters of state and church, and in a friendly and helpful spirit approached the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans. These, constituting a large part, yea, the majority of the English people, especially of the Londoners, sought to win parliament to its side and expressed loyalty to it. Little by little and more and more parliament made a favorable response to their desires; and they pledged mutual support and cooperation. Thereafter parliament was taken by the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans into their organization (15). The latter desired the former to witness their zeal for God and God's cause; and thus unitedly these two groups worked together against the fourth Anglican movement, the Anglican Church and the autocratic king, court and army (16). On entering the sphere of church politics, they cut off every supporter of the Anglican Church, particularly those who make politics of religion, even setting aside the Book of Common Prayer, the 39 Articles and the canons of the Anglican Church—in a word, disrupted entirely the Anglican Church, its organization, officers, liturgy, creed and laws, all this in fulfilment of God's Word spoken by His uncompromising mouthpiece (17).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) We now come to the overthrow of power-grasping and lording it over God's people as this is typed in vs. 18-29. Through the revolutionary agitations, partly along religious lines and more along the lines of state and church politics in the Long Parliament, the Presbyterian Puritans gathered the British people together along the lines of excitement and partisanship on the involved questions. Their acts of taking more and more of the king's and bishops' powers to themselves gave the people the idea that they in their religious domain were going to act more autocratically than the second phase of the Anglican movement (18). These acts were a charge that all the propagandists of absolutism in its power-grasping and lording and their supporters and sacrificers, without exception, be gathered together as a party separate and distinct from the liberty-lovers; their conduct giving the impression that they were going at great self-denial to sacrifice to the principle of autocracy in state and church and to cut off all privileges of those power-grasping lords, their supporters and sacrificers who failed to join in this service to power-grasping and lording. At the time, while giving these impressions, they hid their purpose to put down the tyranny of the autocrats (19). The revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans caused to be proclaimed that fasts, watchings, prayers, sermons and speeches be had in and out of parliament anent this work (20). These agitations and proclamations aroused the attention of all England and resulted in the autocrats assembling into one party, some of whom did their assembling about the autocratic King Charles I, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> in the state, the others about the autocratic Archbishop Laud, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> in the Anglican Church. And the stress of partisanship was so great that all autocratically inclined assembled to this party in its two aspects. These assembled in the sphere of serving autocracy, which was filled from end to end (21).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(18) The revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans came in concealed hostility to the sphere of serving autocracy, as though they would support it, and so pressed matters on the lawyers and judges that these were charged to invest by their legal opinions the autocrats with the authorization to further autocracy. This these lawyers and judges did in setting forth such legal points as gave precedents of autocracy in British history and courts, a thing that, among other ways, shows itself in Hampden's appeal to the high court against the king's tyranny being overruled by the majority of that court (22). These Presbyterian Puritans in the religious</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">sphere and the Long Parliament, largely Puritan, as the organized director of the revolutionists, in the religious and political sphere came to the sphere of autocracy and by their course charged that no liberty-lover be permitted in that sphere, but only the autocrats and their supporters were to be there (23). As the autocrats lent their services to autocracy, even to the degree of Charles' appearing, in gross violation of parliament's rights, in parliament to arrest its five leading anti-autocratic members, and of his assembling an army and declaring war on parliament, which in accepting the challenge declared that its army was fighting to rescue the king from his abductors (subtlety, v. 19), the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans arranged for their best debaters to be stationed about the active autocrats and their supporters as they were serving autocracy, but outside its sphere, and by word and act charged these to refute in detail such, and warned them that at their peril would they fail in this refutative work (24).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(19) But as soon as the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans finished their pretended service of autocracy, they charged the champions of anti-autocracy to fight these in state and church in the arena of debate, e.g., Hampden, refusing to pay an illegal tax called ship tax, appealed his cause to the courts and won the argument, though the majority of the court in fear of the king decided against him; but the nation in its large majority favored his argument. Milton and lesser lights poured out one pamphlet and book after another in the conflict. Pym and others in parliament made one unanswerable speech after another against autocracy, blaming, not the king (&quot;The king can do no wrong&quot;), but his civil and ecclesiastical ministers. In the argument the autocrats and their supporters were completely refuted. The agitation became so overwhelming that Lord Stratford, Charles I's chief political adviser and supporter, and Laud, his chief religious adviser and supporter, were impeached and beheaded;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans, casting out of office all autocrats, overthrew the Anglican Church as the religious government of autocracy (25). All the theories of autocracy as theories and the practices flowing out of them they overthrew, and by the civil war that ensued they broke up the whole structure of autocracy and, defiling it, left it as an unclean thing in theory and practice (27). In this way autocracy was from then to this day left in wreck and ruins, no more in Britain to come into power (28).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) But while the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans destroyed autocracy in state and church, they fostered without deviation clericalism and sectarianism, which had been introduced unto making Protestantism idolistic, by the first phase of the Lutheran movement; for they favored Presbyterianism, which under their sanction and appointment drew up the Westminster Confession and catechisms and a form of worship for the church, as they favored the various sects of that time, particularly Presbyterianism and Congregationalism (29). By His providences and the principles of His Word God approved of the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans' executing His word and will on the Anglican movements and the Anglican Church, and promised them long, but not perpetual continuance as the less favored movement of His real people (30). However, they did not take heed to walk wholeheartedly in the Truth then due and to eschew clericalism and sectarianism as taught in the Word; for they continued to advocate and practice these sins as introduced into Protestantism by the first Lutheran movement (31). It was in the period of the first phase of the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans (1616-1646) that the Romanists made invasions and conquest in Britain and Germany. This began through the compromising spirit of James I, who, to win as a bride for Charles the daughter of Spain's Romanist king, yielded much to Rome in withholding support from his son-in-law, attacked by the Austrian and Spanish</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Romanists in the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). (21) Failing to win her as the bride of Charles, he entered into compromises with Romanism to win Henrietta, a bigoted Romanist and daughter of France's king, as a bride for Charles. Successful therein, he had to permit many liberties to Romanists in Britain, contrary to law and the strong convictions of the bulk of his Britons. Henrietta was involved in the arousing of the Irish in the Irish massacres, in which in Ulster alone 154,000 were massacred or exiled, besides untold thousands undergoing these fates in other parts of Ireland. During the civil war Henrietta absconded from England with the royal jewels and with their purchase price hired Romanist soldiers (B 340, 341) to invade England to help her husband, Charles I, against the parliament's army. Charles' favoring Romanists for Henrietta's sake, who urged him on to autocratic acts (&quot;Be a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">king,</span><span class="font3">&quot; which she understood to mean to rule autocratically, as did the French kings), British Romanists flocked to his standard against parliament and did some of the chief fighting in his army. Through these compromises Romanists not only gained a measure of temporary control in Britain and Ireland (Gilead, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rough,</span><span class="font3"> Manassites, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">forgetters'),</span><span class="font3"> but did the same in Germany (Reuben, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lo, a son)</span><span class="font3"> and Bohemia and Moravia (Gad, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortunate),</span><span class="font3"> in all of which, from Britain (Gilead) to Protestantism abroad (Bashan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">campaign country),</span><span class="font3"> Britain as the chief Protestant power had and should have preserved Protestant influence (Jordan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">descender,</span><span class="font3"> eastward), but lost it unto restrained Romanism (Aroer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">enclosure)</span><span class="font3"> and her tumultuous (Arnon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">noisy)</span><span class="font3"> adherents (33). These and other deeds and powers of the first phase of the revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans are abundantly described in the historical works, especially in those of British historians treating of the years 16161646 (34). They have been in respectful remembrance by the rightly informed, in unison with their Puritan predecessors for their deeds as to church</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">politics, and were succeeded by the Presbyterian (Jehoahaz, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah keeps')</span><span class="font3"> Puritans in a reconstructing but weak phase (35), after serving out their full period in church politics (36).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) Jehu was succeeded in 875 B.C. by his son Jehoahaz </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jehovah preserves</span><span class="font3">—a name given to him in allusion to God's preserving this king and his antitype despite many adverse circumstances, v. 1), who reigned for 14 years, according to the compared dates of his reign with those of Joash of Judah; hence he reigned until 861 B.C. Paralleling his reign is the course of the Presbyterian Puritans (from 1646 to 1660; see the chronological tables in P '40, 181, 182), who as the antitype of Jehoahaz pursued a half-way revolutionary course as to autocracy in state and church, and therefore may, in contrast with antitypical Jehu, who was energetically revolutionary, be called compromisingly revolutionary. During the antitypical Jehu phase the Presbyterian Puritans as revolutionists were supported especially by Congregationalist Puritans, and in a very minor, yea, almost negligible degree, by the Baptist Puritans. And as long as the first two had autocracy in state and church to deal with as their opponents, i.e., during the period of antitypical Jehu, they held together quite well, despite their disagreement on matters of church government. But shortly after they had conquered autocracy in state and church, i.e., shortly after the antitypical Jehoahaz phase set in, differences between them began to appear. The Presbyterian Puritans had their main power in the Long Parliament, which they controlled, while the Congregationalist Puritans had their main power in the army, which was overwhelmingly Congregational, and whose ablest and most successful leader was the Congregationalist Oliver Cromwell. The latter as warrior, statesman and ruler was one of the greatest of Englishmen; yea, it is doubtful if ever another Englishman from a combination of these three standpoints ever equaled him. He was a sincere patriot</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">desiring his beloved England's welfare, to secure which he fought to a complete defeat the army of Charles I, that of the Irish revolutionists and that of the Scotch royalists. But to secure England's welfare he at times violated features of the English constitution and laws.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) As a whole the Jehoahaz phase was an evil one (v. 2). It so greatly favored </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sectarianism</span><span class="font3"> as to have induced its majority in parliament to set it up as the state religion in England, putting the Westminster Confession forth as the creed in place of the Anglican Church's 39 Articles, and its directory of worship in the place of the former's Common Prayer. Yea, it went so far as to authorize a law to put to death deniers of the trinity, Christ's divinity, the resurrection of the body and free-will asserters, and to imprison deniers of Presbyterianism. Such a law was directly opposed to the Congregational doctrine of tolerance for all Protestants and Jews, and aroused Cromwell's unrelenting and successful opposition. Again, the Presbyterian Puritans sought to organize the religion of England on the Presbyterian model of national assemblies, provincial synods and district and local presbyteries, which again greatly outraged the Congregationalists, as this was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">clericalism,</span><span class="font3"> and which again Cromwell as their leader unrelentingly and successfully opposed. In championing sectarianism and clericalism the Presbyterians were guilty of the two sins of the first Lutheran movement (followed the sins of Jeroboam). But there were other evils that antitypical Jehoahaz committed, among which were things that compromised the revolutionary spirit and the fight against Romanism. One of these was their insistence on a union of state and their church, which also antagonized the Congregationalists, especially in the army. Shortly after Charles I fell into the hands of the Long Parliament, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font3">1646, the Presbyterian Puritans in parliament, contrary to the Congregationalist party in the army, and to secure Cromwell's elimination, sought to effect a reconciliation with Charles</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that would have greatly compromised the effects of antitypical Jehu's revolution. This step was effectually stopped by Cromwell's interposition with the army. The Presbyterian Puritans, seeing that the army was getting an overweening influence in English affairs, sought to disband it, which, supported by the army, Cromwell prevented. Of course, the clashes between parliament and the army weakened antitypical Jehoahaz, whose main strength was in parliament.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) Just as the Presbyterian majority in parliament was about to effect a reconciliation with Charles I, and to restore him to royalty under conditions which would have given him again the opportunity to tyrannize over England and eliminate Cromwell, the latter sent Col. Pride with two regiments to surround the parliament house and exclude the Presbyterian majority from their seats. This done, the 60 Congregationalist parliamentarians became the sole members of that body and were resultantly called the &quot;Rump Parliament.&quot; This act took away from antitypical Jehoahaz all parliamentary power and, of course, greatly weakened them. Great differences arose between many Presbyterian Puritans and the army, because the latter, after seeking a reconciliation with Charles I, found him as deceitful in negotiations as the Presbyterian Puritans had just previously found him to be, and therefore the army and the Rump Parliament decided that Charles must be tried as a tyrant, a traitor and an enemy of the English people. Finding him guilty as charged, they caused him to be beheaded. Upon the Congregationalist Puritans fell the main odium for Charles' execution, &quot;since they constituted the parliament that ordered his trial on capital charges, the army and the Londoners clamoring for his death. But part of the evil effect of the king's beheading, Jan. 30, 1649, fell upon the Presbyterian Puritans and contributed also to their ever-increasing weakness, though they tried to save Charles I from the block, for which their weakness made them incapable. Cromwell’s</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">well's insistence on tolerance for all Protestants and Jews undermined some of antitypical Jehoahaz's influence. Cromwell's absolutism made a reaction in favor of the restoration of the Stuarts to England's throne, in favor of which the Presbyterian Puritans, in one of their huge and fatal compromises, worked. Their course therein gave antitypical Jehoahaz a mortal blow; for it opened the flood gates for a Romanist inundation. Contributory also to their fall on this line were two other things: (1) the inefficiency of Richard Cromwell, who at his father's death succeeded him as Protector of the English Commonwealth, as the English government and nation were called under Oliver Cromwell's rulership, for his inefficiency threw England into disorder and made order-loving people turn toward the monarchy; and (2) the deceitful course of General Monk, who by intrigue created a situation whereby he and the Presbyterian Puritans arranged for Charles' son, the later Charles II, to return and take England's throne.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(25) Various of the acts of antitypical Jehoahaz set forth in the preceding two paragraphs increasingly turned the Lord against this phase of the revolutionists, antitypical Jehoahaz; and this resulted in many misfortunes coming upon the English people (anger . . . against Israel, v. 3). This anger of the Lord brought in punishment several things, mentioned in the preceding two paragraphs, upon antitypical Jehoahaz and the English people. In addition to these things, the following may be mentioned as contributory thereto: Charles as Prince of Wales entered Scotland, whose hereditary king he was, and aroused the Scots to make war on England. Cromwell met them at Dunbar, Sept. 3, 1650, and completely crushed their army; and a year later to the day, at Worcester, he crushed the army of the Prince of Wales, who with another army, just before Dunbar, had invaded England from Scotland. These encounters weakened antitypical Jehoahaz: for the Scotch (Presbyterians) were in</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">religious alliance with the Presbyterian Puritans of England. Moreover, these victories aroused foreign Romanists to side with Charles. Cromwell's severe handling of the Romanist Irish revolutionists, for their cruel massacres of, and other wrongs against Irish Protestants, greatly aroused Romanist anger in England, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy and Austria against both the English Congregationalist Puritans and Presbyterian Puritans; and from Romanist machinations trouble was stirred up in England and in foreign countries against England. Charles' escape from England, after his defeat by Cromwell, to France and his intrigues there against both English revolutionary parties made no end of trouble for them — trouble that arose not only amid direct oppositional Romanist works </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">religiously</span><span class="font3"> against England (hand of Hazael, v. 3), but also </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">politically</span><span class="font3"> through the alliances that first Cromwell and later Charles II made with France and through Romanist political works within England (hand of Ben-hadad)—trouble that was of many years' duration against England, continuing even after James II was driven out of England in 1688 (all their days: literally, all days, the rest of antitypical Hazael's and all of antitypical Ben-hadad's).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(26) The earlier calamities of antitypical Jehoahaz's reign led its adherents to repentance and to pleading mercy from the Lord, who extended them mercy (besought the Lord . . . harkened unto him, v. 4), and who had compassion upon them as to their oppressions from Romanists in England, Ireland and Scotland (oppression. . . king of Syria oppressed them). The Lord gave them deliverance through Oliver Cromwell's victories over the Irish (1649), Scotch (1650) and English (1651) Romanists (gave Israel a saviour . . . from under the hand of the Syrians, v. 5), so that so far as Britain and Ireland were concerned they dwelt in safety (Israel dwelt... as beforetime). Thus we see that some of the events mentioned in preceding paragraphs were, through Cromwell, deliverances to the English people and the compromising Presbyterian Puritan revolutionists, antitypical Jehoahaz, from Romanist machinations. Despite these delivering acts neither antitypical Jehoahaz nor the English people gave up sectarianism [the calf at Bethel] and clericalism [the calf at Dan], set up by the first Lutheran movement (departed not from the sins ... of Jeroboam, v. 6); for the first Lutheran movement in these two ways led Protestantism in its less favored movements of God's people greatly to sin (made Israel sin). And the virtual union of state and church in feebler manner than that which characterized the various Anglican movements and the Anglican Church still persisted in church and state politics (remained the grove [where unchaste acts occurred] also in Samaria). These wrongs continued to be punished by the Lord until antitypical Jehoahaz was rendered quite powerless; for while Cromwell and his parliaments did not persecute them, they reduced them for their sectarianism and clericalism to impotence (leave . . . Jehoahaz but fifty. . . ten. . . ten thousand, v. 7); for his victorious fights with Romanists continually drew away the support of the people from antitypical Jehoahaz and gave it to him; and thus by indirect effect (threshing) the Romanists (king of Syria) brought about their impotence (destroyed).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(27) The historians of the period of antitypical Jehoahaz have very detailedly discussed this period (1646-1660) and the events of the compromising revolutionaries, antitypical Jehoahaz (acts . . . written . . . chronicles, v. 8): and by the recall of the Prince of Wales to England and by his turning his back to them after becoming Charles II, though they were the chief ones who brought about his return, they came to an end as the compromising Presbyterian Puritan revolutionaries (slept. . . buried, v. 9); and for the next 18 years the Presbyterian Puritans became the persecuted and resurgent revolutionaries, as antitypical Jehoash, or Joash of Israel (Joash . . .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">in his stead). But all through antitypical Jehoahaz's period, directly by their attacks and revolutions and indirectly, as explained above, by Cromwell's victories over them, the Romanist revolutionaries oppressed this phase of the antitypical Jehu dynasty and the English as antitypical Israel (Hazael. . . oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz, v. 22). But because of their relation to the Covenant in God, Christ and the Little Flock (respect. . . covenant. . . Jacob, v. 23), God favored (gracious . . . had compassion) both antitypical Jehoahaz, as His less favored movement, and the English, as His antitypical Israel, and did not cast them off nor take His favor from them, but punished them measurably, for their reformation (not destroy. . . cast. . . presence, face, i.e., favor).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) We now come to the study of the parallel of Jehoash, otherwise called Joash, of Israel, 861-843 B.C., and his antitype, the Presbyterian Puritans as persecuted but reawakening revolutionaries, 1660-1678. For these dates please see the tables on page 274-277. The Biblical or typical events on this phase of the parallel are described in 2 Kings 13:10-21, 24, 25. We will here omit the study of the war between Jehoash </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jehovah secures,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to God's increasingly making Protestantism safe in England, vs. 10, 12) and Amaziah of Judah, since it will be treated in connection with the study of the parallel of Amaziah. According to a comparison of vs. 22 and 24, 25, Hazael died during Jehoash's reign. Hazael in this parallel seems to type Romanism as a predominantly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">religious</span><span class="font3"> opponent of Presbyterian Puritans as persecuted but reawakening revolutionaries; and Ben-hadad seems to type it as a predominantly political opponent of such revolutionaries, while in each feature the other feature's characteristics is less prominently present. The fulfilled facts give this thought. Charles II, 1660-1685, the son of Charles I, was invited to return to England arid to receive the crown by almost unanimous desire of England, the invitation coming mainly through</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">antitypical Jehoahaz and Gen. Monk, the English nobility and the royalist supporters of his father. His character was one of the most depraved of English kings. He had 16 known mistresses, many of whom he ennobled and whom he loaded with costly favors, at expense of the state, and at least 13 bastard children, most of whom he ennobled, while he neglected and mistreated his legitimate wife, who pined away in worse than widowhood. Most of his youth and young manhood (he being just 30 on his return) he spent in profligacy in France; and on his return he headed the most unchaste, blasphemous and frivolous court ever to reign in England; and out from it flowed a deep and wide stream of profligacy, frivolity and blasphemy, defiling the nobility and other higher classes of England. Trained as a secret Romanist by his bigoted Romanist mother, Henrietta, queen of Charles I, to gain the crown of Scotland he professed Presbyterianism, taking the oath of the League and Covenant, and persecuting all dissenters; and to gain Englands crown he professed Anglicanism, likewise persecuting all dissenters. His whole course was one of enmity to the Puritans of all classes—Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist and Quaker—and of favor to Romanism, all of the while pretending to be a member of the Anglican Church, the head of which he as king was </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio.</span><span class="font3"> His hand very ungratefully rested most heavily upon the Presbyterian Puritans, now antitypical Jehoash, to whom as antitypical Jehoahaz above all he owed his return and throne.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(29) Scarcely seated on his throne, he ordered the trial and execution of those most concerned in his father's death. These were permitted no defense, 14 of whom he had hanged, drawn (their vital organs tom out and burned in their sight) and quartered (their yet living bodies cut into four quarters), Charles II nearby watching the scene; and 15 he had imprisoned, a treatment very similar to that of the 14 being accorded to the dead bodies of Cromwell, his son-in-law Ireton, and Bradshaw, the head of the court that condemned Charles I, which were disinterred for the purpose from their graves in Westminster Abbey. Pym's and Blake's bodies were disinterred from the same Abbey and were buried in St. Margaret's churchyard. Similar indignities were offered the bodies of Cromwell's mother and eldest daughter despite their having been models of female virtue. Charles restored wherever possible to all royalists their property confiscated by the revolutionists. He restored the Anglican Church to her place as the state church by the Corporation Act, passed in 1661, by which he required all public officials and army and naval officers to foreswear the League and Covenant, by oath to deny that a subject under any circumstance had a right to resist the king, and publicly to profess Anglicanism and join the national church, an act that cut off all Puritans from public office, steps that favored Romanism, because Anglicanism was half Romanist, and because it weakened Rome's enemies, the Puritans of all creeds, who were genuine Protestants. He then, 1662, caused the Act of Uniformity to be passed, whereby non-conforming ministers to his type of Anglicanism (the Presbyterian Puritans having for a century been the Evangelical wing of the Anglican Church) were to the number of over 2,000 driven from their pulpits and parsonage and were forbidden to be teachers, even of secular subjects, whereby they were reduced to abjectest poverty. This Act he followed with the Conventicle Act, whereby assemblies of five or more were forbidden, unless the Anglican Common Prayer were used. To this he added the Five Miles Act, which forbade the ejected Puritan ministers to come within five miles of a church in which they had formerly preached either regularly or occasionally or but once as a supply. These two Acts resulted in filling English prisons with the best men and some true saints in England. Even before, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font3"> in 1660, he ordered the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">imprisonment of Independent Puritans who refused to cease preaching, which resulted in John Bunyan's 12 years' imprisonment in Bedford jail, where and when he wrote a number of his best works, including his immortal Pilgrim's Progress, the most wide-spread and popular of English religious books, and in the repeated imprisonment of starmember George Fox, the Little Flock leader of the movement later perverted into Quakerism. His first Declaration of Indulgence, 1662, parliament and the people forced him to withdraw, 1663, because they saw that it was actually shielding Romanists, though ostensibly also favoring the Puritans, who could, however, get no benefit from it because of the Corporation and Uniformity Acts.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(30) While he persecuted all Puritans as nonconformists, he singled out the adherents of George Fox as the especial targets for his shafts of oppression and persecution; and in a few years 12,000 of them were languishing in jail, this being the number of them released from prison in 1672 under his second Declaration of Indulgence, whereby also John Bunyan obtained his freedom. Through his agents he most fiendishly persecuted the Scotch Covenanters. Though sworn to the League and Covenant to uphold Presbyterianism in Scotland, he most violently sought to overthrow it and put Episcopacy into its place; and he met resistance to these two measures by war, imprisonment, execution, exile and starvation. In 1662 he caused an Act to be passed requiring all Scotch Presbyterian ministers to be reinstated into their charges at the hands of bishops, ejecting all who refused to comply, to the number of 350. He greatly outraged English feelings by marrying a Romanist princess, the daughter of the Portuguese king. He allowed Romanist priests, monks and nuns, especially Jesuits, to swarm back to England, contrary to the law prohibiting their presence in England. His selling to Romanist Louis XIV Dunkirk, which the latter had given England for Cromwell's successful help of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">him against Spain, greatly outraged the English people, as a national humiliation. Entering into a secret treaty (The Treaty of Dover) with Louis XIV by which he agreed for an annual pension of 3,000,000 francs publicly to profess Romanism whenever conditions in England seemed to make it practicable, to accept Louis' promise of 6,000 French soldiers in case England would revolt at his act of professing Romanism, and in alliance with Romanist France to declare war against the Dutch, in order to break up that Protestant power, he brought England into a most unprofitable war with Holland and deeply insulted his people, in that he, their sovereign, should have sunk so low and disgraced them so blatantly, by becoming a pensioner of France. In 1672 he passed a second Declaration of Indulgence to all religions and their professors, intended by him to advance Romanizing England, whose favoring he could secure only, if he gave tolerance to English Puritans, which resulted in freeing from prison tens of thousands of Puritans, including, among others, 12,000 Quakers and John Bunyan. Knowing his Romanist intent therein, parliament refused him supplies for his war against Holland until he rescinded the part of his Declaration that tolerated Romanists. All of his acts set forth in this and the preceding paragraph were, and were intended by him to be, favorable to Rome; and almost all of them were blows at Protestantism; and those of them which were not such blows were as they were, because they were in the ultimate interest of Romanism and favored Protestantism as an indispensable means to that end, as show his two Declarations of Indulgence.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) Now let us see the relation of the course of Charles II from 1660 to 1678 to the type of Hazael, Ben-hadad and Jehoash. While some of the above acts were preponderantly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">religiously</span><span class="font3"> favorable to Romanism, and are therefore to be viewed as acts of antitypical Hazael, the bulk of them were preponderantly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">politically</span><span class="font3"> favorable to Romanism, and therefore are to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">be viewed as acts of antitypical Ben-hadad, but in all cases they were acts against antitypical Jehoash, persecuted and reviving Presbyterian Puritan revolutionaries. The pertinent acts of the latter were mainly </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">political</span><span class="font3"> (Jehoash. . . reign over Israel in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Samaria [guard, watch],</span><span class="font3"> v. 10). Antitypical Jehoash continued to practice sectarianism and clericalism (sins of Jeroboam, v. 11), as well as did wrong in other ways. They favored some of Charles' measures, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> the punishment of the regicides, oppression of the Independent Puritans, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> Congregationalists, Baptists, Quakers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., </span><span class="font3">and submission to many of his oppressive acts (did that which was evil). Their acts are set forth in the writings of historians, particularly church historians (acts of Joash . . . written in. . . chronicles of Israel, v. 12). This policy— persecuted but reviving revolutionism—ceased to be the reigning policy in 1678 (Joash slept, v. 13) , when it was succeeded by an aggressive revolutionists policy, which utterly overthrew Romanist attacks on England and preserved tolerance for Protestants of all sects (Jeroboam [ II, contention of the people, in allusion to their striving for the rights of the people] sat upon the throne). The Jehoash phase, as said above, was one mainly occupied with the political side of Presbyterian Puritanism, and was set aside as a reigning policy as such (Joash was buried in Samaria). The Puritan period so far considered was one in which God used first uncompromising mouthpieces (Elijah) toward His people, nominal and real, then later more or less compromising mouthpieces (Elisha), both kinds of mouthpieces together prevailing for about 90 years, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font3">from about 1582, when Robert Browne began to function, to about 1672, when brethren like Baxter, Howe, Bunyan and Barclay, respectively representatives of Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist and Quaker Puritans, began to cease acting as God's compromising mouthpiece, under repressive measures of antitypical Hazael and Ben-hadad, weakening (sick, v. 14); and about 1672</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ceased to function as such (died). Persecuted but reviving revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans resorted to these for comfort and counsel (Joash came down to him), mourning over their condition (wept over his face), expressing deep respect and filial affection (my father, my father) and much concern over the weak organization that antitypical Joash had (the chariot of Israel) and the leaders thereof, who were faultful, weak and harassed (the horsemen thereof).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) The symbolic visit was a long-drawn-out one. It began about 1662, when Charles' oppressive legislation began to weigh heavily on antitypical Jehoash, and continued until about 1672. Antitypical Elisha armed antitypical Joash with the knowledge of the sharp pertinent controversial truths (Take . . . arrows, v. 15) to meet the devious course of Charles' Rome-favoring acts, and with the organization and Biblical passage and facts (bow, whose wood types the organization, and string the passage and facts) to shoot forth these truths. Antitypical Joash availed himself of these (took unto him bow and arrows). Then antitypical Elisha encouraged antitypical Joash to lay hold powerfully on the pertinent organization and Bible passage and facts (Put thine hand upon the bow, v. 16), which they did (put his hand). To their power antitypical Elisha gave their powerful support (Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands). Then antitypical Elisha charged antitypical Joash to act in the matter publicly in the interests of the Gospel (Open the window eastward, literally, toward the rising of the sun, v. 17). This they did (opened it). Then came the charge, Shoot, which was done (Shoot. And he shot). This entire scene, so far enacted as a pantomime forecast, was fulfilled in 1663, as follows: In 1662 Charles II issued his first Declaration of Indulgence, a thing that on its face seemed to decree tolerance for all Christian sects. But its real purpose was to protect and further Romanism, which was not covered by the Corporation and Uniformity Acts. Hence, these two</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Acts, still applying to Protestants exclusively, could be enforced against them; but not applying to Romanists, the latter in the end, according to Charles' intention, would be the only ones benefited by the first Declaration of Indulgence. Antitypical Elisha, perceiving this, aroused antitypical Joash in and out of parliament, which included almost all Englishmen, to use their organization, Bible passage and facts to propel the sharp truths of Protestant anti-Romanism against this Declaration. As a result a determined agitation throughout parliament and the English public set in with such mighty force as compelled Charles to withdraw this Declaration. Foreseeing this result, in itself given here as a forecast of the future full victory of God's truth against Romanism in Britain, antitypical Elisha described it prophetically with emphasis as a forecast, to be hoped, of deliverance from Romanism in Britain (arrow . . . arrow of deliverance from Syria). He added that it prophesied that antitypical Joash would defeat the Romanists (smite the Syrians) as led, secretly, by Charles II, in their power (Aphek, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">strength)</span><span class="font3"> unto overcoming them in their pertinent plans (consumed them). The fulfilment of this pantomime forecast was given above, because in the subsequent narrative it is not mentioned, while the fillfilment of the threefold striking with the arrows is later given, as factual fulfillments of the pertinent forecasts. (33) Continuing the pantomime forecast antitypical Elisha charged antitypical Joash to lay hold on all the rest of the controversial truths against Romanism, which he gave them (Take the arrows, v. 18). This antitypical Joash did (did so). Then antitypical Elisha told him to smite with this Romanism's political social earth (Smite upon the ground). In pantomime antitypical Joash did this only three times (smite thrice) and then ceased so doing (and stayed), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font3"> on only three points did he use these truths against Romanist political and social arrangements in relation to England. When describing the fulfilment as typed in v. 25, we will set forth the antitypical facts. Antitypical Elisha was displeased at this manifestation of little zeal and aggressiveness (was wroth with him, v. 19), telling him that full zeal and aggressiveness would have moved him to smite five or six times (shouldst have smitten five or six times), thereby indicating that a proper zeal and aggressiveness would utterly overthrow Romanism (smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it), whereas their incomplete zeal and aggressiveness would not result in a complete overthrow of Romanism in England (smite Syria but thrice). We are to understand that before each one of the three blows in the antitype antitypical Elisha gave the charge to smite the Romanist works of Charles II. Hence we believe that antitypical Elisha's ceasing to function as God's mouthpiece from the standpoint of separate and distinct pictures was a little time before 1674, when the last of the three defeats was administered to the Romanists as they acted in Charles II. Thus antitypical Elisha ceased to function about 1672, as Rome was about to get the third blow in England that bade her pause (Elisha died, v. 20), and was kept in deep respect by the Puritans of all branches (buried him). With their supporters the wicked Cabal ministry (1667-1673), that negotiated the Treaty of Dover, 1670, whereby Charles for 3,000,000 francs agreed publicly to profess Romanism, to aid Romanist France in a war against Protestant Holland and to receive 6,000 French soldiers on English soil to defend him against a possible revolution raised by his open profession of Romanism, was in their autocracy guilty of many corrupt acts against England politically (Moabites invaded the land). On every opportunity they committed corruption (at the coming of the year).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) The exposure of the existence of the infamous Treaty of Dover—so disgraceful to England—forced, in 1673, the resignation of the Cabal ministry. In their cast-off condition they and the bulk of their supporters continued to be political pirates, except</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">their ablest representative, the Earl of Shaftesbury (Ashley Cooper) and his supporters, who as reformed became dead to them; and as they were ridding themselves of these (they were burying a man, v. 21) their attention was attracted by the agitation over the Titus Oates' and others' outcries of murderous popish plots, which proved to be base inventions, but which were believed in widely, and which stirred up in 1678 Protestant vigilants to counteractive measures (behold, they spied a band of men). As the majority of the defunct Cabal ministry and their remaining supporters took note of these measures they cast off the Earl of Shaftesbury and his adherents (cast. . . sepulchre of Elisha) into contact with the memorials of antitypical Elisha, and in that cast-off and contacting condition these (touched the bones of Elisha) were revived in their British and Protestant patriotism (revived). Thereupon as a counteractive measure he and his supporters caused to pass through both houses of parliament a bill disqualifying all Romanists, except the Duke of York, Charles Il's staunch Romanist brother, from sitting in parliament, a law that for over 150 years debarred all Romanists from membership in either house (he stood up on his feet). Vs. 22, 23, having been expounded while antitypical Jehoahaz was being described, we pass by here. It was, as shown above, during antitypical Joash's days (1660-1678) that the Romanism conflict changed in England's experience from a preponderantly religious fight (Hazael . . . died, v. 24) into a predominately political fight (Ben-hadad his son reigned in his stead). And on political lines antitypical Joash—the Presbyterian Puritans as persecuted but revived revolutionaries—drew to their side the Congregationalist, Baptist and Quaker Puritans as religious bodies that Romanists alienated from them during the days of antitypical Jehoahaz, 1646-1660 (Jehoash. . . took again ... the cities ... his father, v. 25).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) This occurred through a threefold conflict (three times . . . beat him) waged against Charles II as the secret leader of political Romanism in England, which conflict will now be described. Still persisting in his attempts to favor Romanists Charles II made a second Declaration of Indulgence, 1672, ostensibly aimed to free all sects from legal disabilities. By now the Presbyterian Puritans had gained much influence in parliament. They recognized that Charles sought to give Romanists liberties forbidden by law. They therefore, by their own members in parliament and others that these convinced of Charles' purpose, refused to vote him supplies until he would withdraw his Declaration. This made him give up his second Declaration of Indulgence; but parliament granted this indulgence to all Protestant sects and excluded Romanists from it. This was the first of the three victories of antitypical Joash over antitypical Ben-hadad; and this victory did its part in freeing the Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist and Quaker churches from Charles Il's oppression. As a result John Bunyan was freed from his 12-year confinement in Bedford jail; and 12,000 Quakers got their freedom from prison. The second victory of antitypical Joash over antitypical Ben-hadad was this: Charles had filled many political and civil offices with Romanists, and had made a very large number of them military and naval officers. To break this up and thus deliver England from being betrayed to her Romanist enemies antitypical Joash in parliament passed, 1673, a law called the Test Act, requiring (1) all civil, political, military and naval officers to deny all specifically Romanist doctrines, (2) to belong to, and (3) to commune in the Anglican Church. This law forced the retirement of all Romanists, including the Duke of York, Charles' brother and heir to the throne, who was also commander-in-chief of the navy, from their offices in these four branches of public service, and certainly was a great victory over political Romanism. The third victory of antitypical Joash over</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">antitypical Ben-hadad was their forcing the dissolution of the Treaty of Dover. This disgraceful treaty, that made the English king a pensioner of Romanist France and offered him 6,000 French soldiers to put down an English uprising at Charles' intended announcement of his going over to Rome, and that made it fight Protestant Holland for Rome, was to the extremist degree a humiliation of Britain, and was most deeply resented by practically the entire English people. Antitypical Joash outside, in and through parliament denounced, 1674, the treaty and forced Charles to give up the alliance with France, to make peace with Holland, 1674, and to withdraw Protestant England's support of Romanist Louis XIV in his war against Protestant Holland. That infamous treaty was kept a secret from 1670 until 1673; and on its becoming known an outraged public sentiment forced the overthrow of the Cabal ministry, which had negotiated it, as well as moved parliament to take the three steps set forth in the second preceding sentence. A decidedly Protestant ministry succeeding the Cabal ministry kept Charles in check until the Joash phase ended.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(36) The antitypical Jeroboam II phase, 1678-1730 (parallel years are 846-791 B.C.; see page 275-277), witnessed the complete overthrow of religious and political Romanism in Britain, so far as controllership in its affairs is concerned, as it witnessed the full enjoyment of tolerance on the part of the nonconformists, non-Anglicans—a thing that grew stronger throughout this entire phase. First the historical events in the development of these two sets of activities will be set forth; then their relation to the type of Jeroboam's activities and accomplishments will be shown. These events form a very large part of the history of religious and political England during the period, 16781730. By the year 1678 the bulk of the British people became fully convinced that Charles II, backed by Louis XIV of France, was intent on ruining English liberty, trampling on English law, introducing Romanism as the state religion in England and Romanizing the English people. Taking advantage of such a state of the public mind, Titus Ohs, Erst an apostate Baptist preacher, then a Romanist pervert, then a Jesuit, then an adventurer, an imposter and an unequaled falsifier, spread widely a lying invention that the Jesuits were on the eve of executing a plan to murder the king and parliament, then overthrow Protestantism by a Romanist uprising in England and a Romanist invasion from Spain and France and bring England into subjection to the papacy. His ever-growing and gruesome stories gained such popular credence as engrossed the attention of parliament, before which, at its invitation, he gave details on his exposures of the alleged conspiracy.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) It was as a result of this agitation that Lord Shaftesbury caused his bill mentioned above to pass through parliament disqualifying Romanists from sitting in either house of parliament. It also resulted in the trial and execution of many prominent innocent Romanists. This agitation and the desire to prevent the exposure of the worst feature of Charles IPs disgraceful bargain with Louis XIV moved him to agree to the dissolution of his partisan parliament, the Cavalier Parliament, by which he had from 1661 to 1678 been able to work so effectively for Rome and against the Puritans of all sects. The new parliament, thoroughly anti-Romanist, both religiously and politically, passed (1679) the Habeas Corpus Act, one of the three great liberty Acts of England, which greatly freed accused Britons from the king's power to imprison arbitrarily, without charge or trial, those in the way of his schemes. Three times in as many years (1679, 1680, 1681) Charles dissolved parliament for its anti-Romanism. In 1682 the changing fortunes of the strife between Charles and parliament gave him the advantage over parliament; and for three years he ruled as an absolute monarch, i.e., he ignored the Test Act, appointing Romanists to civil, military and naval</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">offices, and had his Scotch representatives terribly to persecute the Covenanters. Some base criminals were exposed as guilty of what was called the Rye House Plot, whereby they sought to kill Charles and the Duke of York; and the king brought to trial before a packed court and jury and had executed five innocent nobles as alleged participants in that plot. And when about to die he had his Romanist brother bring a Romanist priest to hear his confession and administer extreme unction to him.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) His last three years of favoring Rome and quenching Protestant liberty were followed by three years of stubborn effort by his brother and successor as James II to destroy English liberty and Protestantism, to make Romanism the state religion and to pervert the English people to Romanism. He was a most arbitrary, stubborn and unreasonable ruler, and by his course brought about what is called the &quot;Glorious Revolution,&quot; whereby civil and religious liberty for Protestantism and the repression of Romanism became dominant British policies. These six years, the last three of Charles' and the three of James' entire reign (1682-1688) were antitypical Ben-hadad's time of strenuous fight against antitypical Jeroboam II, a fight that resulted in undoing everything as to the Presbyterian Puritan revolutionaries that antitypical Hazael and Ben-hadad had done against them throughout the reigns of the first four Stuarts: James I, Charles I and II and James II. When the last named succeeded Charles II, he by oath promised the King's Council that he would reign according to the English constitution and laws, and would support and uphold the Anglican Church, whose head he became on becoming king; but during his three years' reign he defied public sentiment, trampled on the constitution and laws and became very malignant to all who would not favor his scheme of Romanizing England religiously, politically, educationally, diplomatically and socially.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) Three days after his accession, without the authorization of parliament and against the earnest advice of his council, he lawlessly levied customs. He carried his first parliamentary election by violence and fraud. He had his Scotch representatives make laws against, and fiendishly persecute the Covenanters. Most brutally he suppressed a Scotch revolution and an English revolution against his Romanist schemes. Not content with executing their leaders, he, against their followers and alleged followers, had the most infamous of judges, Chief Justice Jeffries, hold court, who had 300 of them hanged, in many cases on the flimsiest or no evidence; and he commissioned Col. Kirke with his ruthless soldiers, ironically called Kirke's Lambs, to execute without trial anyone against whom suspicion was raised. Rewards to informers induced such, to secure them, to accuse hundreds of innocent persons, who were ruthlessly executed by Kirke's Lambs, they beating drums in harmony with the &quot;dancing&quot; of the toes of those being hanged. Thus Romanist James II introduced the second English &quot;reign of terror,&quot; Romanist &quot;Bloody Mary&quot; having introduced the first, in burning at least 283 Protestants and putting into prison and starving there thousands of other Protestants. He, determined to make Romanism the state religion, defied parliament's protests at his filling offices with Romanists against the Test Act, and prorogued it for refusing to vote him supplies, until he set aside his violations of that Act. He dismissed four judges of the King's Court who refused to justify his illegalities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(40) Thereupon he packed the court and got it to decide that he could override any law. Then he greatly increased his filling civil, military and naval offices with Romanists, including the appointment of four Romanist lords to the Privy Council. He ignored the law forbidding Romanist priests, monks, especially Jesuits, and nuns to live in England. He caused, against the law, Romanist churches and chapels to be opened and public Romanist worship to be therein held. He</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">opened a gorgeous chapel for his own Romanist worship in St. James Palace, and sought to force his Protestant officers to attend him there, dismissing those who refused. Riots being aroused through his lawless act, he had 13,000 soldiers stationed in London to overawe the objecting London populace. He set out vigorously to stamp out Protestantism in Scotland and Ireland by cruel persecutions. In Ireland all Protestant officers were dismissed from the army. In a short time every privy councilor, judge, mayor and aiderman in Ireland was a Romanist. Then he set out to overthrow the Anglican Church in England. Against the law he set up again the Court of High Commission, under the name of Ecclesiastical Commission, appointing thereto seven commissioners, with the infamous Jeffiies at their head. Then he forbade Protestant ministers to preach or speak against Romanism, and suspended the Bishop of London for refusing to suspend a dean who ignored this prohibition. Pressure from his Ecclesiastical Commission aroused bolder Protestant defiance, which asserted itself in numerous anti-Romanist pamphlets and sermons. Next, contrary to law, James II sought to Romanize the English universities, by appointing Romanist presidents and professors and fellows therein, which led to determined professorial and student resistance, which he arbitrarily and stubbornly fought with manifold schemes and acts. By 1687 his lawless, pro-Romanist and anti-Protestant course aroused nation-wide resistance. His willfulness paid no heed to the advice of moderate Romanists, including that of the pope, all of whom had good reason to fear that he was pulling down the house upon himself and them. He silenced the protest of parliament by frequent prorogations and finally dissolved it. He removed every Protestant who refused to sanction his lawlessness and installed Romanists in their places, even doing this in the case of his cabinet members and privy councilors. He made the Jesuit Petre, who had no legal right to be in England, a privy councilor, received the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">papal nuncio in state at Windsor, and dismissed the Protestant Duke of Somerset, who refused to do the lawless act of presenting him in the Chamber of Presence. Truly, it may be said of his course: Whom God is about to destroy He first makes mad.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(41) Discerning from his pro-Romanist and anti-Protestant lawless acts and words that his purposes were anti-English, the English people in all ranks set up a determined resistance. Despite his recommending and commanding by letter the governors of the Charter House, containing among them some of the greatest nobles of England, they refused to receive Romanists among their number. Even his most devoted Tories rebelled when he required of them as an evidence of loyalty that they renounce the Anglican and join the Romanist Church. He issued in the beginning and then toward the end of his reign Declarations of Indulgence, allegedly in the interests of all non-Anglicans, but intended, of course, to help Romanists, annulling all laws to the contrary; but Protestants of all parties, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., </span><span class="font3">Presbyterian Baxter, Congregationalist Howe, Baptist Bunyan and Quaker Fox, refused to accept or become beneficiaries of this illegal act. This failure made him seek the repeal of the Test Act. He caused such voting regulations to be set up as he thought would return only such parliamentary candidates as would vote to repeal this Act. On the magistrates' and Lord Lieutenants' refusing to lend themselves to such corruption of the ballot, he dismissed them and appointed compliant ones. But the voters elected a parliament that refused to rescind the T est Act.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) Thereupon he published a new Declaration of Indulgence, ordering every Anglican clergyman to read it from the pulpit to their congregations on two successive Sundays. Only about 200 out of 10,000 obeyed this order. In only four London churches was this attempted; but on the reading's beginning the four congregations arose and rushed out of the churches. The bishops supported their clergy in this refusal. The</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">primate, Archbishop Sandcroft, called the bishops together to form a protest at, and petition against such reading. But due to the shortness of the time only six bishops got to Canterbury, the primate's seat, in time. These seven ecclesiastics drew up a mild protest and humble petition and took them together in a body to James II. On receiving it the king cried out: &quot;It is a standard of rebellion,&quot; and had the seven committed to the Tower, which in those days was used as a prison for noble political prisoners, they refusing to furnish bail against such an unheard-of act of arbitrariness. All London and England supported them. The people knelt in the streets begging their blessing, both as they were taken to the Tower and from it to court for trial. Again the king rejected counsels of caution and mildness. Brought to the bar as criminals the bishops were, June 30, 1688, by the jury acquitted. This decision was celebrated throughout London with greatest demonstrations of joy and by parades, speeches and bon-fires. Horsemen departed from the city on the rendering of the verdict and published the news broadcast throughout England, everywhere demonstrations of joy and triumph occurring, as in London. Even the army of 13,000 troops, stationed in London to overawe the populace, joined with them in the celebrations, for which James removed it and broke up its companies and incorporated these soldiers into other companies at distant points, thus dispersing his special guard. These demonstrations convinced him that he was deserted by all ranks, callings and stations in England.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(43) Almost all English officials had by him been illegally appointed, which made their acts null and void; and to reestablish law in England a reversal of practically every public act, arrangement and appointment of his had to be made. He sought to punish by dismissal from office, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., </span><span class="font3">all who sided with the protesting and petitioning seven bishops. He sought to foist upon England an Irish army, which aroused further English resistance. Englishmen were patient and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">longsuffering with him, since he was old and might soon die, and his two Protestant daughters were next in line for succession to the throne. But the birth of a Prince of Wales in 1688 as the next heir to the throne, which engendered the fear that they would have another Romanist as king, convinced them that to save Protestantism and British liberty and to repel Romanism they must dethrone him. Leading statesmen, nobles, bishops, military and naval officers invited his son-in-law, William of Orange, the ruler of Holland, and his daughter, Mary, William's wife, to deliver England from James II and become England's king and queen. William and Mary, aware of James' plan to extirpate Protestantism and British liberty and enthrone Romanism, accepted this invitation. Seeing the drift of things James sought to reverse his course, but none trusted him, feeling sure that he was bending to the storm from necessity, and not conviction, and that as soon as the storm would subside he would re-embark on his former course. William landed with a Dutch army, which was quickly and hugely reinforced by English soldiers; for regiment after regiment forsook James and joined William. Panic-stricken, James fled London, but was, contrary to William's wishes, who felt that the simplest solution would be his flight to France, captured and brought back. To the relief of all the Protestant leaders, who did not desire his death, but his riddance, he again fled and this time reached France. Parliament declared that his oppressions, lawlessness and flight made his throne vacant. After William and Mary had promised to respect the English constitution and laws and preserve English liberty and Protestantism and had accepted a bill of rights for Englishmen, they were crowned king and queen.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(44) James' Romanist organization of Ireland's government made Ireland loyal to his cause. His Irish army plundered and slew Protestants right and left in the war that resulted in Ireland from his overthrow in England. In several sieges of Protestant dries, Londonderry</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">especially, their defenders and inhabitants were reduced to extreme famine, but held out until relieved by an English army that came to Ireland. James in an un-British spirit brought from France a French army to reinforce his Irish army. An indecisive campaign was carried on during 1689, but on William's arrival with reinforcements in 1690 the ride turned against the Irish and French army. The two armies came into battle at the River Boyne, July 12, and the Irish and French army was completely routed. Witnessing from a neighboring hill the battle and the defeat of his Irish and French army, James in cowardly flight escaped and left Ireland for France. In this battle William was wounded, but his generals followed up his victory with others and pacified the country. In the peace terms they allowed 15,000 Irish Romanist officers and soldiers to leave Ireland and enter the army of Louis XIV. Following this war the rebelliousness of the Irish Romanists against English rule was responsible for many repressive measures; and for a full century Romanist Ireland was thereby made a poverty-stricken and backward country, while Ulster became a prosperous and orderly Protestant country. In harmony with their promise not to keep a standing army in times of peace, except by parliament's consent, not to suspend any law without parliament's consent and not to rule without it, to call parliament in frequent session, faithfully to execute the law, to grant tolerance to all Protestants of whatsoever sect, to allow free and honest elections to, and debate in parliament, to enforce all anri-Romanist laws, to grant the right of petition, free speech, free press and assembly and to respect the bill of rights, William and Mary ruled in England as efficient king and queen.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(45) Indeed, William, called the III, was the rallying center and leader, not only of Protestant England and Holland, but also of all Protestant Europe, against Louis XIV, who sought to subjugate all Protestant countries under the Roman yoke. To this day his memory is kept green as the deliverer of British and European</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Protestantism; particularly in Ulster and wherever Ulstermen have emigrated he is held high as the deliverer of Protestant Ulster; and the names of his house, the house of Orange, and of the Battle of the Boyne are perpetuated by the Order of Loyal Orangemen. The constitutional reforms of the day of William and Mary undid all the Romanist and Romanizing measures of James I, Charles I and II and James II. And thus as a result they undid the autocracies of the Tudor and Stuart kings and reintroduced with marked additions the English liberties enjoyed by Englishmen during the days of the Plantagenets, from John Lackland's days, 1199-1204, to the first Tudor, Henry VII, 1485. The revolution of 1688 was accomplished in England without shedding one drop of blood and in contrast with &quot;the bloody revolution&quot; of 1616-1646, particularly in its violent form, 1641-1646, it is in English history called &quot;the Glorious Revolution.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(46) The main part of the fight in England between antitypical Jeroboam and Ben-hadad was from 1678 to 1688. The struggle, however, afterward took on international forms, due partly to the intrigues of James II and his son, whom his followers called James III, conducted mainly in France, and partly through the intrigues and wars of Louis XIV in his efforts to overthrow English, Dutch, Scandinavian and German Protestantism and to enthrone Romanism. The general results were the victory and strengthening of Protestantism and the general defeat and weakening of Romanism internationally. In 1701 the Act of Settlement excluded forever Romanists from the English throne. Throughout his reign William III opposed religious persecution, rightly reasoning that to force religious opinion benefits religion none at all and injures its enforcers and victims. During his reign, 16881702, the rights of the king, parliament and people were strictly defined and secured by law against usurpations of the king and lawlessness of the people. From then on the cabinet was not appointed by, and made responsible to the king,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">but by and to the House of Commons. Indeed, the reforms of this and the subsequent period of antitypical Jeroboam are the basis of America's Declaration of Independence and its constitution; and the Common Law of England, developed from many centuries of English experience, became the Common Law of the U. S. From these standpoints and those of the individual's &quot;inalienable rights&quot; [before human law] of &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot; England is very properly the mother country to America, even as for long she was generally thus called. Louis XIV's severe persecution of French Protestants, called &quot;Huguenots,&quot; especially after his revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which had guaranteed their liberty and other rights, solidified Protestant countries against his Romanist course. When at the death of James II, in 1701, Louis XIV proclaimed James' son king of England as James III, parliament for Louis' busy-bodying in English affairs declared James III and his descendants forever incapable of sitting on Britain's throne. During the war of the Spanish Succession, 1702-1714, caused in part by the Romanist ambitions of Louis XIV, he suffered an almost continuous succession of defeats from the Protestant powers, including England, Holland, parts of Germany and Scandinavia, which further weakened political Romanism.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(47) To the further strengthening of political Protestantism and weakening of political Romanism, England and Scotland (1707) united as the one kingdom of Great Britain, with religious liberty made operative in both countries, Anglicanism and Presbyterianism remaining the state churches in them respectively. During 1714-1716 the Jacobites, the name given to the supporters of James II and his son, the so-called James III, were very active in agitating for the latter's enthronement in Britain after the death of his stepsister, &quot;Good Queen Anne,&quot; the sister of William's Mary, and the last Stuart to sit on England's throne, who was in 1714 succeeded by George I, a German</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Protestant prince and the first British king of the Windsor family, still the reigning house of the kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Jacobites sought to dethrone him in favor of James, so-called III. First they demanded his enthronement instead of that of George I. In fact the Tory (Conservative) ministry plotted his enthronement, which led to its dismissal and the choice of a Whig (Liberal) ministry as the faithful upholders of the settlement of 1688.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(48) Tory riots followed in the Pretender's (James Il's son) interests, which grew into revolutionary uprisings in England and Scotland, and which was marked by the Pretender's landing in Scotland from France; but in both countries the revolutions were squelched, and the kingdom was saved the evil of another Romanist Stuart as king. Charles XII of Sweden plotted to invade Scotland and put the Pretender on the Scotch throne, but his plot came to an end through his death, Dec. 11, 1718. During 1718-1720 Britain waged war against Romanist Spain for its plots to put the Pretender on its throne. Spain's defeat resulted in the collapse of the plot, and the disappointment of the Pretender. In 1719 a bill passed parliament relieving Protestant dissenters from certain evils of the Test Act, still enforcing the fines of the Act, but returning the fines after they were paid. In 1723 Bishop Atterbury of the Rochester diocese, the leader of the Jacobites, was discovered in a plot to restore the Stuarts in the person of the Pretender and was deprived of his see and banished to France, where he continued without fruitage his Jacobite plots. He was on British soil their last able leader. During 1727-1729 Romanist Spain, again at war with Britain, sought to seat the Pretender on Britain's throne and arranged for an invasion, but its fleet was defeated, and Romanist James Stuart again failed to become Britain's king. By the next year (1730) he gave up all </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">personal</span><span class="font3"> efforts to gain that throne, and with that the triumph of antitypical Jeroboam was fully realized over</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">antitypical Ben-hadad, though his son without his father's cooperation, in 1745, led a futile insurrection in Scotland and England to instate him as Britain's king.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(49) Briefly will the foregoing discussion be connected as antitype with the type set forth in 2 Kings 14: 16, 23-29. Antitypical Jeroboam (II; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">strife of the people;</span><span class="font3"> 14: 16) certainly fittingly by the significance of the name led the great conflict of the Presbyterian Puritan revolutionaries as fighting the people's battles for freedom from Romanist autocracy. They were occupied with politics in their religious and liberty applications (reign in Samaria). But his course in many ways was evil, compromising in overmuch longsuffering, especially from 1683 to 1688; with antitypical Ben-hadad in the last three years of Charles II and the full three years of James II (did . . . evil, v. 24). Like the rest of the less favored movements of God's real people he followed the course of the first Lutheran movement in sectarianism and clericalism (sins of Jeroboam [I]). Nevertheless all of the conquests of antitypical Hazael (predominately religious Romanism) and Ben-hadad (predominately political Romanism) against antitypical Jehu, Jehoahaz and Jehoash he undid, and restored everything that they had undone throughout Protestant England (Hamath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fortress]</span><span class="font3"> unto the sea of the plain, the Dead Sea, v. 25). This was prophesied by Jonah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(dove),</span><span class="font3"> the son of Amittai </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(true,</span><span class="font3"> Jonah 1: 1), of Gath-hepher </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(■winepress of the pit),</span><span class="font3"> in a prophecy not recorded by him, though here mentioned. The Lord wrought this deliverance for His people in England, Scotland and Ireland out of deep sympathy for their oppressions (Lord saw the affliction . . . very bitter, v. 26), since no crown-loser (shut up) nor crown-retainer (any left) was able to deliver them (any helper for Israel), and God would not yet cast them off (blot out. . . Israel, v. 27).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(50) Hence He delivered them by the victorious revolutionaries of the Presbyterian Puritans, whose principles were adapted thereto (saved them by . . .</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Jeroboam), the successors of the revived revolutionary Presbyterian Puritans (son of Joash). The acts of antitypical Jeroboam (acts of Jeroboam, v. 28), their conflicts and victories (warred. . . recovered) in restoring to antitypical Israel all their belongings acquired by the Church as antitypical David of antitypical Judah (Damascus and Hamath . . . Judah), are described by very many historians, the ablest for the period of 1678-1702 being Lord Macaulay in his five-volumed History of England, entirely devoted to this period (written. . . chronicles . . . Israel). After a period of 52 years, 1678-1730, this phase of revolutionary Presbyterian Puritanism ceased to be the ascendant movement (slept, v. 29), and was succeeded for a short period by a Presbyterian Puritan movement that sought to have the Test Act, which was no more actually and finally enforced against them, repealed, 1730-1731 (Zachariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[remembrance of Jehovah]</span><span class="font3"> his son reigned in his stead).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(51) As shown above, in 1719, as a part of antitypical Jeroboam's activity, the non-Anglican sects— Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists and Quakers— received an amelioration of certain disadvantage that they incurred through the operation of the Test Act, which allowed only those to be civil, military and naval officers who conformedto the Anglican Church. Some members of these sects to have such offices rendered an occasional conformity, i.e., occasionally attended Anglican services, occasionally communed there and did other acts of occasional conformity. Strict Anglicans objected to this course, and had a bill passed fining such occasional conformity. Without annulling the Test Act a bill had in 1719 been passed returning these fines after they were imposed and paid. The antitypical Zachariah movement in 1730 began an agitation to set aside the Test Act altogether in its application to them, though they desired it to continue to operate against Romanists. They truly set forth as inducements to such an annulment the fact that they had always staunchly defended the principles of the 1688 revolution, &quot;the Glorious Revolution,&quot; and therefore should have its full benefits. The Whigs, then in power, under the leadership of Sir Robert Walpole, agreed with their view of the matter, but urged delay, as, they affirmed, conditions were not ripe for the change. This discussion went on for years, but by 1731 the Whigs were determined not to make the change; and all they would do was to soften the application of the Occasional Conformity Act, the government asserting that the Puritans had all the liberties and privileges extant, except their being the state church. And with this decision the antitypical Zachariah phase ended and with it ended the Presbyterian Puritan revolutionary movements as the most prominent movement among God's less favored people, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the antitypical Jehu dynasty ceased to operate, after winning for Britain some of its most prized and cherished features of liberty, and after crushing in Britain Romanist religious and political oppressions and other Romanist evils.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(52) The antitypical Zachariah phase lasted but a year, 1730-1731, the parallel year of typical Zachariah being 791-790 B.C. For the data on this phase see page 275-277 (Zachariah. . . reigned over Israel, 15: 8). Briefly will we connect the type with the facts presented in the preceding paragraph: The coming into the ascendancy of this phase of the antitypical Jehu dynasty as active in religio-political aspects is typed (Zachariah reigned. . . Samaria </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[watch tower}).</span><span class="font3"> It was guilty of the evils inherent in every phase of the antitypical Jehu dynasty (he did. . . evil... as his fathers had done, v. 9), and that while engaging in matters pertinent to the Lord (before the Lord). Nor did this movement give up the evils that the first Lutheran movement introduced, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e..</span><span class="font3"> it was guilty of sectarianism and clericalism, evils of which every one of the movements of God's less favored people were guilty and caused such people to commit (sins of Jeroboam . . . who made Israel to sin). The Whigs, especially</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">their leaders, purposely kept putting these Puritans off as to fulfilling their requests to have the Test Act annulled so far as Protestants were concerned (Shallum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[retribution]. . . </span><span class="font3">Jabesh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[dry]</span><span class="font3"> conspired against him, v. 10); and their decision fully made not to grant it was the public act that ended antitypical Zachariah (smote him before the people) and they briefly exercised the power of the most prominent movement in this aspect of their activity (reigned in his stead). The acts of antitypical Zachariah are recorded in the histories of this movement as those of this aspect the last one of the house of antitypical Jehu (acts . . . written. . . chronicles . . . Israel, v. 11). Thus was fulfilled a forecast that God made, probably through antitypical Elisha, that there would be four dominant policies carried out by those who had succeeded antitypical Jehu and worked for their principles (2 Kings 10:30). Anti typical Elisha did use antitypical Jehu's revolutions as an application and an arousement to the revolution that, beginning in 1616, came to a successful issue in 1646. It is therefore probable that they promised these four descendent policies to operate through the Presbyterian Puritans, though we do not know the writings or sayings in which this prophecy was made (word . . . spake . . . sons . . . throne., unto the fourth generarion, v. 12). So was it fulfilled (so it came to pass), as are all of God's prophecies.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(53) After having studied the parallels of Israel's kings of the Jehu dynasty, we now return to a consideration of the parallels of Judah's kings. A very brief review of the parallels of Judah's kings, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, will help us better to consider the Athaliah and Joash or Jehoash, parallels to which this study will be devoted. Jehoshaphat (939-914 B.C.) parallels the Congregational movement benevolent and helpful to the second phase of the Anglican movement (1582-1607). It began with Robert Browne, progressed through Henry Barrowe and came to an end in Francis Johnson before he became thoroughly reactionary,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">though the last seven years of the antitypical Jehoshaphat phase, from its becoming confederate with the second phase of the Anglican movement against the Romanists as antitypical Syrians, were accompanied by Francis Johnson's brand of Congregationalism reactionary as paralleling Jehoram's coregency with Jehoshaphat. Jehoram (of Judah, not Jehoram of Israel, 914-906 B.C.) parallels the Congregational movement thoroughly reactionary (16071615), wherein, misled into a quasi-Presbyterianism through Francis Johnson's aberrations and, into a quasiunionism with apostate churches through John Robinson's compromises, it showed a decidedly reactionary spirit. Ahaziah (906-905) parallels the Congregational movement autocratic (1615-1616), and as such associated with the fourth phase of the Anglican movement. Francis Johnson and John Robinson headed this phase of Congregationalism in Holland, and practically all England's Congregational leaders exemplified this phase of Congregationalism in England, where they battled side by side with the fourth Anglican movement (antitypical Jehoram of Israel) against the antitypical Hazael movement (Romanism) and the antitypical Jehu movement. In the conflict with the latter it came to an end, 1616. This is a brief review of the first three Congregationalist movements and brings us up to a fourth Congregational movement, which was, strange to say, that of a church, a symbolic woman, the Congregational Church at Leyden, Holland, presided over by John Robinson who was injuriously active in three Congregational movements: that of reactionism, that of autocracy and that of anti-separatism, the latter typed by Athaliah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(afflicted by Jehovah).</span><span class="font3"> The parallel dates are 905-898B.C. and 1616-1623 A. D.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(54) When the Leyden Congregational Church saw that both in England and in Holland autocracy was overthrown as a bad Congregational movement, it under the leading of John Robinson embarked on an anti-separatism movement. The faithful Congregationalists</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">were Separatists, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> they avoided all fellowship with the Anglican and other denominational movements. Their idea was that only that was a true church which was separate and distinct from all sectarianism, and which was united in justification and sanctification by a covenant Godward and fellowmemberward. Into this covenant they solemnly entered by the entire assembly clasping hands and binding themselves to obey the Lord, to put away evil and to walk in the light already had and yet to come. Hence they refused to fellowship with those not so covenanting with the Lord and one another, and holding membership in apostate churches, from which they had separated themselves. Hence they were called Separatists, and their theory and practice Separatism. During the seven years, 1616-1623, the Leyden Church, on seeing that Congregational autocracy was refuted, which it had mothered (Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah, 2 Kings 11: 1; 2 Chro. 22: 10), repudiated this theory and practice and their involved principles and practices (destroyed. . . royal). But the covenant, in its keepers, that Congregationalists had made (Jehosheba </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[oath of Jehovah],</span><span class="font3"> 2; 11, Jehoshabeath, a phonetic variation of the same name), which even Congregationalism reactionary held as a power of its own (daughter of king Jehoram), yea, which even Congregationalism autocratic cherished (sister of Ahaziah), resting in its adherents, laid hold on (took . . . stole), from among the repudiated policies (sons . . . slain), protected; even in secrecy, among God's people the principle and practice of Separatism (hid him), as well as those who ministered thereto (nurse), and kept them in the sphere of faith (bedchamber), against the repudiating activities of the Leyden Congregational Church (from Athaliah). Thus this covenant in its adherents, as a feature of Christ's Bride (wife of Jehoiada, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah knows),</span><span class="font3"> shielded the principle and practice of Separatism from repudiators (hid. . . him).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(55) The following are 16 of the principles and practices that the Leyden Church under John Robinson's leading repudiated, as can be seen in his and their theories and practices (sons . . . slain). He and they joined with the Dutch Reformed Church in fighting Arminianism in public debate, thus rejecting some advancing light, contrary to the covenant; he became a religious teacher in their university (combinationism), also against the covenant; they fellowshipped with the Dutch Reformed Church, which was also against the covenant; they took with them the Lord's Supper; advocated attendance reciprocally at church together; joined in prayer with them, though recognizing that they were not consecrated; in private and public they accepted God's nominal people as their brethren; offered fellowship to the Church of Scotland (a state church, thoroughly sectarian and sharply opposed to the covenant); offered church fellowship to the Church of England, the bitter persecutor of Congregationalism, and the executor of some of its leading lights; asserted that they would not have separated from the Church of England, if it had allowed them liberty to teach and preach their convictions and not bound them to its ceremonies and its creed; advised Congregationalists to attend Anglican Church services, taking part devoutly therein; advocated that elders be elected for life; to get sanction from James I to colonize New England with the pilgrim fathers, even agreed to accept the Anglican Episcopacy, as not of Divine but human right; as a church engaged in the secular business of colonization, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.;</span><span class="font3"> encouraged forming a Congregational denomination; and encouraged and practiced clericalism of a quasi-Presbyterian kind. Thus they repudiated vital Congregational principles flowing out of their idea of the nature of the Church as a company of saints separate and distinct from nominal churches and those owning fealty to them. Certainly, they repudiated the distinctive thing in the idea of the ecclesia as a company of God's saints that under Christ was mistress in her own midst, and that while fellowshipping with like ecclesias as brethren, yet remained free from all external union with them, and thus avoided constituting a denomination. The Leyden Church certainly repudiated these principles and practices and therein antityped Athaliah in murdering her grandchildren, but failing to kill Separatism's type.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(56) This teaching of Separatism was held secretly among the faithful for six full years, from 1616 to 1622 (hid in the house ... six years, 3; 12). And all this time the Leyden anti-separationist movement was the chief influence in the six involved years in the sphere of God's most favored people (Athaliah reigned over the land). But from April, 1622, to April, 1623, our Lord (seventh year Jehoiada, 4; 23: 1), first, strengthened Himself in His faithful (strengthened himself, ; 1), and, secondly, aroused the leaders in the four Amsterdam churches and the one London church (rulers over hundreds), especially the error-refutative leaders (captains [literally, Cherethites, executors], 4;) and the Truth-defending leaders (guard [literally, the runners, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Pelethites], 4;). These were the leaders of the Ainsworth ecclesia (Azariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[help of Jehovah] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Jeroham </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[cherished]</span><span class="font3"> ), those of the Johnson ecclesia (Ishmael </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[God hears] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Jehohanan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah favors}),</span><span class="font3"> those of the White ecclesia (Azariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[help of Jehovah] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Obed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[servile]</span><span class="font3"> ), those of the Smyth ecclesia (Maaseiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[deed of Jehovah] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Adaiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[ornament of Jehovah}),</span><span class="font3"> all four being ecclesias in Amsterdam, Holland, and those of the Jacob (London) ecclesia (Elishaphat </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[God judges] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Zichri </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[remembering}).</span><span class="font3"> These He bound to Himself by vows (made a covenant with them) with great solemnity (oath, 4;). This He did among God's people secretly (house of the Lord), and clarified and stressed to them the truth on Separatism (shewed them the king's son, 4;). These leaders busied themselves in the sphere of God's more favored people (went about in Judah, ; 2) and gathered therefrom to their support the other leaders (Levites [here used of all descendants of Levi], those technically called priests and Levites,; 2), as</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">well as all others of special influence but not leaders (chief of the fathers of Israel, ; 2). These they brought to the executive sphere of God's more favored people (Jerusalem, ; 2). All of the faithful of God's more favored people in their assemblies vowed loyalty to Separatism (all. . . covenant with the king in the house of God, ; 3). Jesus made clear to them that Separatism as a truth of the Lord would continue and prevail (king's son shall reign, ; 3), even as the Bible teaches of the principles of Apostles (Lord hath said of the sons of David, ; 3). Our Lord, according to their differing abilities, spirit and providential situations, gave them a fourfold work (a third part... a third part... a third part. . . two parts, 5-7; 4-6). The first of these activities was that of helping winnable people to come among the brethren (sabbath . . . porter of the doors, ; 4. . . gate behind the guard, 6;) ; a second was to defend Separatism against attacks as a matter of practice (king's house, ; 5 . . . watch of the king's house, 5;); a third was to attack the error as it would seek entrance among God's people (gate of Sur </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[entrance],</span><span class="font3"> 6;. . . gate of the foundation, ; 5); and the fourth was the regular work of the ministering priests to defend God's people in relation to Separatism as a matter of doctrine (two parts. . . sabbath. . . watch of the house . . . king, 7). And all of the other brethren, the non-official and non-influential brethren were mutually to defend one another against error and sin unto truth and righteousness as supporters of their abler brethren (people shall keep the watch of the Lord, ; 6). But none but the leaders were to do public service (none . . . save the priests . . . Levites, ; 6). These should do their consecrated service as public ministers of the Word (go in. . . holy, ;6).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(57) The subordinate leaders (Levites, ; 7) and the warriors (ye, 8;) were controversially (weapons in his hand) to serve in defense of Separatism in every phase of it (compass the king round about). Any one coming among God's people inimically disposed on the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">subject should be refuted forthwith (cometh. . . slain). They were especially to support and defend Separatism in every activity into which it might come (with the king . . . in. . . out). The warrior leaders of all the five involved ecclesias (captains, 9;), the subordinate ministering leaders (Levites, ; 8) and all of the rest of the Congregational movement (all Judah, ; 8) did as our Lord Jesus charged (Jehoiada . . . commanded) and the main sacrificing leaders also cooperated (in. . . and out on the sabbath); for the Lord Jesus kept the main leaders active in their varied services without intermission (dismissed not the courses, ; 8). Our Lord saw to it that all the main leaders were provided with controversial pen-products (spears, 10; 9) and immovable (bucklers, ; 9) and movable (shields, 10; 9) defensive armor, contained in the writings of the Apostles (king David, ; 9) and placed in the Church (house of God, 10; 9). These all came to our Lord for His present purposes (came to Jehoiada, 9;). Taking their positions as upholders of the sacrificing Christ and the Church (along by the altar, 11; 10) and of the brethren (temple) in support of Separatism on all sides (round about the king), the trained defenders (guard, 11;) and all other brethren (all the people) stood ready to defend the entire Church (right. . . temple . . . left. . . temple), fully armed for all eventualities (weapons in his hand). Then they began publicly to expound, prove and refute as to Separatism (brought forth the king's son, 12; 11), set it forth as the Divinely-authorized teaching (put the crown upon him), gave God's attestation to their act (testimony), and thus set it forth as the prevailing pertinent teaching (made him king). Jesus as High Priest and the Church as under-priests (Jehoiada and his sons, ; 11) gave to the teaching and practice of Separatism in its maintainers the full qualification of the necessary wisdom, power, justice and love for their pertinent work (anointed him). Then all the faithful demonstrated their approval and praise</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(clapped their hands, 12;) and prayed God's support upon Separatism as the prevailing Congregational teaching and practice (God save the king).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(58) When the Leyden Church Congregational antiseparatist movement perceived the demonstrations in favor of the separatist movement (Athaliah. . . noise, 13; 12), both of the official and non-official loyal ones (guard. . . people), by conduct and propaganda supporting Separatism (running and praising the king, ; 12), coming among them in the Church, it intervened among the demonstrators (came . . . into the temple). Their discussions revealed to its inquiring eyes of understanding in its adherents the doctrine and practice of Separatism (looked . . . king, 14; 13) as its position, as propounded by Robert Browne, its introducer (stood. . . pillar), who started the Little Flock movement (at the entering in, ; 13) later sectarianized by Henry Barrowe, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> even as was the case in such matters (as the manner was, 14;). The leaders and lecturers stood, advocating the Separatist movement (princes . . . king). And all Congregationalists, apart from those belonging to the Leyden Church, were very glad over the situation (all. . . rejoiced). All lecturers and conversationalists joined in such advocacy (blew the trumpets). Their preachers (singers,; 13) orally and by pertinent literature (instruments of music, ; 13) and those who acted as instructors in the school of prophets (taught to sing, ; 13) joined in the propaganda.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(59) On the Leyden Church movement's seeing what was going on, it as the anti-separatist movement did great violence to its graces in seeking to defend its position (rent her clothes), accusing the faithful as its betrayers and maligners (Treason, Treason). Jesus as High Priest then brought the leaders of the five above-mentioned churches in their warrior aspects into special and official prominence (brought out... set over the host, 15; 14) and charged them (charged. . . said) to attack it on its secular wrongs, those connected with</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">its concessions on policies and practices of church and state toward James I in their compromising efforts to have him sanchon their emigrating as pilgrim fathers to what became New England (Have her forth without the ranges [outside the temple]). He also charged these leaders to refute all who would defend it (followeth her kill. . . slain with the sword, 15; 14). He prohibited that it be attacked on special religious grounds (Slay her not in the house of the Lord). Taking this as the line of their attack, they in argument seized that compromising church (laid hands on her, 16; 15); and, avoiding special religious arguments, they led it forth (went by the way) to the teachings (horses came into the king's house . . . entering of the horse gate) pertaining to royal prerogatives and powers, in connection with which it compromised the Truth, and revealed its compromising and treasonable acts as against the Lord, the Truth and the brethren, and thus thoroughly refuted it (there was she slain... slew her there, 16; 15). The movement championed by the Leyden Congregational Church took its place as a decadent one; and in less than two years after its death-thrust, its chief spirit, John Robinson, died; and the semi-Presbyterian-Congregationalism that he through the pilgrim fathers transplanted to New England got a real Congregational teaching and practice nearly a hundred years later, through John Wise of Ipswich, Mass. During the first part of this brand of Mass.-Congregationalism it was guilty of great evils in persecuring dissenters unto banishment, e.g., if Roger Williams, and even unto death, e.g., Quakers; and its witch huntings, trials and executions have made, among others, Salem, Mass., a blot on Massachusetts' early reputation. Certainly these facts prove that the Leyden brand of Congregationalism was decadent and ceased to be the most prominent movement of God's more favored people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(60) Our Lord Jesus effected an agreement between Himself as God's Representative, and thus between</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">God (made a covenant between him ... the Lord, 17; 16), and the separatist movement and the loyal Congregationalists. On God's part this was an acceptance of the separatist movement as the more favored movement of God's people, and of the people as adherents of that movement. On the movement's and the people's part it was an agreement to believe and practice according to the responsibilities and privileges of being the more favored movement of God's people in Congregationalism (people . . . king . . . Lord's people). It also implied on the part of the movement and its adherents that they be loyal to one another as to Separatism as a teaching and practice (king . . . people, 17). These brethren in loyalty to their agreement entered the sphere of power-grasping and lording it over God's people as it was exemplified in Romanism, Anglicanism and Presbyterianism (went to the house of Baal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[/ord],</span><span class="font3"> 18; 17); and, first, utterly refuted these as spheres of Biblical theories and practices (brake it down) and refuted the ideas of their adherents that their respective churches were the true Church (brake his altars) and refuted their false creeds (image in pieces) from top to bottom (thoroughly, 18;); and, secondly, utterly refuted their hierarchy and clergy (slew Mattan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gift)</span><span class="font3"> as they were exercising their offices in the interests of their respective churches (before the altars). Our Lord arranged for the public ministrations in the Church (appointed. . . offices . . . Lord, 18; 18) through the main leaders (by the hand of the priests the Levites [here the priests are set forth as descendants of Levi, not their assistants who are technically and usually called Levites ]), according to the arrangements of the Apostles as set forth in the Bible (whom David had distributed [in 24 courses] . . . Lord, ; 18). Their work was to offer sacrifices manifesting God's approval of Jesus' sacrifice (burnt offerings), as Jesus indicated in the New Testament writings (as . . . law of Moses, ; 18). These offerings were administered as a joyous privilege (with rejoicing,; 18)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and with preaching of the Word (singing, ; 18), even as the Apostles had arranged (by David). They also arranged for evangelists to lead new ones through repentance and faith unto justification (porters at the gates, ; 19), that they might admit no unjustified, impenitent and disfellowshipped ones into the courts of the Lord's house (unclean. . . should enter,; 19).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(61) These arrangements for a proper ecclesiaism having been set into operation, another thing was done to make complete the reformation initiated by our Lord among Congregationalists: To put Separatism into its proper place as the prevailing policy and movement among God's more favored people; for separatism was not to be merely a prevailing theory; it was also to be made a prevailing practice. And this is set forth in 19, 20; 20, 21. This work was participated in by all, but in an orderly way, i.e., with all in harmony with their places in the Church. First, the main leaders in each of the five involved ecclesias as controversialists, both in parrying off attacks and in refuting the errorists (rulers. . . captains of hundreds [instead of the translation, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;and</span><span class="font3"> captains&quot; (19;), it should be, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;even</span><span class="font3"> captains&quot;], 19; 20), took the most prominent part in putting Separatism as a principle and a practice into operation. Next, the less prominent defenders acted to the same end (guard, 19;). Following these, thirdly, the most prominent unofficial brethren contributed their share in this good work (the nobles, ; 20). Strangely enough, fourthly, the elders in these five ecclesias, who in zeal for this work we would think should have preceded the more prominent unofficial brethren, came after the latter in support of this work (governors of the people, ; 20). And, finally, the nonprominent brethren of the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit gave their cooperation to the work at hand (all the people of the land). All of these cooperated to make Separatism the prevailing Congregationalist movement among God's more favored people (brought down the king) as a thing that operated</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">not simply in religious relations (from the house of the Lord). They exalted (came through the high gate, ; 20) the teaching and practice of Separatism by means of those who defended the pertinent teaching and practice (way. . . guard) and put it into the sphere of polity controllership (king's house), and constituted it as the Divinely-authorized separationist movement (set the king upon the throne,; 20); and in its adherents the separatist movement among Congregationalists exercised this Divinely-authorized power as it did also among other movements of God's more favored people internally and externally (sat on the throne of the kings, 19;). This condition made all loyal Congregationalists very glad (people . . . rejoiced, 20; 21); and peace reigned in the sphere of Separatism's executiveship (the city was quiet) after they had thoroughly refuted the Leyden Congregationalist Church's antiseparatist movement (slain. . . slew Athaliah) with the Word of Truth (sword) on prevailing policy matters (king's house, 20;).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">JOASH OF (JUDAH). AMAZIAH. WAR BETWEEN AMAZIAH AND JOASH (OF ISRAEL)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">HAVING studied the overthrow of the anti-separatist Congregationalist movement, as antitypical Athaliah, by the Separatist Congregational movement, as antitypical Joash, or, Jehoash </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jehovah supports'),</span><span class="font3"> and the installation of the latter as the more favored movement of God's people, we are now ready to study the further history of this latter movement, whose forty years' period of preeminence in Congregationalism was from 1623 to 1663, paralleling the reign of typical Joash, 898-858 B.C. (2 Kings 11: 21— 12: 1; 2 Chro. 24: 1). Separatism's preeminence was divided into two parts, the first of which consisted of its period of loyalty to the principle of separatism (1-16), and the second of which consisted of its period of disloyalty to that principle (17-21; 17-27) . During this time it exercised its preeminence in the sphere of executiveship among God's more favored people (Jerusalem, 12: 1; 1) and began it properly (seven years, 11: 21; 1). The doctrine of consecration mothered this movement, which doctrine is closely related to the truth of the Oath-bound Covenant (Zebiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah],</span><span class="font3"> Beersheba </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[well the oath]).</span><span class="font3"> As long as this movement recognized and accepted Jesus as its High-priestly Leader and Teacher it did right in the Lord's service (right. . . Lord. . . Jehoiada </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Yahweh knows] . . . </span><span class="font3">instructed him, 2; 2). Our Lord enlisted in its support nonsectarian consecrated Anglicans and nonsectarian consecrated Puritan Presbyterians (Jehoiada . . . two wives, ; 3), by whom it developed various</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">movements, e.g., movements against sectarian Anglicanism, Puritan Presbyterianism, Romanism, in the activities of Christianizing the parliamentary army and of civil and religious liberty as against Charles I's and the Anglican hierarchy’s tyranny (begat sons) and various powers toward parliament, its army and its church and for the rights of existence, conscience, propaganda and controversy (daughters). Nevertheless it permitted without remonstrance denominations to flourish in its sphere of executiveship and in the sphere of its teachings (high places Were not taken away, 3;) ; and it allowed its adherents to minister therein (people still sacrificed) and to offer their choice powers in the interests of denominationalism (burnt incense). Marked illustrations of these things are seen in its parliamentary members' working on forming a new national church and some of its leaders, 11 able men, as members of the Westminster Assembly, helping to form parts of the Westminster Confession and its two catechisms, the main creed of English-speaking Presbyterians.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) The Separatist movement shortly after overthrowing antitypical Athaliah (after this, ; 4) was determined to repair the damage done to God's people as His temple (minded to repair the house of the Lord), which damage were made by the followers of the movement that John Robinson led as the leader of antitypical Athaliah; for the followers of that evil movement (sons . . . wicked woman, ; 7 [as the wife of Jehoram of Judah and the mother of his children; all of Athaliah's children, except Ahaziah (also called Jehoahaz), were slain during Jehoram's lifetime by the Arabians (2 Chro. 21: 17; 22: 1); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">accordingly,</span><span class="font3"> we understand the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sons</span><span class="font3"> here to mean certain subordinates of Athaliah, those who had her spirit]) had by the evils, introduced among God's people and set forth in our discussion of 2 Kings 11 and 2 Chro. 22: 10-23: 21, done untold harm to God's people as His temple (broken up the house of God) and had</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">perverted the things consecrated to God by His people to the use of power-graspers and lords over God's heritage (dedicated things. . . bestow upon Baalim [/ords']). Accordingly, the Separatist movement attracted the attention of the main and subordinate leaders of the movement (gathered . . . priests and the Levites, ; 5) to the work of getting for the repairing of God's people as His temple (repair the house of your God) the things of God's people as classes (cities of Judah) and individuals (all Israel) adapted to such work—the things of their humanity and of their new-creaturely possessions and abilities applicable to such work. Included among such latter things were the pertinent Scripture passage and their new-creaturely pertinent oral and written teachings (money). These they were to assemble at all opportune times (year to year). This antitypical money was the applicable things of God's people's consecrations given for temple uses (dedicated things. . . house of God, 4;), re., their applicable abilities (passeth the account) according to the Lord's and His people's judgment (every man is set at), even everything that was freely and willingly devoted to the purpose at hand (cometh. . . heart. . . house). These were the things that the main leaders were to take into their charge (Let the priests take it to them, 5;) from all whose abilities the main leaders knew (of his acquaintance); and they were to use these as available to repair the damage done the Church (repair breaches), regardless of where these damage existed (wheresoever . . . found). They were charged to do this work expeditiously (hasten, ; 5); but the subordinate leaders did not hasten therein (Levites hastened not). The work dragged along from shortly after 1623 until 1646, the year of Charles I's complete defeat and the time that the dissenting Congregationalist leaders withdrew from the Westminster Assembly (three and twentieth year. . . not repaired . . . house, 6;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) Varifold were the reasons why this work dragged on. The first of these was the persecution that the Congregationalists in England had to endure at the hands of James I and Charles I, goaded on by the Anglican hierarchy, especially by Archbishop Laud and his Star Chamber Court and High Commission Court. The second of these was their preoccupation in the debates that then agitated the British people between the civil and religious liberty-lovers in and out of parliament and the tyrannyexercisers, especially Charles I and the Anglican hierarchy. The third of these was the years-long revolution between parliament and its supporters, on the one hand, and Charles I and his supporters, on the other hand. The fourth of these was the participation of eleven among ablest Congregationalist leaders in the Westminster Assembly, working for years on the Westminster Confession and its two catechisms. The five main leaders among these eleven were Nye, (Thomas) Goodwin, Bridge, Simson and Burroughs, called the dissenting brethren, who had as Congregationalists a most strenuous debate with the Presbyterian majority in that Assembly, and who finally withdrew from it shortly before it was at long last adjourned, because they would not endorse its majority-adopted Presbyterian order of church government. Other able Congregationalists then active, though not members of that Assembly, were Howe and (John) Owen, the latter being perhaps the greatest one of all of Congregationalist theologians. The fifth reason for their delay was that very many Congregationalist ministers were chaplains in the parliaments army, which increasingly became Congregationalist, until the vast bulk of it was such by the end of the fighting part of the revolution, 1646. Oliver Cromwell increasingly became a main lay Congregationalist leader, until he became, through his victories and elevation to be head of the English Commonwealth, their lay leader by preeminence, despite the fact that the puritan Presbyterians</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">were the leaders of the less favored movement of God's people (Levites hastened it not, ; 5).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) This delay to repair the damage wrought among God's people as His temple by antitypical Athaliah and her supporters greatly weighed upon Separatism and its leaders and leadings (king Joash, 6) and moved it to appeal to Jesus as High Priest and to the main leaders under Him (called for Jehoiada . . . priests, , the chief, ; 6), asking why they did not repair these damage (Why. . . breaches, 7) and why Jesus did not have the subordinate leaders make available for this work, of the human and new-creaturely abilities, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (Why. . . Levites, ; 6), of God's more favored people and those of them in their executive sphere (Judah . . Jerusalem, ; 6), those things (collection) adapted to restoring temple breaches, even as Jesus and God's people had charged throughout the Gospel Age to be done for the erection of the antitypical Gospel-Age Tabernacle (commandment of Moses . . . congregation . . . tabernacle, Ex. 35: 4-29; 36: 3-6). The main Congregational leaders had appropriated to themselves for their uses, as indicated in their activities set forth in the preceding paragraph, things in the human and new-creaturely abilities, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> consecrated by their supporters to the Lord. This antitypical Joash forbade to be done any more (receive no more money of your acquaintance, 7) but commanded them to cause these things to be made available to restore the Church as God's temple (deliver . . . breaches). Recognizing the propriety of this charge, the main leaders agreed to make no more these consecrated things available to their own uses (consented to receive . . . people, 8;), except to make them available to restore God's people as His temple to an orderly condition (neither [literally, except, as the connection clearly shows] to repair ... the house). Thereupon at the recommendation of antitypical Joash (king's commandment, ; 8) and by Jesus' cooperation (Jehoiada, 9;) a committee, as a school of the prophets, was suggested to be appointed in each ecclesia (chest, 9; 8), suitable to receive (bored a hole, 9;) by its leaders (lid, 9; ) whatsoever offerings in money, Scripture passage, talents, discourses, pen-products, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> were presented. These were made available for use to repair the aforesaid damage done God's people as His temple. This arrangement was decided on for every ecclesia (set beside [to the east, at the gate not to the north or south side in the court] the altar, 9; ) in relation to consecration, so that it would include those about to consecrate, as well as those already consecrated (set it without at the gate, ; 8, as one cometh into the house, 9; ). These committees, as schools of the prophets, it was planned, were to be dominated by love (to the right side, 9;—in the type the chest was located east of the altar, not in the court, but outside the gate that corresponds to the tabernacle's gate of the court, but so located that if a straight line were drawn eastward along the north side of the altar and projected to and outside the gate, the chest, at the right, would be north of that line, i.e., toward the north side of the temple, which symbolizes love). And those main leaders who did evangelistic work were planned to be used to supervise the offering made in each committee as a school of prophets (priests . . . door . . . put. . . brought, 9; ). These schools of prophets were, as decided on, conducted in a manner similar to our suggestions in these columns as to how schools of prophets should be conducted in Epiphany ecclesias.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(13) These arrangements having been decided on, everywhere among God's more favored people (through Judah, ; 9) and in their sphere of executiveship (Jerusalem) it was widely advocated (proclaimed) to make available such offerings as their schools of prophets had prepared (collection) for the Lord's service (bring in to the Lord), even as Jesus had taught personally and by His special mouthpieces, the Apostles and other star-members, should be done during the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Gospel Age with the consecrated people's human all and their new-creaturely attainments, etc. (Moses . . . laid. . . wilderness). This work of agitation heard by all the leaders and all the leadings (princes . . . people, ; 10), first, made them very glad indeed (rejoiced), and, secondly, in the spirit of joyful cooperation they arranged for such committees, as schools of the prophets, in all the ecclesias, many offering themselves as trainees (brought in), making in them the pertinent human all and new-creaturely attainments available by training to be fruitfully used to restore the Church from its damage (cast into the chest); and this good work was continued to a completion with remarkable success as to a fine spirit shown and a great increase of members won (made an end), e.g., even the privates, as well as the officers, in the parliamentary army became through this method of training for God's service so well developed in their ability to explain and defend their truths and to refute the opposing errors that they confounded all opponents, puzzling even Richard Baxter, the ablest Presbyterian divine of his and most other times. These soldiers became very able preachers and expounders of the Word, using much of their time in its study and proclamation. The same is true of the non-military members of the Congregational ecclesias of England. Their propaganda resulted in an immense increase of Congregationalists in Britain.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) When it, was brought to the administrative attention of antitypical Joash (saw, 10;, brought unto the king's office, ; 11) that a very generous response was made in volunteering their pertinent human all and their new-creaturely abilities and possessions in the school of prophets (much money in the chest, 10; , much money, ; 11), ministered to by the subordinate leaders as leaders in such schools (the Levites), Separatism's scholarly representatives (king's scribe, 10;) and the Lord Jesus' representatives (high priest's officer, ; 11) saw to the graduation of fit ones from such schools of prophets (emptied the chest, ; 11) and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">gave them diplomas to the branches of service to which each was specially fitted, e.g., some as teachers, some as evangelists, some as catechists, some as extension workers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (put up in bags, 10;) and described the available talents, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (told [counted] the money), usable for and in the Church (house, 10;); and then installed these into their places of service in the Church (carried it to his place, ; 11). This was repeatedly done, whenever these sons of the prophets were fitted for their several places of service (did day by day, ; 11). These schools of prophets proved to be an abundantly fruitful means of providing the necessary talent for the Lord's pertinent service (gathered money in abundance,; 11). Antitypical Joash and our Lord (they, 11; , the king and Jehoiada, ; 12) put these talents so described (told, 11;) into the charge of their leading brethren in the service (gave . . . did the work. . . oversight). These put these talents into the hands of those who worked along lines of justification (laid it, 11;, hired, ; 12, carpenters and builders) and of new-creatureship (masons and hewers of stone, 12;, masons, ; 12), in order that they might win new justified ones and new consecrated ones (to buy timber and hewed stones, 12;). This was done to replenish the Church (repair the breaches of, 12; , repair the house of the Lord, ; 12). Especially did they employ these talents to put the workers into a position to make strong those justified ones that they had won (such as wrought iron and brass, ; 12, all laid out... to repair, 12;); and so did they seek to restore the Church unto a sound condition (mend the house, ; 12, repair it, 12;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) Accordingly, the involved pastors, the teachers, ruling elders, teaching elders, and their helpers, worked upon the Church and repaired completely the damage that were wrought upon it by antitypical Athaliah and her subordinates (wrought. . . perfected, ; 13). According to the view of the Congregationalists, not seeing that Eph. 4: 11, as the Greek indicates, uses the terms </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">pastors</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">teachers</span><span class="font3"> synonymously, and taking them to mean two different kinds of officers in the ecclesias, such officers among Congregationalists were: first, pastors; second, teachers; third, ruling elders (the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ruling</span><span class="font3"> in passage that suggest such elders is a mistranslation; it should be given as presiding, in the sense of administering officially); fourth, teaching elders (here, again, they were not clear, for all elders were pastors, or teachers); fifth, deacons, and sixth, deaconesses. From among the ruling elders, as a rule, the secretary and treasurer were appointed. They developed the Church into a good condition in grace, knowledge and service (set... in his state) and then strengthened it therein (strengthened it). But up to this stage of the work they had not prepared refutative writings (bowls of silver, 13;), corrective writings (snuffers), doctrinal writings (basons) or other, i.e., ethical, writings (vessels) of Divine Truth (gold. . . silver) and the announcements of special teachings by lecturers (trumpets), from the talents made available for such work for the Church (money. . . house), since up to this time the main and great stress was laid as to the use of these talents on the Truth workers to repair the damage that the Church had sustained (gave . . . workmen, and repaired . . . house, 14;). There was such fidelity (dealt faithfully, 15; ) shown by those supervising brethren who were commissioned to oversee the work of placing these talents into the hands of the pastors, teachers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> under appointment by antitypical Joash and our Lord Jesus, that they needed not censoriously to be rebuked, nor suspiciously to be overseen (reckoned not with the men . . . delivered . . . bestowed on workmen). And after the work on the Church was completed (finished) they made available the remaining and pertinent talents (brought the rest of the money, ; 14), before the Separatist movement and Jesus as High Priest (king and Jehoiada); and by these were made doctrinal, refutative, corrective and ethical writings, even teachings</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(vessels) to advance the Church in every good word and work (for the house). These written and oral teachings served to advance the brethren (vessels to minister), to delight the Lord as antitypical censers to bum acceptable incense before the Lord (to offer) and especially to help all along ethical lines (spoons); for they consisted of Divine truths. The main workers on these antitypical vessels were John Owen and Thomas Goodwin, who were the leading professors and executives of the Oxford University at that time. Other able assistants of these were Philip Nye, William Bridge, Sydrach Simson and John Howe. Especially did John Owen and Thomas Goodwin do extraordinarily able work as authors.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(16) The advantage that came from the reformatory deeds of those that had to make good for wrong-doing (trespass money, 16; ) and the advantage that arose from the privilege of sharing with the Lord in the sin-offerings did not accrue to the generality of the Congregationalists (was not... house); for these fell to the lot of the Congregationalist main leaders; for the wrong-doers (trespass), among other things, had to give up their positions, which fell to the lot of the main leaders among the Congregationalists, e.g., Owen and (Thomas, not John) Goodwin were given the highest positions at the Oxford University, that the former wrong-doing incumbents had to give up for their wrong-doing. So, too, were similar changes made in favor of able Congregationalist preachers as to important pulpits for the wrong-doings of former incumbents. And because certain Congregationalist leaders suffered much persecution in the sin-offering (sin money) they were promoted in those days following the ascendancy of the Puritans and Independents (it was the priests'). And as long as the Congregationalists continued to enjoy the approval of Jesus (all the days of Jehoiada, ; 14), they served in ways that received the manifestation of God's approval in the blessings that He bestowed upon them (offered burnt offerings</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">. . . Lord). And Jesus exercised an approving ministry for many years among the Congregationalists, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> from 1582 to about 1652 (waxed old... an hundred and thirty years old, ; 15). And during about 60 years of this period, for the most part poor, few and persecuted, they held up the light of Truth as due and lived exemplary lives. But their apostasy, typed further on in this chapter, made Jesus withdraw from them His special favor (died). Nevertheless, the earlier and more holy days of Congregationalism were held in great esteem and reverence as being closely apostolic (buried. . . City of David, ; 16), even as days in which it enjoyed the privilege of being God's most favored movement (among the kings), because those days were such as contained much good done to God's people (done good in Israel), toward God (God) and the Church (house).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) As we saw above, so long as antitypical Joash (the policy of Separatism in its adherents) was loyal to God, Jesus supported it, but after it had proved fully disloyal, He forsook it entirely. This disloyalty was a gradually increasing one; and as it progressed Jesus' abandoning it progressed; and both of them progressed unto their separate completions (after the death of Jehoiada, ; 17). Antitypical Joash degenerated proportionately as it increased in popularity with the people and with great ones (; princes of Judah) who became more and more affiliated with it and rendered it subservience (; made obeisance to the king); for the leading men in the English government, e.g., Cromwell, the Lord Protector of the Commonwealth, his leading assistants in parliament, on the bench and in the council, as Congregationalists, did so. The leading men in the army and in commerce were mainly Congregationalists, and as such were also subservient to Separatism for a while. But mainly on account of the majority of Englishmen not being Congregationalists these leaders thought it good politics to blunt the edge of Separatism, and accept all Protestants into membership in the state church, which, accordingly, they desired to consist of Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists, but all holding to their own peculiar views and not engaging in controversy with one another. These leaders sought to persuade Separatism in its members to cooperate as parts of such a unionistic and compromising state church. It in them submitted to such persuasion (; hearkened). In this we see the danger of worldly popularity coming to, and of great ones coming among, God's people. It was an expression of the old Satanic trick repeated from Greek and Roman Catholicism in every Protestant sect, as it became popular, as witness Lutheranism in Germany and Scandinavia, Zwinglianism in Zurich, Calvinism in Switzerland, Holland, England and Scotland, Episcopalianism in England, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> The Church has always been purest when unpopular and persecuted! God's people should avoid worldly popularity and the favor of worldly great ones as evil.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(18) As a result Congregationalists neglected building up God's people (; left the house . . . God, v. 18) along the lines of the Congregational principles held from the earliest days of Congregationalism up to that time (; fathers). Thus they entered into a combinationistic alliance, which is symbolic fornication (Rev. 2: 20-23; 17: 3-6, 15, 16, 18; 18: 3, 9; 19: 2, 3) , with Episcopalianism, Presbyterianism and Baptistism arid the English Commonwealth, as the English government, people and country were then called, to all of which it and its members ministered (; served groves,—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Asheraism.</span><span class="font3"> where in the type fornication and adultery were committed as parts of the religious rites of heathenism); and they also served the creed idols of these denominations, as well as made a new one of their own (; idols). E.g., Congregationalists, like John Howe, an exceedingly eloquent and learned man and Cromwell's court preacher, and John Owen and Thomas Goodwin, very able theologians, advocated a corporate union of the four above-mentioned denominations.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">And had the Lord not interfered, this purpose would probably have been effected. But this disloyalty aroused God's displeasure (; wrath) against the Congregationalist people (; Judah) and the sphere of Separatism's executiveship (; Jerusalem). This wrath expressed itself in giving them up to various hallucinations, strifes, divisions and losses, thus marring the Spirit of the Lord which had been so richly apparent among them. This strife also affected their connections with other churches and with the arrangements of the state within itself and in its relations to Separatism and these churches, e.g., changes from some to other legislative organizations in the Commonwealth. Thus their disloyalty met with a deserved retribution. But amid wrath God remembers mercy, and, accordingly, raised up preachers who lodged protests against this apostasy (sent prophets . . . testified against them, ; 19), with entreaties to reformation and a return to truth, righteousness and holiness (; to bring . . . Lord). But these were not heeded (; would not give ear).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(19) Only one of these protesting preachers is typed as an individual (Zechariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[remembrancer, reminder, of Jehovah,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to his constantly reminding the people of God's relations to them], ; 20), though other preachers also protested (; vs. 19, 25). This special protester was George Fox, the Little Flock member who started the Little Flock movement later perverted by crown-lost leaders into the Quaker sect. From early years of youth he sought to come into close fellowship with the Lord, and began as early as 1647, when 23 years of age, to preach and teach consecration and heart religion as opposed to dead formalism, mouth religion and unsanctified living. He traveled as a real pilgrim from place to place, preaching in churches whenever permitted, in open fields, in cemeteries, in the market places of towns and cities and in private homes. His godly life, simple speech and fearlessness amid much persecution attracted consecrated people, mainly of the humbler walks of life,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">to his movement, which gained increasing numbers of people. Classes of believers were organized and a new ministry of itinerants like himself arose; and soon the Friends, as they were called, became a great influence for consecrated living; and as their influence increased their persecution, egged on by the clergy, increased. Everywhere jails were filled with these godly confessors of Christ and the life hidden with Christ in God. Fox himself was repeatedly jailed and whipped, experiences undergone by many of his brethren also. They were surely &quot;a sect everywhere spoken against.&quot; In general they were persecuted for righteousness, though, as in all Little Flock movements, some fanatics associated themselves with them and by their follies brought upon all of them needless reproach. Everywhere the real Friends were recognized as exemplary Christians. Their conscientious objection to bearing arms, to taking oaths and to indulging in polite forms of speech and in forms of etiquette toward the great, like refusing to address them by their honorary designations, like, Your Worship, My Lord, Your Honor, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to take off their hats, kneel and then stand up and remain standing in their presence, made them much reproached, and in not a few cases led to their imprisonment, charged with contempt of court. At one time there were 12,000 of them in prison. They rebuked sin in the high and low alike; they protested against the dearth of true religion, so general at that time; they inveighed against a paid ministry, especially one supported by tithes levied by the state, as was the case then in England. Particularly did they attack union of state and church as symbolic fornication.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) In all of this George Fox led the way, as was proper in the case of a star-member; for as such there rested a large measure of the Lord's Spirit upon him (Spirit of God came [literally, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">clothed]</span><span class="font3"> upon, ; 20). True to the antitype of the meaning of his typical name, he, as Jesus' special representative (; Zechariah the son of Jehoiada), continually kept reminding the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">people of Jehovah and the things of Jehovah's Word, as far as he understood that Word, in order to turn them away from their creed idols and their combinationism. In this he occupied high spiritual grounds, far above those occupied by the nominal people of God in those days (; above the people). Many were his Bible grounded expostulations as God's mouthpiece against the evils of his day (; said. . . saith God). He reasoned with them against their evil course (; Why transgress ye), proving from Scriptures, reason and facts that they were by their deeds violaring God's Word (; commandments of the Lord). He pointed out that because of their creed idolatry and their combinationism they were not prospering, nor could they prosper, in grace, knowledge and fruitfulness in service (cannot prosper). Then he pointed out the facts, that they had forsaken the Lord, in that instead of being faithful to the principles of Separatism they had given these up in the interests of a union of state and church, which was symbolic fornication, and that instead of holding in all simplicity and faithfulness to the teachings of God's Word, as formerly, they had resorted to creedal sectarianism, which was idolatry, and that instead of holding fast to the Lord's people as God's temple and to their services of Truth as such, they were giving their all to building up the nominal people of God in a service that advanced false religion. By these charges repeatedly made and factually, reasonably and Scripturally proven, he charged them with forsaking God (; forsaken the Lord). He then pointed out that because of this forsaking of God by the abovementioned sins God had forsaken them, which he proved by the facts that God had given them up to everincreasing sins, errors, false worship, an evil organization and bad practices (; forsaken you).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(21) Unless humble and meek, wrong-doers resent rebuke and correction, however lovingly intended and kindly made. And those wrong-doers with whom Fox had to deal were neither humble nor meek; hence they greatly resented his rebukes and corrections. Above 16521654 were given as the time of the full fall of Separatism; but we are not to understand that it was a sudden thing. It began about 1648, but very subtly, almost imperceptibly, and progressed slowly by increasing compromises, until such compromises were full, during 1652-1654. Its increasing falling progressed with the increasing political power of Congregationalist secular leaders, especially that of Oliver Cromwell. The Spirit of the Lord in Fox perceived varying situations at the beginnings, progress and fulness of this apostasy. And his rebuke and correction of it were also progressively increasing ones, having a very small beginning and gradual progress unto a completion, increasingly accommodating themselves to the progress of the apostasy. In other words, while the type was progressive in fulfilling, the antitype was also progressive and long-drawn-out. Usually while types are quickly enacted, antitypes almost invariably are long-drawn-out matters. Already late in 1648 he mildly began his rebukes and corrections; but as the apostasy increased his rebukes and corrections increased in their vigor and severity, until he was most uncompromising in them. Such has always been the course of God's mouthpieces toward the unfaithful leaders and leadings among God's nominal people, as we can see in the course of Jesus, Paul, Arius, Claudius of Turin, Marsiglio, Wessel, Luther and the Parousia and Epiphany Messengers. In this they simply reflected God's increasing displeasure of the wrong-doers. And as these rebukes and corrections increased, so did the persecutions with which they were answered. They started with contradictions, proceeded to minor violences at the hands of individuals, later by mobs rioting against him, hurling literal stones, garbage, foul eggs and refuse at him. They came to a head in arresting, trying, sentencing and imprisoning him often, the first time in 1649, at Nottingham. He was also beaten at the order of various officials, especially of magistrates and judges.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) Mayors, aidermen, sheriffs, magistrates, judges and army officers were his special accusers and persecutors. Going up and down the country, somewhat after the manner of a pilgrim, except that he traveled by foot, preaching and teaching in rebuke and correction of the above-mentioned sins, errors, formal worship, union of state and church, state tithing for the support of ministers, creed idols, among which he counted churches, called by him &quot;steeple houses,&quot; false church organization and discipline, he was very offensive to the church and civil officers. These put their heads together (conspired against him, ; 21) to cut him off from his ministry. Not accepting clerical ordination at the hands of any ecclesiastical body, he was considered as a usurper of the clerical office by the adherents of the sects then in more or less power. Hence this, added to his rebukes and corrections, made him a target of every strict sectarian who felt himself wronged by him. Usually &quot;rude fellows of the baser sort&quot; brought charges against him almost everywhere he went. And the civil officials were only too glad to jail him in vile prisons, where he was treated as the worst of criminals with great cruelty and neglect. There was an understanding reached by such civil officers to treat him with rigor wherever they could lay hands on him. They raised against him the worst of charges, e.g., blasphemy, accusing him when he spoke of &quot;the Christ in you,&quot; as claiming to be a reincarnation of Jesus. A certain fanatic at that time did claim such for himself, and was worshiped as such; but despite Fox's rejecting, preaching and writing against him as such, he himself was charged with, and sentenced to prison for, that blasphemy. His trials before magistrates and judges were the grossest travesties of justice. He was indeed &quot;crucified without the city.&quot;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) We are not to understand the antitype of Zechariah's stoning to be a literal stoning, even though a part of it was literal stoning, but rather the hurling of religious, civil and social teachings at him in contradiction of him, until he was entirely cut off from the fellowship of the nominal people of God—dead in their sight (; stoned him with stones); for the typical stonings charged by Moses represent the Lord's people hurling at wrong teachers and doers Biblical teachings, until the evil ones were cut off from God's people; but the wrong stonings, like that of Naboth, type hurling of false charges, wrong secular and religious teachings and perverted representations of the Truth teachings of the faithful against them. Such was the antitype of the stoning of Zechariah; for it was just such things that were hurled against Fox, until he was entirely cut off from the fellowship of God's nominal people. Accordingly, the death of Zechariah did not type Fox's death, which did not occur until Feb., 1691, 28 years after the antitypical Joash ended; but, as just indicated, his cutting off from all fellowship with the nominal people of God, which made him dead in their sight. A sad feature of this matter is that it was corrupted Separatism, unfaithful to its principles and the principles of the former phases of Congregationalism, that instigated this symbolic martyrdom of Fox, one of the finest characters of the Gospel Age (; at the. commandment of the king). And it caused this to happen while he was ministering in the antitypical court—his condition and activities as to matters of justification in relation to the right way of living—duty love to God and man (; court of the house of the Lord). It certainly was an act of gross ingratitude to the Lord Jesus, who spoke through him, for corrupt Separatism to have instigated such persecution against one who reproved at the Lord's charge in the gate—publicly before the nominal people of God. It shows how unfaithfulness makes one forget formerly held and practiced principles; for Congregationalism in its faithful days protested against similar sins, errors and wrong practices and suffered persecution thereover and therefore received great blessings from the Lord Jesus (; remembered not. . . Jehoiada. . . slew his son).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) All the while this persecution of Fox and his brethren continued he cautioned the persecutors against their course. He told them that God Almighty was taking note of this persecution; that there was not one feature of its injustice but aroused His attention (; the Lord look upon it). Here is a wrong translation. It should be rendered: The Lord sees it. Certainly this richly developed child of God did not pray that God take a hostile view of his persecutors; for this would be a violation of the Lord's charge that His people wish and pray blessings upon their persecutors (Matt. 5: 44). The facts of the case prove that he did not pray vengeance upon his persecutors; for they show that he entreated them to recognize that the Lord could not but take cognizance of such evil, and that He could not but mete out condign punishment therefore (; require it [literally, will require it]). It was Fox's custom lovingly to caution his persecutors that he was a servant of God, who must take note of their mistreating His servant, and who must mete out deserved retribution therefore. This was his course also as to the persecutors of his brethren. Orally and by writings he cautioned persecuting magistrates, judges, mayors, sheriffs and military officers, as well as private persons, that God was speaking through him and his brethren, and that He considered the treatment that they gave His servants as the treatment that they bestowed upon Him, and would react to it accordingly. He even wrote to this effect to Oliver Cromwell, and in his interview with him spoke of the same two things. But while Cromwell gave orders to the officials to cease the persecution, the latter heeded not his charge. Such expostulations and warnings continued for years, even as the cutting off proceeded for years.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(25) The forecast punishment came when the cup of wrath became full (at the end of the year, ; 23). Romanism was the agent used by God to bring the punishment (Hazael, 17). It acted therein through Charles II, who was at heart a Romanist, though</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">outwardly, for policy's sake, conforming to the Anglican Church, who was also its legal head, who for years pursued a policy of favoring Rome and persecuting its British opponents, and who on his death bed received its sacraments of communion and extreme unction, as shown heretofore in our discussion of antitypical Jehoash and Jeroboam II in their dealings with Charles II. Invited to become England's king by military leaders, especially by Gen. Monk, commander of the army, then mainly Congregationalist, by the Presbyterian Puritans, who were deceived into believing him a Presbyterian, as he professed to be when made king of Scotland, by Episcopalians, who believed him a loyal member of their church, and by parliament, which was disgusted with the inefficiency of Richard Cromwell, the successor in the Protectorship of his very efficient father, Oliver. Charles returned to England from Holland in 1660 as king. His' restoration was a matter of prolonged and secret intrigue, engineered initially by Jesuits, Louis XIV of France and the Romanist hierarchy. In this intrigue Gen. Monk took a large share, without, however, suspecting that Rome was its instigator. Hence Charles' return was a real papal victory, though concealed as such from the English people of all non-Romanist parries. Thus secretly Rome conquered England as a country and government (fought against Gath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(winepress) </span><span class="font3">and took it, ;). Thereupon Romanism, working through Charles II, sets its face against the sphere of the executorship of God's more favored people, the apostate Congregationalists (Hazael set. . . to Jerusalem, ;). At that time apostate Congregationalists were subject to disloyal Separatism, its ruling policy. And against it Romanism in Charles II turned its hostile attention (; Syria came up against him). It invaded the sphere of the apostate more favored people of God, and worked against apostate Separatism (; came to Judah and Jerusalem), in the sense that it planned through Charles II to undermine their influence before the public. This was not hard to do, because those mainly responsible for bringing Charles IPs father, Charles I, to trial for tyranny, dishonesty and treason, and for condemning and beheading him were the Congregationalist lay leaders, and, the Episcopalians and Presbyterians opposing it, the odium for the regicide fell upon the Congregationalists. It was a stipulation of Charles II, as a condition of his accepting the throne of England, that the main ones implicated in the regicide be punished. This was done by exhuming the bodies of the dead leaders, including that of Oliver Cromwell, and hanging and quartering them and giving them infamous burials, by executing the main living regicides and imprisoning and fining less prominent ones (; destroyed all the princes .</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the people). All this turned the sycophantic public against disloyal Congregationalists and their disloyal policy of Separatism and made them very unpopular.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(26) Their spirit of disloyalty in the face of the popular disfavor, of the rule of the restored Charles II taking the place of the rule of the Commonwealth that had favored them, of the manipulation of his determined Romanist mother and brother, of his own secret Romanist leanings and obligations making disloyal Separatism its special object of attack, and of the opposition of the restored Episcopate and of the Puritan Presbyterians, moved Separatism in its disloyal adherents to retire to seclusion from all public activities. Its leaders, like Owen, (Thomas) Goodwin, Nye, Howe and the rest of their formerly influential brethren, bereft of the support of its political leaders, who had their hands full with their efforts to preserve their own personal safety, and deprived of their positions, sank into obscurity. There were none of disloyal Separatism's leaders who would venture in public to defend its principles held from 1582 until the period of 1652-1654. Hence the principles of the pure Congregationalism of antitypical Jehoshaphat (hallowed things that Jehoshaphat... dedicated, 18;), the slightly tarnished Congregationalism of antitypical Jehoram</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(Jehoram. . . dedicated), the largely tarnished Congregationalism of antitypical Ahaziah (Ahaziah. . . dedicated), and the partly restored pure Congregationalism of antitypical Joash's faithful days (his own hallowed things), were all given up, so far as defending them in public was concerned, which were the things required to be given up, in their yielding to antitypical Hazael as represented in Charles II (sent to Hazael). Moreover, it in disloyal Congregationalists, in the face of the abovementioned obstacles, by ceasing to advocate the Divine principles belonging to God's people as His temple, i.e., the principles of freedom of conscience, assembly and propaganda and separation of state and church, gave these up to plunder-seeking Romanism, which in Charles II suppressed these for it (gold . . . house of the Lord . . . sent it to Hazael;). Finally, it in the disloyal Congregationalists, in the face of the same obstacles, gave up the Divine principles belonging to the state, e.g., democracy, the independence, coordination and cooperation of the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the state (gold... in the king's house . . . Hazael; sent all the spoil unto the king of Damascus). Having thus despoiled the antitypical Joash of all that was distinctively its, as well as of Divine principles applicable to the Church as God's temple and to the state to be enjoyed by it in its most highly developed form, according to God's highest ideal for the state under conditions of the curse, Romanism in Charles II left Congregationalism alone as it was thus reduced to impotency. Thus by default unfaithful Separatism surrendered the abovementioned principles to what was really Romanism.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(27) Those who invited him to return to England and to mount England's throne made a great mistake in not putting him under the stringent conditions necessary to preserve the democratic gains of the struggle between parliament and Charles I. They should have known the statecraft of the house of Stuart enough to distrust it for its tyrannical and arbitrary propensities.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Doubtless the confusion and disorder then existing in England made them think that haste to bring him back was the one indispensable thing to secure the order for which the English people as a whole then longed. The result was that Charles II and family with a small rerinue of supporters, as more or less conscious representatives of Romanism, made an invasion into the sphere of Congregationalism's domain and of its executiveship (the Syrians came with a small company, ; 24); and because of their disloyalty to the principles of Separatism the millions of English Congregationalists, including the army, which in its bulk was Congregationalist, were by God delivered over to what was actually Romanism masking under the person of Charles II, his mother, brother and a few supporters, who were aware of the secret Romanist purposes of these (; delivered a very great host into their hand). This all befell apostate Separatism and its apostate supporters, because they had in their unfaithfulness forsaken the Lord in the particulars of the stewardship of doctrine and practice that God had committed to the preceding phases of Congregationalism (; forsaken the Lord God of their fathers). How terrible the judgments of the Lord upon unfaithful individuals and churches are, can be seen, not only in the case under study, but even more impressively in the case of the entire nominal church: Greek, Romanist and Protestant, both of great and little Babyions. The case under study is certainly one of Divine judgment, as shown above (; executed judgment against Joash).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) Certainly, when the executors of these judgments left unfaithful Separatism, it in its adherents was afflicted with many spiritual diseases (left... diseases, ; 25); for impenitence, indecision, cowardice, discouragement, inactivity, shame, over-reticence and supineness characterized it in its leaders and leadings. Not only so, but former supporters turned against it in its supporters (his servants arose, 20;) and then among themselves conspired to cut the unfaithful</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Separatists off from fellowship with the rest of the real and nominal people of God (made a conspiracy; conspired against him), a thing that God sent as a punishment for their mistreatment and disfellowshipment of Fox and his brethren (; blood of the sons of Jehoiada); and they did cut them off from such fellowship (slew Joash; slew him . . died), as they rested on their creed bed (on his bed;), while they were engaged in the work of bringing their full number (Millo </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[filling];)</span><span class="font3"> in a public way (goeth down to Silla </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[highway];)</span><span class="font3"> unto endorsing their newly made creed. Those that conspired against them and cut them off from the aforesaid fellowship were of two classes: those liberty loving Presbyterian Puritan clericalists that had formerly kept them in mind, supported them and given them public favor (Jozachar </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah remembers],</span><span class="font3"> Shimeath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fame], 21;</span><span class="font3"> Zabad </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[endower] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Ammonitess, 26) and Romanizing autocratic Episcopalians that had also formerly supported and carefully guarded them (Jehozabad </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah is endow er],</span><span class="font3"> Shomer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[guarding],</span><span class="font3"> Shimrith </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[careful],</span><span class="font3"> a Moabitess). Because of its former good course it was held in respectful memory as having had apostolic teachings and practices (buried him with his fathers in the city of David, 25), but because of its later unfaithfulness none hold this phase of Congregationalism in the respect due to a movement of God's more favored people (; not in the sepulchres of the kings). Other details concerning this movement than those brought out as the antitypes given above are given in the writings of Congregationalists (rest of the acts . . . written in . . . Chronicles . . . Judah); and the movements that it set into action (sons, ; 27) and its great work in developing God's people as His temple (; burden. . . repairing the house of God) are described in the writings of both Congregationalist and Puritan Presbyterian histories and biographies (; book of the kings). The end of this movement is also the end of Congregationalists as in the most favored movement of God's people. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Friends, nicknamed Quakers, operated as the next movement of God's more favored people (; Amaziah. . . reigned in his stead). Our study of antitypical Joash should teach us to imitate it in its faithfulness, and to avoid imitating it in its unfaithfulness.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(29) In discussing antitypical Joash we made some comments on the Friends, nicknamed Quakers, first by a judge who threatened to make a certain fearless Friend quake, after the latter had told him to quake before God's Word, and then by others. These comments were necessitated by the fact that George Fox, their leader, was the antitype of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, and his followers were the antitype of Jehoiada's other sons, all slain by apostate Israelites at Joash's command. As we saw, the apostasy of the final phase of the Congregational movement, the antitype of Joash as God's more favored movement, caused God to cast it off as such and to accept the Friends' movement as such (reigned Amaziah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[strength of Jehovah] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Judah, 2 Kings 14: 1;). It was by God accepted as such, before crown-lost leaders had succeeded in perverting it fully into a sect. Its period of ascendancy as the more favored movement of God's people was from 1663 to 1692 A. D., corresponding to the 29 years of Amaziah's reign, 858-829 B.C. (twenty and nine years, 2; 2 Chro. 25: 1). Born of pious parents, 1624, and pious from his earliest childhood, George Fox consecrated probably in 1638, 25 years (twenty and five years old. . reign, 2; 1) before his movement became God's more favored movement in the sphere of its executiveship (Jerusalem, 2; 1) . The doctrine of the joyousness of fellowship with God mothered this movement (Jehoaddan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah is delightsome],</span><span class="font3"> 2; 1) . Generally speaking, this movement acted righteously (right, 3; 2), but not completely so (not with a perfect heart, ; 2); for it did not fully follow Apostolic example and practice, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> it would not practice water baptism, the Lord's Supper arid the Apostolic organization of an ecclesia with elders and deacons as the servants of the ecclesia (not like David his father, 3;). Rather, it followed a course similar to that of antitypical Joash, the last phase of the Congregational movement (according . . . Joash, 3;), in sectarianism (high places . . . away, 3;) and more or less of combinationism (sacrifice and burnt incense . . . places, 4;). As this movement became firm (kingdom was confirmed. . . established, 5; 3), it thoroughly refuted those Presbyterian Puritan and liberal Anglican supporters who gave the death blow to antitypical Joash's ascendancy (slew . . the king, 5; 3) . But innocent movements founded by these traitors it did not include in these refutations (children. . . slew not, 6; 4), even as Jesus in the New Testament charged that a ,good work even of evil-doers be not set aside because done by evil-doers (law of Moses . . Lord commanded, 6; 4; Mark 9: 38, 39; Phil. 1: 15-18) . He likewise charged that the innocent or weak maker of an evil movement or action be not, with it, destroyed (father shall not... for the children, 6; 4; Matt. 12: 31, 32); for it is for personal totally willful sins that one goes into the second death (every man. . . own sin, 6; 4; Heb. 6: 4-6; 10: 26-29). Antitypical Korah's movement in its children, the Levite movements under bad leaders and textbookistic movements under good but mistaken leaders illustrate this principle.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(30) The Friends' movement was surrounded by enemies that attacked it on all hands; particularly did civil and Anglican Church authorities so do. These attacked it and its supporters with legal and ecclesiastical charges, almost without exception unjustly and falsely. This moved it to take defensive measures, by which it assembled (gathered Judah, ; 5) and trained its adherents to war against their attackers in their legal and religious arguments, making the ablest of these warriors the leaders of large numbers (captains over thousands) and able leaders, but less able than the former of these warriors, the leaders of smaller numbers (captains over hundreds), brethren like Fox,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Barclay, Fell, Pennington, Keith, Penn, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> among the former and their itinerary speakers among the latter. All were organized as such warriors according to their spirit of consecration, talents and providential situations (according . . . fathers). This was done as to the mightier (Judah) and the weaker (Benjamin) among all of antitypical Amaziah's adherents (throughout). These truth .warriors included the unconsecrated (twenty years) and the consecrated (upward); and the zeal of the Friends aroused practically every one of them to be warriors of truth, righteousness and holiness and to corresponding action (choice men able . . . war). They were trained to aggressive (handle spear) and defensive warfare (shield). The Friends' movement worked on the hearts as distinct from the heads with little of heart. They insisted on entire consecration, not merely expressed by words, but lived first in heart, and then in words and acts. The bulk of the Anglicans were dead formalists and rigid ritualists; and the bulk of the Presbyterian Puritans had degenerated into head religion; but there were many consecrated ones among the Presbyterian Puritans who sought to live out their consecration; and these, persecuted, like the Friends, and by the same enemies, were favorably disposed toward the Friends' spirit of consecration. The latters' movement, to attract these more closely to itself, made slight compromises in the way of treading softly on their toes. These were along the lines of a small sectarianism and combinationism (He hired, 6); and thus it enlisted in its defense numerous of such consecrated and persecuted Presbyterian Puritans (hundred thousand). Such Presbyterians were, as a rule, better educated secularly and Biblically and thus, as a rule, were abler controversialists than the Friends, who, as a rule, went to an extreme in neglecting secular and religious education (mighty men of valor). Thus they drew to themselves numerous brethren who were adherents of the less favored movement of God's people. Their small compromises gave up, at least, advocacy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of teachings that were unacceptable to these from antitypical Israel (hundred talents of silver).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) But George Fox, who would not in the least compromise what he held to be true, disapproved of support coming from anyone who sanctioned the sectarianism and clericalism of the less favored movement of God's people (man of God, ; 7). He, therefore, declared to the Friends' movement (saying, O king) that these Presbyterian Puritans, though able warriors against their enemies, should not be given a joint share in the warfare of the Friends' movement (not. . . Israel go with thee), giving as his reason that Jehovah did not give His special favor and help to the sectarian and clericalistic Presbyterian Puritans (not with Israel. . . Ephraim). George Fox did not seek to over persuade the Friends' movement to do as he thought was the Lord's will, but cautioned against its purposed course, warning it that, if it was determined to go (if thou wilt go, ; 8), let it do so (do it); let it be ever so strong for battle (strong for battle), God would cast it down in defeat before its adversaries (fall before the enemy), since the omnipotent Jehovah had the ability to help unto victory (help) and cast down unto defeat (cast down). Thinking of the small compromises of Truth that it had made to enlist the support of the consecrated Presbyterian Puritan warriors, the Friends' movement (Amaziah,, ; 9) asked Bro. Fox (the man of God) what its adherents should do as to the concealed truths, which were concerned with matters pertinent to natures lower than the Divine nature (one hundred talents [of silver, v. 6] ), yielded up by the movement to the Presbyterian Puritan warriors (given. . . Israel). Bro. Fox assured the Friends' movement that the Lord by His forgiving grace would more than make up the loss, on repentance being experienced for the wrong; for Fox knew that it was done in human weakness, which on repentance and faith would be made good for by Jesus' merit (much more than this). Thereupon the Friends as a movement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">renounced their compromises and advocated the teachings before compromised, which drove away from the Friends the consecrated Presbyterian Puritans (separated them. . . come . . . Ephraim, ; 10). These went to the sphere of their fellow Presbyterian Puritans (go home again). But they were highly displeased at their being thus cut off from the warfare with the Friends against the adversaries of both (anger was greatly kindled against Judah); and they persevered in this anger, not only until they reached their own sphere (returned . . . anger), but long afterward.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) The Friends' movement then thoroughly drilled and thus strengthened its adherents for the controversary against the civil and ecclesiastical tyrants who persecuted them so relentlessly that, all told, over 14,000 Friends had been imprisoned, 369 of them dying in jail from hunger, cold and neglect; 10,000 of them at one time were in prison, in 1689, when a general indulgence from William III freed all prisoners who were held for religion's sake (strengthened himself, ;11). The movement directed them in this conflict (led, ; 11), which was waged in the sphere of the desolation where the civil and (Anglo-) ecclesiastical tyrants held sway (valley of salt, 7:11). Charles II, to overthrow all dissenters (Presbyterian Puritans, Congregationalists, Baptists and Friends), caused the Conventicler Law to be passed, forbidding all assemblies of five persons or more above 16 years of age, except the household amid which the meetings were held, outside of Anglican churches, where, of course, these dissenters as such were not allowed to meet. While the dissenters, except the Friends, held very secret meetings of a few, very carefully guarded by their own sentinels, the Friends held their meetings openly, protesting vigorously against the tyrannous law; and in the ensuing arguments thereover they from legal, Biblical, factual and reasonable arguments refuted the civil and ecclesiastical tyrants who oppressed them. Some of the Friends, like Fell, were judges and used their legal</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">knowledge triumphantly to defend their oppressed brethren. George Fox wrote many a letter to judges and magistrates in protest against their evil course. But the controversy was not only one on legal questions, but also one on religious grounds, and that from two standpoints: (1) religious arguments in favor of freedom of speech, conscience, assembly and propaganda against the laws that denied these and imprisoned their practicers and (2) religious arguments against the dead formalism and ritualism of the Anglican Church, which favored and, in their bishops in the House of Lords, voted for the persecuting laws. In this way they refuted both the legal tyrants (slew of Edom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[red],</span><span class="font3"> 7 smote . . . Seir </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[hairy],</span><span class="font3"> ; 11) in their legal secular totality (ten thousand, 7:11), and in time by this controversy (war, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">7)</span><span class="font3"> won over both parliament and the king (Selah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[rock,</span><span class="font3"> the capital and fortress of Edom], 7), and subdued them into making just laws (called . . . Joktheel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[subdued of God\,</span><span class="font3"> 7), which laws hold them in subjection even to the. present (unto this day). The clerical tyrants in their entirety as thoroughly secularized men (the other ten thousand) in their full vigor (alive, ; 12) by the Friends' controversialists (children of Judah, ; 12) were through their arguments bound hand and foot as captives (carried away captive;; 12); and these brought them as such to the highest part of England as a church state, which highest part was the Anglican Church (brought them unto the top of the rock, ; 12) and from the hierarchy downward to the lowest of the laity cast them down unto complete disruption as the alleged true church (broken into pieces,; 12).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(33) While the Friends were engaged in their controversy with the tyrannical English civil and Anglican Church rulers, the Presbyterian Puritans, who for a while cooperated with, and were later dismissed by the Friends' movement from cooperation in the contemplated controversy with the antitypical Edomites (soldiers . . . sent back . . . battle, ; 13), enraged at such dismissal, made inroads upon the Friends' ecclesias (fell upon the cities of Judah), starting out from church politics (Samaria) and proceeding to take up the ill-founded views (Beth-horon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[house of hollowness])</span><span class="font3"> of the Friends on political, social and religious subjects, and wrought much devastation thereon. The Friends as a fanatical sect cherished many vagaries; and these, kept compromisingly by them in abeyance, for the sake of said cooperation, were the ones that those Presbyterian Puritans attacked. They refuted their anti-oath-be fore-courts view, by pointing out that Jesus (Matt. 5: 33-37) and James (5: 12) referred not to oaths before courts, but to oaths in private conversations, which prevailed very widely among the Orientals in those days. They refuted their view that respect should not be shown judges and magistrates by standing in their presence with their hats off and addressing them as, Your honor, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., </span><span class="font3">by pointing out that the Bible teaches that respect and honor be given civil officials (1 Pet. 2: 13-17; Rom. 13: 17), citing the respect given with Divine approval to Joseph, David, Solomon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> and by Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah to kings, by Jacob to. Pharaoh, by Israel to Moses, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> They also refuted their conscientious objection when urged as binding on the unconsecrated. In justification of social civilities, like addressing single individuals with the plural personal pronoun you, instead of the singular </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">thou,</span><span class="font3"> and using polite language and conduct socially, all of which the Friends refused to engage in, they quoted St. Paul's statement that all things be done decently and in order (1 Cor. 14: 40) and cited his example in making himself all things to all men, in order to win some (1 Cor. 9: 19-22) and in his addressing Festus as most noble, which was a title (Acts 26: 25). They especially refuted the Friends' claim that the light of nature, particularly conscience, which was in fallen man as a vestige of God's image surviving the fall, was Jesus Christ in them enlightening every man that entereth the world, as Friends interpreted John 1: 9</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">to mean, which was a view entertained by some of the church fathers and evidently invented to evade the support that it gives to future probation, when this passage will be fulfilled in the Millennial universal enlightenment of the race, dead and living. But the refutation that they gave was not the application of this passage to future probation, but from the standpoint of man's depravity and God's leaving the race as such in darkness under the curse unhelped by Him with enlightenment (John 1: 5; 3: 19, 20; Acts 26: 18; Rom. 1: 21; 2 Cor. 4: 4, 6; Eph. 5: 8, 11; 1 Thes. 5: 4, 5; 1 Pet. 2: 9; 1 John 2: 8-11) . They from Christ's command and the Apostolic practice refuted the Friends' denial of the obligatoriness of water baptism and the Lord's Supper. These arguments refuted all Friends against whom they were used (smote three thousand of them) and resulted in influencing great numbers of them to give up their refuted views and to join the Presbyterian Puritans (took much spoil).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) While the Friends' movement was victorious in its theory-controversy with the tyrannous civil and ecclesiastical rulers, despite the physical power used against it in whipping and imprisoning its members, it received more or less injury as a result of it (come from . . . Edomites, ; 14). It was by its success perverted into a sect, into which its crown-lost leaders misled it and which blunted the edge of its rebukes of sectarianism. It also led it into compromising its principles of separatism into a measure of combinationism, and thus it fell into the evils into which antitypical Joash had fallen, as we read in 3, 4; (brought the gods . . . Seir). These two evils were given a more or less strong position amongst the Friends (set them up to be his gods). Henceforth they served these two evils (bowed himself before them) and used more or less of their choice human powers in advancing them, their party consciousness as fellow laborers and sufferers strengthening their sectarian spirit, and the desire of support from the other persecuted non-conformists strengthening their combinationism, and thus enlisting their choice human powers in advancing these two evils (burned incense unto them). These evils, though not so gross as antitypical Joash's commission of them, displeased God (anger . . . against Amaziah, ; 15) . But in His displeasure God remembered mercy, and therefrom sent George Fox (sent. . . prophet) to rebuke and remonstrate with the Friends' movement for these sins (Why . . . after the gods). He gave them a good reason against their course: these evils were not able to save the antitypical Edomites out of its hands (not deliver . . . out of thine hand?). Thus did this godly star-member reason with the former Little Flock movement now perverted into a sect; and he received an answer like that which other star-members received from their movements after they were perverted into sects—a rebuke (as he talked with him, ; 16). Like them he was interrupted amid his expostulations with an impudent rejoinder, in the form of a question: &quot;Have we made thee of the king's counsel?&quot; —A.R.V. Thus he was charged with officiously arrogating to himself powers that were not his by right (Art thou made of the king's counsel?). He was as impudently commanded to cease, even as proud wrongdoers usually charge those who rebuke at the gate (forbear). We can easily imagine how candid George Fox felt at this impudent and ungrateful charge. But the now sectarianized movement did not stop at impudence and ingratitude. It threatened to cut him off from fellowship as it argued against his course (why shouldst thou be smitten?) Seeing the uselessness of further efforts at dissuading the evil-doing movement from its course, he desisted from further remonstrance (Then the prophet forbare). This was perhaps the beginning of this star-member's being made a captive as a part of the large antitypical Samson by the antitypical Philistines (sectarians) of his movement. But as he ceased remonstrating, he uttered a warning to the effect that it was a matter of knowledge with him that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">God purposed to destroy the Friends' movement as that of God's more favored people (know. . . determined to destroy thee). He gave two reasons for this course on God's part: (1) because it had sectarianized and compromised its separatism, and (2) because it would not follow the advice that he had given it (not. . . counsel).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) Perhaps the dismissed Presbyterian Puritans' attacks on various teachings of the Friends' movement and its resultant loss of many members moved it to take counsel on whether it should enter into a controversy with the reviving Presbyterian Puritan movement. We do not know this of a certainty, the Bible being silent thereon. But whether this or some other reason impelled it so to do, it nevertheless discussed among its leaders the question of whether it should enter into this attack (Amaziah . . . took advice, ; 17) and it sent messengers to that phase of the Presbyterian Puritan movement (sent. . . messengers to Joash, 8; 17). This revived movement had succeeded the weak and discouraged Presbyterian Puritan movement (son of Jehoahaz, 8; 17), which in turn had succeeded the energetic revolutionary Presbyterian Puritan movement (son of Jehu, 8; 17), all three of which were movements of the less favored people of God (king of Israel, 8; 17). The antitypical messengers were controversialists whose controversial tactics were a challenge to engage in a controversy (see . . . look one another in the face, 8; 17). This was indeed a presumptuous thing for the Friends' movement to do, since they had only four real scholarly men: Barclay, Keith, Pennington and Penn, on their side, while the reviving Presbyterian Puritan movement had many of such, including the redoubtable Richard Baxter, who was one of the most able and prolific authors of the whole Gospel Age, not only on controversial and theoretical, but also on practical theology, a man who was as eminent in practical piety as he was in theoretical learning. Having its hands quite full in its controversy with Romanism disguised in the person of Charles II, the reviving Presbyterian</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Puritan movement, knowing its superior equipment in controversialists, sought to restrain the controversial aims of the Friends' movement (Joash . . . sent to Amaziah . . . saying, 9; 18). This it did by comparisons and contrasts. It called attention to the fact that it was the Friends' movement (the thistle that was in Lebanon, 9; 18) that asked the army of antitypical Israel (cedar that was in Lebanon) to send it some of its warriors to become united with the army of antitypical Judah (thy daughter to my son to wife, 9; 18). And after this was done they were unceremoniously dismissed, which was an affront to the army of antitypical Israel. Then the reviving Presbyterian Puritan movement showed what the result of the controversy would be upon the Friends' movement—full defeat (wild beast. . . trod down the thistle, 9; 18).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(36) Then the reviving Presbyterian Puritan movement read the falling Friends' movement a much needed rebuke and lesson. The former reminded the latter of its victory over the civil and ecclesiastical tyrants in England (hast smitten Edom, 10; 19), and then charged the latter with becoming puffed up over its victory, which charge was true (heart lifted thee up ... to boast, 10; 19). The, former gave the latter the much needed advice to be contented with attending to its own affairs (abide now. . . tarry at home, 10; 19). Expostulatingly the former reasoned with the latter to abstain from a course that would surely result in its injury (why . . meddle to thine hurt, 10; 19); for that course would result in the Friends' movement's complete defeat (shouldst fall, 10; 19) and in the Friends' as supporters of that movement going down to defeat (and Judah with thee, 10; 19). It is written: &quot;Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall&quot; (Prov. 16: 18). And this, as seen in many other cases, we see exemplified in this case. Few, indeed, can bear prosperity and retain humility and meekness. Those inclined or addicted to fanaticism are especially inclined or addicted to pride and stubborn</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">ness; and the Friends, the chief sect of the fanatical sects, were exposed to these two evil qualities; and this was the case with the Friends' movement at the particular time now under study (Amaziah would not hear, 11; 20). This attitude, as well as its sins of sectarianism and combinationism, moved God to adjust its circumstances in a way that its pride and stubbornness would incline it to a course that would bring retribution upon it for its aforesaid sins at the hands of the Presbyterian Puritans (enemies . . . gods of Edom,; 20).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) As indicated in the meaning of the name Bethshemesh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of the sun,</span><span class="font3"> God as the indweller of the Bible is a symbolic sun, the controversy was over the question of the God-indwelt source and rule of faith and practice, between the Presbyterian Puritans' movement and the Friends' movement. The correct way of presenting the Bible in its relation to the God-indwelt source and rule of faith and practice is this: The Scriptures are the sole source of faith and usually the sole source of practice and always the main rule of practice, with the Spirit and the providences of God as subordinate rules thereof, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the true Christian faith always and practice usually are to be derived from the Bible alone; and while the Christian's conduct should usually be derived from the Bible principles and examples alone, there are special times and circumstances in which he from those principles and examples alone cannot decide which one applies to those times and circumstances; for two or more apparently conflicting Bible principles and examples seem equally to apply to them. In such cases usually the Spirit of God in him, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the New Creature, God's holy mind, heart and will in him, will enable him to decide which ones of two or more apparently conflicting Bible principles and examples apply to the case at hand. And in this sense of its assisting him to a proper recognition of the applicable Biblical principles and examples the Spirit of God is as God's disposition in him a secondary rule of practice. But there are cases in which the Christian</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">cannot by the Spirit alone decide on apparently conflicting duties and privileges from Bible principles and examples. In such cases he must, if he would learn to know the applicable ones, wait upon the Lord to reveal these to him by His </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">providences,</span><span class="font3"> which in due time the Lord will so exercise as to clarify the applicable ones to the waiting child of God. And in this sense God's providences are a tertiary rule of practice. Moreover, when no Bible principle or example seems to apply, the Spirit and providence can be a source of practice, e.g., what, when or how we shall do as to matters of whether we should eat rolled oats, shredded wheat for breakfast, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> arise at 5 or 7 A.M., eat at 12 noon, or earlier or later, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> In the controversy under study each side went to an extreme, the Friends' movement to the more evil of the two extremes. The extreme of the Presbyterian Puritan movement was this: While the Bible is the sole </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">source</span><span class="font3"> of faith (which is entirely true) and sole source of practice (which is not entirely true), it is also the sole </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rule of practice</span><span class="font3"> (which is an error; for it denies the secondary and tertiary rules of practice, as interpretative rules helping one to judge in complicated cases what Bible principles and examples apply to the case, and when no Bible principle or example applies). But, except in very rare cases as to at times the what, when and how, it will be seen that the Spirit and providences do not furnish the applicable principles and examples; they simply assist us to understand usually which are the applicable ones, because usually the Bible furnishes the principles and examples that determine or rule the case. It is the main rule of practice, the other two being as interpreters respectively the secondary and tertiary rules of faith. We should here remark that examples from secular and religious experience that at times help us to decide are to be considered as belonging under the providences of God in others' lives.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) God often uses some of His children to draw back others of them from an extreme; and frequently this is accompanied by the former themselves going into the opposite extreme. The Friends were used by God to emphasize the fact that the Bible is not the sole rule of practice, but that the Spirit is also a rule of practice. The Presbyterian Puritans got their one-sided rule from Calvin, while the Friends' view was somewhat akin to Luther's, who taught that while the Bible is the sole source of faith and the main source of practice, and usually is the sole one, it, the Spirit and God's providences are rules of practice, the Bible being its main rule. However, the Friends up to the time of the controversy stressed the Spirit in this matter to such an extreme as to set aside the Bible both as the sole source of faith, the main source of practice and the main rule of practice, alleging that the Spirit is now to the children of God the primary source of faith and rule of practice, the Bible being merely a revelation of what the Spirit gave to God's people in former age. The following is a brief view of their understanding of the matter: While they mistook the vestiges of God's image in fallen man to be Christ in the fallen man, they understood this to be something quite different from the Christ in the consecrated. Their thought on the latter point was that this was the same Spirit as animated the Prophets and Apostles to write inspiredly the Bible. Thus they confounded the Spirit as God's power that inspired the writing of the Bible with the New Creature that enables one to understand, appreciate and be conformed to, the Holy Bible. Of course, if these two Spirits were the same, the Friends' depreciating the Bible as the dead letter and esteeming the present enlightenment of the Spirit, as opposed to the letter, a better thing, a more up-to-date thing, than the Bible, whose highest use to them was an instruction on how ancient generations of God's people experienced the Spirit's enlightenment, their view would be nearly right; but, as it was, their view of the identity of the two was wrong, and in the hands of unbalanced brethren made them think that their strong impressions and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">high-strung feelings were the thoughts and affections of the Spirit. It moved them, not only to fanaticism, but also to ascribe infallibility to these impressions and feelings as being the expressions of God's Spirit. From this arose all sorts of vagarious notions and false views, to which they ascribed infallibility. Thus their second ablest controversialist, Isaac Pennington, speaking of the Spirit in the consecrated, says: &quot;Every way of it is infallible and every step of the creature after it is infallible.&quot; And Barclay, their ablest scholar and controversialist, said that &quot;the Spirit in the consecrated is the primary rule of faith and practice,&quot; which, of course, would make one by &quot;one's own inward and therefore private and individual illumination, so far as he follows the Spirit, an infallible oracle of Divine Truth.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) Handicapped by such a palpable error, and by the fact that they despised sacred learning, which only a few of them, e.g., Barclay, Penn, Keith, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> had to any fair degree, and by the fact that they had no regular local ministry, they were no match for pious, able and learned men like Richard Baxter and John Bunyan, the Baptist author of Pilgrim's Progress, who joined the Presbyterian Puritans in the controversy. Seeing that they entered the controversy with such handicaps, they knew not what to do with the many Scriptures, reasons and facts that proved the Bible to be the sole source of faith and usually the sole source of practice and the main rule of practice (though their antagonists were not clear on this latter point, nor on the Bible as the main source of practice). Their opponents were particularly trenchant on forcing the issue into questions like this, What shall decide the question as to who is right when two claiming the Spirit's illumination teach directly contrary to each other on the same question? This question forced Barclay to give up the Friends' position on such (alleged) Spirit's illumination as infallible; and it also forced him to give up the position that the Spirit in the consecrated is the sole source of faith and practice and to accept the thought</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">that the Bible would have to decide questions of faith and practice. Thus he surrendered the three chief involved errors of the Friends. Had the Friends had the full pertinent light, which became clearly due only in the Harvest, though Luther saw it clearly to some degree, they would have won out in the controversy; but having only a part of it, and that pushed to a mischievous extreme, and being in error on the chief features of the controversy, on which the Presbyterian Puritans were largely right, the Friends went down to a disastrous defeat in the controversy, as the type forecast of them. The foregoing explanations will make the correspondence between type and antitype easier to understand. We now proceed to a discussion of them.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(40) Not waiting to be attacked, the Presbyterian Puritans advanced to the attack (Joash . . . went up, 11; 21), and both sides joined the battle (saw. . . looked. . . face, 11; 21), even both of them in sharp contrast (he and Amaziah, 11;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">21) . Be it noted that it was the viewpoint of the Friends on the office of the Bible, a dwelling place of God, the symbolic Sun, as to faith and life that was attacked (Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah [not Israel], 11; 21). And the outcome of the controversy was a great victory for the Presbyterian Puritans and a crushing defeat for the Friends as a movement and as individual warriors (Judah. . . worse before Israel, 12; 22). So great was the defeat that the Friends as individuals fled from the field of controversy (fled every man, 12; 22) and disbanded in disunion as a fighting group on the subject at controversy (to his tent, 12; 22). The Presbyterian Puritan movement got control of the Friends' movement, so far as the questions at controversy (at Bethshemesh, 13; 23) were concerned (Joash. . . Jehoash. . . took Amaziah, 13; 23), the latter in its capacity of being the successor movement (son, 13; 23) of the Separatist Congregational movement, faithful and unfaithful (Jehoash. . . Joash, 13; 23), which succeeded (son, 13;) the autocratic Congregational movement</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(Ahaziah, 13;), the former in its capacity of succeeding the weak Puritan movement (son of Jehoahaz, ; 23). It brought captive the Friends' movement to the latter's sphere of executiveship (came . . . brought him to Jerusalem, 13; 23), and overthrew the powers, the chief exponents and defenders, that supported the sphere of the Friends' movement (brake down the wall of Jerusalem, 13; 23). Its re futaffair of the above-described views of the Friends' movement was the means of destroying in large measure the influence of its leaders and changing certain of its pertinent practices as to the Bible. This included the overthrow of its drawing by its leaders to itself followers from the ten-tribed kingdom of the north (gate of Ephraim, 13; 23) and of its keeping by its leaders for itself those who were on the verge of apostasy (corner gate, 13; 23; this gate was close to Gehenna), exceedingly trialsome and weakening things to the involved crown-lost leaders (four hundred cubits, 13; 23; 40 being the symbol of trial and 10 of natures lower than the Divine 40 x 10 = 400). The Presbyterian Puritan movement appropriated to itself whatever was good in the religious teachings of the Friends, e.g., their Divine truths on consecration and character building (gold and silver, 14; 24), together with their pertinent doctrinal, refutational, correctional and ethical teachings, as these were in charge of the pertinent Gospel-Age Levites (vessels . . . with Obed-edom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[servant of Edam],</span><span class="font3"> 14; 24), and the good principles of executorship prevailing in the Friends' movement, like the emphasis on the priesthood of all the consecrated as against clericalism, testimony meetings and zeal in propaganda (treasures of the king's house, 14; 24). It required of the Friends' movement guarantees of submission to the demands implied in what it took from it (hostage, 14; 24), and worked on its own affairs (Samaria, 14; 24).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(41) The controversy between the Presbyterian Puritan movement and the Friends' movement was waged for several years and came to its climax in 1675.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">George Fox took almost no part in it, being absent in Barbados and America from about its beginning until May, 1673. While he had much insight into the practical religion of the heart, he was no theologian in the sense of having scholarly reasoning equipment for controversy. Moreover, God's enlightening him against and on it, he abstained from participating therein (; 15, 16). He, therefore, even after his return to England, about May 1, 1673, abstained from it and let the four Friends' theologians: Barclay, Pennington, Keith and Penn, do the arduous work of defending the Friends' position, which defense, as we have seen, resulted in defeat. Even Barclay, their ablest theologian, whose Apology is considered the ablest exposition and defense of their position, was in the controversy forced to give up the main position of the Friends, that the ideas, impressions and views that they had from what they called the Spirit were infallible and were the primary source and rule of faith, and not the Scriptures, to accept the position that the Bible is the final source of faith, and to approximate their opponents' error on its being the sole rule of practice, instead of taking it to be the usual sole source and main rule of practice. This controversy hardened the Friends' movement into a real sect, to which they had been approaching for a number of years. Henceforth George Fox as a part of blind antitypical Samson, like the rest of the Philadelphia star-members from Luther onward, became a slave of the antitypical Philistines (sectarians), grinding out the flour from the wheat of the Word for these antitypical Philistines. In their interests he continued to travel, preach, converse and teach throughout Britain. In 1674 he was imprisoned [in Worcester], the tenth time that he had such an experience. He suffered much in his imprisonments, and while they prevented his preaching, he could nevertheless edify his visitors and keep his pen busy in writing. He did considerable writing, the chief of which was his journal. His other writings were collected into a large Quarto. Indeed,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the last two things that for him the Friends' movement did before it ceased to be in the ascendancy as antitypical Amaziah was to publish, 1692, his journal, which in its eighth edition appeared in 1891 in two octavo volumes, at the 200th anniversary of his death, March, 1691, and to begin arranging to collect his other writings in the abovementioned Quarto, which appeared in 1706, fifteen years after his death. In 1692, it also through Perm published the works of Barclay, its ablest exponent, as its last work.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) In 1677, and again in 1684, Fox visited the Friends in Holland. The following are brief characterizations ,given of him by various Friends: &quot;Graceful in countenance, manly in personage, grave in gesture, courteous in conversation&quot; (Elwood, Milton's friend); &quot;civil beyond all forms of breeding&quot; (Perm). It has been said of him that he was &quot;plain and powerful in preaching, fervent in prayer,&quot; &quot;a discerner of other men's spirits and very much master of his own,&quot; skillful to &quot;speak a word in due season to the conditions and capacities of most, especially to them that were weary and wanted soul's rest,&quot; &quot;valiant in asserting the Truth, bold in defending it, patient in suffering for it, immovable as a rock.&quot; He was the mainstay of even the sectarianized Friends' movement as the more favored one of God's people. And small wonder that it ceased to be such a year after his death, its last year being largely devoted to the work described in the last part of the preceding paragraph. The movement dragged on a prosaic existence for 17 years after the climax of its controversy with the Presbyterian Puritan movement and 15 years after the latter ceased to be predominant in its Jehoash (Joash) aspect (Amaziah. . . lived after . . . Jehoash . . . Joash. . . fifteen years, 17; 25). The history of this phase of the more favored people of God is given in greater detail in the writings of the Friends' historians than in those of others' writings (acts of Amaziah . . . written . . . Chronicles . . . Judah, 18;); yet they are also</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">described, though less detailedly, in the writings of nonFriends' historians (acts of Amaziah . . . written. . . kings of Judah and Israel, ; 26). After this movement became thoroughly sectarian, i.e., some time after 1675, more and more disgruntiement set in against it, which it for years sought to avert, and which broke out in efforts to hinder it in its sphere of executiveship (after . . . did turn. . . conspiracy . . . Jerusalem, 19; 27). It set itself against this stubbornly (fled to Lachish [ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">obstinate],</span><span class="font3"> 19; 27). But the conspirators, 1692, led by George Keith, then in America, joined by numerous British co-conspirators, pursued it even unto exercising similar stubbornness (sent to Lachish, 19; 27) and overthrew its controllership in Friends' affairs (slew him there, 19; 27). By their teachings they did this (brought him on. . . upon horses, 20; 28). Nevertheless, this movement has been kept in respect as to its executiveship (Jerusalem. . . city of David. . . city of Judah, 20; 28), like the former ones of God's more favored people (with his fathers, 20; 28).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">WITH THE passing away, in 1692, as shown above, of the Friends' movement from being that of God's more favored people's movement, what has been called the Pietism movement took its place as such a movement. It had its main field of work in Germany, but overflowed its bounds and gave refreshment to God's consecrated people in England, Holland, Switzerland, Russia and Denmark, as well as encouraged the later Quietist movement in France and Belgium. All the more faithful consecrated people of God, first in Germany, then in the rest of these countries, united in spirit, not organizationally, to support this as the more favored movement of God's people in successorship of the Friend's movement (all. . . Judah took Azariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[help of Jehovah} . . .</span><span class="font3"> Uzziah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[strength of Jehovah} . . .</span><span class="font3"> made him King . . . father, 14: 21; 2 Chro. 26: 1). This occurred after this movement had been active in Germany in the work of its leader, Philip Jacob Spener, which had its special beginning as the nicknamed movement of Pietism in 1676, just 16 years before this movement became the successor of the Friends' movement (sixteen years old, 21: 1). In order to understand the circumstances of its rise it is necessary to take a short look at the condition of the Lutheran Church somewhat before and during the time of Pietism's rise and progress. A dead orthodoxy then reigned in the Lutheran Church, whose almost exclusive activities consisted of setting forth dry dogmatics, of engaging in constant controversies on most minute points and of a formalistic partaking in lifeless church</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">services, its clergy being largely worldly and in not a few cases drunkards and adulterers, and its laity in vast bulk being like their clergy.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) The Lutheran Church from shortly after the reformation onward had undergone a course of misdevelopment along the same general lines as the Church from shortly after the Apostolic times to the times of the reformation had undergone. The Apostles' times and Luther's times from 1512 to 1525 were periods of intense productivity. From 100 to 325 A. D. was a period of the rise of sectarianism and fundamental error, including union of state and church in the Catholic Church; and from 1525 to 1530 sectarianism and error, including union of state and church, arose in the Lutheran Church. From 325 to 799 increase of error, creedism, sectarianism, headship of the pope in the church and his temporal power and great controversies arose in the nominal Catholic Church; and from 1530 to 1580 more error, creedism and sectarianism, great controversies, the practical obliteration of the priesthood of all consecrated Christians in favor of a graded hierarchy (called prelates and superintendents, the latter really bishops), with the church yielded temporal power in the secular rulers as chief bishops or superintendents, arose in the Lutheran Church. From 799 to 1215 was the Antichrist period of great error, creedism and persecution in a worse form than previously, with the pope ruling in all things; and in the Lutheran Church from 1580 to 1610 the Book of Concord, the Confessions of the Lutheran Church, became in reality a paper pope, and dissenters were unfrocked, banished and imprisoned as peace-disturbers. Next came the cut-and-dried scholastic period of Romanism, which reduced theology to almost mathematical formulas and which continued until the reformation, 1215-1500; and from 1610, when John Gerhard published his great dogmatical and polemical work, Common Theological Topics, to 1692 the scholastic period, with dead formalism marking its later years, prevailed. But as</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">mysticism accompanied the period of scholastics in the Romanist Church from 1215 to 1500, so there was a mysticism (culture of the emotions, often in more or less unhealthy ways, of ecstatic excitement, quietism and selfsatisfaction, amid much of good feeling and piety by contemplation of God, Christ, the Spirit, oneself, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.)</span><span class="font3"> in the Lutheran Church accompanying the scholastic period, represented in its more or less questionable forms by Jacob Boehme and in its best forms by John Arndt, while John Gerhard united both the mystical and scholastic in his character and writings.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) Spener, who was born in 1635 in upper Alsace and died in Berlin in 1707, united in his character a strong intellect and a pious heart. Pious parents by heredity and training gave him a good start in religion; and his pious godmother, Agathe von Rappolstein, added to this good start. Good books, like Arndt's True Christianity, written in German, and Bayly's Practice of Piety, translated from English into German, deepened this good start. Good pastors and theological professors also contributed toward it. He became a very learned scholar and prolific author, and had to engage in much controversy in defense of consecrated living, which he championed. His real work as the leader of Pietism, after preliminary activities stretching over years of earnest efforts to cultivate Christian living in his parishioners in various pastorates, began in 1676, a year after he published his epoch-making work entitled, Pious Desires, in which reformatively he depicted the spiritual deadness of the then Lutheran Church, set forth the hope for better times, recommended more earnest Bible study on the part of the people under the guidance of their pastors, advocated a revival of the doctrine of the priesthood of all the consecrated, as against the idea that the clergy were the priesthood, and of Christlikeness as the mark of such priests, combated the idea that knowledge of doctrine was the whole sum of piety, advocated a change in university teaching to make its chief object</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the cultivation of true Christianity in those preparing to be pastors, and called for a change in sermons to make their main object be the cultivation of godliness in the hearers. In about a year, 1676, these ideas sinking in, Spener was accepted as the leader of those who favored the reformation that he advocated. His reiterated stress in this book on prayer, praise, testimony and study meetings, whose attendants he would restrict to the consecrated, made a deep impression, and in 1676 these were introduced into many churches. This was the date of the start of the Pietist movement proper, though if did not become the more favored movement of God's people until 16 years later, 1692 (sixteen, 21; 1). In 1691, as we have shown in EJ, 276, 1, Spener brought out the long forgotten doctrine of the Millennium (he built Elath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[palm grove],</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the Millennium's being the period of righteousness' flourishing, Ps. 72: 7; 92: 12); and by the next year this doctrine was accepted by the Pietist movement (restored. . . king [Amaziah] slept, 22; 2). True enough, as these texts indicate, the doctrine was developed prior to the end of antitypical Amaziah's demise as the more favored movement of God's people, but became generally accepted by the antitypical Uzziah, or Azariah, very soon after the latter started as such to be the more favored movement of God's people. This movement was the longest-drawn-out executive movement in antitypical Judah (52 years in Jerusalem, 15: 2; 3) and began to operate during the longest reign in antitypical Israel; for antitypical Jeroboam Il's reign also lasted 52 years, 1678-1730 (Jeroboam, 1;). The planning and founding of the Halle University by Spener and Franke began its symbolic reign. The parallel years were, accordingly, 829-777 B.C. and 1692-1744 A. D.— 2520 years apart. The doctrine that mothered this movement is that of Jehovah's ability in executive matters (Jecholiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah is able]</span><span class="font3"> of Jerusalem, 2; 3).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) The character of this movement's ideal and acts was righteous in matters pertaining to the Lord (did</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">. . . right. . . Lord, 3; 4), in imitation of that of the good in the Friends' movement; but it did not do according to the latter's evils (according . . Amaziah did, 3; 4). Indeed, the main course of this movement was among the most righteous of antitypical Judah's symbolic kings. It sought to know and do God's will (sought God, ; 5) during the entire period of its leaders' remaining faithful (Zechariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[remembrancer of Jehovah]).</span><span class="font3"> These were Spener, Franke, Breithaupt, Anton, Lange (Halleians), Jaeger, Bengel (Wuerttembergers), Zinzendorf, David (Hermhuters), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc. </span><span class="font3">And as long as they remained faithful they were gifted with a deep understanding of matters pertaining to justice and love—reverence for the Lord (understanding in the visions [the better reading is reverence; the two words are spelled much alike; thus the misreading arose] of the Lord). Of these, Zinzendorf later went wrong and was the main one to partake of the evils typed in vs. 16-21. Of these undoubtedly Spener and Franke, as the foremost, were the ablest and most developed in head and heart, as they were also the most fruitful in their ministries. And as long as the movement sought earnestly to know and faithfully to do the Lord's will, God prospered it in its undertakings, which is especially manifest in the life and work of Spener and Franke (sought the Lord, God made him to prosper). But during its entire period of preeminence as the more favored movement of God's people sectarian denominations were not by it removed (high places were not removed, 4;) and the nominal people of God consecrated themselves to, and served sectarianism (sacrificed) and used up their choice human powers in its service (burnt incense still on the high places); for even the leaders attached themselves to sectarian systems, though opposing the sectarian spirit and work, Spener, Franke and their colaborers maintaining that they were true to the Lutheran creed and church, only were seeking to reform Christian life in that church.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) But they had to maintain a continual controversy with the dyed-in-the-wool sectarians. Of these there were very many among the Lutheran theological professors and pastors, who for the most part, through their worldly and sinful lives, felt the stings of the Pietist leaders' reproofs for sin, righteousness and judgment to come, and greatly resented the reformation that they advocated in clergy and laity (warred against the Philistines, ; 6). They refuted the formalistic theories and practices of Romanists' sectarianism as its powers (brake down the wall of Gath, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">winepress'),</span><span class="font3"> the formalistic theories and practices of Calvinistic sectarianism (Jabneh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">he builds)</span><span class="font3"> and the formalistic theories and practices of Lutheran sectarianism (Ashdod, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortress),</span><span class="font3"> and set up prayer, praise and testimony meetings, catechetical classes and sermons and adult Bible classes throughout the Lutheran churches (built cities about Ashdod) and among the sectarians of the Calvinistic and even among Romanist churches (among the Philistines). In the years' long controversies with such sectarians God helped the Pietist movement (God helped him against the Philistines, ; 7) and against the treachery (Arabians, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">desert, wasters)</span><span class="font3"> of power-graspers (Gur </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[sojourn]</span><span class="font3"> -baal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[lord])</span><span class="font3"> and autocrats in state and church (Mehunims, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dwellers).</span><span class="font3"> Under the and-clericalist blows that this movement gave the clergy by its emphasis on the sole priesthood of the consecrated, the clericalists (Ammonites </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[from one's people],</span><span class="font3"> ; 8) gave manifestation of subjection to it by introducing the called-for reforms (gave gifts to Uzziah). By the fruits of righteousness developed by their preaching, teaching and writings, and the benevolent institutions in the form of the Halle University, colleges, schools, meetings for edification, orphanage, old folks' homes and missionary activities that they founded, this movement's fame (his name) was broadcast, not only among Christians, but also among the nobility, rulers of the present evil world (even to the entering in of Egypt); for it activities made it very strong (strengthened himself exceedingly).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) This movement did much to strengthen its executive powers (built towers in Jerusalem, ; 9). This was particularly done as to those who had an evangelistic, a conversionist, work to do toward outsiders (comer gate [the same as the gate of Ephraim, Neh. 12: 39, implied in Neh. 3: 7, EJ, 154, 155]), for whom special schools and schooling as strengthened were conducted as symbolic towers, fortifications, as it also strengthened those powers of its executiveness that were occupied with second-deathers (valley gate, Neh. 3: 13, EJ, 156, 1); and it likewise strengthened its executive powers on lines of turning from evil to good (turning); and it made all these activities and arrangements strong (fortified them). This movement made many strong arrangements for foreign missionary work, through the Halleians' sending out laborers to India, where Schwartz and Ziegenbalg worked very fruitfully, and to America and South Africa, where especially the Pietists of Herrnhut, the Moravian missionaries, labored fruitfully. Moreover, the Halle Pietists sent forth missionaries who worked in Denmark, Switzerland, Russia, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> They even did Jewish missionary work, for which they had a special training institute (built towers in the desert, ; 10). The Halleians founded beneficent homes, schools, colleges and one university, that of Halle, which were veritable fountains sending out the waters of Truth from their midst. The Wuerttembergers got control of the Tuebingen University and founded colleges and schools and made them a fountain of Truth for Wuerttemberg, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (digged many wells). By these they gave the Truth, not only to their inmates and students, but through the graduates of these colleges and these universities they sent forth over 5,000 Truth servants, who watered God's numerous flock (had much cattle), both among the lower classes and the middle classes (low country. . . plains). It had many who planted and watered the seed of the Word (Husbandmen) and many who gave special attention to developing the fruits of the Spirit</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(vine dressers), scattered throughout various kingdoms, e.g., Germany, Denmark, Russia, Holland and Britain (mountains) and many other fruitful fields of labor in heathen countries (Carmel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fruitful field)',</span><span class="font3"> for this movement delighted in the works of God's husbandry, in bringing forth the Truth and the Spirit of the Truth (loved husbandry).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) The Pietist movement had to fight for every inch of territory that it gained and had to fight to keep it. Therefore it had to have and train many warriors to fight the Lord's battles, in which they zealously took part (Uzziah had an host... to war, ; 11). They were divided into various kinds of fighters (by bands). There were especially three groups of such warriors, who corresponded to the three great groups of the Pietists: (1) those who were trained at the Halle University and at its various institutes, schools and colleges and who constituted the largest part of the warriors (Jeiel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[removed by God,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to their separation from the spirit of Lutheran formalism]), their leaders being the scholars of this movement (the scribe); (2) the Wuerttemberg Pietists, who were more conservative and less aggressive in controversy and practical measures for the advancement of Pietism, for which reason it was more favored by the civil and church rulers; nevertheless they did effective work as a distinct group of Pietists (Maaseiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[work of Jehovah]</span><span class="font3"> the ruler [literally, officer]); and ( 3) the Herrnhut, or Moravian Brethren, whose leader was Count Zinzendorf, these, like the Halle section, being eminent for their missionary activities at home and abroad; while these were the least aggressive of the three groups in controversy they produced some very able hymn writers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> in English, Montgomery, and in German, Zinzendorf; and these are aptly typed by Hananiah ( </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is gracious). </span><span class="font3">These groups had able controversialist leaders. The main ones of the Halle wing of the Pietists were Spener, Franke, Breithaupt, Baier, Anton, Mechaelis, Lange and Hemschmied. The main</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">controversialists of the Wuerttemberg wing of the Pietists were Jaeger, Hochstetter, Reuchlin, Weismann, Rieger. The ablest representative of this seed on of Pietism as text critic, commentator and student of Prophecy (Dan. 12: 5) was J. A. B eng el. Zinzendorf was almost the only outstanding controversialist of the Moravian Brethren wing of the Pietists (chief of the fathers of the mighty men, ; 12); yet the great and his great main controversialists were no inconsiderable number (number. . . two thousand and six hundred). But under their leadership (under their hand, ; 13) there was an unusually large number of leadings who were armed controversially and fit to fight in defense of the principles of Pietism and in attack on the dead orthodoxy against which Pietism was an energetic protest (an army, three hundred thousand. . . five hundred). These fought continually with strong and victorious power in defense of the principles of the movement (made war with mighty power) as they advanced its interests (to help the king) against its many foes (against the enemy).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) The movement, especially in its Halle and Wuerttemberg adherents, through their educational institutions, prepared for its warriors every kind of thorough armor for their warfare (prepared ... all the host, ; 14). This armor consisted of arguments that defended the warriors from their enemies' attacks (shields), that, contained in controversial writings, made them strong to attack their enemies (spears), that defended their intellectual grasp of the controversial truths (helmets), that defended every vital part of their teachings (habergeons; literally, coats of mail), that gave them the proofs which enabled them to shoot sharp teachings at their enemies (bows) and that equipped them to cast controversial questions with deadly effect at their opponents (slings to cast stones), thus equipping them thoroughly for defensive and aggressive warfare. Moreover, in executive respects (in Jerusalem,; 15) this movement made armorial weapons of war (engines) as a defense of its fortifications (towers) and its strong points (bulwarks). These were constructed by brethren, like Spener, Franke, Canstein, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> as able developers of the practical means of defense against attack (invented by cunning men). The chief of these armorial weapons were the Halle publishing house, the Halle and Tuebingen theological faculties, which by lectures and publications mightily defended this movement, the Canstein Institute, which saw to the publication of Bibles, defenses of Christianity in the form of tracts, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> the Home Missionary Institute, the Foreign Missionary Institute and the Jewish Missionary Institute. All of these combined did a marvelous work in defense of this movement and in attack of error and wrong. Particularly did its short attacks in the form of tracts (to shoot arrows) and its larger publications in the form of aggressive and defensive questions and answers (great stones) deal hard blows at its enemies. The many institutions of practical usefulness that the Halle Pietists operated wonderfully helped it to success (marvelously helped), until on all sides it was strong in itself and in the influence that it exerted (till he was strong).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) As can be inferred from the above, its two greatest and most influential exponents were Spener and Franke, men of the fullest spirit of consecration, the former giving it mainly its theoretical form, the latter cooperating therein, giving it mainly its practical form, the former dying 15 years (1707) after it became the more favored movement of God's people, and the latter dying 35 years (1727) thereafter. Much like our Pastor, Franke was a marvel of theoretic knowledge, high organizing powers, tireless activity and practical executiveness, and was the all-influential spirit in the Halle form of Pietism up to the time of his death; and for nearly ten years afterward his works were carried on much in his spirit and forms by able adjutants. But about ten years after his death pride, especially in the form of arrogance, conceit, and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">self-sufficiency, began to set in, in small part in the Halle and Wuerttemberg wings of Pietism, and in large part in the Herrnhut, or Moravian Brethren, wing of Pietism. Count Zinzendorf, a zealous and philanthropic spirit, ran well for years; but later his place as the main leader of these, the natural arbitrariness of his hereditary aristocracy, his dictatorial use of power and the conceit that his success brought increasingly manifested themselves, until he became a liability to the movement and was mainly responsible for its decline in real usefulness. Especially was this true of the last six years of the movement's preeminence, his followers supporting him unquestioningly (his heart was lifted up, ; 16); and the final outcome was its setting aside as the more favored movement of God's people (to his destruction). The following is the way that he wrote of himself: &quot;We, Lewis, by Divine providence, Bishop, Liturgist and Ordinary [executive] of the churches known by the name of the Brethren, and under the auspices of the same, Advocate during life, with full power over the hierarchy of the Slavonic Unity, Guardian of the circuits and President both of the General Synod and of the teaching leadership, by these presents declare, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.” </span><span class="font3">Spangenberg, his biographer, enumerates the titles that Zinzendorf appended to his name on certain papers, as follows: Count and Lord of Zinzendorf and Pottendorf, Lord of the baronies of Frey deck, Schoeneck, and Thurstein and of the vale of Wachovia, Lord of the Manor of the Upper, Middle and Lower Bertholdsdorf, Hereditary Warden of the Chase to his Imperial Roman majesty, in the Duchy of Austria, below the Ens, and at one time Aulic [courtier] and Justicial Counsellor to the Elector of Saxony.&quot; Enough said!</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) The evil of busybodying in priestly matters that Uzziah did is typical of the busybodying that the Moravian brethren, especially Count Zinzendorf, exercised in the priestly work of our Lord and the consecrated brethren in the Wesleyan movement. A few</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">explanations are necessary to clarify the situation. John and Charles Wesley and a few kindred spirits already in their under-graduate days at Oxford University were nicknamed Methodists, because of their strict and methodical practice of religion. Both Wesleys had for years been consecrated before in 1738 they met Peter Bohler, a Moravian preacher, who conducted a fruitful ministry in London. He led them to &quot;conversion,&quot; as they called it; but we believe, so far as John and Charles Wesley were concerned, it was their quickening as 2 of the 70. John, deeply interested in the Moravians' religiousness, desired to become better acquainted with them, and, therefore, journeyed to Germany, where he met Count Zinzendorf, who, to test his humility and simplicity, set him to work in a garden. To ease his work Wesley removed his coat and vest and worked at his task. After a while Zinzendorf suggested that the former go with him to visit a neighboring count. Wesley acceded, asking for a short delay to wash his muddy hands and perspiring face and put on his coat and vest. The count demurred, saying that he should go exactly as he was, as a proof of his sincerity and simplicity, to which Wesley also consented. This occurred in Marienborn, Germany. Thence Wesley journeyed 350 miles eastward to the Moravian headquarters at Herrnhut where he spent a few weeks and learned to appreciate the Moravians more and more, though he saw some things that met his disapproval, which, being minor matters, did not disturb his fellowship with them. Returning to England, he shortly began what is called the Evangelistic Revival, in which he greatly stressed repentance toward God, faith in the Lord Jesus unto justification and a life of entire consecration or sanctification. The matter of &quot;conversion,&quot; as beginning in a series of great mental perturbations and outward groanings for sin, and culminating in a sudden outburst of the full assurance of faith that one's sins are forgiven and of resultant peace and joy, often accompanied with outbursts of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">intense excitement and exultation, was stressed in this evangelistic work. This they called the first blessing.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) They called the experience of entire consecration or sanctification, which they identified with Christian perfection, the second blessing. These teachings brought Wesley and his colaborers into collision with the Moravians, especially with Zinzendorf, all of whom identified justification and sanctification, and so stressed justification by faith as to claim entire freedom from obligations to the moral law, they claiming that Christ's imputed righteousness was the only righteousness needed and had by the Christian. They did not believe that Christ imputed only so much of His merit as brought one up to perfection. Hence they tended to antinomianism, literally, against legalism, i.e., opposition to the thought that the moral law had any rule over the justified, while Wesley properly insisted that the justified are to obey the Divine Law, not thereby to be justified, but to evidence their justification as genuine. Moreover, he insisted that in consecration one seek to fulfill the law of disinterested love, while in justification he seek to fulfill the law of duty love, the former as an evidence of the genuineness of consecration. These two opposing views led to a head-on collision between the Evangelical Revival movement and the Pietist movement as represented in the Moravians and championed by Zinzendorf. The fellowship between the Evangelistic Revivalists and the Moravians had been so close before this controversy broke out that they all met and worked together, especially at London, where the latter had a number of able and influential preachers. Zinzendorf and his preachers began to attack the Revivalists on their differences above mentioned and excluded the Wesleys and their colaborers from the meetings at Fetters Lane, London, after the debate had assumed large and decided proportions. This led Wesley to read a paper on the subject at the London Church, and he followed that reading by inviting those who held with him to withdraw from the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">London Church. About 75 arose and followed Wesley out of the meeting. Similar actions occurred elsewhere, the Moravians excluding Wesley's colaborers, and they resultantly withdrawing those agreeing with them. This greatly enraged the Moravians, especially Zinzendorf, who strove to subjugate the Wesleyans to his and their sway, alleging that they were right, but the Wesleyans proving them to be wrong. The result was division where before there had been unity. It is this situation that is the antitype of; 16-20.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) Now will be traced the connection between the type and antitype of these verses. The course of the Moravians under Zinzendorfs leading was a gross impingement against the priestly work of the Evangelical Revival, or the Methodist movement, as it is more popularly called; for Moravianism was in reality a sectarianizing of the priestly Pietist movement; hence it was a crown-lost leaders' movement; and for it to attempt priestly work was a sin against God's order (transgressed. . . God, ; 16). This in God's sight made that movement busybody in the priestly work of the Evangelical Revival; for the latter was led by John Wesley, a star-member, and by Charles Wesley, his special helper as such. It means that the Pietist movement, no more a priestly movement, was attempting to offer the choice human powers of a no-longer priestly movement as antitypical incense (to bum incense ... of incense); for it actually entered into the priestly condition, where it had no right to be (went into the temple of the Lord). Jesus (Azariah), followed first by John Wesley, then by Charles Wesley and then by their now increasing number of priests, followed after them in the ensuing controversy (the [high, ; 20] priest went after him . . . fourscore priests . . . valiant men, ; 17), and opposed their usurpations and power-grasping, whereby they sought to subject the priesthood to themselves; for they sought to set aside the Scriptural work of the Evangelical Revival and put their mistaken work, their antmomian work, in its</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">place. Their busybodying was just like that of that evil servant's busybodying in the priestly work of the Epiphany messenger and his colaborers in England in the small parallel (EJ, 385-390). And certainly Jesus and the valiant Wesleyans withstood the Moravians, led by Zinzendorf, to their face in vigorous protest at their usurpation (withstood. . . the king, ; 18). By their proofs of the erroneousness of the Moravian teachings involved in the controversy, i.e., by act, they remonstrated with them (not unto thee, Uzziah, to bum incense). And by their right teaching on the subject in controversy, i.e., by act, they declared that the Moravians were busybodying in a priestly function (to the priests, the sons of Aaron). Their act of teaching the pertinent Truth also showed that they were the consecrated priesthood (consecrated to bum incense). By act, i.e., their controversy, they also charged them to go out from the priestly condition (go out of the sanctuary). Furthermore, by their proving the erroneousness of the Moravians' and the truth of their view, they charged them of being guilty of sin (thou hast trespassed) and that they would not be honored by the Lord for it (neither . . . thine honor . . . God).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(13) This course of the Lord Jesus through Wesley and his colaborers greatly incensed the Moravians, particularly Zinzendorf, who said of the obligatoriness of the Divine Law, &quot;I trample upon it.&quot; He said the same of Wesley's doctrine of entire sanctification, Christian perfection. They, especially he, became very angry, yea, full of wrath at the opposition of the faithful priests, as though the latter were the intruders (Uzziah was wroth, ; 19). Zinzendorf became furious over Wesley's doctrine of entire sanctification, exclaiming, &quot;This is the error of errors. I pursue it through the world with fire and sword. I trample upon it. I devote it to utter destruction. Christ is our sole perfection. Whoever follows inherent perfection denies Christ. All Christian perfection is faith in the blood of Christ, and is wholly imputed, not inherent [he here confused sanctification</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">with justification].&quot; In the debate Wesley forced him to make the following admission: &quot;A believer is altogether holy in heart and life ... he loves God with all his heart, and serves Him with all his powers.&quot; To this Wesley replied, &quot;I mean nothing else by perfection, or Christian holiness.&quot; To this Zinzendorf rejoined: &quot;But this is not the Christian's holiness. He is not more holy, if he loves more, or less holy if he loves less. In the moment he is justified, he is sanctified wholly; and from that time he is neither more, nor less holy, even unto death [here, again, he confused sanctification with justification; what he said is true of our reckoned perfection in justification; it certainly is false as to sanctification]. Our whole justification and sanctification are in the same instant. From the moment any one is justified, his heart is as pure as it ever will be.&quot; Thereupon Wesley asked, &quot;Do we not, while we deny ourselves, die more and more to [self and] the world and live to God?&quot; Zinzendorf answered, &quot;We reject all selfdenial. We trample upon it. We do, as believers, whatsoever we will, and nothing more. We laugh at all mortification. No purification precedes perfect love.&quot; An unclean crown-loser, of course, he could not see the pertinent truth. Speaking of St. James' epistle, he said: &quot;If it were thrown out of the canon [Bible], I would not restore it.&quot; His popish autocracy aroused much opposition among some of his English followers, which made him furious. He expressed his wrath as follows; &quot;I will have nothing more to do with those English brothers ... I disapprove of the absolution that is given to such Korah spirits. I laugh at the English national self-righteousness ... I desire to be erased from the list of English laborers, and not to be named among them until. . . [they] make acknowledgment in writing of their being deceived.&quot;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) Such teachings, arrogance and wrath were manifest while the Moravian movement was using Bible passage to justify its errors (a censer in his hand, ; 19), in an attempt to use all their choice human powers in a religious service (to burn incense). How could it have been otherwise than that their wrath, arrogance and the popish spirit of Zinzendorf made apparent crown-losing errors in their views (leprosy. . . forehead), which appeared before these priests in God's house (priests . . . Lord), as they were standing beside the Church in its capacity of comforting, strengthening, encouraging, warning, correcting, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> their brethren (beside the incense altar) ? Jesus and the cooperating underpriests attentively viewed these (Azariah, and all the priests, looked upon him, ; 20) and recognized that they were afflicted with a spiritual error indicative of their having as individuals lost their crowns, and of the sectarian, crown-lost, teaching condition of their movement (behold, he was leprous in his forehead). By their Truth opposition these priests quickly cast the crown-losers and their movement out from the true Church, as unclean crown-losers and as a crown-lost movement (thrust him out); and by their defenses of their errors they hastened their exit (hasted also to go out), because the Lord Himself had smitten their evil course with crown-losers' blindness (smote the king . . smitten him, 5; 20). This busybodying began late in 1738, about 5*4 years before Pietism ceased to be the more favored movement of God's people, even as J.F.R.'s small parallel's busybodying began about 5*4 days before he ceased to be the small antitype of Uzziah. At the same time the Halle and Wuerttemberg wings of the Pietist movement kept deteriorating in sectarianism, antitypical crown-lost leprosy, all three of them remaining in this condition until the movement as a whole ceased being the more favored one (leper unto . . . death, 5; 21). They pursued their own separate work (dwelt. . . house), severed from the loyal brethren (cut off. . . Lord). During these 5*4 years the Evangelistic Revival, or Wesleyan movement, presided over the affairs of the Lord's work and of the Lord's people (Jotham </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah is upright] . . .</span><span class="font3"> was over the king's house,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">judging). The history of the Pietism movement has been recorded by Church historians and biographers, and particularly by John Wesley (acts of Azariah. . . Uzziah . . . chronicles . . . Isaiah, 6; 22). The memory of this movement is kept as one of the more favored movements of God's people (buried . . . fathers in the city of David . . . field . . . kings, 23). And the Evangelical Revival movement, or the Wesleyan movement, succeeded it as that of the more favored people of God (Jotham . . . stead). From this history let us learn to remain humble amid successful and exalted service, if God gives it to us.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) In the foregoing, on the basis of 2 Kings 15: 7 and 2 Chro. 26: 23, it was pointed out, with the assistance of the facts of the fulfilment in the large and small parallels, that Jotham ( </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah is upright)</span><span class="font3"> acted as Uzziah's deputy in ruling over the land for about 5*4 years before Uzziah's death. These 5*4 years' activities of antitypical Jotham should be given more attention than was given them above. The parallel years of typical and antitypical Jotham's reigns were 777-761 B.C. and 1744-1760 A. D., 1845 years apart, as the parallel periods require. Antitypical Jotham was the good Wesleyan Methodist movement (2 Kings 15: 32; 2 Chro. 27: 1). It began its special individual or separate period of activity later in the same year of our counting, as the Calvinistic Methodist movement (second year of Pekah . . . king of Israel, 32, ; ) began its separate course, the latter starting before April 1, hence in an earlier year of God's reckoning, the former after April 1 in the early part of another year, but in the same year as we count years. The harmony of the involved chronologies proves this [P. '40, 182, (6) ]. This movement had the germ of its beginning 25 years before, 1719, in John Wesley's beginning to yearn after God, while yet a scholar at the Charter House School or Academy in London, a year before he entered Oxford University. In his later years, from 1729 onward, as a fellow at the university, which he became in its Lincoln College, 1726, he expanded his spirit of consecration as the leader of a number of consecrated students, who because of their holy lives of loving service to the poor, needy and fallen, and because of their methodical ways of living to fulfill their aspirations for godliness, were in that year, 1729, nicknamed Methodists. In that year he read William Law's epoch-making book on holiness, called, Serious Call, and by it his aspirations for holiness were very greatly deepened. In 1732 he visited Law and for six or seven years had fruitful fellowship with him; but the latter then becoming a vagarious mystic and not teaching justification by faith, Wesley broke with him. Ordained in 1725, from 1727 to 1729 he assisted his father as vicar in clerical duties, and in Nov., 1729, he returned to his duties as fellow (teacher, but not professor) in Lincoln College, Oxford University, where he remained until 1735, increasing in grace, knowledge and fruitfulness in service. In 1735 Wesley went to Georgia as minister to the English in the colony and missionary to the Indians. On the voyage to Georgia the calmness and resignation of some Moravians on his ship during a storm that momentarily threatened to sink the ship greatly impressed him. In Georgia his ministry was unsuccessful, due to his too great strictness. He first met the Moravian Peter Bohler, who greatly influenced him toward deeper faith in 1738 in London, beginning the third day after Wesley's return; for he had left Georgia in the fall of 1737 and reached London on Feb. 3, 1738. During the years from 1719 to 1738 Wesley developed more and more, until, May 24, 1738, he experienced what he called his conversion, but what we believe was the quickening of his new creature accompanying his being made a starmember—his beginning to share in that bestowal of the Spirit on the antitypical 70, typed in Num, 11: 16, 17, 2530. Then followed his visit to Germany to see Count Zinzendorf at Marienborn, Southwestern Germany, and the Moravian headquarters at Herrnhut, Southeastern Germany.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(16) In the Fall of 1738, he began to see the first encroachments of Pietism on him, as exemplified in the Moravians; and since it was the beginning of antitypical Uzziah's attempting to offer incense, his resistance was the beginning of antitypical Jotham's judging the people of the land as antitypical Uzziah's regent ( 15: 5; 26: 21). Above we traced these busybodying acts, so need not repeat them here. Here we need only to stress the thought that they began about 514 years before the good Wesleyan movement became the ascendant more favored movement of the people of God; but during these 514 years the movement did much good. At first its three main leaders were John and Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, one of the greatest pulpit orators of all times. The preaching of these three being too trenchant for the dead orthodoxy of the Anglican Church, the Anglican clergy of London and Bristol, their first evangelistic fields, closed their church doors to them, which led them to preach in the fields, where their immense audiences, sometimes reaching 80,000 people, found ample space, whom none of the churches were large enough to accommodate, and where they were fiee from churchly restrictions. Another important step of Wesley's was to organize the justified into small groups called bands, which served to strengthen them, especially in right living. While Wesley's stewardship doctrine was the teaching, Perfect love is God's ideal for the consecrated, the wickedness of the lower middle and the lower classes in England, to whom the Wesleyan movement primarily appealed, made him lay great stress on repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus for justification by faith. While Whitefield preached eternal torment as the main motive of bringing people to repentance and faith, Wesley made the love of God and Christ for man and the evils of sin and the blessings of righteousness the motive to produce such effects. Whitefield depended mainly on oratory and dramatics to influence his hearers. Wesley used for these effects a friendly, loving</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and logical exposition of Biblical doctrines as the substance of his preaching, speaking in an earnest and not loudly pitched voice. So penetrative was his voice that though speaking slightly louder than a conversational voice he could be distinctly heard by 60,000 people. The result was that Wesley influenced his hearers more deeply and lastingly than did Whitefield. In 1740, Whitefield stressing Calvinistic predestinarianism with its particularistic merit of Christs death, and Wesley stressing Arminianism with its universalistic merit of Christ, a controversy broke out between them, resulting in a division, out of which emerged two kinds of Methodists: Arminian and Calvinian Methodists, the former being the movement of antitypical Jotham, as the more favored movement of God's people, and the latter becoming antitypical Pekah, as the less favored movement of God's people. The former's work increasing, Methodist laymen began to preach; but not being ordained they did not administer baptism and the Lord's supper. Societies of believers began to be formed; and amid these, classes consisting of the consecrated were formed; and thus the good work progressed until the Wesleyan movement became in 1744 the ascendant more favored one of God's people.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) The thing that was the inauguration of antitypical Jotham's sole reign was the creation and meeting of the conferences (began to reign, 32; 1). Wesley had a number of clerical supporters from late 1738 onward in his movement; and to these ere long were added the laymen who became qualified and active as evangelistic lay preachers. These to the number of six clergymen and four lay preachers held in June, 1744, for five days the first good Methodist movement's conference. It was here decided to have them annually. Here were discussed doctrinal, ethical and practical matters, and in time these conferences under Wesley's direction became the highest and most authoritative body in the movement. Elaborate minutes of each conference were kept and were published, so that all the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">movement's adherents might leam to know of its deliberations and decisions. Wesley's decisions were accepted as the authorized expressions of each conference. It was Wesley's firm but kindly control of this movement that kept it as one of the very best of the more favored movements of God's people. He held the same kind of teaching and executive control over this movement as our Pastor maintained over the Parousia movement. This movement began its ascendancy just 25 years after Wesley began to seek after the Lord in 1719, at the age of 17 years (twenty and five, 33; 1); and it lasted 16 years, 1744-1760, in executorship for God (sixteen years in Jerusalem, 33; 1). The movement was mothered by the possession or heritage of truth, righteousness and holiness with which Wesley was endowed and with which he under God endowed the movement (mother's. . . Jerusha [h] [possession, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">inheritance],</span><span class="font3"> 33; 1); and this endowment was one begun by the righteousness of faith (daughter of Zadok </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[righteous], </span><span class="font3">33; 1). This movement in matters pertaining to God (in the sight of the Lord, 34; 2) acted in harmony with the Lord's Word as then due (did. . . right, 34; 2), treading the footsteps of the Pietistic movement in all that it did righteously (according . . . Uzziah, 34; 2). But it did not do the evil that the Pietistic movement did in seeking to dominate a star member by attempting to undertake priestly functions; for the good Methodist movement did not attempt to subjugate Wesley to its will, as did the Moravian section of antitypical Uzziah, especially in Count Zinzendorf (entered not into the temple, ; 2).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(18) However, there were great evils practiced by the people in high, middle and low society; for much unbelief, misbelief, blasphemy, disregard of parental, school and civil authority, murder, robbery, immorality, slander, perjury and political corruption prevailed (people did corruptly, ; 1). Moreover, sectarianism in the form of Romanism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism, Baptistism, Congregationalism, Quakerism and Moravianism, instead of being set aside, prevailed in sharp rivalry between its sects (the high places were not removed, 35;); and the sectarians in each of these sects served the several interests of these sects by seeking their prosperity, instead of that of the true Church (sacrificed. . . high places, 35;), and used up their choice human powers for each one's particular sect (burned incense . . . high places, 35; ). The good Methodist movement did much work in teaching consecration and entire sanctification, as well as sought to bring the justified to consecration and to carrying it out in holy living, self- and world-denying service and joyful endurance of evil (built the high gate . . . Lord, 35; 3). Moreover, it wrought much in its executive powers in the way of building chapels, orphanage and schools and of printing Christian literature and school literature (on the wall of Ophel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[hill\</span><span class="font3"> the ridge in the south-east corner of Jerusalem, where the king's palace from the time of David onward stood, and where the kings ordinarily exercised their executive authority and works] he built much, ; 3). The title to these chapels, orphanage, schools and the printed literature was vested in Wesley, until late in his life by the Deed of Declaration he vested it in 100 brethren whom he chose to take over things at his death, even as our Pastor did as to his belongings that he put in the name of the Society. The religious literature that he published was partly his own writings and partly extracts from the writings of the most helpful authors since the Apostolic times, especially those of the best Christian authors of the preceding 150 years, including extracts from German writers, like Luther and Arndt. These books in the second edition consisted of 30 octavo volumes, entitled, The Christian Library. Wesley furnished these extracts to bring to the poor Christian families some of the best pen-products of this Age; for, an able scholar himself, he sought also the spiritual intellectual elevation of the masses among whom chiefly he worked. An admirer of good, secular literature, both in prose and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">poetry, he also published, years after the movement ceased being ascendant, in many volumes a library for uneducated Christian families, for their improvement in good secular things, consisting of extracts from some of the best secular literature of the world. He, himself, made these two sets of extracts, at inns, at friends' homes, in his study and on horseback; he read through these books, drawing heavy lines through what he desired omitted, and then handed what was left of the books over to printers to print. The work on The Christian Library was done in his scant spare time from 1749 to 1755. For his schools he wrote most of the textbooks there used, like English, German, French and Spanish Grammars, and textbooks on arithmetic, orthography, psychology, rhetoric, logic, science, etc. These books were almost always abridgments of larger works. During this period his notes on the New Testament appeared, mainly extracted from good authors, especially from Bengel's Gnomon (Register), one of the ablest of the short commentaries on the New Testament, which, despite its 200 years' age, is still useful.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(19) This movement gathered and organized what they called societies, actually churches, consisting of its converts and consecrated ones, throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (built dries in the mountains of Judah, ; 4). As developers and strengthened of its work it organized a series of circuits (built castles, ; 4), into which its working districts in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland were divided, ministered to by preachers (forests [trees representing leaders or great ones]) appointed by Wesley, called circuit riders, who usually traveled horseback, an institution something like that of our pilgrims. It also established a local ministry (towers) consisting of laymen called local preachers (forests), who ministered locally and in nearby suburbs and village, but did not serve circuits. These two sets of helpers were a mighty buttress to the movement. From the outstart this movement's more public work, in 1738, had almost constant</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">conflicts with the bishops and clergy of the Anglican Church, who complained mainly and bitterly against the movement's spokesmen as busybodying in their dioceses and parishes, as stealing their sheep, and disregarding order in the Church. Especially three of the bishops wrote against the good Wesleyan movement, particularly against Wesley,—Gibson, bishop of London, Lavington, bishop of Exeter and Warburton, bishop of Gloucester. Wesley answered each one of them. Even bishop Butler, author of the Analogy, forbade his speaking in his diocese, that of Durham. Numerous clerics wrote against him, especially the Rev. Mr. Thomas Church of London; and he replied. He was too good a logician and Biblicist not to have refuted them well. Against their complaint that he had no right to enter their dioceses or their parishes he replied that the only reason that he had for it was that they neglected the work of evangelizing the people of their dioceses and parishes, and that for a matter of mere order he would not allow souls for whom Christ died to perish, as long as he had the means in his hands for their rescue. It was in this controversy that he answered their charge that he was a busybody in their dioceses and parishes by the epigram that has become a proverb, &quot;The world is my parish,&quot; basing it on the great commission of Matt. 28: 18-20 and Mark 16: 15, 16. The clergy were the main inciters of vicious mobs and great riots against this movement's preachers and adherents. This controversy was a war between clericalism and the good Wesleyan movement (he fought. . . Ammonites, ; 5). And, certainly, it gained the victory in the warfare; for not only were the bishops and clergymen not able to justify their neglect of the people, which was one of the great causes of the reign of gross wickedness in Britain and Ireland at that time—a neglect that this movement not only rubbed in hard on them, but that was one of the best of justifications for its existence. Its, especially Wesley's use of Scripture, reason and facts, so completely refuted these sticklers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for church order and these neglectors of souls, to the detriment of God's work and of the salvation of many, that in time they had to keep silence and could find no mobs that would riot against the Wesleyan preachers and adherents (prevailed against them).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) To evade their arguments the clericalists had to give up to them their doctrine of justification by faith alone, as the truth fitted for justified humans, i.e., a perfect nature lower than the Divine nature (hundred talents of silver), and began to teach justification by faith and works. Indeed, out from among their own number many clergymen embraced the Wesleyan movement. Many more, while remaining in the Anglican Church, imbibed the spirit of this movement and evangelized their parishes and some of them did evangelistic work in circuits of their own, for the Wesleyan movement did much to reform clergy and laity in the Anglican Church. The King, George III, once remarked that Wesley and his associates did more good to the generality of the English people than did the hierarchy and clergy of the entire Anglican Church. Besides Wesley's brother, Charles, and Whitefield, he counted Vincent Perronet and William Grimshaw among some of his best clerical friends, both of them out-and-out Methodists. But best and highest of all, he counted the saintly John Fletcher, incumbent of the parish at Madeley, his best friend and ablest controversialist supporter. He had counted on his mantle falling on Fletcher, who, however, died a few years before Wesley's death. But the most valuable things that the clericalists had to yield the good Methodist movement were the many new creatures who, uncomfortable and out of place in the dead formalism of the Anglican Church, came into the loving and saintly atmosphere of the warm Methodists, who, like the Parousia brethren, were certainly a saintly people during the ascendancy of antitypical Jotham. These new creatures that came into this movement from the Anglican Church were of two classes: crownretainers (measures of wheat) and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">crown-losers (measures of barley). Their justification is also here typed—by the ten thousand, a multiple of ten, in each case typing that perfect natures lower than the Divine were meant, in this case reckonedly perfect men, justified without works by faith alone; and their justified human all was taken away from uses for the Anglican Church (ten thousand). These were the great losses that the bishops and the clergy underwent: (1) the loss of the truth on justification by faith alone without works, and their accepting of the Romanist error of justification by faith and works, at the same time accepting Rome's pertinent error on faith's being merely belief; (2) the loss of new creatures as crown-retainers from their midst; (3) the loss of new creatures as crown-losers from their midst; and (4) the loss of the human all of such new creatures from uses for the benefit of Anglicanism. This certainly impoverished the Church of England. Points (2)-(4) imply that these generally absented themselves from attendance at, and support of the Church of England, despite Wesley's urgent advice to the contrary; for he struggled all his life against his followers' seceding from the Church of England, designing his societies in each parish to be a part of the local Church of England—a church within a church, as it were, and himself remaining a minister of it until death (so much. . . pay unto him), to its lasting loss (second year, and the third).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(21) It was because the good Methodist movement was whole-souled in its devotion to the Lord, the Truth, as then due, the brethren and all others with whom it had to do, on the lines of justification by faith alone and entire consecration unto the Lord (prepared his ways before . . God, ; 6), that it became stronger and stronger. In these matters it was as faithful to the Lord as any of the other more favored movements of God's people from antitypical Rehoboam's time until its own time, if not more so. The zeal, self-sacrifice and labors of Wesley and his ordained and unordained circuit and local preachers and the generality of the rest of the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">adherents of this movement was perhaps unexcelled since the days of the Apostles, up to their time. No wonder that they became as a movement mighty for God, truth, righteousness and holiness (Jotham became mighty). In externals they grew mightily in the number of the societies and membership therein, in the number of classes and members therein, in the number of the local preachers and circuit riders, in the number of ordained ministers, in the number of their chapels and in the attendances thereat, in the number of their schools and pupils therein and in the number and importance of their publications and institutions of benevolence. The bulk of their preachers and ministers were men of such characters as wrought mightily for the spread of truth, righteousness and holiness. Filled with the idea of the priesthood of the consecrated, the bulk of those who professed consecration among the general membership of the movement were burning and shining lights in their own communities and often beyond them. The number of adherents ran into the tens of thousands, and of general and local preachers into the hundreds, by 1760. Their hymnology greatly increased as especially the two Wesleys, particularly Charles, the greatest of hymn-writers, who left behind him between 6,000 and 7,000 hymns, all of good quality, some of supreme quality, e.g., Jesus, Refuge of My Soul, poured out their sentiments in fine rhyme and rhythm. Another feature of the strength of this movement was its uplifting effects upon ministers and laymen, not only in the Anglican Church, but also in the Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Baptist, Quaker and Moravian Churches. This was due to the fact that the movement was wholly non-sectarian; for Wesley, though an Anglican clergyman, required no doctrinal or creedal tests from his adherents. All that he required for membership in his societies was repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, with a life in harmony therewith; in his classes, entire consecration reasonably lived out; in local officers, stewards and local</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">preachers, and in his other preachers and circuit riders and clerical assistants, in addition to clearness in the truth, consecration attested by a life of self- and world-denial, sacrificial zeal and that holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. The strength of character in the leaders and leadings is evident from their meekly bearing mistreatment at the hands of mobs, as they were taught by Wesley to do. No wonder that it grew strong, since thus it prepared its ways before God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) During this period, apart from repelling the attacks of the bishops, clergy and others that these influenced to attack them, they had no theological controversies. Wesley's experience with his local and circuit preachers, mainly laymen, convinced him of the fact that there was no difference in the office designated by the Scriptural terms, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bishops,</span><span class="font3"> or overseers, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elders,</span><span class="font3"> or presbyters. He saw this from the facts: (1) that the Greek terms for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elders</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bishops</span><span class="font3"> mean the same office, the former meaning its honor, the latter its toil; (2) that they are used interchangeably in Acts. 20: 17, 28, of the leaders of the church at Ephesus, and of leaders in general, in Tit. 1: 5, (3) that in addressing the Philippians, not using the Greek word for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elders</span><span class="font3"> at all, he uses instead of it the plural of the Greek word for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">overseers, i.e., bishops,</span><span class="font3"> and speaks of the officers of the church at Philippi as bishops and deacons [the plural of bishop here, as in Acts 20: 28, of course, proves that Paul did not use the word in the modem sense of bishops, of whom there is not a number in one church, but used it in the sense of elders]; and (4) that in 1 Tim. 3: 1-13 Paul mentions only two offices in local ecclesias, calling the first bishops and the other deacons. Therefore Wesley, not a bishop in the Anglican sense of the word, had no compunction in appointing lay local and circuit preachers. For a while he did not have them administer baptism and the Lord's supper, but later came to do it. All his life he resisted the increasing pressure to make the Methodist societies churches and to separate them from the Anglican Church into a Methodist Church. And as long as he lived he succeeded therein; but not long after his death, 1791, this separation was made. Foreseeing such an event he made such arrangement as when the break would come, it would be accomplished with a minimum of disorder and ill-will. The three leaders of the movement, John and Charles Wesley and George Whitefield, especially the first, have been the subjects of biographies; for which their journals have been the chief sources. Some lesser lights in this movement have also been made the subjects of biographies, while the movement in its 16 years' duration holds a prominent place in histories of Methodism. These biographers and historians have been Methodists and non-Methodists (acts of Jotham . . . written. . . chronicles</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">. . . Judah. . . Israel and Judah, 36; 7). V.; 8, having in substance been explained in our comments on vs. 33; 1, where almost the same words and the same thoughts are given, needs no more comment here. This good movement ceased operating as the ascendant one in 1760 (Jotham slept with his fathers, 38; 9); but it was held in loving remembrance as being quite apostolic in character (was buried ... in the city of David), as worthy of being among the more favored movements of God's people (with his fathers, 38; ), to be succeeded by an evil Methodist movement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) There remain for our present study a consideration of 2 Kings 16: 1-4; 2 Chro. 28: 1-4, on part of the career of Ahaz, the son and successor of Jotham. We will not here discuss the whole of his career, because it touched on that of Pekah of Israel. Hence we will study here only that part of it until Pekah came on the scene. Thereafter we will return to a study of the kings of Israel following Zechariah, the last king of the Jehu dynasty, before resuming with Ahaz. Ahaz represents the bad Methodist movement, which became the more favored movement of God's people from 1760 to 1776, paralleling the reign of Ahaz, 761-745 (Ahaz . . . began to reign ... in Jerusalem, 2 Kings 16:1;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">2 Chro. 28: 1). One of the proofs of human depravity is the rise of corruption after a season of good development in most human movements; and such a procedure we witness in the Methodist movement, a procedure that almost always sets in, in the case of those new creatures who for a time run well and then later lose their crowns. We see this in the Parousia movement, changing in most cases to more or less cormpt Great Company movements during the Epiphany. This is also typed by the good Jotham being followed by the evil Ahaz. The bad Methodist movement was twenty years in existence before it came into the ascendancy as that of the more favored one of God's people. This movement first began to come into existence in 1740, at the occasion of the temporary break between Wesley, who was an Arminian, and Whitefield, who had shortly before become a Calvinist, during his first trip in America, under the influence of Jonathan Edwards. This breach was accompanied by an exchange of controversial pamphlets between the two, in which Whitefield was decidedly defeated; for he was no match for Wesley as a theologian and logician; and to make matters worse, the former descended to personalities. But after a short time he apologized for this; and a reconciliation between them took place; but Wesley did not again take him into the same complete friendly confidence as formerly. They remained friends for life, but differed on election and free grace permanently. And while friendly dispositions existed between Wesley and the good Methodist movement and Whitefield and his movement, which in 1744 became antitypical Pekah of antitypical Israel, the same year, but a little earlier in the year, as the good Methodist movement became antitypical Jotham of antitypical Judah, certain of the adherents of the latter movement began to develop a series of characteristics and do a series of acts in 1740 and onward that by 1760 put them into the ascendancy in the Methodist movement and that made them the bad Methodist movement (twenty years old, 2; 1). This</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">movement was in the ascendancy of the more favored ones among God's people for 16 years executively (sixteen years in Jerusalem, 2; 1).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) But the bad Methodist movement did not do right in matters pertinent to the Lord (not. . . right. . . Lord, 2; 1); for it disregarded certain of the teachings of the Apostles as set before them by Wesley (not. . . like David his father, 2; 1). Instead, this movement acted out the two main sins of the less favored movements of God's people—clericalism and sectarianism, two sins to which God's people, including the Levite movements of the Epiphany, are much tempted and into which most of them have fallen (walked. . . kings of Israel, 3; 2). This bad Methodist movement became guilty of sectarianism, not only as over against the older sects in England, but also over against the Whitefield movement, and of clericalism, inasmuch as increasingly certain of the ordained ministers in the movement felt themselves above the lay preachers, and the latter increasingly sought more of the clericalistic powers of the former. These two evil developments gave Wesley much concern and trouble, especially as his brother, Charles, was the leader of the ordained ministers in this unhealthy practice (in the ways, 3; 2). Even worse than this, the bad Methodist movement, both in its ordained and unordained preachers, sought to make forms of offices that without the names sought to grasp for and exercise the powers of the Anglican hierarchy and clergy (molten image for Baalim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[lords],</span><span class="font3"> ; 2). His unordained preachers sought long, but in vain, to make Wesley claim and exercise the powers of a hierarchical bishop and ordain them; and these unordained ministers were by Charles Wesley and other bishop-ordained ministers of this movement made to feel that they were of a lower order of Truth servants than the former. These evils grew increasingly, especially from 1760 to 1776. An even worse sin did this movement commit: As we saw above, while Whitefield used the dread horrors of eternal torment</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">as a cudgel with which to beat men to repentance and faith, Wesley used the love of God and the love of Jesus as expressed in His death as the main motive to lead men to repentance and faith. But many of Wesley's preachers did not follow his, rather they followed Whitefield's example, as to the motive that they offered sinners as the way to salvation. Hence they pictured God as filled with rage against sinners—so enraged as to hold, according to some of these preachers, sinners in great wrath over the yawning abyss of eternal torment, suspended on a hair, and that ready to be singed with torment's fires. This threat they used to drive men by fear to what they called repentance and faith; and they labored long, using up their choice human powers in such a service (burnt incense in the valley . . . Hinnom [Gehenna], ; 3).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(25) Not only so, but they went even further than this abominable practice. They sought with the same fear to keep their converts in line; yea, whenever they saw any becoming cooled in their fervor they threatened them with their view of hell fire; and in the most lurid colors they described the eternal torture of those who backslid (made his son to pass through the fire . . . burnt his children in the fire, 3; 3). Thus the bad Methodist movement worshiped antitypical Moloch, as the antitype of Ahaz, who put his living children in the red hot arms of typical Moloch until they were roasted unto death. The spokesmen of antitypical Ahaz have used eternal torment more perhaps than any other class of preachers as a means of frightening people unto their kinds of repentance and faith and unto keeping them therein. In this they have furnished the antitype of the sorriest of all caricatures of our Heavenly Father, the God of all mercy and of all grace. In this they outdid the greatest of all heathen abominations known in the Old Testament (abominations of the heathen). As Moloch worship was one of the sins for which God drove the seven nations out of Canaan, so is its antitype—the service given to Satan in serving</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the doctrine of eternal torment—the great sin of Christendom for which God during the interim, the Parousia and the Epiphany has been driving its cherishers out of the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit (whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel). As though these abominations were not a sufficient filling of the bad Methodist movement's cup of iniquity, they added to these sins by using their human all in wrong ways, (sacrificed, 4; 4), even using their reckonedly perfect choice human powers (burned incense), doing all of this in the interests of nominal-church systems (high places), of the civil governments of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales (hills) and of the great ones of this world, the British royalty, nobility and officials (under every green tree). Certainly, antitypical Ahaz committed gross abominations, more of which will be shown later. What a warning lesson he is to us who have followed the good movement of the Parousia to abstain from participation in the evil movements of the Epiphany. Let us be faithful to the teachings and arrangements of that wise and faithful servant, the antitypical small David, and thus we will be immune from the evils of bad movements following in time, but not in spirit, the good Parousia movement, and will be kept in the good movement following the Parousia movement, i.e., the Epiphany movement.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(26) As intimated above, an interruption of our description of the reign of antitypical Ahaz will here set in, in order to discuss the reigns of four of the last five movements of antitypical Israel—antitypical Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah and Pekah, the last of which reigns was in part contemporaneous with part of antitypical Ahaz's reign. The last king of antitypical Israel studied was antitypical Zechariah, who reigned one year [P '40, 182 (6)] , i.e., from April, 1730 to April, 1731 A.D., paralleling Zechariah's reign (791-790 B.C.). With antitypical Zechariah the antitypical Jehu dynasty, Presbyterian Puritan movements, came to an end. Sir Robert Walpole's ministry killed the last phase</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of the Presbyterian movements (Shallum . . . slew him, 2 Kings 15: 10), by refusing their adherents fullest religious liberty as dissenters, free from the few disabilities that the Anglican Church succeeded in putting on them in the settlement following the revolution of 1688. For a full month that ministry through Walpole, the prime minister, in control of parliament, manipulated religious matters in the Anglican Church as a barren political matter (Shallum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[requital],. . .</span><span class="font3"> Jabesh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[dry],</span><span class="font3"> 13;) and as an Anglican movement in antitypical Israel (Samaria). But the Anglican hierarchy and higher clergy in a controversial movement designed to comfort (Menahem </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[comforter],</span><span class="font3"> 14;) its adherents against infidelistic attacks from without and from within, resented this political interference, and put an end to it so far as concerned the management of that Church's internal affairs; for this movement in the hierarchy and the higher clergy in its good fortune (Gadi, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortunate)</span><span class="font3"> left its pleasures, ease and delights (Tirzah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">delight)</span><span class="font3"> and gave its attention to executive matters (Samaria, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">guard),</span><span class="font3"> and put an end to the Walpole ministry's meddling with the administration of the Anglican Church's internal affairs (smote Shallum). English Church and secular historians (chronicles . . . Israel, 15;) have described that ministry's participation in church affairs (acts of Shallum), especially in that part of it wherein they hypocritically denied the Presbyterian Puritans complete freedom from the few disabilities under which they suffered disadvantage as to the Anglican Church (conspiracy which he made).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(27) Typical Menahem reigned from 790 to 779 B.C.; and antitypical Menahem reigned from 1731 to 1742 A. D. (17). This Anglican movement conducted two great controversies against infidelistic movements, one within the Anglican Church and one outside that Church. The first was with what were called the Latitudinarians, who correspond to the present Broad Church Party in the Anglican Church. Archdeacon</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Francis Blackboume was their most influential leader. At that time, as at the present, they were infidelistically inclined. While contending against certain errors of antitypical Menahem, who opposed full religious and civil liberty, they went to the extreme of denying many partial truths held by that movement, questioning the full inspiration of the Bible, and tolerating almost any denial of its main teachings imperfectly held as they then were. These Latitudinarians despised antitypical Menahem, who sought to maintain the Divine authority of the Scriptures against them. The latter fought it at every turn and refused to submit to its authority as it was exercised by the bishops. They opposed and sought on infidelistic grounds to reduce the bishops to nonentities. They were rationalists, who certainly would give the bishoply and high clericalistic orthodox movement, antitypical Menahem, no access (Tiphsah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opening)</span><span class="font3"> to them, and as a result antitypical Menahem for the comfort of its adherents entered into a sharp controversy with, and refuted them completely (smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, 16;), and did this with all who held with them (coasts thereof). To do this antitypical Menahem had to leave the pleasures, ease and delights in which then its hierarchy and higher clerics reveled. It did this refutative work so thoroughly that it utterly overthrew the various companies or groups of the Latitudinarians (women) and destroyed their embryonic movements and powers (with child he ripped up). This controversy occurred in the outstart of antitypical Menahem's reign.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) The reign of antitypical Menahem began in 1731 (nine and thirtieth year of Azariah [Uzziah], 17) and lasted 11 years (P '40, 182 (6); years in Samaria). Despite some good it was as a whole an evil reign, and that because it was a typically hierarchical and higher clerical one. Hence it abounded in the evils of hierarchism and clericalism and sectarianism (did evil, 18;). Despite protests to the contrary, it adhered to the clericalism and sectarianism that the Lutheran</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">movement as antitypical Jeroboam introduced and used to mislead antitypical Israel (departed not. . . Jeroboam . . . made Israel to sin). It had a by far more important controversy with Deism than with the Latitudinarians (Pul </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[elephant],</span><span class="font3"> 19;). Deism is the belief that, despising the Divine Revelation, the Bible, bases its religion on its view of nature and reason unassisted by revelation. Hence its adherents call it natural religion, or natural theology. Deists are often called freethinkers, another name for infidelity. Its beginner was Lord Herbert of Cherbury (died 1648). Thomas Hobbes (died 1679) gave it a further push into more error, claiming that all religion is the product of fear and of reason reflecting on the universe. Charles Blount (died 1693) fused Herbert's and Hobbes' views. John Toland (died 1722) developed his Deism further, requiring that Revelation to be true must be deduced from reason, which made reason the source of faith. The Bible, rightly understood, certainly is in harmony with sanctified reason, but it, and not reason, is the sole source of faith. Anthony Collins (died 1729) and William Whiston (died 1752) developed their Deism into a theory that claimed that the Old and New Testaments were irreconcilably contradictory, and spent their efforts in seeking to point out such alleged contradictions. They and Thomas Woolston (died 1733) denied that the Old Testament contained prophecies, while the last sought to set aside the miracles of the New Testament. Matthew Tindal produced the standard textbook of Deism. He denied the fall and the curse and claimed that among all nations God revealed Himself, though giving more revelations to Jews and Christians than to heathen.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(29) While up to this time Deists usually held that the Law of Moses and the law of nature were identical, with Thomas Morgan (died 1743) they began to deny this. Peter Annet (died 1769) carried their infidelity further, denying Jesus' resurrection, claiming that Jesus had not died, but had merely swooned away and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">recovered from His alleged swoon, which recovery the disciples allegedly set forth as His resurrection. The spear thrust into Jesus' heart thoroughly disproves this swooning theory. He also roundly denied the actuality of miracles. By the time of antitypical Menahem (1731-1742) Deism had shot its full broadside of infidelism into the world. Thus it claimed that only the religion derived from a study of nature by reason could be true. This made it deny the Bible as an inspired Revelation, reject its prophecies, deride its miracles and reject the fall, and consequently the atonement, the virgin birth, ransom sacrifice, resurrection and glorification of Jesus. In a word, everything essential in Christianity Deism denied. The full impact of its attack came in the time of antitypical Menahem against the Truth and its spirit (king of Assyria came against the land). Against this attack the hierarchy and higher clergy of the Anglican Church, acting as antitypical Menahem, rallied their forces and especially by three works ably refuted the main positions of Deism. The first of these works was Bishop Walburton's two-volumed treatise entitled, The Divine Legation of Moses (1738), which overthrew Deists' anti-Mosaic and anti-Prophetic views. The second refutative work was really a series of writings by Dr. Waterland, the ablest English theologian of his day, who certainly decimated Deism; and the greatest work of all was Bishop Butler's Analogy (1736), which met Deists on their own ground of nature and literally pulverized their viewpoints. To this day, over 200 years later, Deism has attempted no reply to the Analogy. There were lesser penproducts sent forth to refute Deism; for the anti-Deistic literature is a vast one. The defeated Deists, like our Higher Critics, kept repeating their refuted arguments long after antitypical Menahem ceased to be the main movement in antitypical Israel; and the controversy dragged on until Paley brought it to an end, early in the 19th century, by a refutation that Deists have not attempted to answer.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(30) But while antitypical Menahem refuted Deism, it did not do it so well, e.g., as antitypical Jotham refuted clericalism; for in two particulars it was somewhat lame against the Deists. In the first place, it defended some erroneous doctrines against the attacks of Deism, e.g., trinity, God-manship, eternal torment, damnation to eternal torment of the heathen, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> This particular feature of the controversy, however, is not typed in vs. 19, 20. The other lameness of antitypical Menahem in this controversy is, however, brought out in these verses: its too much stress on reason. For a hundred years before this controversy there had arisen in the Anglican Church an unhealthy view as to reason in its relation to the Bible as the sole source of faith, for it was held to be a subordinate source and rule of faith. And this view further depraved was one that Deists made the main principle of their system, /. e., that human reason is the sole source of religious belief. This, of course, fitted in with their nature religion—religion derived by reason alone from the study of nature. The Anglican errorists on reason in its relation to faith, of course, did not go so far into error on the subject as the Deists did. Whereas Deists made reason their sole source of faith, the Anglican errorists, particularly Bishop Walburton, made it an almost equal source of faith with the Bible; for these, somewhat as the Romanists make the Bible and tradition the source of faith, made the Bible the main source of faith and reason a subordinate source and rule of faith.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) The word, reason, is so ambiguous a term that it actually becomes what each one's views make him think things ought to be, and therefore it means a different thing to each person. It amounts to each one's understanding of things, backed by his rational or irrational intuitions. Hence things that some think reasonable others think unreasonable. Sanctified reason, the holy mind of God in His people, is not a source of faith; it is a vessel that contains the things of faith that the Scriptures as their sole source give; and it is</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">an interpretative rule of faith. Sanctified reason sees everything Scriptural as reasonable; for it is the understanding of Divine things that God from the Scriptures as their source gives His people. These things never contradict its understanding of things viewed from the standpoint of true rational intuitions, hence never contradict their sanctified reason. So-called Orthodoxy has accepted so many things contradictory of sanctified reason, and contradictory of the reason, one's understanding of things in the light of rational intuitions, of the natural man, that such views are justly counted unreasonable, both to sanctified reason and to the dimly enlightened reason of the natural man, who additionally thinks some Divine truths to be unreasonable to him. The unhealthy view that many Anglicans accepted on reason's being a subordinate source and rule of faith made them concede entirely too much to Deists' claim as to reason's being the sole source and rule of faith. This dangerous concession of these Anglican apologists is what is typed by Menahem giving Pul 1,000 talents of silver, conceding as human truth (1,000, being a multiple of 10, types things belonging to a nature lower than the Divine nature) a part of the claims of Deists on reason being the sole source and rule of faith (a thousand talents of silver, 19;). This evil concession was made in order that antitypical Menahem might get that much of Deism's support as was necessary for antitypical Menahem to keep its power as a dominating movement in antitypical Israel (hand . . . confirm the kingdom in his hand).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) Antitypical Menahem exacted these concessions as teachings of God's people (money of Israel) from the Anglican controversialists, especially from the ablest from among them (mighty men of wealth [teachings being the wealth of teachers], 20;). The concessions of each controversialist were not complete; they were merely partial, which is indicated by the 50 in the shekels. Had the shekels been 100 (10 X 10), the concessions would have been all-out; but as they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">were 50 (5X10) they were only partial (fifty shekels of silver). But as such they were yielded to Deism (give to the king of Assyria). Bishop Walburton was the main sinner in this respect, though as a whole his work, The Divine Legation of Moses, ably refuted the main objections of the Deists against the Mosaic Law and prophecy as being against nature. In reading Bishop Butler's Analogy one can see that he, too, yielded too much to human reason in its office as a student of nature; for he used reason in studying nature as being a quasi-sourcel prover of faith, whereas he should have used it only as offering corroborations to things of faith. It is very unwise, yea, wrong in a Truth controversialist to yield more to an adversary than the principles involved require. Deism would have been more soundly beaten had these concessions not have been made. As it was, they left the field of battle (turned back) feeling that they had gained a partial victory, though suffering a greater defeat. And they left off the controversy with antitypical Menahem, leaving the field in its hands (stayed not. . . land). English church historians especially, though others cooperated therein, have given the record of antitypical Menahem's acts, especially as to its controversies with Latitudinarians and Deists, and have given many of them not typed in the Bible record of Menahem's acts (acts . . . book . . . kings of Israel, 21;). In the year 1742 antitypical Menahem ceased to be the most prominent movement of the less favored people of God (slept with his fathers, 22;), after following the evils of the Lutheran movement (evil, 18;); and a pleasure- and societyloving movement of the hierarchy and clergy of the Anglican Church, begotten by antitypical Menahem, succeeded it as the most prominent movement of the less favored people of God (Pekahiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[whom Jehovah exposes] </span><span class="font3">his son reigned in his stead).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(33) Already before and increasingly during the days of antitypical Menahem the Anglican hierarchy and clergy loved leisure, ease, fashionable society, learned pursuits, pleasure and worldly occupations and diversions. Of the clergy Archdeacon Blackbourne, the Latitudinarian leader, in a letter to the archbishop of Canterbury said that they were &quot;courtiers, politicians, lawyers, merchants, usurers, civil magistrates, sportsmen, stewards of country squires, tools of men in power.&quot; &quot;Nonresidence and disregard of the claims of duty prevailed among the bishops and lower clergy. Watson, Bishop of Llandaff (Wales), lived in the Lake district, and visited Wales once in three years. Hoadly, Bishop of Bangor, never visited his diocese during his six years' occupation of it; Warburton at Gloucester complained of the inconvenience of that public starion as hindering his studies; while Seeker at Oxford looked upon his summer visit at Cuddesdon as giving him a delightful retirement for his favorite studies. In the view of statesmen some bishoprics were preferments suitable for men of ability and learning, some mere places of ease, suitable for men of family and fashion.&quot; The hierarchy and the clergy were pleasure- and society-mad. Hilarious gatherings, social calls and musicals attracted them. Parties were in great favor with them; masquerades were an attraction to them. Some of them loved to follow the hounds in fox hunting; and afternoon teas in wealthy houses were dear to them. They were a pleasure- and money-loving set in very many cases. So much was this mode of life their pursuit that their spirit became characteristic of the most prominent movement among God's less favored people—antitypical Pekahiah, whose reign was from 1742 to 1744, typical Pekahiah reigning from 779 to 777 B.C. (fiftieth year of Azariah. . . reigned. . . Samaria, and reigned two years, 23;). This movement naturally grew out of antitypical Menahem (son of Menahem) and exercised the place of chief prominence in executorship in antitypical Israel (over Israel in Samaria). In addition to committing the abovementioned evils, antitypical Pekahiah (evil. . . Lord, 24;) was guilty of the sins of sectarianism</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and clericalism, which were introduced by the first Lutheran movement, and which became the evils of all the movements of the less favored people of God (Jeroboam . . . made Israel to sin).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) Calvinistic Methodism, under the lead of George Whitefield, was a party in the Anglican Church (Pekah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[exposer] ... </span><span class="font3">a captain of his, 25;). It was a party that practiced rigid self-denial and world-denial and naturally was much offended by and opposed to the selfishness and worldliness of the Anglican hierarchy and clergy acting in antitypical Pekahiah, and consequently agitated much against them (conspired against him) and publicly and privately witnessed against antitypical Pekahiah, exposing the selfish and worldly lives of its leaders and their executorship neglect of the salvation of Britishers in general and of their church members in particular (smote him in Samaria). Particularly did Calvinistic Methodism excoriate the special evils, those set forth above, of their selfish and worldly lives (palace . . . house). In this attack Calvinistic Methodism singled out the earthly minded members of the hierarchy (Argob, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cloddy)</span><span class="font3"> and the most powerful of the higher clergy (Arieh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lion)</span><span class="font3"> for the special targets of their sharp shafts; and so thoroughly did they do this work that they put an end to antitypical Pekahiah as the most prominent movement among those of God's less favored people (killed him). Calvinistic Methodism was in these attacks supported by tentatively-justified members of the Anglican Church who occupied a rough and hard position on the subject, e.g., many of the outspoken nobility, parliamentarians, judges (fifty. . . Gileadites </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[rough, hard,</span><span class="font3"> 50 = 10 X 5, hence not vitalizedly, but tentatively justified ones. If 100 = 10 X 10 had been the number, vitalizedly justified ones would have been meant]). This course met very general approval; for the selfishness and worldliness of antitypical Pekahiah was the greatest obstacle in Britain to godliness in high and low, as it was also indirectly responsible for the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">many evils that marred British society in all classes—high, middle and low. As a result of Calvinistic Methodism's pertinent course it became the most prominent movement of God's less favored people (reigned in his room). In the writings of church and secular historians of Britain and other countries are found accurate accounts of the abovedescribed and other acts of antitypical Pekahiah, which certainly were unpastoral (acts . . . chronicles . . . Israel, 26;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) As in describing antitypical Jotham's reign we devoted some space to a study of the life and work of John Wesley, its chief leader, so now in describing the reign of antitypical Pekah, which became the most prominent movement in antitypical Israel in 1744 (two and fiftieth year of Azariah, 27) and continued to be such until 1772, the parallel dates being 777-749 B.C. [P '40, 182 (6) ], we will devote some space to a study of the life and work of George Whitefield, the main leader of the Calvinistic Methodist movement. He was born in 1714 and died in 1770. He was a son of an inn-keeper, and in adolescence served drinks in the inn to customers to help his mother, who was widowed when he was but two years old. He studied at St. Mary de Crypt and later at Pembroke College, Oxford, where he fell in with John and Charles Wesley, joined the &quot;Holy Club,&quot; faithfully kept its rules, professed &quot;conversion&quot; in 1735, was ordained deacon in 1736, spent much time helping prisoners in Oxford, began to preach and became a pulpit orator of the highest order, probably as great a pulpit orator as ever lived. He preached throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Protestant Ireland and visited America on evangelistic work seven times and finally died during his seventh visit there. In 1738 he was ordained an Anglican priest. His pointed preaching occasioned many of the London church doors to close to him, though he was allowed to preach in some others. Like the Wesleys, he worked a while among the Moravians. In 1739, the church doors of Bristol being closed against him, he resorted</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">to preaching in the open air and soon induced John Wesley to do the same. This gave the Methodists opportunities to reach great multitudes that they never could have reached in churches. Thereupon he began his career as an itinerant evangelist, one of the greatest that ever lived. He sometimes addressed audiences of 80,000. His denouncing leading members of antitypical Pekahiah, calling them, among other things, &quot;blind guides,&quot; made the latter oppose him. His association with American Calvinists, particularly Jonathan Edwards, deepened the Calvinism that he had earlier espoused. Above we pointed out his controversy with Wesley on predestination, which led to a temporary alienation between them, but which was soon healed, and they remained friends for life, though their paths diverged, because of their leading different movements.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(36) Whitefield left the work of organizing his movement to others, especially to Lady (Countess) Huntingdon, his most devoted helper, and gave himself to preaching as his specialty, even preaching for two hours at Exeter, Mass., the day before his death, he being accustomed to preach every day, often three and four times daily. Like our pilgrims, he preached his sermons over and over again. His journals, sermons and letters have been published. His success was due to his dramatic delivery; for his published sermons are tame and do not rise above the commonplace. Lady Huntingdon sought through him to interest members of the nobility. On one occasion when he was addressing some of them, his description of the lost sinner as being like one blindfolded and walking toward, and falling over a precipice was so realistic that Lord Chesterfield, of politeness' fame, cried out, in great excitement, &quot;Why! he has fallen over the precipice!&quot; Benjamin Franklin describes the effect of one of his appeals for a charitable fund as moving him from a determination to give only a penny to successive determinations to give ever-increasing amounts, until finally he emptied his entire purse into the collection basket!</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Whitefield and Wesley undoubtedly excel all other non-apostolic evangelists, not even excepting Moody. Like the Wesleyan Methodists, the Calvinistic Methodists built chapels, founded schools and even instituted a theological seminary at Trevecca, Wales. The movement failed to achieve the same degree of fruitage as the Wesleyan movement, and that largely because the former did not preach Biblical doctrines as much as the latter, nor did it seek to indoctrinate its adherents as much as did the latter. Most contemporaries placed Whitefield above Wesley, because of his greater oratorical abilities. Wesley's greater scholarly and organizing ability, his greater pastoral character and his star-membership made his movement a far better one than Whitefield's. However, under the antitypical Ahaz phase of the Wesleyan movement matters were almost as bad in it as in antitypical Pekah. Doubtless Countess Huntingdon's great influence in antitypical Pekah imparted to it an aristocratic savor that did not give it the popular appeal that the Wesleyan movement exerted.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) Note the difference in the expressions characterizing antitypical Ahaz, which, though a Wesleyan movement, was much degenerated from antitypical Jotham the Wesleyan movement at its best, and antitypical Pekah: &quot;did not that which was right&quot; (; 28: 1) and &quot;did that which was evil&quot; (15: 28). Even evil antitypical Ahaz was not so bad as antitypical Pekah ! Some of the latter's evils will come out when its controversies with antitypical Ahaz are described. It was certainly a more contentious movement than the former, having all its faults and lacking some of its virtues. It was a very sectarian movement, seen in its strict Calvinism and in its taking away temporarily from antitypical Ahaz many of its followers. It, too, was a decidedly clericalistic movement, since it stressed clericalistic powers decidedly more than did antitypical Ahaz. These two faults are typed by the Scripture statement made of all but one, antitypical Hoshea (17: 2;), of the movements of the less favored people of</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">God: &quot;He departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin&quot; (28;). Certainly, the first Lutheran movement wrought much mischief in its establishing clericalism and sectarianism. Nor was God's punishment slack as to antitypical Pekah; for though Whitefield had wrought very much and effectively in the American colonies, having visited and evangelized all eight of them, as these were in his days organized, the preliminary acts of the American revolutionists, 1764-1772 (days of Pekah. . . Tiglath-pileser </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[mighty lion of the Tigris],</span><span class="font3"> 29;), took from antitypical Pekah in Britain almost all that Whitefield had accomplished for it during his seven evangelistic trips in America (and took). In his days the American colonies were from certain standpoints organized into eight groups: (1) New England, (2) New York and New Jersey, (3) Pennsylvania and Delaware, (4) Maryland, (5) Virginia, (6) North Carolina, (7) South Carolina and (8) Georgia (Ijon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[ruin],</span><span class="font3"> and Abel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[mourning]</span><span class="font3">-beth </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[house]-</span><span class="font3">maachah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[oppression],</span><span class="font3"> and Jenoah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[he</span><span class="font3"> rents'], and Kedesh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[holy],</span><span class="font3"> and Hazor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[court, village],</span><span class="font3"> and Gilead </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[rough, hard],</span><span class="font3"> and Galilee </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[circuit] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Naphtali </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[wrestling],</span><span class="font3"> From another standpoint there were, of course, 13 colonies. Henceforth the American revolutionists in their strength took over the fruitage and members of these colonies as theirs from antitypical Pekah, carried them captive to Assyria </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[step, going]).</span><span class="font3"> The British state-church, deliberately pursuing an anti-Calvinistic policy, worked against the Calvinistic Methodists as the most prominent movement of God's less favored people (Hoshea </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[deliverance] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Elah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[oak, strength]</span><span class="font3"> made a conspiracy, 30;); and in spite of this movement's having much riches of grace from God (Remaliah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wealth of Jehovah),</span><span class="font3"> attacked its Calvinism and refuted it (smote him and slew him) and took its place as the most prominent movement of the less favored people of God, in 1772 (17: 1; reigned in his stead). The acts of this movement are described in the writings of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">church historians, especially those written by Britons, Americans and Germans (acts of Pekah. . . written. . . chronicles . . . Israel, 31;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) We now return to antitypical Ahaz, whose acts as described in 16: 1-4; and; 28: 1-4 we have already studied. For its wickedness the Lord aroused the so-called Evangelical [Calvinistic] Party in the Church of England to attack it on the subject of election (Rezin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[firm] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Syria </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[highland] . . . delivered. . .</span><span class="font3"> mote him, 16: 5; 28: 5); and by this controversy these Anglicans won many Wesleyan Methodists back to the Anglican Church (carried. . . multitude of them captive . . . Damascus). Antitypical Reziris leading representatives (not all taking part in the controversy about to be described) were James Hervey, William Grimshaw, William Romaine, Henry Venn, John Newton, Thomas Scott, Richard Cecil, Joseph Milner, Isaac Milner, Samuel Walker, Thomas Adam, Thomas Robinson and William Richardson, men of great piety and zeal, and some of them of considerable learning. At that time antitypical Rezin attacked the Methodist Millennial doctrine [blessings for the then living only] and moved the Wesleyan Methodists, who for a while held it in the form just stated in brackets, to give it up, and a false nominal-church view of the Millennium as a reign of the Church before Christ's Return was by it given to this doctrine (drove the Jews from Elath, 6;), and this has been accepted since by the so-called Evangelical Anglicans (Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day). The main Anglican evangelical controversialists against the Wesleyan Methodists on predestination and the Millennium as a time of blessing the then living only, were Henry Venn, John Newton, Thomas Scott, Richard Cecil and Joseph Milner. Others, whose names will be omitted because of their bitterness, were very mde in their treatment of the Wesleyan Methodists in this controversy. But by far more bitter than antitypical Rezin in this controversy against antitypical Ahaz was</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">antitypical Pekah (delivered into . . . Israel, ; 5); but both of them sought to overthrow the former in its executiveness (came up to Jerusalem to war, 5;); and while they did it much injury, especially did antitypical Pekah so do (great slaughter, ; 5), they were unable to conquer it (could not overcome him, 5;). The chief controversialists of antitypical Pekah were Augustus Toplady, author of the hymn, Rock of Ages, John Berridge and the brothers, Sir Richard and Roland Hill; and the chief warriors of antitypical Aliaz were John Fletcher, Thomas Olivers and Walter Sellon. Wesley did very little writing in this controversy, being too busy with more important matters. The four above-named warriors of antitypical Pekah were most bitter in the abusive epithets that they, especially Toplady, hurled at Wesley, who in a truly Little Flock spirit bore it, without answering in kind, in a most sweet spirit, Toplady's spirit being far from that of our Lord, especially considering that he was only 30 years old, while Wesley was 70. The same sweet spirit marked the saintly John Fletcher's pertinent writings. But Thomas Olivers descended to almost the same depth of abuse as the four antitypical Pekahites. Sellon's part was in spirit midway between Wesley's and Fletcher's spirit and that of Olivers.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) The main questions at issue were those of elecri on and free grace. The Bible teaches both, election operative, pre-Millennially and free grace operative Millennially. The result of the controversy was that each side presented many Biblical arguments in its favor, and neither was able to refute the main arguments of the other. Antitypical Ahaz labored under the difficulty of having the facts of the Church's and the world's experience up to the present against it; for both the Bible and the Church's and the world's experience prove that up to the present election, and not free grace, has been operating savingly. Antitypical Ahaz, denying future probation, was in great difficulty in maintaining free grace as now operating savingly.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Antitypical Rezin and Pekah had the greatest difficulty with the passage that prove free grace—God's love for all, Christ's death for all and the Spirit's work for all for salvation. Both sides were thus greatly hampered in the controversy; but the predestinarians won many more proselytes from antitypical Ahaz than the latter won from the former. Involved in the main question at issue were questions like the following: What is the relation of good works to justification by faith? Are certain ones predestinated to eternal life? Are all others destined to eternal torment? Have all a chance to gain life? Is justification a result of sanctification, or does it precede it, or are the two identical? Is Christ's righteousness imputed or imparted to the believer, or both? Is it possible to attain a state of sinlessness in this life? Is grace irresistible and unloseable? Are there two justifications, one in this life by faith, and one by the evidence of works at Christ's judgment seat? Do we work for life or from life? Does the expression, a finished salvation, mean more than a finished redemption? Is the liberty of will compatible with Divine grace? Did Christ die for the elect only, or for the whole world? Is God's saving love limited to the elect, or does it extend to the whole world? Is the Spirit's work limited to the elect, or will it operate to the whole world? Other questions were also involved, which we will here pass by. From the viewpoint of the Divine plan we may say, in summarizing the controversy, that both sides had much of truth and much of error, but all in all antitypical Ahaz had more of truth and less of error than antitypical Rezin and Pekah, as we should expect of the movement of the more favored people of God. Neither side understanding future probation, the high calling as distinct from justification and the difference between tentative and vitalized justification, they could not conclusively refute each other, a stalemate resulting.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(40) However, because of the apostasy (forsaken the Lord,; 6) of antitypical Ahaz, it lost refutatively to the other side decidedly more, and brave, crownretainers and crown-losers than it gained from that side (Pekah slew . . . one hundred and twenty thousand [ 12,000, a Little Flock number, a multiple of 10 fitting the Great Company] ... all valiant men, ; 6). Toplady, the ablest but most vituperative warrior of antitypical Pekah (Zichri </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[memorable]),</span><span class="font3"> on certain lines of argument refuted John Fletcher, a very great favorite of antitypical Aliaz (Maaseiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[work of Jehovah]),</span><span class="font3"> Walter Sellon, one of antitypical Ahaz's leaders (Azrikam </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[help arises])</span><span class="font3"> and Thomas Olivers, one in very high place with antitypical Ahaz (Elkanah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[God is maker],</span><span class="font3"> ; 7). Antitypical Pekah won over to his side very many of the less informed adherents of antitypical Ahaz (captive. . . two hundred thousand women, sons and daughters, ; 8); additionally they took over from the other side not a few lines of thought, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., </span><span class="font3">they would not say that anyone is predestinated to eternal torment (much spoil. . . Samaria). But there were some teachers in the domain of antitypical Pekah who disapproved of the unbrotherly course of antitypical Pekah (Oded, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">setter up,</span><span class="font3"> ; 9). They appeared in the sphere of antitypical Pekah's executorship (Samaria) in public before the warriors as they were returning from the field of controversy (before the host), severely blaming them for the unbrotherly way the Divine wrath against antitypical Ahaz had permitted them to war with their brethren (Lord. . . wroth. . . your hand. . . lain). They pointed out that their rage was heaven-crying for vengeance (rage . . . heaven). Then they blamed them for their proselyting purpose whereby they sought to enslave their brethren (purpose . . . children . . . bondmen and bondwomen, ; 10), charging that there were sins in them against God (sins). Therefore they exhorted the warriors to return their winlings to their own brethren (deliver . . . brethren, ; 11), threatening them with special wrath from the Lord (wrath . . . upon you). Thereupon the leading brethren of antitypical Israel (heads of Ephraim,; 12), those of England (Azariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[help of Jehovah} . . .</span><span class="font3"> Johanan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah is gracious^),</span><span class="font3"> of Scotland (Berechiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[blessed of Jehovah} . . . </span><span class="font3">Meshillemoth </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[retributions]),</span><span class="font3"> of Wales (Jehizkiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah strengthens} . . .</span><span class="font3"> Shallum [ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">peaceable, requital])</span><span class="font3"> and of Ireland (Amasa </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[burden} . . .</span><span class="font3"> Hadlai </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[forbearing]),</span><span class="font3"> set themselves in opposition to the course of the warriors (stood up against. . . war), declaring that the warriors should not retain these pertinent captives (not bring . . . hither, ; 13), asserting that what they had already done was offensive to God (offended) and that what they further purposed would be adding to the sin of all Israel (add . . . trespass) and that Israel's sin was already great (sin. . . great), and was bringing special wrath upon Israel (wrath against Israel).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(41) This remonstrance led to the warriors' giving up their prey to the will of the protesters (left. . . spoil. . . congregation, ; 14). Thereupon certain Israelites were elected (expressed by name, ; 15) to see to the supplying of the needs of these winlings. They put upon them as garments the boohed truths (rose up . . . clothed. . . naked. . . hod), set truths before them as symbolic food (gave them to eat and drink), aroused them to exercise their good qualities (anointed them). Then, secondly, they supported the feeble among them with suitable helps (carried . . . asses) and led all of them back as crown-losers to their proper condition as such (Jericho . . . palm trees), to the antitypical Judahites (to their brethren). Those who had heated them in brotherliness then returned to the sphere of executorship of God's less favored people (returned to Samaria). In its extremity antitypical Ahaz betook itself for succor to the revolutionists in America and to those who favored them in the United Kingdom (messengers to . . . Assyria. . . help, 16). The protests of the American colonies against the tyrannies of George III, his ministers and parliament aroused much sympathy in Britain, and, among others, the Wesleyan Methodists favored their cause. Indeed, there were kindred thoughts and spirit among them (thy servant and thy son, 7); for antitypical Ahaz, standing for universal redemption and the freedom of man's will as against Calvinistic coercion of the human will in &quot;conversion,&quot; found itself in sympathy with the freedomadvocating Americans. Hence both mutually sought each other's support, especially was this the case with antitypical Ahaz (save me . . . hand . . . Syria . . . Israel, which rise up against me). Not only was antitypical Ahaz attacked by antitypical Rezin and Pekah, but the civil magistrates mistreated it at the instigation of the clergy and clergy-raised mobs and frightened weak ones into leaving the movement and into becoming captives of secularists (Edomites... mitten... captive, ; 17). Moreover, sectarians made inroads (Philistines also had invaded, ; 18) among their weaker members (low . . south), in America (Beth-shemesh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of the sun),</span><span class="font3"> in Ireland (Ajalon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Oakland),</span><span class="font3"> in England (Gederoth, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortress),</span><span class="font3"> in Scotland (Shocho, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hedging),</span><span class="font3"> in Wales (Timnah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">portion)</span><span class="font3"> and in the West Indies (Gimzo, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sycamore plantation).</span><span class="font3"> They also made inroads in the subordinate classes in these countries (village . . . village . . . village). Thus the Lord abased His more favored people (brought Judah low,; 19), because of antitypical Ahaz's sins; for it stripped the more favored people of God of their real adornment of graces (naked) and, sinning greatly against the Lord, alienated Him (transgressed sore). But the sum total of the efforts of the secular liberty-lovers was of no real help to antitypical Ahaz, rather it added to its distress (Tilgath-pilneser [a euphonic change in the spelling] . . . distressed him, but strengthened him not. . . helped him not, ; 20, 21).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) To gain the support of the secular liberty-lovers antitypical Ahaz gave up to them some of its Divine religious teachings (silver and gold . . . house of the Lord), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> the right of subjects to resist, and even to rebel against religious (hierarchical) tyranny, some of its civil teachings (in the treasures of the King's house . . . portion), e.g., the right of subjects to resist and rebel against civil tyranny, and some of its aristocrats' teachings (of the princes), e.g., &quot;all men created equal,&quot; &quot;taxation without representation is tyranny,&quot; &quot;consent of the governed, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,&quot; </span><span class="font3">for their comforting and supporting (sent. . . Assyria, 8; 21). This induced the secular liberty-lovers to take its side (hearkened unto him, 9;) and they attacked the Anglican Church in its Evangelical Party for supporting the secular powers in their tyranny (went up against Damascus) and captured its theories on subjects' obeying the civil powers in all things and being subject to aristocratic powers (took it) and changed the opinions of their supporters into accepting their own (captive to Kir [cz/y]) and refuted antitypical Rezin's pertinent views (slew Rezin). Above we showed how these liberty-lovers took away from Britain the American colonies in eight divisions as to giving them their, as against Britain's theory on liberty. Antitypical Ahaz gave his attention to the executorship of antitypical Rezin (went to Damascus, 10;), in order to fellowship with the British and American liberty-lovers (meet. . . Assyria), and, considering the Anglican Church as an organization, as set forth by antitypical Rezin in its executorship (saw an altar. . . Damascus), commended it to the leading consecrated ones in its movement (sent Urijah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[light of Jehovah])</span><span class="font3"> as a model for the Wesleyan Church as an organization (fashion. . . pattern) in its various details (workmanship). These leading consecrated ones, including both Wesleys and John Fletcher, began from then on to develop the Methodist Church as an organization according to the theory of the Anglican Church as an organization. This development was one that took years to complete; in fact it was not completed until after the Ahaz phase ceased to be the most prominent one in antitypical Judah; yet, as it is usual in prophecy and prophetic</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">types to fix as to time the forecast events at their beginnings, since it was begun and developed in part during the Ahaz phase, it is set forth as made during it (Urijah . . . built an altar according . . . Ahaz . . . Damascus, 11;), and that by the time antitypical Ahaz ceased giving special attention to the matters of antitypical Rezin's executorship (Ahaz came from Damascus), and attended to matters at home.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(43) After ceasing such attention antitypical Ahaz made a careful study of the thus developing Methodist Church as an organization (saw the altar, 12;) , and made its sacrifice in the interests of, and according to that Church (approached. . . offered). Thus in its critical situation it added to its past sins by starting to build a sect as the true Church, after the model of the Anglican Church, as set forth by its Evangelical Party (distress did he trespass, ; 22). Its pertinent ministries were a sacrifice in the interests of sectarianism and clericalism (sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, ; 23), despite their having hitherto attacked it (smote him), it thinking that, as the various parties of the Anglican Church had gotten help from sectarianism and clericalism (gods . . . Syria help them), by thus serving them they would help it, too, (help me). Instead of these helping it, they brought ruin upon what once had been a priestly movement (ruin of him . . . Israel). It presumed to give in sacrifice to this developing sect ministries that it had formerly given the Church for God (burnt, 13;), sacrifices allegedly manifesting God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice (burnt offering), in the form of preaching, teaching and writing on the deep (meat offering) and surface things of the Word (drink offering), and all this as a counterfeit fulfilment of consecration vows made to the Lord (peace offerings, upon the altar). The next great evil that antitypical Ahaz did was to displace the true Church in the Methodist movement, brethren like the Wesleys, Fletcher and those of the same spirit, from its position as the true Church, as</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">viewed by the justified, in its capacity of comforting, strengthening, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> the sacrifices (brought also the brazen altar . . . Lord, 14;), from its place of prominence before God's house (forefront of the house), and gave it a position inferior to the sectarian Church that it was developing (north. . . altar). It charged the prominent consecrated ones (commanded Urijah, 15;) , thus taking the two Wesleys as parts of antitypical Samson into captivity after blinding them, to do their sacrificing, from the viewpoint of the justified, in the interest of the developing Methodist sect (upon the great altar [the counterfeit altar]), those sacrifices of Jesus in manifesting God's acceptance of it (morning burnt offering), those of the Church in the form of giving out the deep things (evening meat offering), the movement's sacrifices to God as manifesting that it was acceptable by Jesus' merit (king's burnt sacrifice), in the form of its giving out the deep things (his meat offering), and the same features, plus the giving out of surface things, in the common people's sacrifices (burnt offering . . . people . . . meat offering, and their drink offerings), and to make a public use of such sacrifices as manifesting God's acceptance and as made for the developing sect (sprinkle . . . burnt offering. . . blood of the sacrifice). It further charged that the true Church in its midst be used only for it to learn God's will (brazen altar ... me to enquire by). The leading consecrated ones did accordingly (thus did Urijah. . . Ahaz commanded, 16;), a bad example.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(44) Antitypical Ahaz added still another evil: it gathered the doctrinal, refutational, cleansing and ethical teachings that the Lord's people had and defiled every one of them by its false teaching of sinless perfection of the most advanced of the consecrated, calling this error Entire Sanctification. By this error it undermined overtly or covertly every doctrinal, refutational, cleansing and ethical teaching of the Word (vessels . . . God and cut in pieces the vessels . . . God, ; 24). This teaching and practice (1) in its estimation closed</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the entrance into the true Church to those who did not profess sinless perfection; and ( 2) it actually closed it to those who made such profession (shut up the doors . . . Lord); and at the same time it changed the societies of the Church of England, as the local groups of the Methodists were called, and made churches of them wherever its executiveship extended (altars . . . Jerusalem). This had the effect of making all these churches of God's more favored people sectarian churches (city. . . high places, ; 25), where the consecrated choice human powers were sacrificed to sectarianism and clericalism (bum incense unto other gods), which, of course, increased God's displeasure with antitypical Ahaz (anger the Lord God). These evils, set forth in; 24, are described typically in another way in 17, 18;. By its teaching of the sinless perfection of the sanctified it severed the connection between the doctrine of man's fall and the Bible (cut off the borders of the bases, 17) and thus overthrew the basic necessity of the Bible (removed the laver) and removed from the Old Testament as the basis the New Testament (took down the sea. . . brazen oxen) and left the New Testament standing on justification without a real basic necessity (put. . . tones), all of which grossly militated against the fall and the ransom and was very untrue (1 John 1: 8). And the proven doctrine of reckoned and actual justification as the antitypical rest (covert [place] for the sabbath, 18;) and the teaching that effected the entrance of the movements of God's more favored people into the antitypical court it gave up (turned. . . house), because of its fellowship with the secular liberty-lovers (king of Assyria). The acts of antitypical Ahaz are described in the histories of the movements of God's more and less favored people (acts . . . written in the book . . . kings of Judah and Israel, 19; 26). The movement finally ceased to be the most prominent of the more favored people of God (slept, 20; 27). It has been honored as such a movement (buried... in the city); but not as worthy of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the respect given to other more favored movements of God's people—by an effigy burial with the movements of God's less favored people (not into sepulchres . . . Israel, ; 27), because the movement was evil.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(45) We now come to the study of Israel's last king, Hoshea </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">( deliverance)</span><span class="font3"> son of Elah ( </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">oak),</span><span class="font3"> as the parallel of the last movement of God's less favored people. The parallel years were 749-739 B.C. and 1772-1782 A. D. For the proof of this please see P '40, 180 ( 6). The date of the end of antitypical Hoshea was April, 1782, as will be shown when we come to study the end of the last movement of God's less favored people. As we saw above, antitypical Pekah, the Calvinistic Methodist movement, was displaced as such by the combined British state-church movement, April, 1772, because of the latter's disapproval of the former's Calvinism and of its more or less approval of the Wesleyan Methodist movement by contrast in their controversy with each other. Antitypical Hoshea was the British state-church movement in its capacity of seeking to enforce absolutism, especially in the state, and particularly in relation to the 13 American Colonies, claiming that absolutism was a matter of Divine right; and it began its reign in 1772, in its requiring the Colonies to pay the tea tax, all other taxes being by it at that time remitted, at the insistence of the secular liberty-lovers (reign. . . Israel, 2 Kings 17: 1). It was an evil reign (did evil, 2). While sectarianism and clericalism were present, they were not so prominent in this movement as in the former movements of God's less favored people (not as the kings . . . before him). Its main sin was absolutism by alleged Divine right, especially in the king, George III; and this led to its tyrannizing over the secular liberty-lovers in the Colonies and in Britain. In Britain these liberty-lovers restrained somewhat the autocrats who sought to tax the Colonies without representation, a thing that secular liberty-lovers everywhere denounced as against the British constitution (against him came up Shalmaneser, 3).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Tea shipped to America was not by these liberty-lovers allowed to be landed in Boston, New York and Philadelphia; and in Charleston, S. C., it was purposely stored in musty cellars and was thus ruined, while in Boston the Boston Tea Party, disguised as Indians, cast overboardthe contents of 340 chests of tea.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(46) Thereupon antitypical Hoshea redoubled his efforts at oppression and was met by such determined resistance as forced on the War of Independence on the part of the Colonies against Britain; and Britain's concessions to liberty-lovers in Britain and America and its heavy expenditures were the price that it paid to the secular liberty-lovers to stall off matters' coming to a climax (became his servant... presents). The secular libertylovers in Britain and America as the War of Independence in America continued faulted the absolutist movement (found conspiracy in Hoshea, 4), because it sought to hire time-serving mercenary troops from other European nations, especially from the Hessians (sent. . . o </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[devoted to Chronos]</span><span class="font3"> ), to fight against the 13 Colonies. In view of such help, actual and anticipated, it made no further concessions to the secular liberty-lovers in Britain and America (no present. . . Assyria), but waged relentless war on them. Of course, these fought back, those in Britain by arguments and efforts to block antitypical Hoshea's plans and measures, and those in America by battles and campaigns. Success fluctuated from one side to the other, with these liberty-lovers restraining the oppressors more and more (Assyria shut him up . . . prison), until April, 1780, when the war turned more and more in favor of the secular liberty-lovers, both in Britain and America (Assyria ... all the land . . . besieged it, 17: 5; fourth year of the king Hezekiah . . . year . . . Israel, 18: 9), when the secular liberty-lovers began to press hard the autocratic movement in its executorship.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(47) This turn of affairs came about by the secular libertylovers in Britain, especially in parliament, waging a more vigorous and successful opposition to the autocratic movement, and by the liberty-lovers in America waging a vigorous and successful campaign against Cornwallis' army in South Carolina and North Carolina. And by 1781 they forced him to leave the Carolinas and to advance northward into Virginia, whence he planned to go to New York and join forces with the British there. But the Americans and their French allies under Washington's command besieged him at Yorktown, Va., and compelled him to surrender, Oct. 19, 1781. After the news of this defeat reached England and was digested by the English, the autocratic ministry of Lord North resigned, March 20, 1782, and was succeeded by a secular liberty-lovers' ministry, which forthwith set into operation measures calculated to bring about a treaty of peace. Thus by April, 1782 (sixth year of Hezekiah, 18: 10) the state-church autocratic movement received its death-blow (king . . . Samaria, 17: 6; they took it, 18: 10). This proved to be the end of movements of God's less favored people (carried Israel away into Assyria, 17: 6; unto Assyria, 18: 11). The less favored people of God were thus made captives of the secular liberty-lovers, who from 1782 to the present have required them to favor and work for liberty movements (Assyria). Henceforth the less favored people of God, especially in Britain, mentally dwelt, busied themselves, in such movements (placed them; put them).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(48) These liberty movements were of three kinds: (1) Political liberty movements (Halah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">strength,</span><span class="font3"> which liberated America, Southern Ireland, withdrew oppressions from dominions and colonies, established freedom of the press, especially to criticize the government, of assembly, of free speech and conscience, gave universal suffrage, including that of Romanists and Jews, with power to hold political office, stripped the crown's autocratic power unto its becoming a mere symbol of power, took away from the House of Lords the power to abrogate the decisions of the Commons, made the ministry subject, not to the king, but to</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Commons, gave the right of discussion of political subjects to all, granted equality of all before the courts, gave dominion status to colony after colony, softened the penalties of the law, e.g., no more imprisonment for debts, no more capital punishment, except for murder and treason, whereas before they hanged even chicken thieves, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc. </span><span class="font3">(2) Social freedom (Habor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[union],</span><span class="font3"> Gozan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[refuge}).</span><span class="font3"> Class distinctions were made much less rigid, and are becoming yearly more fluid, so that the masses mingle more and more with the classes in Britain. It is now possible for royalty and nobility to wed with commonality, which before 1782 was almost an impossibility. All social distinctions based on race, color and religion are more and more being abrogated. Slavery has been abolished throughout the empire, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc.</span><span class="font3"> (3) Economic liberty (cities of the Medes, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">midland.</span><span class="font3"> These liberties include for all the privilege of getting an education, wages sufficient to support self and family, living conditions suitable for comfort, working conditions free from extreme exactions, privilege of belonging to unions, cooperative bargaining and the right to strike. In our times this kind of liberty is bringing a mild socialism into vogue in Britain. Certainly, since 1782 these three kinds of liberty have been on the increase, and they prove that a degradation set in for the less favored people of God from religious to secular privileges.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(49) Thus from great religious privileges the less favored people of God have become captives serving these three forms of secular liberty instead of religious privileges as formerly, all of this resulting in their becoming very much secularized—worldly. This is because they did not live out the principles of God's Word (obeyed not. . . God, 18: 12), but violated the principles of justice, the law of the New Covenant, whose blessings with the obligation of justice were reckoned to them in justification, and the principles of the covenant of sacrifice and the Oath-bound Covenant, under which they were (sinned . . . God, 17: 7; transgressed his covenant, 18: 12). Jesus' charges they disregarded and disobeyed (Moses . . . commanded . . . hear them, nor do them). And they so acted despite God's delivering them from the present evil world and Satan's control as the god of this present evil world into the Kingdom of God's dear Son (Egypt. . . Pharaoh king of Egypt) <sup>and</sup> reverenced creeds, rulers, sectarianism, clericalism, movements, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (feared other gods). Instead of following the Divine principles of justice and love they conducted themselves after the examples of worldlings in the various forms of sin, error, selfishness and worldliness that they committed (walked. . . heathen, 17: 8), after God had enabled them to drive out of their hearts and minds such evils (whom the Lord cast out from before . . . Israel). They also conducted themselves in the ways of living that were pursued by the movements that the less favored people of God had made (of the kings . . . had made). When we consider the evils of the various Lutheran, Calvinistic, Anglican, Puritan Presbyterian movements and the five succeeding movements of God's less favored people, we will have to admit that they were guilty of following in the ways of these evil movements. They were guilty of secret sins, i.e., in hypocrisy they hid from others the evils that they in secrecy practiced, all of which God's all-seeing eye beheld (did secretly. . . against. . . God, 9). In every denomination they developed sects (high places . . . cities). They did this in turning Little Flock movements (tower of the watchmen) into denominationalism (to the fenced city). They developed creeds, e.g., the various Lutheran, Calvinistic, Anglican, Presbyterian Puritan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> creeds (set them up image, 10), formed unions of state and church with every great state (groves) and served under the energetic work of great sectarian leaders, especially crown-lost leaders (every green tree). In and for these sects they offered up their choice human powers in service (burnt incense . . . high places, 11), after the example of the evil characteristics</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">which God had purged out of their heads and hearts (heathen . . . carried away before them), and did so evilly as to arouse God's displeasure against them (wrought. . . provoke . . . anger).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(50) They gave themselves up to serve the idols of various forms of sin, error, self and the world (served idols, 12). In the Bible time and again God forbids such idolatry to His people (said. . . not do this thing). God sent teachers among them, testifying against these deeds, e.g., he sent to the Lutherans Hubmaier by writings and lectures, Bucer in his lectures, sermons, Spener in sermons and writings, and John Arndt in his book, True Christianity; He sent Michael Servetus in his Restitution of True Christianity and Gisbert Voet in his Exercise of Piety, to the Calvinists; Jeremiah Taylor to the Anglicans in his Holy Living and Holy Dying, and Robert Browne, George Fox and John Wesley in their preaching and writings to the Anglicans and Presbyterians. John Bunyan in Pilgrim's Progress, William Law in his Serious Call, George Whitefield in sermons and John Wesley in sermons and writings, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> testified against the evils of all of these denominations. Many others took part in such testifying (testified against Israel. . . prophets . . . seers, 13), exhorting the apostates in the less and more favored movements of God's people to reform and keep their covenant vows as to faith and practice (turn. . . evil ways, and keep . . . statutes) accordingly as God had given His Word to their predecessors by His mouthpieces (law . . . fathers . . . sent. . . prophets). Despite all of these they did not give heed, but became very willful, like their ancestors (not hear, but hardened . . . fathers, 14), who were unbelieving and consequently disobedient (not believed in. . . God). Thereby they cast off God's precepts (rejected his statutes, 15) and abandoned the reckoned covenant of justification by faith and its implications of righteous living, and the actual covenant of sacrifice and the actual Oath-bound Covenant (his covenant), made by</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Him with their predecessors (made with their fathers), and gave up the protesting antitypes (testimonies . . . against them). Instead they followed error, an empty and unprofitable thing (vanity), and as a result became empty and unprofitable (became vain) and imitated the teachings and practices of the neighboring worldlings (heathen. . . about them), concerning imitating whom God had warned them (charged. . . not do like them). They forsook all of God's teachings (left all the commandments, 16), generally speaking, instituting for themselves wicked practices (made them molten image), specifically speaking, even the two main evils of God's apostate less favored people, clericalism and sectarianism (two calves), entered a union of state and church, symbolic fornication (grove), and served all the evil qualities typed by the heathen personifications of the heavenly bodies, singly and as constellations, to which the heathen had given the names of their gods (host of heaven), especially power-grasping and lording, the symbolic sun (served Baal, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lord).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(51) Additionally they taught the God-blaspheming doctrine of eternal torment (caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire, 17,—an allusion to Moloch worship), taught false prophecies (used divination) and deceitful doctrines, especially in the form of ununderstandable doctrines, like trinity, absolute predestination, the real presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, the omnipresence of Christ's humanity, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc. </span><span class="font3">(enchantments), and gave themselves unto spiritual slavery as the wages of indulgence in sin (sold themselves to do evil), and that in matters pertinent to the Lord (sight of the Lord), which, of course, resulted in displeasing Him (provoke him to anger). As a result God became highly displeased with His less favored people (very angry with Israel, 18) and cast them off entirely from being His less favored people (removed. . . sight), with the result that He had no other favored people than His most favored people alone (none left. . . Judaffairly). Moreover, His more favored people (Judah, 19) were not true to God's teachings (kept not the commandments. . . God), but at times followed the example of His less favored people in clericalism and sectarianism, which the latter had arranged for themselves (which they made). Hence God rejected the whole of God's less favored people (rejected all. . . Israel, 20), sent from time to time various punishments upon them (afflicted them) and allowed them to fall into the power of plundering nations (delivered. . . spoilers), which, not resulting in their reformation, came to a climax in His casting them entirely from His favor (cast them out of His sight). His wrath against antitypical Israel was a gradually rising one in which much forbearance was exercised. It began at the time that the less favored people of God were by Him broken away in revolution from the more favored people of God in the Zwinglian movement (sent Israel from. . . David, 21) and at the time when they made the Lutheran movement the less favored movement of God's people (made Jeroboam . . . king), which movement drove the less favored people of God into apostacy from the Lord (Jeroboam drave . . . Lord) and made them sin greatly, especially in clericalism and sectarianism (sin a great sin), since they conducted themselves as the Lutheran movement directed, not only in clericalism and sectarianism, but also in creedism, unbrethrenliness, unjustified disfellowshipment, secularism, persecution of dissenters, union of state and church, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (walked. . . sins of Jeroboam, 22); neither did they give these up (departed not from them). So strongly and long did they adhere to these evils that finally God cast them off entirely from His favor (removed. . . sight, 23), even as He had threatened by all His messengers to them (said . . . prophets). Thus were the less favored people of God taken out of the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit into the teachings and sphere of secular liberty (carried. . . land to Assyria), where they remain until now and will continue until this Age ends (unto this day). These effects were wrought out in all European Protestant countries, additionally to Britain.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(52) The secular liberty-lovers aroused adherents of five movements to make the hearts and minds of God's less favored people, which hearts and minds were once the sphere of a measure of the Truth and its Spirit in their various denominations, their sphere of teaching and spirit (king of Assyria . . . placed them . . . Samaria, 24). And the adherents of these movements in their teachings and spirit filled such hearts and minds, formerly the sphere where new creatures were, moved and had their being (instead . . . Israel), and made such hearts and minds the sphere of their teachings and spirit (possessed Samaria). The adherents of these five movements that filled such minds and hearts were those of: (1) the Combinationist movement (Babylon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mixture, confusion),</span><span class="font3"> (2) the Contradictionism movement (Cuthah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hiding place),</span><span class="font3"> (3) the Reformism movement (Ava, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ruin),</span><span class="font3"> (4) the Infidelistic movement (Hamath, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortress)</span><span class="font3"> and (5) the No-ransomism movement (Sepharvaim, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">borderers). </span><span class="font3">These occupied the various denominations of God's less favored people in all European Protestant countries (dwelt in the cities thereof). These movements' adherents, as one after another was set into activity, in the beginning of each (at the beginning, 25), several years intervening after one started before the next started, had no reverence for Jehovah (feared not the Lord). As punishment God opened the way for Romanism and Anglo-Catholicism in Britain and Romanism and elsewhere a revived Lutheran and Calvinistic orthodoxism which continued (sent lions) to make inroads upon them (among them); and these refuted them as such and won some of them over to their views (slew some of them). These adherents by their attitudes apprized the secular liberty-lovers (spake . . . Assyria, 26) of the fact that they who were put by them into the sphere of a measure of the Truth and its Spirit (removed . . . cities of Samaria) were without a proper knowledge</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of the way that Jehovah was to be served (know not. . God of the land), which resulted in God's loosing Romanism and Anglo-Catholicism upon them (sent lions among them), to the continued overthrow of some of them (slay them). All this, their conduct showed, was due to their not knowing how they were to serve Jehovah (know not. . . God). The secular liberty-lovers by their attitude opened the way for prominent Protestant sectarians (Assyria. . . thither one of the priests, 27) made captives by the secular liberty-lovers (brought from thence) to help these adherents, requiring by their attitude that the adherents of the five movements continue where they had been transplanted (dwell there) and receive Protestant sectarian teachings from the prominent Protestant sectarians as to how they should serve Jehovah (God of the land).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(53) These teachers certainly occupied themselves with Protestant sectarianism, as against Romanism and Anglo-Catholicism and revived Lutheran and Calvinistic orthodoxism (dwelt in Bethel—as the counterfeit </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">House of God, i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> sectarianism, 28), as the literature of the times shows; for they republished the main English and continental Reformation attacks on Rome, e.g., the Parker Society republished the controversial writings of Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer, Jewel, Parker, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> Others republished Foxe's Acts and Monuments of the Martyrs, Chilling worth's Religion of the Protestants, Barro we's The Pope's Supremacy, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., etc., etc.</span><span class="font3"> Moreover, many new antiRomanist and anti-Anglo-Catholic and pro-Protestant works of great ability were published by these Protestant sectarians. Public debates were held between them and Romanists, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> that held at Hammersmith, England, between John Cummings, D. D. (Protestant) and Daniel French, Esq., Barrister-At-Law (Romanist) (taught them . . . fear the Lord). In Continental Europe similar pertinent literature was republished and pertinent new literature was published. The five movements typed in v. 24 were reduplications of the five Gospel-Age forms of No-ransomism,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Infidelism, Combinationism, Reformism and Contradictionism, and not the five forms of the two Harvests' sifting movements, e.g., their No-ransomism was not a verbal, but a logical denial of the ransom; for in their teaching human immortality, eternal torment and the trinity they logically, not verbally, contradicted the ransom, even as the No-ransomers of the Smyrna period did. And so with the others; for the Infidelism of that time consisted in displacing God's plan by the plans of the creedists and others; their Combinationism consisted in a union of state and church; their Reformism consisted in an effort to rid their sects of certain evils in state, church, aristocracy, labor and society, and construct in their stead a reformation in these spheres of action; and their Contradictionism consisted in their fighting unfolded reformation truths. Their contradictions were their creedal disagreements with the stewardship truths of other Protestant bodies, they making creeds their creed-gods (every nation [the five of v. 24] made gods of their own, 29) and establishing them in the bodies or groups of their own sects (put them in. . . high places) which these five movements constructed (Samaritans had made) in each denomination; for there have been the following Protestant denominations in Britain since 1782: Anglican, Presbyterian, Congregational, Baptist, Quaker and Methodist Churches, besides numerous sectlets and religious movements and on the Continent the Lutheran, Calvinistic, Unitarian denominations and many sects (cities . . . dwelt).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(54) It is from names of the gods set forth in vs. 30 and 31 that we were able to see the antitypes of the peoples of the five parties that according to v. 24 were settled in the territory of the ten-tribed kingdom. It will be noted that neither in v. 24 nor in vs. 30, 31 are the five movements given in the order of the parallel movements of the Harvests and the Interim. The Combinationists made the union of state and church their creed-god (Babylon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[mixture, confusion,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to their combining things that should have</span></p></li></ul>

The No-ransomers (Sepharvaim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[borderers,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to their standing just outside the borders of Christianity]) constructed their ransom-denying theories of human immortality and eternal torment into their creed-gods, which were a logical not verbal denial of the ransom (Adrammelech </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[king's majesty,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the Noransomers' king doctrine of human immortality, which they considered a very honorable teaching], Anammelech </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[woe's king,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to their No-ransomer king doctrine of eternal torment] ).

<p><span class="font3">(55) Thus these practiced a form of reverence for God (feared the Lord, 32). They also appointed in their sects as their clergy those who were, generally speaking, timeservers, popularity-lovers, ease-lovers, money-lovers, power-lovers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> and thus the lowest of themselves (made . . . lowest. . . priests of the high places). These ministered on their behalf in the offices of their sects (sacrificed. . . high places). They were a double-minded set, showing on the one hand a kind of reverence for God yet exercising a ministry on behalf of their creed-gods (feared . . . served, 33). This service was performed in the same way as the depravity that had reigned in the natural hearts, and that had been driven out by the new creatures of God's people (manner . . . whom . . . from thence). Even to the present time these apostates live as they lived before they became justified, and especially before they became new creatures (do after the former manners, 34): They neither really reverence God (fear not the Lord), nor do they five as their predecessors did as sectarians as to precepts and arrangements from 1521 to 1782 (after their statutes . . . ordinances), nor do they live according to the Oath-bound Covenant (the law), nor the covenant of sacrifice (commandment) that God gave to those who were produced by the star-members and their special helpers (commanded the children of Jacob </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[supplanter\),</span><span class="font3"> whose two final Parousia representatives God turned into the special warriors of God (named Israel—in allusion to these two being made special warriors for God). With these consecrated ones individually God had made a covenant, the Oath-bound Covenant (made a covenant, 35), with the implications of the covenant of sacrifice as binding them not to reverence the gods of sin, error, selfishness and worldliness in their various forms (fear other gods), nor to honor them (nor bow yourselves to them), nor to yield themselves up to further them (nor serve them), nor to yield up their human all in their interests (nor sacrifice to them). But they should give Him supreme duty and disinterested love (him shall ye fear, 36) and further His interests (him shall ye worship) and yield up in service to Him their human all (to him . . . sacrifice). This is fitting because He had delivered them from the present evil world of Satan's empire into the Kingdom of God's dear Son (brought you . . Egypt), through justification and consecration, which God had operated toward them by the great power of His Word (great power) and the efficient ministry of Jesus (stretched out arm).</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">(56) God had set forth for these very clearly (he wrote for you, 37) precepts (statutes), arrangements (ordinances), the Oath-bound Covenant (the law), with its implication, the covenant of sacrifice (the commandment). These He charged His consecrated people carefully to heed in practice always (observe to do for evermore) and prohibited them to give supreme duty and disinterested love to the various gods of sin, error, selfishness and worldliness in any of their forms (not fear other gods). God emphasized these thoughts, particularizing that they forget not the Oathbound Covenant, which, given by God to them, implies that they had made the covenant of sacrifice (covenant. . . made . . . not forget, 38); and He stressed by repetition their not giving supreme duty and disinterested love to the gods of sin, error, selfishness and worldliness, in any or all their forms (fear other gods). He charged them to give supreme duty and disinterested love to God, the self-existent One of perfect wisdom, power, justice and love (God ye shall fear, 39), which if they would do, He would give them victory over every power of every form of sin, error, selfishness and worldliness, as these would be manipulated against them by the devil, the world and the flesh (deliver . . . hand . . . enemies). But the unfaithful less favored people of God would not obey the Lord as He thus charged them (not hearken, 40), but lived after the depravities according to which they lived before their justification, consecration and Spirit-begettal (did after their former manner). Hence the tribes of God's less favored people (these nations, 41) continued to five double-mindedly, giving God some reverence and yielding service to No-ransomism, Infidelism, Combinationism, Reformism and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Contradictionism (served their graven image), in all the successions of those whom they produced in their apostate condition (children. . . children). In this they have been close imitators of those who produced and developed them (as did their fathers, so do they), and this has continued up to this time and will continue unto the end of the extreme limit of this Age (this day).</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font3">CHAPTER VIII</span></h4>
<h4><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark84"></a>LAST PARALLELS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1">HEZEKIAH. MANASSEH. AMON. JOSIAH. JEHOAHAZ. JEHOIAKIM. JEHOIACHIN, ZEDEKIAH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FROM NOW on our study of the Large Parallels will be restricted to those of Judah's kings, since we have with Hoshea, Israel's last king, completed our study of those of the latter's kings. Still we will continue to use the same wording for the subject of our study in Kings and Chronicles, for the sake of indicating the relationship of our pertinent coming studies with those of the past thereon. It was after Hezekiah had reigned six years, Hoshea ceasing then to reign, that the Large Parallel becomes restricted to the kings of Judah. With these preliminary remarks we begin our study of the Hezekiah parallels. Hezekiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Strength of Jehovah)</span><span class="font3"> types the Bible recension, printing and distributing movement. The parallel periods were 745716 B.C. and 1776-1805 A.D. See 274-277 above. This movement had its faint beginning in the publication of J. J. Wetstein's recension of the Greek New Testament, which appeared in 1751, just 25 years before the movement became in 1776, through the completion of J. J. Griesbach's epochal recension of the Greek New Testament, the chief movement among God's more favored people; and it came to the end of being such a movement in 1805, when J.J. Griesbach, whose text is that of our Diaglott, finished his work on the last edition of his recension of the Greek New Testament, and had it thus ready for the press, whence it appeared in 1806 (began. . . five and twenty. . . reigned nine and twenty, 2 K. 18: 1, 2; 2 C. 29: 1). It was also in the period of these 29 years that the first Bible Societies came into existence, the first of these was that which arose among the Methodists in 1778, though there had been Bibles published previously by several societies</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">which, however, were not mainly devoted to printing and distributing the Bible. The greatest of the Bible societies, the British and Foreign Bible Society, was founded March 7, 1804, a little over a year before antitypical Hezekiah ceased to reign (April, 1805). As we have shown in E 3, 28 (2 6)-33 (30), the main impulse in the formation of this society came as a result of a Methodist damsel's, Mary Jones', 50-mile journey for a Bible, and of a Methodist minister's, Pastor Charles', fervent advocacy of a Bible society; but it was an undenominational society, joined in by members of all Protestant denominations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) Hence this Bible society and almost all others have been non-sectarian, mothered by the Bible itself, as coming from the Heavenly Father (mother's name was Abi </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[my father] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Abijah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah is my father],</span><span class="font3"> 2; 1 [in allusion to God as the Author, symbolic Father, of the Bible]); and, of course, the Bible, above all other things, serves to remind people of God (daughter of Zechariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[reminder of Jehovah]).</span><span class="font3"> The Bible recension, publication and distribution movement, which has sought from its beginning to print and circulate cheap Bibles for the common people of Christendom and heathendom, did and still does a very good work; and it did very commendably before the Lord (right. . . Lord, 3; 2), in the same spirit and in the very words of the Apostles as recorded in the New Testament (according . . . David . . . done). Whereas during the preeminence of the apostate Methodist movement, antitypical Ahaz, those servants of God's house who led people into repentance and faith-justification were estopped from their work by antitypical Ahaz's evil doctrines and practices, immediately after antitypical Hezekiah came into preeminence as the movement of God's more favored people, it reversed that course by beginning to set at work such servants of God as opened the way of entrance into repentance and faith with faith-justification (first month opened the doors,; 3), by cleansing them of their errors of doctrine and practice and by giving them correct teachings and practices (repaired them). Move over, it attracted to itself the main and subordinate leaders of God's people (brought the priests and Levites, ; 4) and assembled them about the first principles of the Lord's house (together into the east street; literally, broad place to the east, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font3">, the first part of the temple enclosure, where even heathen could stand, typical of the condition of repentance). There it gave forth its message (said unto them ; 5). It exhorted them to separate themselves from sin, error, selfishness and worldliness (Hear. . . sanctify yourselves), as it also exhorted them to separate all God's people from these (sanctify the house of the Lord), and thereby to remove these unclean things out of the sanctuary (carry forth the filthiness . . . holy place).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) It pointed out the transgressions and sins of their predecessors (have trespassed. . . done evil, ; 6) in their relations to God (eyes of the Lord), by apostatizing from Him (forsaken him) and removing their favor from His people (turned . . . habitation) and disfavoring them (turned their backs). They also stopped the work of those who led people to faith-justification (shut up the doors of the porch, ; 7), quenched the enlightment of the teachers (put out the lamps), stopped offering to God their choice human powers amid fiery trials with accordant graces (not burned incense) and ceased offering the things that effected justification and sanctification as manifesting God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice (nor offered burnt offerings) in the antitypical Court (holy. . . God). This resulted in God's wrath coming upon His more favored people and the sphere of their executorship (wrath. . . Judah and Jerusalem, ; 8), expressed in their becoming distressed (trouble) and objects of disagreeable surprise (astonishment) and abhorrent disapproval (hissing), even as they witnessed (see). Their predecessors had been refuted in controversy (fathers . . . sword,; 9); their movements, powers and supporters</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">were proselyted into erroneous sects for this (sons . . . captivity). The movement then taught that it desired to renew its and their covenant with God (heart. . . covenant. . . God, ; 10), to the end that His wrath be removed from them (wrath. . . from us). Affectionately (My sons, ; 11) it exhorted them against negligence as to God's ways (negligent), since the main and subordinate leaders were God's choice to officiate as His representatives (chosen. . . before him), to advance His purpose (serve . . . minister) and to sacrifice their choice human powers amid fiery trials, resulting in the graces as their prayers ascending to, and pleasing God (burn incense).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(4) Thereby were aroused to their work recensionists of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures (Mahath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[grasping] . . . </span><span class="font3">Amasai </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[burdensome,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to their seizing hold of burdensome work], ; 12), translators of such Scriptures (Joel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah is God\ . . .

Antitypical Hebronites as historians in the widest sense of the word gave no service to the Bible recension, printing and circulating movement, hence are not typed in this connection. Besides the above there were aroused to pertinent activity the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">continually traveling preaching brethren (Asaph, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">he gathers')',</span><span class="font3"> those who traveled throughout all Britain, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc. </span><span class="font3">(Zechariah) and those limited to circuits, i.e., circuit riders (Mattaniah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gift of Jehovah)',</span><span class="font3"> the occasionally traveling preacher brethren (Heman, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">trustful,</span><span class="font3"> ; 14), consisting of those who traveled occasionally all over Britain, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc. </span><span class="font3">(Jehiel) and those who traveled occasionally in a circuit (Shimei,/amoMy); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font3"> local preachers (Jeduthun, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">praising), </span><span class="font3">consisting of those who preached Sundays in their local churches (Shemaiah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fame of Jehovah)</span><span class="font3"> and in neighboring churches (Uzziel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">power of God),</span><span class="font3"> all good works for God.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) These brethren gathered together all of those who consisted of their kinds of colaborers (gathered their brethren, ; 15) and separated themselves from sin, error, selfishness and worldliness (sanctified [literally, caused themselves to separate] themselves), and in harmony with the movement's charge (commandment of the king) by God's principles (words of the Lord) gave themselves to put aside all uncleanness from God's people (came . . . cleanse the house). The main teachers (priests, ; 16) ministered to cleanse the consecrated and the things that pertained to them in the antitypical Holy as to the main leaders (inner part... to cleanse it) and cast out unclean teachings, wrong readings in the received texts of the Hebrew and Greek Testaments and wrong translations and unclean practices therefrom (brought. . . uncleanness . . . temple) and ended the beginnings of their cleansing work as to the antitypical Holy, when they reached pertinent justification matters and persons (into the court). Such latter matters and persons the subordinate leaders cleansed (Levites took . . . abroad) and put them where they belonged, in the domain of evil away from God's people (into the brook Kidron </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[turbid, i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, typical of the condition of the curse]). This reformatory work began immediately on antitypical Hezekiah's becoming the most prominent movement of God's more favored people. It at once grappled with the first feature</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of the evil (first day of the first month, ; 17) and in a week's time had grappled with the last feature of the evil, as matters of the Holy in the main leaders and other new creatures (eighth day... came... porch). This will become clear, if we remember that the beginnings, not the endings of the various features typed are usually meant in the antitype; for certainly the many errors of doctrine, wrong readings in the Hebrew and Greek and wrong translations and errors of practice introduced by antitypical Aliaz and others were not removed in eight days; but within eight days every feature of them was begun to be set aside (sanctified the house . . . eight days). Thereafter the subordinate leaders began to set aside the errors of doctrine, wrong readings, translations and practice pertinent to the condition of these subordinate leaders as the antitypical Court, /. e., pertinent to justification. Within eight days more (sixteenth day) the subordinate leaders had made a beginning of attacking every error of doctrine, reading, translation and practice among themselves. Here, again, the remark is in order, that they did not within eight days rid themselves of all these wrongs of doctrine, readings, translations and practice, but had by that time begun to cleanse every one of them (made an end).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) Then the main and subordinate leaders made a report of their activities to the movement as represented in God's more favored people (went. . . king, and said, ;18). Their report embraced the several items that they did. First of all, they reported that they had begun to cleanse all of God's people as His Temple (cleansed all the house); secondly, they reported the beginning of cleansing the whole Church in its capacity of comforting, encouraging, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> by God's Word the sacrificing and tried people of God as they appear to those in the antitypical Court (altar of burnt offering); thirdly, they reported the beginning of cleansing every one of the doctrinal, refutational, corrective, textual and ethical teachings pertinent to the Church as comforter, encourager, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> as it appears to the subordinate leaders in the Court (all the vessels thereof); fourthly, they reported the beginning of cleansing the Church in its capacity of holding up the bread of life to the brethren as main leaders, to strengthen them in every good word and work for their heavenly journey (shewbread table). Fifthly, they reported the beginning of cleansing all the doctrinal, refutative, correctional and ethical teachings pertinent to the antitypical Shewbread Table (vessels thereof). Sixthly, they made particular report that all of the Truth teachings that the apostate Methodist movement, antitypical Ahaz, had repudiated in its sinful course (all the vessels . . . cast away in his transgression,; 19) were prepared anew and fitted for the Lord's people (prepared and sanctified) and had been placed at the disposal of God's Church for its use of them for sacrificial purposes (before the altar).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) The Bible recension, printing and distributing movement in its members, on learning of the prosperity of the cleansing work, very promptly gathered the leaders (Hezekiah. . . early. . . rulers, ; 20), and together they betook themselves to God's people as His Temple (went. . . house). From v. 24, as well as from v. 21, we see that the seven goats were the sin offering, and since we see that from v. 24 it wrought atonement for the then people of God, it types teaching emphasis put upon Jesus' sin-offering sacrifice, which is further confirmed by the seven lambs, typical of Jesus as the Lamb of God, and typifying Him as such. Hence from v. 24 we infer that the seven bullocks were the burnt offering and the seven rams were the peace offering, the former typing God's manifesting His acceptance of Christ's sacrifice, e.g., by Jesus' ministering as Teacher, Justifier, Sanctifier and Deliverer in cooperation with the then serving brethren (seven bullocks) and the latter typing His fulfilling His vows while in the flesh and since coming into the Spirit. Of course, the priests' offering these sacrifices represents their serving as reminderers of Jesus' sacrifice, and not making a repetition of His sin-offering sacrifice (seven. . . goats, ; 21). These sacrifices prove that Jesus made atonement for the rulers (kingdom), God's people as His Temple (sanctuary) and God's more favored people (Judah). Antitypical Hezekiah in its members charged the main leaders to make the offering (commanded ... of Aaron to offer) in connection with God's people in their capacity as comforting, encouraging, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> the sorely tried sacrifices (the altar). These then stressed by their teachings God's acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice (killed the bullocks, ; 22), their faith laying hold of this acceptance (received the blood), and taught how it atoned for God's people as comforters, encouragers, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> of the sorely tried priesthood (sprinkled. . . altar). Their faith laying hold on Christ as His vows-Fulfiller (killed the rams), they showed how His fulfilling His vows atoned for the same antitypical Altar (sprinkled. . . altar). They did the same as to the antitypical Lamb, His blood and the Altar (killed also the lambs . . . altar). Then they set forth Jesus as the sin offering (brought. . . goats for the sin offering, ; 23), publicly before the movement as such and all God's people (king and the congregation). They also set forth the thought that Jesus was their substitute (laid their hands upon them). Thereupon they set forth the thought that Jesus died for the sins of God's people (killed them, ; 24) and makes atonement by His merit for God's people (reconciliation . . . altar), which made God pleased with His whole people (atonement for all Israel), even as the movement charged that atonement be made to man (burnt offering—which reconciles man to God) and to God (sin offering, which reconciles God to man).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) The Bible recension, printing and distributing movement arranged offices for the subordinate leaders throughout the Church (set the Levites in the house, ; 25), to minister, some with tracts (cymbals), some with books, especially with star-member books (psaltries) and some with Bibles (harps), which they expounded, even as the Apostles, their special helpers</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">as seers and general teachers, charged (commandment of David, and of Gad. . . Nathan the prophet), even as God also charged by the Old Testament writers (commandment. . . prophets). The subordinate leaders stood ready with the Apostolic teachings (Levites . . . instruments of David, ; 26); and the main leaders stood ready with discourses and lectures (priests with the trumpets). Then the movement charged that by the main leaders God's manifestation of His acceptance of Christ's offering be set forth as to Christ doing His teaching, justifying, sanctifying and delivering work for the Church (commanded. . . burnt offering upon the altar, ; 27). As soon as the main leaders began so to do, they also began to deliver suitable sermons and lectures, and the subordinate leaders began to serve with tracts, books and the Apostolic writings (began . song . . trumpets . . . instruments ordained by David). This moved the entire people of God to serve (all. . . worshipped, ; 28); all the time the pertinent sermons and lectures continued (singers . . . trumpeters . . . continued... finished). At the conclusion of these activities in each of its phases, the movement in all its members humbled themselves and served God (King . . . bowed . . worshipped, ; 29). It and the leaders charged the subordinate leaders to set forth God's attributes as praising Him in His teachings as given in the Apostolic words and in those of the star-members (commanded. . . praise . . . words of David and of Asaph the seer, ; 30). This they did, humbling themselves and serving the Lord (worshipped).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(9) The movement then invited the non-official brethren who had consecrated themselves to join in sacrificing for, and thanking, the Lord (said . . . consecrated . . . sacrifices and thank offerings, ; 31). This they did (brought. . . offerings); and the most zealous ministered in a way that manifested God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice, by cooperating under Jesus as He gave the blessings of instruction, justification, sanctification and deliverance; for it is by these acts that God</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">manifests His acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice (fiee heart burnt offerings). They brought Divine and human blessings (70 [7 x 10] bullocks, ; 32) in tentative justification (100 [10 x 10] rams) and vitalized justification (200 [2 x 10 x 10] lambs), all expressive of Jehovah's manifesting His acceptance of Christ's sacrifice (all... a burnt offering). Even unjustified people offered service in that they yielded up contributions (six hundred [6 x 10 x 10,—6 the number of imperfection and evil, combined with the thought that these gifts were by their unjustified givers intended for the tentatively-justifieds' blessing] oxen, ; 33) and their loved ones as (1) tentatively-justified, (2) vitalizedly-justified and (3) new creatures (three thousand [3x10x10x10 = 3,000,—the third 10 standing for crown-losing new creatures, because they formed the bulk of the new creatures] sheep). The main leaders alone, e.g., John and Charles Wesley and John Fletcher, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> were too few to set forth the people's sacrifices alone (too few. . . flay all the burnt offerings, ; 34). Hence the subordinate leaders helped them, until all the sacrifices were made (Levites did help . . . ended) and until others were developed into main leaders unto fitness for such main service </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(other</span><span class="font3"> priests had sanctified themselves); for the subordinate leaders were more hearty for this service than those of their number who later became main leaders (more upright. . . sanctity themselves than the [other] priests). Many indeed were the expressions of God's manifested acceptance of Christ's sacrifice, in the form of much Truth clarified, many persons justified, consecrated and given victory over the devil, the world and the flesh and over the fear of death and the grave (burnt offerings were in abundance, ; 35), as was the case of love coupled with consecration vows (fat of the peace offerings) and of preachings of the simpler truths (drink offerings) as to the various expressions of God's manifested acceptance of Christ's sacrifice (burnt offering). Yea, the entire movement in its participators rejoiced in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lord's favors, as well as all God's people (rejoiced. . . people, ; 36), on account of God's fitting His people for this matter (prepared the people), which was done quickly (done suddenly).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(10) 2 Chro. 30 treats of the great Passover of Hezekiah's day. The Passover in general represents the deliverance of God's people from Satan's rule on the basis of the antitypical Lamb's blood; its emphasis, therefore, is mainly on justification through faith in Christ's merit. Celebrated the 14-21 of Nisan, it represents mainly the salvation of the Gospel Age and its joys, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> particularly that of the Gospel Church, which is the antitype of the account in Ex. 12; but celebrated the 14-21 of the second month, it types mainly the salvation of the Millennial Age, particularly that of the world of mankind, which is the antitype of the account in Num. 9: 6-14. However, the great Passover of Hezekiah is an exception to this rule; for though celebrated the 14-21 of the second month, the facts prove it does not type the Millennial Passover, but a particular part of the Passover of the Gospel Age; for, according to the parallel, this antitypical Passover was begun to be celebrated about the beginning of May, 1776. By oral and literary messengers (sent. . . and wrote letters, ; 2 C. 30: 1) the movement invited God's less favored (Israel) and God's more favored people (Judah), particularly of God's less favored people those who lived in England (Ephraim) and in Scotland (Manasseh), asking them to come to the real people of God (house of the Lord), in the sphere of the executorship of God's more favored people (Jerusalem), to live out tentative and vitalized justification on the basis of the Lamb's shed and sprinkled blood, accepted by the justified and consecrated people of God, in honor of God (keep the passover. . . God of Israel); for the movement had in consultation with the leaders and leadings of God's people (counsel . . . congregation, ;2), as a matter of executorship (Jerusalem), exhorted to work on justification and consecration (keep</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the passover) at the earliest moment proper for them (second month), since the cleansing of God's Church; from error and wrong had to precede that particular antitypical Passover (could not keep . . . priests . . . sufficiently, ; 3), and since the leadings had not yet entered into the Bible recension, printing and circulating movement sufficiently to come under its executorship for that antitypical Passover celebration (people ... to Jerusalem). To hold such a justification and sanctification activity pleased the movement and its leadings (pleased the king. . . congregation, ; 4). Hence they decided to decree an agitation (established a decree, ; 5), among all professed Christians, from mere formal hangers-on (Dan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">judge)</span><span class="font3"> to crown-losers and crown-retainers (Beer-sheba </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[well of the oath,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the teachings of the Oath-bound Covenant]), to the end that all should live out justification and consecration matters (come to keep the passover) to God's glory (unto the Lord), under the movement's executorship (at Jerusalem), a thing that was neglected for a long time in Christendom (not. . . long . . . written).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(11) Accordingly, messengers went forth with pertinent literature (posts [messengers] went with letters, ;6) sent to the movements and the leaders among God's less (Israel) and more favored people (Judah), entreating the less favored people of God, some to exercise repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus in the renewal of their justified life, and others to renew their consecration (Israel, turn again unto the Lord of. . . Israel), promising them that God would return (he will return) to the remnant of God's less favored people who had up to then escaped going into the captivity of the secular liberty-lovers (remnant. . . escaped . . . Assyria). The exhortation pleaded with the less favored people of God not to imitate their predecessors or contemporaries who sinned against God (be not ye like . . . which trespassed. . . God, ; 7), who resultantly delivered them to manifest spoliation (gave . . . desolation, as ye see). The plea specifically exhorted</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">them not to be stubborn, as their predecessors had been (not stiff-necked, as your fathers were), but to surrender to God and come among His true Church (yield. . . sanctuary), which God had set apart to Himself perpetually (sanctified for ever), and to serve God (serve the Lord), which would result in His removing His wrath from them (that. . . wrath may turn away), assuring them that if they so did, they, their fellows and winlings (turn again. . . children, ; 9) would obtain mercy before their secular liberty-loving captors (them . . . captive) and thus return to the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit (come . . . land), since God is favorable and compassionate (gracious and merciful) and will not refuse them favor, if they return to Him (not. . . face from you, if ye return). Accordingly, the messengers went from one denomination to another among God's less favored people (posts ... to city, ; 10) throughout England (Ephraim) and Scotland (Manasseh), even unto Ireland (Zebulun), but the majority despised and reviled them (laughed . . .mocked). Yet different ones from little Wales (Asher, ; 11), Scotland (Manasseh), Ireland (Zebulun), as well as from England and continental Europe (Ephraim . . . Issachar, ; 18), abased themselves in a renewal of repentance, faith and consecration, and came under the executorship of God's more favored people (humbled. . . came to Jerusalem).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(12) And God's power acting through His Word, Spirit and providences effected God's more favored people to become of one heart to fulfill the charge of antitypical Hezekiah and its leaders (hand of God. . . one heart. . . commandment. . . word of the Lord, ; 12). Multitudes gathered themselves to the sphere of the executorship of God's more favored people (assembled. . . people ... a very great congregation, ; 13) to live out repentance toward God, faith in the Lord Jesus and entire consecration (keep the feast. . . second month). They effectively set aside their adherence to their denominations (took away the altars, ; 14) from the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">sphere of the executorship of God's more favored people (Jerusalem), even all the sects to which choice human powers were sacrificed (altars of incense), and heartily cast them into the unclean condition of the curse (cast them into the brook Kidron, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">turbid).</span><span class="font3"> Then they in faith, set forth the teaching that Jesus is the Paschal Lamb (killed the passover, ; 15), in the period of justification and consecration (fourteenth day of the second month). But the main and subordinate leaders not yet cleansed were abashed at their uncleanness and cleansed themselves (priests . . . ashamed, and sanctified themselves). Thereafter they performed services that manifested God's acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice, i.e., they cooperated with Jesus in His teaching, justifying, sanctifying and delivering work (brought the burnt offering . . Lord). Each one officiated in his position according to the way that Jesus' teaching directed by God's charge, as His special Servant (place . . law of Moses the man of God, ; 16), the main leaders teaching the atoning efficacy of Jesus' blood (priests sprinkled the blood), as the subordinate leaders served them therein (hand of the Levites). Many of the people had not examined themselves and purged out the evil from themselves (many. . . were not sanctified, ; 17). Hence the subordinate leaders had the work of leading them through repentance and faith unto justification (Levites . . . killing the passovers . . . not clean) and then to consecration, in order to set them apart unto God (sanctify them unto the Lord).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(13) For very many (a multitude, ; 18) from England (Ephraim), Scotland (Manasseh), continental Europe (Issachar) and Ireland (Zebulun) had not exercised repentance, faith and consecration (not cleansed themselves); but they ignorantly counterfeited these (eat the passover otherwise . . . written). The movement labored for them in work and prayer (prayed for them), to the end that the gracious God might forgive (pardon) every one who set his heart to serve the Lord (prepared. . . seek God, ; 19), who was their</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">predecessors' God (God of his fathers), despite their erroneous self-examination, purgation, repentance, faith and consecration (not cleansed. . . purification of the sanctuary). The Lord graciously, in answer to the labors and prayers of the movement, by Jesus' ministry exercised through His servants, cured these into a proper selfexamination, purging, repentance, faith and consecration (Lord hearkened . . . healed the people, ; 20). Not only so, but the less favored people of God who had come under the executorship of His more favored people (Israel. . . Jerusalem, ; 21) remained in the privileges of new creatures in the Christian life (kept the feast. . . seven days with great gladness); and the subordinate and main leaders set forth God's Word continually in ways that reflected credit upon Him (Levites and priests praised the Lord day by day), using the teachings of the Word energetically for the Lord (loud instruments unto the Lord). The movement by word and act spoke encouragingly to the subordinate leaders (spoke comfortably. . . Levites, ; 22) who taught God's profitable thoughts to the people (taught the good knowledge of the Lord); and these appropriated the Lord's blessings throughout their Christian life (eat. . . seven days), carrying out their consecrations, encouraging others to do the same (offering peace offerings), and professing God's Truth, as well as their own weaknesses (confessing to . . . God).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(14) Those who adhered to the Bible recension, printing and circulating movement did not stop at their justification, especially typed by the first antitypical Passover, but they proceeded on to and into consecration in full determination and unanimity (whole assembly . . . keep other seven days, ; 23). This second step of the Christian life they took and kept with special joy (seven days with gladness). The movement as a whole very abundantly ministered to Jesus in His capacity of giving evidence of God's acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice by His ministering instruction, justification, sanctification and deliverance to many (thousand bullocks, ; 24) and abundantly did it stress Jesus' sacrifice as the basis of these works for the Church (seven thousand sheep). The cooperating leaders is all Protestant denominations who supported this movement ministered in this very abundantly (princes . . . thousand bullocks) to all the adherents of the movement (congregation), especially stressing Jesus' sacrifice in its justifying aspect to the adherents formerly in it, those just coming into it and those being invited to come unto justification (ten thousand sheep). Many of the main leaders renewed their consecration (priests sanctified themselves). All of God's more favored people, together with the main and subordinate leaders were full of the joy of the Lord (all. . . Judah . . . Levites . . . rejoiced, ; 25). And not only they, but also all of the less favored of God's people who responded to the movement's invitation (all. . . out of Israel), yea, those Israelites who fled from the less favored people of God and came and dwelt among God's more favored people joined in the great rejoicing (strangers that came out. . . dwelt in Judah). As a result of these justifications and consecrations, combined with instruction and deliverance, there was much joy in these in connection with the Bible recension, printing and circulating movement in its sphere of executorship (great joy in Jerusalem, ; 26); for since the ascendancy of the Interim's star-members (Solomon), as they conformed to the Apostles' teachings (son of David), there had not been in any other of the more favored movements of God's people such a period of justification and sanctification in their executorship (Solomon. . . David. . . not the like in Jerusalem), since at this time the main and subordinate leaders wrought blessingly toward the people (priests. . .blessed the people, ; 27); for their message was heeded (heard) and their prayers ascended to their Covenant God (prayer . . . unto heaven).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(15) After this great antitypical double Passover (finished, ; 31: 1) the work of uprooting every form of sin, error, selfishness and worldliness continued. This was participated in by all God's people who had taken part in these Passovers (all. . . present), and that in every denomination of God's more favored people (to the cities of Judah). They thoroughly destroyed creedism (brake . . . pieces), set aside union of state and church (cut down the groves), uprooted sectarianism from their hearts (threw down the high places) and rejected the denominationalism (altars) of God's more favored people (all Judah and Benjamin), of that in England (Ephraim) and Scotland (Manasseh). And they wrought thereon until they had driven these evils out of their hearts (utterly destroyed them all). Thereafter each one abode in his class standing, in spite of his denominational adherence (all. . . returned .possession . . .cities). The movement appointed the kinds of services as to its peculiar activities for the main and subordinate leaders (appointed. . . Levites, ; 2); according to each one's particular kind of work was he appointed (courses . . . service), some of the main and subordinate leaders to minister as to God's manifested acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice (for burnt offerings), some of them as to consecration vows (peace offerings, to minister), both as to rendering God duty love (thanks) and disinterested love (praise), as they served and by their service held high God's kindnesses and His glorious character, as those who brought others in among God's people as His Temple (gates. . . Lord). Moreover, this movement in its adherents arranged for their ministries to manifest God's acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice (king's . . . burnt offering, ; 3), first, that which was directly connected with the acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice while He was in the flesh (morning) and, secondly, that which connected it with the acceptableness of the Church's sacrifice while it is in the flesh (evening), also for it as connected with reckoned and actual justification (sabbaths), with the twelve chief graces of God's people (new moons), and the antitypical Passover, the justification and sanctification</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of the Church of the Firstborns, as well as with the antitypical Pentecost of the new creatures, and with the antitypical Feast of Tabernacles—the final standings of each as the fruitage of the Gospel Age (set feasts), according to God's Word (in the law).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(16) It also gave a charge to the people within its executorship (charged... in Jerusalem, ; 4) to carry out their consecrations (give the portions), as an encouragement to the main and subordinate leaders in the good Word of the Lord (encouraged in the law). This charge met with an immediate response (as soon. . . abroad, ; 5); the brethren rendered up their consecrations abundantly (children of Israel. . . firstfruits), in yielding deep and surface truths (com and wine), mingled with the Holy Spirit (oil) and blessed hopes (honey), and of every kind of increase wrought by their sacrificed humanity (increase of the field). Thus they yielded up in consecration their human all very overflowingly (tithe . . . abundantly). It was indeed a time of very fruitful service of God in Spirit and Truth. This was faithfully done by God's less and more favored people who were associated in the denominations wherein God's more favored people held sway, i.e., in certain Zwinglian, Unitarian, Congregational, Quaker, Pietistic and Methodist Churches (children . . . dwelt. . . Judah, ; 6); for these made and carried out their consecrations (brought in), based on Jesus' merit (oxen) and consisting of their human all (sheep); for they consecrated their time, talents, health, strength, means, influence, reputation, learning—in a word, all they were and had and all they hoped to be and have (tithe of the holy things); and they put them combinedly together in great abundance (by heaps). They began by offering their tentatively (third month, ; 7) justified human all, and ended by giving to and in God's service their new-creaturely all (seventh month). The movement in its adherents and the leaders saw these abundant consecrated things (Hezekiah. . . saw the heaps, ; 8), and therefore praised God and His</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">people (blessed... people). The movement investigated the matter as to the abundant consecrated things at the hand of the main and subordinate leaders (questioned. . . concerning the heaps, ; 9). And Jesus (Azariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[help of Jehovah] . . .</span><span class="font3"> answered,; 10) through mouthpieces made it known that since these numerous consecrations and their products began (since the people began. . . offerings) the main and subordinate leaders were greatly satisfied as to their longings for fruitfulness in God's people (had enough), yea, that it was much more than they could appropriate (have left plenty), acknowledging that God had blessed His people (hath blessed), which resulted indeed in a great quantity (great store).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(17) The movement in its adherents then charged that official positions should be made and filled in the Church (prepare chambers, ; 11), which the brethren did, in the forms of service as prophets, evangelists, pastors or teachers (they prepared them); moreover, they carried out their consecrations (brought in offerings, ; 12); others made and carried out their consecration (tithes) and presented advancing Truth (dedicated things), all of which was faithfully done. In charge of this work were </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">twelve </span><span class="font3">subordinate groups of leaders, in symbolization of its being a Little Flock work (Cononiah. . . Benaiah, ; 13), whose two group leaders respectively correspond to the two group subordinate leaders in the Little Flock tribes of antitypical Judah and Ephraim (Cononiah and Shimei), even as Jesus and the movement in its adherents charged (Hezekiah . . . Azariah). The leading evangelist group, which was among the Methodists (Kore . . . porter toward the east, ; 14), had charge of the work of gaining consecrations as fieely made and to arrange for the ascription of praise to God and Truth features to be properly apportioned (freewill offerings . . . oblations . . . most holy things). The other six evangelist groups were in charge of these things in the Anglican (Eden, ; 15), Presbyterian (Miniamin), Baptist</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(Jeshiia), Unitarian (Shemaiah), Congregationalist (Amariah) and Quaker (Shekaniah) Churches (in the cities), where there were main leaders (priests) all set in their proper offices (set office) to apportion the forms of services to their evangelistic brethren (to give. . . courses), regardless of whether these brethren were great or small (great. . . small). The general principles followed in these arrangements ran along the following lines: (1) sectarian denominationalism was ignored (beside [apart from] their genealogy, ; 16), though the stronger brethren were included (of males); (2) they included those who had just consecrated (three years old) up to the fullest matured ones (upward); (3) every one was used who entered for service among God's people as His Temple (entered . . . house); (4) a daily portion of the ministry was allocated (daily. . . service); (5) in harmony with the form of their service (charges. . . courses); (6) this was true as to the denominational relations according to the kinds of the service for and of the main and subordinate leaders (genealogy. . . Levites, ; 17); (7) qualification for service was required in each one as to his duties in his form of service (from twenty years old and upward . . . courses); (8) these arrangements applied to the denominationally most immature, to their special helpers, their movements and their powers (genealogy. . . daughters, ; 18); (9) they were applicable to all the favored people of God (all the congregation); (10) each one was to act in his office in sanctification and holiness (sanctified . . . holiness). Vs. 1618 are a parenthesis explaining matters touched on in vs. 13-15. The same general rules applied to the main leaders (sons . . priests,; 19), including eventhose who were on the fringes of denominations (fields . . . cities), of each one's denomination (several city), who were designated by their characters (names); for they were assigned to each strong one among the main leaders, as well as to the subordinate leaders in the denominations (portions . . . males). These arrangements were</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">made throughout God's more favored people by the movement, doing according to God's will in His matters (did. . . Judah. . . before . . .

<p><span class="font3">(18) Following the above-described works and their firm operation (After . . thereof, ; 32: 1), in the year 1790 (fourteenth year, 18: 13; ; Is. 36: 1 [whenever a third book is used in the parallels, if it is the only one referred to, we will use a comma and two semicolons before it; and when there is another one used in the same place there will be two semicolons used before it, as above, to indicate the third book, Isaiah; for here we have often two and sometimes three accounts]) the French revolutionists as the leaders of the liberty-lovers (Sennacherib </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[wrathful,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the wrath of the French revolutionists]) made an invasion against God's more favored people (Judah), with the purpose of winning over all the strong denominations (fenced cities) to their theories and practices (thought to win them, ; 1). When the Bible recension, publishing and distributing movement (Hezekiah, ; 2) took note that the French revolutionists were working against it (saw. . . come), and were intent on overthrowing its sphere of executorship (fight against Jerusalem), it as a whole advised (took counsel, ; 3) with its leaders (princes) and warriors (mighty men) over the question of stopping all supplies and relief (stop . . . fountains) outside of its sphere of executorship from falling into the hands of the French revolutionists. They supported it in this purpose (did help him). Thereupon there were united in this purpose multitudes of its supporters (much people, ; 4), who cut off such supplies and relief (stopped all the fountains), which dried up every avenue for them to reach such revolutionists (brook), believing and declaring that it was unreasonable to let them succor the enemy (Why. . . Assyria . . . much water). It made its position strong</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(strengthened, ; 5), especially increasing and fortifying its powers where weak (built. . . wall. . . broken) and made them fit supports to its strongest points (raised . . . towers) and secured power from those outside of its sphere of executorship, both in Britain and on the continent (another wall without). It strengthened the Apostolic ramparts (Millo . . . David), and invented many sharp weapons (darts) and strong defenses against the theories and practices of the French revolutionists (darts and shields in abundance). It appointed leader warriors among its supporters (captains . . . people, ; 6), assembling them publicly in the ways of Truth in its sphere of executorship (gathered. . . street. . . gate of the city), cheering them and urging them to be strong and cheerful, not to fear or be discouraged at the liberty-lovers and revolutionists (strong . Assyria, ; 7), regardless of their great numbers (all the multitude), since their Helper was greater than they (more). With their enemies, it continued, was human strength (arm of flesh, ; 8); with them was the Lord as Helper and Warrior (Lord. . . help. . . fight), which assurances gave them rest of faith (people rested . . . words); for God helps in time of need.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(19) The Bible recension, publishing and distributing movement in Europe, especially in Britain, sought to come to terms with the French revolutionists and their libertyloving supporters, especially those of the latter who were in Britain (sent. . . Assyria, 14). These revolutionists were engaged in a sharp struggle with the stubborn defenders of the old order, in France especially, but also with their supporters in other nations (Lachish, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stubborn).</span><span class="font3"> It acknowledged that it had offended in its too strenuous support of the old order (offended), and requested that it be left in peace (return from me), agreeing to accept their terms (puttest . . bear). These overtures were not made by words, but by the conditions of the movement requiring it to adapt itself to the circumstances forced upon it by the French Revolution. And the circumstances forced it to face the question of yielding up an immense shrinkage of its circularion of the Divine Truth, as much as was humanly possible (appointed. . . three hundred. . . thirty). To meet the situation forced upon it by these circumstances it had to yield to a shrinkage of Divine teachings on secular government (silver . . . house of the Lord, 15) and of human teachings thereon (king's house), e.g., it gave up much of the right of rulers to absolute power as of Divine right, civil power derived by heredity, the rights of primogeniture and of aristocracy, and had to accept the doctrine of civil power as derived from the consent of the governed, the responsibility of all to civil law and the equality of all before the law. It also had to give up many of the supposedly Divine-right powers and privileges of the clergy and evangelists (cut off. . . doors of the temple, 16), likewise of the hierarchs (pillars), even those that the movement had attributed to them (Hezekiah. . . overlaid) and yielded these to the revolutionists.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(20) But despite their demands having been met, the French revolutionists aroused from their conflict with the absolutists (Lachish, 17; 9; 2) against the Bible recension, printing and distributing movement and all its supporters (Hezekiah. . . Judah, ; 9) the chiefs of the elected representatives (Tartan, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the third</span><span class="font3"> [estate of France], 17), the chiefs of the military forces (Rabsaris, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chief of the eunuchs') </span><span class="font3">and the chief proponents of their theories (Rab-shakeh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chief butler,</span><span class="font3"> ; ; 2), all combinedly (servants, ; 9), in its sphere of executorship (Jerusalem), they being accompanied by immense numbers of supporters (a great host, 17; a great army, ;; 2). They took their position on the principles of reason (upper pool, 17; ; 2) which lead to the Divine doctrines of the rights of man before his fellows (conduit) and on which all might go (highway) toward a riddance of the sphere of usurped authority (fuller's field). They demanded that the movement give them attention (called to the king, 18). Mentally the executive leaders of the movement (Eliakim, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my God arises',</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Hilkiah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">held by Jehovah. 18’,</span><span class="font3"> ; 3), the humble scholarly writers and orators (Shebna, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shyness,</span><span class="font3"> the scribe) and the historians (Joah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah a brother,</span><span class="font3"> recorder) of the movement journeyed to the theory claims of the French revolutionists (came out). Their theory propounders set forth their views (Rab-shakeh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">chief butler,</span><span class="font3"> said, 19; ; 4)to these that they inform the Bible movement of the views and demands of the French revolutionists (Thus saith . . . king, 19; 10; 4). They considered their confidence baseless (confidence . . . trustest) to endure a siege of the sphere of its executorship (abide . . . Jerusalem, ; 10). They asked if the Bible movement was not inducing them to a course which meant death by lack of deep and surface views (persuade . . . die . . . thirst), claiming, but in vain, to have the needed plans and power to fight (vain words . . . war, 20; ; 5 ), and demanded how the movement in which it trusted could presume to revolt against the French revolutionists as liberty-lovers (God shall deliver. . . Assyria, 20; 11; 5). They accused it of relying upon the support of the unreliable secular powers (staff. . . reed . . . Egypt, 21; ; 6) which will fail their trusting allies and injure their power (lean . . . hand, and pierce it). Such is Satan as the ruler of the secular powers to his dependents (so is Pharaoh . . . trust on him). Further, they argued that if their trust was in Jehovah for deliverance from the revolutionists (say. . . trust. . . God, 22; 11; 7), they were not to forget that He had turned against them, because the Bible movement had overthrown His sects and churches (high places and altars . . . taken away, 22; 12; 7), charging its people and sphere of executorship (Judah and to Jerusalem) to serve in the interests of the one Church (worship . . . altar) and to devote their choice reckonedly perfect powers in its interests (incense upon it, ; 12). It should consider how the liberty-lovers have conquered all the opposing nations.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(21) Thereupon these theory teachers suggested that the Bible movement give pledges of alliance with the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">French revolutionists as liberty-lovers (give pledges . . . Assyria, 23; ; 8), pledging to give it complete secular teachings for their mutual purposes (two thousand horses), provided that it would furnish teachers of these (set riders upon them). In view of the situation they asked how it, which could not frighten into flight even the least able leader of these revolutionists' subordinates (turn. . . captain. . . master's servants, 24; ; 9), could place confidence in the secular powers (trust on Egypt) for secular organizations and their leaders (for chariots and for horsemen). They further asked whether they were coming against the Bible movement's sphere of teaching and of spirit to overthrow it (Am I now come . . . destroy, 25; ; 10) without the Lord's command (without the Lord). On the contrary, they claimed, but falsely, that they had received orders from the Lord Himself to campaign against, and to destroy that sphere (Go up . . destroy it). Thereupon the movement's executive leaders (Eliakim, 26; ; 11) , the humble scholars and orators (Shebna) and the historians (Joah), by their attitude, asked the revolutionists' doctrinaires (Rah-shakeh), very politely and humbly (pray . . . servants), to speak their views in non-Truth forms of expression (Syrian language), since they understood it (understand), and not in Truth terms (not. . . Jews' language), lest those standing in their powers understand them (ears . . . wall). By their continued propaganda they claimed that they were not speaking at the revolutionists' charge to the Bible movement, but to those in power (sent. . . speak. . . wall, 27; ; 12), to the end that they might believe their vile rejected deeper and shallower views (eat. . . drink). They made still louder outcries in language approximating the Truth (cried with a loud. . . language, 28; 18; 13) to the strong supporters of the Bible movement's sphere of executorship (Jerusalem, ; 18), to discourage and intimidate them (affright. . . trouble), to the end that they might capture their sphere of executorship (take the city), demanding their attention to the revolutionists</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as liberty-lovers (Hear . . . Assyria, 28; ; 13), asking them to be on their guard not to let the Bible movement deceive them (deceive you, 29; 15; 14), since it could not deliver them (not. . . deliver, 29; ; 14) from the revolutionists' power (hand, 29). They sought to dissuade them from the movement's word, to trust in Jehovah as their sure Deliverer (neither . . . trust. . . surely deliver us, 30; ; 15) and the Preventer of the fall of the sphere of executorship to liberty-lovers (city shall not. . . Assyria).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(22) Again its supporters were warned by the revolutionists' doctrinaires not to heed the Bible movement (Hearken not, 31;; 16); for the revolutionists (king) advised them to make peace with them by giving them tribute (Make . . . present) and by surrendering (come out), in which case they might continue to eat and drink of their work (eat. . . drink), until the revolutionists would transport them to another sphere of thought and spirit (take . . . land, 32; ; 17), which they claimed was like their own (own land), in which they could produce deeper and shallower teachings (com. . . vineyards) and have a good spirit and happy prospects (oil and honey, 32), resulting in their surviving and not perishing (live and not die, 32); and to be on their guard against the Bible movement's making them believe that God would deliver them from the revolutionists (Beware . . . deliver us, 32; 15; 18), asserting that no powerful one of any country was able to save from their power (nation . . . hand, ; 15), nor had any delivered out of the power of other, earlier liberty-lovers (hand of my fathers). Hence they argued that Jehovah would much the less be able to deliver them from their power (God . . . mine hand). What powerful one of any nation was able to deliver his nation from the power of the liberty-lovers (any. . . delivered . . . hand . . . Assyria, 33; 13; 18)? Where are the powerful ones of contradicting Romanism (Hamath, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fortress,</span><span class="font3"> 34 [19: 13]; ; 19 [37: 13]), of infidelistic philosophers (Arphad), of apostates impinging</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">on the ransom (Sepharvaim), of union of state and church (Hena, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">lowland)</span><span class="font3"> and of the destructive reformers (Ivah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">niin'P</span><span class="font3"> Did any of the powerful ones deliver absolutism (Samaria, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">guard)</span><span class="font3"> out of their power? Again they demanded which one of the powerful, ones of those movements had delivered their spheres out of their predecessors' and their power (Who. . . gods . . .fathers . . . my hand, 35; 14; 20). Could they hope that Jehovah could so do to them and their sphere of executorship (God deliver you . . . Jerusalem, 35; 15;20)?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(23) These doctrinaires continued to slander the Lord and the Bible movement, which was serving the Lord (servants... against the Lord... Hezekiah, ; 16). Moreover, they wrote books and issued proclamations against the Lord as the God of the sphere of His people's executorship (wrote . . . rail . . . God, ; 17), blaspheming Him by degrading Him to the level of powerful ones of non-Truth movements (speak against him), even asserting that He could do no more to protect the Bible movement (Hezekiah) and deliver His people out of the power of the French revolutionists (deliver . . . hand) than the powerful ones of non-Truth movements could do to deliver them out of their power (not delivered their people). Thus they degraded the God of His people's sphere of executorship (God of Jerusalem, ; 19) to the level of the powerful ones of non-Truth movements (as against the gods . . . earth), which were but human manufactures (work ... of man). But the supporters of the Bible movement did not reply to this insolence, not answering even one word (people . . . answered. . . word, 36; ; 21), even as the movement had charged them not to answer (king's commandment. . .not). Thereupon the Bible movement's chief executives (Eliakim. . . household, 37; ; 22) and humble scholars and orators (Shebna the scribe) and the historians who gathered materials for the record of historical events (Joah. . . Asaph, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gatherer)</span><span class="font3"> were very much grieved (clothes rent), and in this state of mind made known to the Bible</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">movement the declarations of the revolutionists' doctrinaires (told him . . . Rab-shakeh).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(24) The effect of this report, when the Bible movement heard it, was to grieve it in all its adherents (Hezekiah . . . rent his clothes, 19: 1; ; 37: 1) and it went into the deepest mourning (sack cloth) and betook itself to God's people as His sanctuary (house of the Lord). For this cause the movement and its most prominent faithful and strong teachers (Hezekiah . . . Isaiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[salvation of Jehovah], Amoz [strong],</span><span class="font3"> ; 20) made special prayer and supplication (prayed and cried to heaven). Thereupon the Bible movement sent its leading executives (Eliakim. . . household, 2; ; 2), its humble scholars and orators (Shebna the scribe) and the chief preachers (elders of the priests) in deep mourning (sackcloth) to the main strong and faithful teachers (Isaiah . . . Amoz), acquainting them (said, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3;</span><span class="font3"> ; 3) with the movement's sentiments, which were to the effect that the period of the French Revolution was a time of tribulation (day of trouble), of rebuke for Christendom's sins (rebuke) and of slander against God (blasphemy); for a great crisis had come upon Christendom ready to produce a new order in church, state and society (children. . . birth), but it was powerless to produce this new order (not strength to bring forth). The Bible movement longed for God to give heed to the teachings of the revolutionists' doctrinaires (may be . . . hear. . . Rab-shakeh, 4; ; 4), whom the French revolutionists as liberty-lovers (king of Assyria) had stirred up to slander Jehovah with blaming charges (reproach the living God). Perhaps God would rebuke in a startling way the blasphemies against Him, made in His hearing (reprove . . . heard). Therefore the Bible movement asked these chief faithful teachers to pray (lift up thy prayer) for its few remaining supporters (remnant). With these message the representatives of the movement came to the chief faithful teachers (servants ... to Isaiah, 5; ; 5). These teachers gave them an answer to give to the movement</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(Isaiah said. . . Thus . . . master, 6; ; 6) as a saying of Jehovah (Thus saith the Lord), encouraging it not to fear the teachings published in its hearing (not afraid of the words) and issued forth by the doctrinaire servants of the French revolutionists as liberty-lovers (servants. . . Assyria); wherewith they blasphemed Jehovah (blasphemed me); for God was determined to bring upon them a powerful blow (send a blast, ; 7); a report that strong opponents of theirs would reach them (shall hear a rumor); they would leave the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit, would go to their own sphere of error and its spirit (return. . . land); and in their own sphere of error and practice the French revolutionists would succumb (fall) by theories subversive of theirs (by the sword).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(25) The revolutionists' doctrinaires then turned their attention to the French revolutionists, who, having overcome the autocrats in state and aristocracy (departed from Lachish, 8; ; 8), turned their attention against the leaders of true Christianity (warring against Libnah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">whiteness, clarity).</span><span class="font3"> In France the abolition of Romanism was considered and meant by the revolutionists as an attack on all religion. Reason as a goddess was enthroned as the sole source and rule of faith and practice; and while the existence of a supreme being was later declared, the indirect effect of the French opponents of religion was an attack on real religion, as the siege of antitypical Libnah was an attack on the Bible movement as an expression of real religion. Frightened by the report that a coalition of European secular powers under England's lead (heard say of Tirhakah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">distance,</span><span class="font3"> 9; ; 9) was coming to war against them (come . . . against thee), in view of this feared attack of the coalition of European powers, to forestall its possible strengthening of their foes, these revolutionists increased their attacks legislatively and literarily on Romanism and all religion, except that of Reason. And from this standpoint their literary attacks were</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">really an attack on the Bible movement (sent messengers, 9; ; 9), charging that their message be declared to the Bible movement as the chief movement of God's people (king of Judah, 10; ; 10). They cautioned it not to let its trust in Jehovah deceive it (not thy God. . . deceive thee) into believing that the sphere of its executorship would not be given into the power of the French revolutionists as the leaders of the liberty-lovers (Jerusalem . . . hand. . . Assyria).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let it keep in mind what the various forms of the libertylovers' leaders had done with all anti-liberty spheres of teaching and practice, /. e., completely overthrowing them (heard. . . done . . . destroying, 11; ;11), as the thing that should convince it that it would not escape (shalt thou be delivered?).

<p><span class="font3">(26) The Bible movement received the writings of the revolutionists circulated by the publishers (letter. . . messengers, 14; ; 14) and digested their contents (read it) and thereover appeared before God's people as His temple (went. . . house of the Lord), and spoke to God on its contents (spread. . .

It pleaded that God would emphatically listen (bow... hear, 16; ; 17) and emphatically take note (open . . . see), and give attention to the oppressive teachings of the French</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">revolutionists (hear. . . Sennacherib), which by their authors they had sent to cast reproach upon the eternal God (sent. . . reproach). It acknowledged before the Lord that the leaders of the liberty-lovers (truth . . . Assyria, 17; ; 18) had crushed those movements and their teachings and practices (destroyed . . lands) and had destroyed their religious beliefs (gods into the fire, 18; ; 19), since such were really not true beliefs (no gods), but were human fictions (work of man's hands), some weak (wood), some strong (stone); and hence such liberty-lovers' leaders overcame them (destroyed them). Therefore it prayed God to save His people from their power (save . . . hand, 19; ; 20), in order that all rulers in human society (kingdoms of the earth) may learn that He alone is God (thou . . . only). Thereupon the strong leading faithful teachers sent the Bible movement an answer (Isaiah. . . saying, 20; ; 21) from God to His people (Thus saith. . . Israel), giving assurance that its prayer against the French revolutionists as liberty-lovers came with acceptance before Him (prayed. . . Assyria I have heard). Now follows His answer (word . . . concerning him, 21;; 22): The consecrated lightshiners (virgin. . .

<p><span class="font3">(27) By their envoys they had blamed Jehovah (they. . . reproached, 23; ; 24), boasting that by their many organizations they would overcome God (come. . . heights. . . Lebanon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">white),</span><span class="font3"> overthrowing His best justified (cut down. . . cedar trees) and most faithful consecrated people (choice fir trees), overpowering the weakest (lodgings) and the most fruitful of His people (Carmel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fruitful),</span><span class="font3"> alleging that</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">they had captured and refreshed themselves with the supplies of foreigners (digged . . . waters, 24; ; 25), and had proudly plundered the people's spheres of teaching and practice that they had invested (soles . . . dried. . . rivers . . . places). God asked them whether they had not heard that in the long past God's plans and works were accomplished (heard. . . done . . . formed? 25; ; 26). He assured them that it was He who had used the French revolutionists to devastate strong spheres of teaching and practice (brought. . . lay waste . . . heaps). Because of God's determination their subjects had been weak (inhabitants were of small power, 26; ; 27), affrighted and discouraged, evanescent (dismayed. . . herb), crushed (grass . . . tops) and overthrown before fully developed (blasted. . . grown up). God then showed them that He knew their position (abode, 27; ; 28), their endeavors and results (out... in) and their wrath against Him in His (rage against me). And because God had taken note of their wrath and agitation (rage . . . tumult, 28; ; 29) He would treat them like hooked and chained prisoners (hook . . . bridle) and force them to retreat over the same course over which they came in invading God's sphere of teaching and Spirit (turn the back. . . earnest). And to the Bible movement God gave a sign of their successive operations (sign unto thee, 29; ; 30); Their first period, i.e., 1795 to Oct. 1800 would produce Bibles at small and individuals' efforts (eat this year. . . grow of themselves); the next period, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> Oct. 1800 to Apr. 1804, would be of a much smaller extent, coming from the remnants of the first period's efforts (second year ... the same); but in the third period the movement's supporters would agitate for printing Bibles and then form Bible societies, the first one coming in the form of the British and Foreign Bible Society, which would produce a most abundant crop of Bibles, refreshing human society (third year sow ... eat the fruits thereof).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(28) Then the chief faithful teachers promised that God's people who would survive victoriously the trials of the French Revolution period (escaped . . . Judah, 30; ; 31), would be rooted deep in the Bible and would raise high the Bible as their fruitage (root. . . fruit); for God promised that some would survive victoriously those trials in their sphere of executorship (Jerusalem. . . remnant, 31; ; 32) and in their embryo sphere of showing forth the light (escape out of mount Zion), guaranteeing that His loving active aggressiveness would accomplish this in due time (zeal ... do this). Furthermore God promised (thus saith the Lord, 32; ; 33) as to the French revolutionists (king), that they would not enter the sphere of His people's executorship (not come into this city), nor pierce it with any of their sharp sayings (shoot an arrow), nor approach it with protective weapons (with shield), nor besiege it (nor cast a bank). They would reverse their theories and practices (came . . . return, 33;; 34) and would not enter the sphere of His people's executorship (not come into this city); [This God repeated for emphasis], because God would protect that sphere (defend, 34; ; 35), and deliver it for His glory's sake and for His Apostles' sake (my sake . . . David's sake).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(29) The prophecy having been given, the fulfilment followed closely on its heels (that night, 35; ; 36); for shortly after the Red terror that gripped France for nearly a year (Sept. 1793 to July 1794) subsided, a reaction (angel of the Lord, 35; 21; 36) set in, which, seeking to preserve the gains, set aside the extreme fanaticism of the revolutionists and destroyed its leaders. This was the beginning of the slaughter of the supporters of the extreme revolutionists and of their officials, who were very numerous and powerful (smote . . . thousands); especially was this reaction fatal to the warriors (cut off. . . men of valor, ; 21), legislative giants (leaders) and other leaders (captains). And by 1796 the extremes! revolutionists were either physically killed or killed as such by giving up their extreme fanaticism and famine-hastening and painful results, the remnant viewing these dead or reformed extremists (arose early. . . behold . . . corpses). The revolutionists somewhat earlier changed their atheism into rationalism, which proclaimed God, virtue and immortality, and thus went back to a reformed France, which was a leaving of antitypical Judah and a return to antitypical Assyria in much shame (departed . . . returned with shame ... land, 36; 21; 37), and occupied themselves in a combined civil and religious government (Nineveh, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dwelling of Nina,</span><span class="font3"> goddess of love). While these reformed French revolutionists were engaged in works of patriotism (worshipping... Nisroch, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">patriotism,</span><span class="font3"> 37; 21; 38), first, under a new constitution, the Directory, the executive body of five members appointed under the new constitution, that of 1795 (Adrammelech, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fire king)</span><span class="font3"> then the Consulate, under a revised constitution, that of 1799, consisting of three members, of whom Napoleon was the first consul (Sharezer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">prince),</span><span class="font3"> put an end to the French revolutionists as a party, by the action of these two constitutions (smote him with the sword), and betook themselves to higher grounds of government than that of the French Revolution (escaped. . . Armenia, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">highland).</span><span class="font3"> As a result a modified democracy temporarily succeeded the French revolutionists (Esarhaddon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">conqueror,</span><span class="font3"> 37; ; 38). Thus the Lord saved the Bible movement and the supporters of its executorship (saved. . . Jerusalem, ; 22) from the power of French revolutionists, the leaders of the liberty-lovers, and from all others (hand... all other) and guided them well in all matters (every side). This led many to consecrate themselves to the Lord (gifts to the Lord, ; 23) and to give helps to the movement (presents), which resulted in its being honored by all other Christian movements from then onward (magnified . . . thenceforth).</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">(30) It was during the period of the French Revolution (in those days,; 24) that, through the conditions induced by that revolution: preoccupation of the bulk of the people in it, the destruction of commerce by it, the use of great funds to combat it and the resultant impoverishment in Britain due to it, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> that the Bible movement came to a standstill as to publishing, and to a low ebb as to circulating the Bible (sick unto death; 20: 1; 32: 24; 38: 1). This is apparent from the story of Mary Jones, referred to above, and is the thing typed by Hezekiah's illness. This led it in its supporters to pray for a recovery (prayed, ; 24); and God assured it and gave it an evidence of recovery (spake . . . gave him a sign). The faithful and strong main teachers had delivered to it a message from the Lord (Isaiah. . . came . . . said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, 1; ; 1), to the effect that it should arrange (set thine house in order) so that its affairs would be in a condition for it to cease being the chief movement of God's people (die and not live). But most dear to its heart in its supporters was its work, feeble as it was; hence, hiding its feelings from others (turned his face to the wall, 2; ; 2), it was most loath to give it up, greatly grieved thereover, and poured out its grief in heartfelt prayer (prayed. . . saying), entrearing the Lord (beseech thee, 3; ; 3) not to forget but to keep in mind (remember) its labor and love for His name, in that it ministered the Bible to His people (walked. . . truth. . . perfect heart. . . good). So grieved was it (wept sore). Here is a case of the thought that before God's people call He answers, and while they are yet speaking He hears; for scarcely had the strong main and faithful teachers gotten, out of the movement's presence, and while it was yet within its office precincts (afore Isaiah. . . court, 4; ; 4), God's providence and word gave them a message for it (came the word of the Lord).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(31) He charged them that they should return to, and tell the movement (turn again and tell, 5; ; 5), as the leading movement among God's people (the captain of my people, 5), as a message from the Lord</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">as the God of the Apostles (Thus saith . . . God of David, 5; ; 5), in whose teachings it abode (father), that He had heard its supplications (heard thy prayer) and seen its grief (tears), to the effect that very shortly (third day, 5), cured of its evil (heal thee, 5), it would appear before God's people, as it was God's chief movement (into the house of the Lord, 5); that He would add 15 years to its term of being the chief movement of God's people (add. . . fifteen years, 6 ; ; 5), would deliver it and its sphere of executorship (deliver . . . city) from the power of the French revolutionists, and would defend that sphere (city) for His honor and that of the Apostles (own . . . David's sake, 6). The faithful leading teachers prescribed the sweet hope of coming success (Isaiah . . . lump of figs, 7), which was applied to its cure (laid. . . recovered). It desired some assurance of its cure (sign. . . heal, 8; ; 8) and of its appearing before God's people in the third period (house . . third day). The Lord gave it the choice as to whether the Bible should go back to its former unopposed or to a future unopposed ministry by justified and consecrated humans (shadow go forward. . . go back ten degrees, 9). It chose the more difficult of the two (light. . . return, 10). In answer to the prayer of the leading teachers (cried, 11), this was done (brought backward). The sign was that the Bible would recover from its then condition of opposition by the French revolutionists to the full condition of the support that justified and consecrated humans could give it (this . . . shadow . . . ten degrees, 11; 24; 8).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(32) So deeply impressed by these circumstances was the Bible movement that it in its supporters poured out its feelings in a widely spread tract, telling among other things the story of Mary Jones and her 50-mile journey for a Bible and the great dearth of Bibles, saying in the noontide of its activities (cutting off [better, noontide], ; ; 10) it was going down to the entrance of the death state (go . . . grave), and was thus cut</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">off from its life's expectation. It concluded that it would not see God in His character and works anymore in this life (not see . . . land of the living, ; ; 11), nor human beings with the rest of this world's creatures (man no more . . . world). Its years were removed like a transitory shepherd's tent (departed, and is removed . . . tent, ; ; 12). As a weaver cuts off his thread, so it was undergoing the cutting off of its existence (cut off. . . life, ; ; 12). It felt that God was cutting it off as by a pining sickness (cut. . . .sickness). It expected daily to come to its end (day even to night, ; ; 12, 13). And when night came it thought it could not last till the morning (till morning), believing that, like a fierce lion, God would scatter from it its supporters (break all my bones, ; ; 13). It muttered incoherent sounds, instead of reasonable speech (chatter, ;; 14). Like a bereaved dove (as a dove) it mourned, and almost became of no understanding from long looking to God for relief (eyes . . .upward). It pleaded with God by reason of its oppression (O . . . oppressed), asking Him to undertake for it (undertake for me). It knew not what to say (What shall I say?, ; ; 15). Despite God's having revealed Himself to it, He yet has afflicted it (spoken . . . done it). Its future would be one of inactivity (softly all my years), after ending life in distress (bitterness of my soul). It recognized that men, as well as itself, really lived by God's Word, Spirit and providences (live . . . life of my spirit, ; ; 16). Hence it prayed that thereby God might recover it and cause it to live (recover. . . live). Instead of prosperity it had grievous disappointment by ill success (peace . . . bitterness, ; ; 17); but in love for it God had rescued it from death (love . . . delivered ... pit of corruption), since He had forgiven and forgotten all its missteps (cast. . . thy back). This God did to it, because the death state cannot praise and honor God (grave . . . death cannot celebrate, ; ; 18); since those in the death state are unconscious, they cannot hope to obtain</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God's Truth (pit. . . truth); for only the living can praise God (living. . . praise, ; ; 19), as it, rescued from death, was then doing (this day). A predecessor will to successors declare God's Truth (father. . . thy truth). Since God was alert to rescue it (to save, ; ;20), it would declare God's as its message (sing my songs), with Bibles circulated (stringed instruments), all its existence (all the days), before God's people (house of the Lord). For the interpretation of vs. 21, 22, please see comments on Is. 38: 7, 8.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(33) The Bible movement, like many people and movements, could not stand prosperity, at least for a while (rendered not. . . benefit done, ; 25), but was temporarily proud (lifted up), for which God expressed His displeasure upon it (wrath upon him), His people (Judah) and its sphere of executorship (Jerusalem). But, unlike most of the selfexalted, it abased itself (humbled . . . pride of his heart, ; 26), not only it, but also its special assistants (inhabitants of Jerusalem), which postponed the wrath until after its days of ascendancy (wrath . . . not. . . days of Hezekiah). It was greatly increased in its Bible work (riches, ; 27) and in the respect of its observers (honor). It increased its depositories of Bibles (silver), of Divine understanding of the Bible (gold), of graces (precious stones) of the utmost variety (spices) and of Bible defenses (shields) and every other kind of adornment of God's Spirit and Word (jewels), as well as pen-products as depositories (storehouses, ; 28) for hard (corn) and easy (wine) teachings and their spiritual understanding (oil), also churches (stalls) where the justified could stay (beasts), and where the consecrated were at home (cotes for the flocks). Moreover, it arranged for Bible societies (dries, ; 29) and made the sacrifice of the Church (flocks) and of Christ (herds) very prominent and greatly prospered in increase of sacrifices (flocks . . . abundance). It also shut off Bible truths on secular things from giving aid to the French revolutionists (watercourse of Gihon,</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stream,</span><span class="font3"> 18: 17; 32: 3, 4) and arranged by publishing Bibles to give directly (west side, ; 30) Apostolic teachings to the Lord's people (down. . . city of David). And in its Bible undertakings it was successful (prospered. . . works). But in one thing it offended—in receiving and glorying before the messengers of nominal-church confusion (ambassadors . . . Babylon, ; 31), who came to congratulate it for its recovery and connected wonders (enquire of the wonder . . . land). To test it God let it follow its own counsels (left him, to try him), to reveal its heart's attitude (know. . . .heart). The following shows the test; and the Bible movement's pride is described in; 25, 26.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(34) It was during the French Revolution that, doubly strong-willed and warlike, Satan (Berodach-[vrar/z£e] baladan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[strong-willed],</span><span class="font3"> 20: 12; ; 39: 1), the creator of symbolic Babylon, caused the sufferings of the French hierarchy and clergy to be made known to the Bible movement in a way that aroused its sympathy for, and confidence in them (sent letters). He also aroused much people to support it (present), because he thought that such expressions of sympathy for its. recovery would enable him to get control, at least in the future, of its work (heard . . . sick). Overjoyed, it listened to the messengers' proposal of sympathy and help for the French hierarchy and clergy as fellow-sufferers from the same agents (hearkened . . . glad, 13; ; 2). In its confidence it made known to Satan's messengers all that it had, as described in; 27-29 (shewed them all. . . treasures). In its spirit of showing off it concealed nothing in its responsibilities and rulership (nothing . . . shewed them not). But God's all-seeing eye saw the spirit and nature of its acts and sent by the leading faithful teachers (Isaiah, 14; ; 3) a sharp rebuke, tactfully put as questions as to what the messengers said (What said these men?) and as to what was the sphere of teaching and practice from which they came to it (whence came they unto thee?). Its attitude showed that in teaching and practice they</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">were far from its teachings and practices (a far country) and it reluctantly by attitude admitted that they came from Satan's sphere of teaching and practice (Babylon). The leading faithful teachers further inquired as to what they had seen in its sphere of duty (seen in thine house, 15; ; 4); and again it in honesty admitted by its attitude that they were given by it to see everything therein (all things), nothing at all having been concealed from them (nothing . . . not shewed them).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(35) Thereupon the leading faithful teachers asked it to hear God's pertinent word (Hear the word of the Lord 16; ; 5). They then forecast that all that it and its predecessors had amassed of good and had shown would come into Satan's control for his purposes of confusion (all that. . . that. . . laid up in store . . . Babylon, 17; ; 6), nothing, at all being excepted (nothing shall be left). Satan's servants would capture its descendants (sons . . . beget, 18; ; 7) and they would become lowly slaves in Satan's sphere of activity (eunuchs . . Babylon). The pious Bible movement was submissive to this pronouncement (said. . . good is the word. . . spoken, 19; ; 8) and took comfort in that this would not happen in its period of ascendancy (good, if peace and truth be in my days). The foregoing episode was the special one wherein the Bible movement exercised pride and later repented of it, as shown above. The abovedescribed works and others of its acts are described in the works of the historians of this movement (rest. . . Hezekiah, 20; 32). Among these works were the mighty and good deeds (all his might. . . good deeds) of its making immense stocks of Bibles kept in storehouses (pool, 20) through its publishing work (conduit) whereby it brought, in the Bible, the due truths into the sphere of its executorship (water into the city). All of these things are recorded in the writings of its historians (book . . . kings of Judah. . . and Israel, 20; 32) particularly in the writings of the main strong and faithful teachers'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Pen-products (Isaiah. . . Amoz, ; 32). In 1805 the Bible movement ceased to be the main movement of God's people (slept 21; 33). It is kept in highest and sacred remembrance as having carried on Apostolic work as among the movements of God's more favored movements (buried . . . chiefest of the sepulchres . . . David). This good movement has been held in especial honor and esteem by God's real people and the supporters of its sphere of executorship (all Judah . . . Jerusalem did him honor in his death). Its successor as the main movement of God's people was the anti-infidelistic movement of the Gospel Age as distinct from that of the harvests (Manasseh. . . stead, 21; 33).</span></p>

The involved parallel years are 716-661 B.C. and 1805-1860 A.D. Rationalism, the theory and practice that exalts reason as the source and rule of faith and practice and rejects the Scriptures as such, had its beginning with that of deism, whose father was Lord Herbert of Cherberry (died 1648). It progressed through the various phases of English deism, became transplanted to France in the so-called Illumination, the mother of the French Revolution; and from France it passed over to Germany, where it did its most destructive work through the activities of German University professors, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> J. S. Semler, J. A. Ernesti, K.A.G. Keil, J. D. Mechaelis, J.G. Eichhorn, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> It degenerated</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">into what was called vulgar rationalism, whose superficiality sank it into its proponents' discussing subjects like vaccination, methods of inducing sleep, food for beasts, which was their Christmas subject, and other secular subjects, e.g., the best lesson that vulgar rationalistic preachers could draw from the resurrection of our Lord was the benefit of early rising. Like the Deists, they summed up religion as consisting of three articles of faith: God, virtue and immortality.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(37) Supernaturalism is the teaching and practice of the Bible as a Divine revelation, proven to be such by accompanying miracles and prophecies and by being delivered by credible messengers. This doctrine as to the Bible was denied by the rationalists, with the result that they denied almost every Bible doctrine which cannot be deducted from reason. So widespread was rationalism that not only in France, but also in Germany the universities were filled with rationalistic professors, with the result that in Germany most of the pastors were permeated with its fell teachings. After it had reigned supreme in Germany for a generation the Lord raised up the supernaturalists, whose leader in its first, or evil, phase was Frederich D.E. Schleiermacher, and whose leader in its second, or good, phase was Ernst W. Hengstenberg, the former being its leader in the antitype of Manasseh's wickedness, and the latter being its leader in the antitype of Manasseh's righteousness. The main helpers of Schleiermacher, who (1768-1834) was one of the ablest of the 19th-century theologians, in Germany were Claus Harms (1778-1855), E.G. Bengel (1769-1826), grandson of J.A. Bengel, the man who was the one &quot;on that side of the bank of the river&quot; (Dan. 12: 5), F.V. Reinhard (1753-1812) and August Hahn (1792-1863), and in England were W. Paley (1743-1805) and Richard Watson (1737-1816). All of these taught and wrote works refutative of rationalism and in support of the Bible as a Divine revelation. This supernaturalism movement began in 1793, twelve</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">years before it became the most prominent Divinely favored movement in Christendom, through the publication of G.C. Storr's book, Theological Notes For Kant's Philosophical Doctrine On Religion (twelve years. . . reign, 2 Kings 21: 1; 2 Chro. 33: 1).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(38) It was the ascendant movement from 1805 to 1860 (fifty-five years in Jerusalem, 1; 1). The disposition that developed it was its delight in the Bible as the Divine revelation (mother's name was Hephzibah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">my delight is in her,</span><span class="font3"> 1). But this movement in its first phase, 1805-1825, which was closed by Schleiermacher's joining the union of the Lutheran and Calvinistic Churches of Prussia, shortly after he had issued a final blast against rationalism's depreciation of Bible doctrines. During these 20 years this movement was guilty of much evil (did evil. . . Lord, 2; 2) along the lines of human depravity in sin, error, selfishness and worldliness (abominations of the heathen. . . cast out. . . Israel, 2; 2). It developed denominations in England and Germany against the non-sectarian spirit of the Bible recension, publishing and distribution movement (built. . . high places which Hezekiah. . . destroyed, 3; 3) and developed power-grasping and lording Churches in Britain and Germany (altars for Baal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[lord];</span><span class="font3"> Baalim </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[/oayZs])</span><span class="font3"> and favored union of state and church in both countries (made a grove; groves), even as absolutism in state united state and church in Christendom (as did Ahab </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[father's brother] . . . </span><span class="font3">Israel, 3), and was subject to the clergy and hierarchy in both countries (host of heaven) and furthered them (served them). Through the unionistic efforts to bring the Lutheran and Calvinistic Churches into one body, it created new churches in various of the German states; for many of the two Churches in various of the German states refused to join the union in those states, which resulted in a number of new church sects being formed (built altars, 4; 4), whereas God desired His character to dwell in His real Church, which was in the executive sphere of the most favored movement (Lord said, In Jerusalem . . . name). Yea, it developed churches as numerous as the clergy desired (altars . . . host of heaven), both for the higher and the lower clergy (two courts . . . Lord). Moreover, it laid very much stress on the doctrine of eternal torment (son pass through the fire in the valley of. . . Hinnom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[wailing],</span><span class="font3"> 6; 6). It observed sectarian anniversaries, like the tercentenary anniversaries of the Lutheran and Zwinglian reformations, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Claus Harms at that Lutheran anniversary republished Luther's 95 theses with 95 very sectarian ones of his own (observed times). It advocated with too much emphasis ununderstandable doctrines, like the trinity, the God-man, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> that had a benumbing effect upon men's minds (used enchantments). It dealt in much Satanic error (witchcraft, ; 6) and had special dealings with the doctrine of the consciousness of the dead (familiar spirits) and with teachers of gross error (wizards), all of this resulting in much evil, unto enwrathing God against it (wickedness . . . Lord ... to anger), expressed in condign punishment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(39) Moreover, it set up as a creedal doctrine the theory and practice of the union of state and church (graven image of the grove; the idol. . . made, 7), which it set up in the Church (in the house of God), even in the true Church and God's real movements, which God had revealed to the Apostles and the Interim star-members that it should be the Church and the executorship of His choice from among the Gospel-Age nominal Israel (house . . . chosen . . . Israel), as that wherein He would set His character and honor (put my name for ever [for the Age]). Furthermore, God had pledged that He would not remove antitypical Israel from the sphere of the Truth, its Spirit and ministry bestowed upon their predecessors (make the feet of Israel move . . . land. . . fathers, 8; 8), on condition that they observed all His commands, precepts and arrangements (observe . . . all. . . commanded . . . law . . . statutes and the ordinances) which God gave by Jesus' hand (hand of Moses). The supernaturalistic movement (Manasseh, 9; 9) caused the consecrated and the supporters of the sphere of the executorship of God's more favored people to go astray in doctrine and practice more than the depraved dispositions of the leaders of former more favored movements of God's people had done (seduced. . . Judah. . . Jerusalem to err . . . worse than the heathen), which God had enabled His favored people to drive out of their minds, hearts and will (destroyed. . . Israel, 9; 9).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(40) God raised up servants who protested against such evils. Men like Neander, the great Church historian, &quot;the father of modem Church History&quot;; Tholuck, the pious Bible exponent and advocate of Christ-likeness; Hengstenberg, the exegete and enemy of all rationalistic advocates and higher criticism; Ullmann, the historian and apologist of Christ's sinlessness; Julius Mueller, who wrote against the sins of the times; Lange, the commentator and author of one of the ablest lives of Christ, and Domer, the opponent of the doctrine that this life ends probation, with many supporters, chastised the aberrations of the erring supernaturalists. Some of them chastised some of the involved evils of these; others of them chastised others of these evils, until the evils of antitypical Manasseh were all rebuked, and they did this as servants of the Lord (spake by his servants, 10;). They pointed out how evil supernaturalism had committed all these evils (Manasseh. . . abominations, 11;), sinning even worse than the earlier unconverted sinners (wickedly above. . . Amorites </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[highlanders] . . .</span><span class="font3"> before him), even leading God's more favored people to sin with their creeds (Judah. . . idols). In view of these evils God, as Israel's Covenant God, declared (thus saith the Lord, 12;) that He Would bring evil upon His more favored people and the sphere of their executorship (Jerusalem and Judah) in a way that would fully astound its hearers (heareth. . . ears shall tingle). God would treat it just as He had treated the sphere of executorship of His less favored people (stretch. . . Samaria </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[guard]</span><span class="font3"> 13;), judging it as He had judged Anglicalism in its various phases (plummet. . . Ahab </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[father's brother, i.e., paternal uncle]),</span><span class="font3"> making a thorough work of it and completely reversing its position (wiping it, and turning it upside down).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(41) He also said that He would forsake those spared from the destruction (forsake . . . inheritance, 14;), delivering them into the hands of Satan, their real enemy, and his cohorts (deliver . . . enemies), who would treat them as booty and plunder (a prey and spoil. . . enemies), and that because in matters pertaining to Him (in my sight, 15;) they had greatly sinned (done. . . evil), to the degree of enwrathing God (provoking me to anger), even as former unfaithful spiritual Israelites had done, after they had exercised repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus (fathers came forth out of Egypt), a course that had marked such throughout the Gospel Age up to the time of antitypical Manasseh (even unto this day). Moreover, various representatives of antitypical Manasseh had wickedly refuted and misled into apostasy harmless spiritual Israelites in great numbers (shed much innocent blood, 16;) everywhere in its sphere of executorship (Jerusalem from one end to another), and that in addition to its evils before mentioned against the Lord's more favored people (beside his sin. . . to sin. . . evil) in matters pertaining to the Lord (sight of the Lord). Despite God's many remonstrances against the course of the unfaithful supernaturalistic leaders and their adherents; they would not give obedience to His rebukes and warnings (Lord spake . . . people, ; 10), but continued on in their evils, so disobedient were they (would not hearken).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(42) Their impenitence provoked the Lord to bring retribution upon the earlier supernaturalistic leaders and leadings, especially upon the former (Lord brought upon them,; 11); for He allowed the historico-critical critical rationalists, led by De Wette, the higher critics of the Tuebingen school, led by F.C. Baur, the rationalistic supernaturalists, whose leader was Baumgarten-Curtius, and who put reason and the Bible on a par as sources of faith and practice, speculative dogmaticians, whose leader was Daub, professor at Heidelberg, and outright infidelism, whose leader was D.F. Strauss, with numerous followers, to make at Satan's charge inroads on the first phase of the supernaturalists (captains of the host . . Assyria) and by their sharp theories (among the thorns [literally, with a ring, i.e., through the lip—subdued and controlled their teachings]) to take captive the first phase of supernaturalism and with their errors to restrain their activities and conduct (bound him with fetters), e.g., Schleiermacher was by these moved to deny inspiration to certain Biblical books, to be infected with pantheism, to endorse the union of Lutheranism and Calvinism and the union of state and church and to dabble in politics. Other leaders of the earlier supernaturalism followed him in these matters. These all became captives in Babylon, i.e., servants of Satan in the nominal church (carried him to Babylon). In this captivity they were greatly afflicted (in affliction, ; 12) by the various forms or schools of error mentioned above. And by these afflictions they were brought to repentance and sought the Lord, beseeching Him to forgive and reinstate them into His favor as the leaders of His more favored people (besought the Lord). Deeply did they humble themselves as to the Lord's matters (humbled themselves greatly before the Lord). Their prayers were intense, expressed in their hard labors to regain the lost Truth and to make further advances in the unfolding Truth and in spreading it (prayed unto him, ; 13). The God of all grace and mercy was appeased toward them (entreated of him) and graciously favored them with forgiveness (heard his supplication) and restoration to the office of supernaturalism in an executorship capacity (brought him to Jerusalem</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">into his kingdom). Among the Apocryphal books is one alleged to be the prayer of Manasseh; but it is unnecessary for us to enter into an exposure of its fraudulent character. These experiences taught the supernaturalists to have a right appreciation of God so far as it was then due for them to have it (knew ... he was God).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(43) Now came the time for the true supernaturalists to function in their office as such, which in the type is represented by Manasseh's reformatory works; for now Neander, whose motto was, &quot;It is the heart that makes a theologian,&quot; Tholuck, Hengstenberg, Ullmann, Miller, Lange, Domer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> came forward into battle for the supernatural nature of the Bible and its teachings, though it was not yet due to see the Truth thereon as in the Parousia and Epiphany. They erected strong defenses for the genuineness of the Apostolic and Gospel histories and writings. Neander did this in his life of Jesus and history of the Apostles, especially against Strauss' and Baur's heresies thereon. Tholuck did this in a genuine representation of Jesus' character against those who alleged Him to have been a sinful man. Ullmann did the same very effectively in his book on the sinlessness of Jesus, which also dealt a deathblow to the denial of His virgin birth. Hengstenberg did magnificent work in his defense of the books of the Pentateuch, Psalms, Daniel and Zechariah and Jesus' Messiahship, against the first school of higher critics. Miller overthrew the superficial views of sin and man's ability without the Savior to overcome it. Lange followed the fines of all of these in his life of Jesus and Bible Commentary; and Dorner gave a hard blow to the doctrine of eternal torment and no future probation. And they made these strong defenses for the Old and New Testament truths as far as then due, by many secular facts and histories, and thereby defended the position of Jesus and the Apostles (built a wall without. . . David, ; 14) on Old Testament history and Truth and practice (west side of Gihon), making them intelligible to the pastors and teachers (fish gate). They insisted on the leadership and rulership of our Lord as to executory matters (Ophel). They exalted to a high degree these powers of the sphere of executorship (very great height) and appointed controversial leaders of their own mind in the various denominations where they had influence (put captains . . . fenced cities of Judah). They set aside the idols of sin and error (strange gods, ; 15), repudiated the doctrine of union of state and church (the idol. . . house of the Lord [compare with 2 Kings 21: 7]) and repudiated the sectarian churches as the true church in favor of the Church invisible, the former of which the first phase of supernaturalism had erected as the true Church in the sphere of its executorship (mount. . . Jerusalem), and allowed them no more to remain in the sphere of its executorship (cast. . . city). These and other Biblical scholars dealt to higher criticism of the New Testament a death-blow and certainly caused the disintegration of the Tuebingen school in its rejection of New Testament books, e.g., Baur rejected all the New Testament books, except Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians and Revelation, claiming of the others that they fraudulently originated after the middle of the second century—a real higher critic.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(44) These true supernaturalists refuted the idea that the nominal church, which they called the visible church, was the real Church and proved unanswerably that the true Church consisted of the faithful only, regardless of the denominations where they were; and this true Church especially Neander, who swayed more influence for good over theologians and pastors than any other theological professor since the days of Luther and Melanchthon, emphatically stressed; and he and Tholuck exerted themselves to the utmost to bring their students to repentance, faith and consecration, their pertinent labors therein being blessed by God; and to this day their writings are edifying (repaired the altar of the Lord, ; 16). They ministered character</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">development to the faithful, encouraging them to carry out their consecration. They brought literally thousands to justification and consecration (sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings) and encouraged God's more favored people to serve the Lord in spreading and living the then due Truth; and in this they were ably supported by their brethren named in the preceding paragraph (Judah to serve . . . Israel). But we are not to understand that they made saints of all in Germany, for many of those who sympathized with the teachings and works of the supernaturalists still continued to remain in the denominations and to serve there (the people did sacrifice still in the high places, ; 17), intending it as a service of God (unto God only), which proves that they did not take part in the Second Advent movement, led in America by Win. Miller, in Europe by the celebrated missionary Wolff, whose work extended into Asia, and in the work of the cleansed sanctuary. Thus we see that the supernaturalist movement was not a Little Flock movement, but was one led mainly by crown-losers. In its good part its conflicts correspond to Saul's and Jonathan's victory over the Philistines, as previously shown in this book in the Chapter on Samuel and Saul.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(45) Many other things in vindication of the Bible that the good supernaturalists did, also those that the evil supernaturalists did, with their many wrongs, are written in the works of Church historians, like Nippold, Kurtz, Sheldon, Newman, Hagenbach, Dryer, Baum-Geyer, Fisher (rest. . . Manasseh ... his sin .. . kings of Judah . . . Israel, 17; 18). Their repentance and prayer are likewise set forth by the more favored people's Church historians, some of whom were just mentioned (prayer unto God, ; 18); and the protestations made against their evils by men like Neander, Tholuck, Ullmann, Lange, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> are also thus set forth (the words of the seers . . . name of the Lord, ;18). These are described by other preachers and writers of repentance (book of the kings of Israel, ; 18).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">These gave details as to their penitential confessions and labors (prayer, ; 19), on how God was appeased toward them, with an unambiguous description of their wrongs and transgressions (sins, and his trespass, ; 19), of their support of sects (built high places) and work for union of state and church (set up groves) and advocacy of creeds (graven image) in the first phase of their activity before their repentance (before he was humbled, ; 19). These are all found among the sayings and writings of preachers and writers of repentance (written among the sayings of the seers, ; 19). This movement, like its predecessors among God's more favored people, ceased being the chief movement among God's more favored people, and that in 1860 (slept with his fathers, 18; 20). They have been held in respect for their strong fruitfulness in their sphere of service (garden of Uzza </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[strength]</span><span class="font3"> ... in his own house, 18; 20). And the movement was succeeded by the Y. M. C. A. and other young people's movements (Amon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[builder]</span><span class="font3"> his son reigned in his stead, 18; 20).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(46) The Y.M.C.A. movement became the ascendant movement in 1860. As an ideal it arose in the mind and practice of Sir George Williams in 1838, in Bridgewater, England, where he became deeply imbued with a religious spirit 22 years before the movement became the ascendant one among God's more favored people (Amon was twenty and two years ... to reign, 19; 21). It remained such a movement for two years, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> from 1860 until 1862 (reigned two years [the parallel years were 661-659 B.C.]), in executorship (in Jerusalem, 19; 21). Sir George Williams founded the first Y.M.C.A: in 1844, in London, making his fellow trade employees members of it. The movement spread to young men of other trades, first in different parts of London, then it spread over Britain, Ireland, Australia, India, France, Switzerland and other parts of Europe. It also spread to America, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> first at Boston, 1851, text at New York, 1852.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Its full members, who alone had the right to vote and hold office, had to profess faith in Christ as Savior and Lord and belong to an evangelical church; but later associate members were accepted without professing faith in Christ as Savior and Lord or membership in an evangelical church. It established reading rooms, libraries, gymnasiums, athletic rooms and fields, educational and lecture courses, religious meetings and Bible classes, boarding houses, dormitories, employment bureaus and special workers to visit the sick, hold religious services in shops, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> But it was not long until the associate members thoroughly secularized the Y.M.C.A. By April, 1860, it had in North America, 203 associations and about 25,000 members. Its members, full and associate, took a prominent part in the American Civil War for the help of the soldiers on both sides, ever becoming more and more secular. And in America and various other countries it in a unionistic manner affiliated with all Protestant Churches and absorbed or countenanced their evils. Its developing thought was carefully by goodness to cultivate friendship among its members and the so-called Evangelical Churches (his mother's name was Meshullemeth </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[friend\,</span><span class="font3"> Haruz </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[careful], </span><span class="font3">Jotbah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[goodness],</span><span class="font3"> 19;), but by its secularization and the various evils in the sects to which it required its full members to belong, it became the aider and abettor of all their evils (did. . . evil, 20; 22) in matters pertaining to the Lord (sight of the Lord), even in the same ways as the first or bad form of the supernaturalists did (as did Manasseh, 20; 22). It became guilty of all such sins, because of its own secularization and the evils of the sects, membership in which it required of its full members (walked ... his father walked, 21;), serving in these sects their creeds (sacrificed. . . carved image. . . father had made, and served them,; 22) and yielding itself to all the evil qualities of the bad supernaturalists (idols that his father served, 21;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(47) However, unlike the good supernaturalists, it did not repent of its evils and turn to good (humbled not himself; 23) in matters pertaining to the Lord (before the Lord), after the example of the good supernaturalists (as Manasseh. . . humbled himself. ; 23). It apostatized from the principles of the Lord's Word (forsook the Lord God of his fathers, 22;), and did not direct its steps in the teachings of God's Word (walked not in the way of the Lord, 22;), but continued to increase in violations of the Lord's Word (trespassed more and more, ; 23.), e.g., when part of its members supported the Confederate army and part of them supported the Union army, thus encouraging the soldiers of each side to fight against the other in fratricidal conflict, it greatly increased its trespasses. Doubtless some of their members, like D. L. Moody, did not pursue this course in each army, but the bulk of them did. Some of them consulted together, not only as respects its course as to the Civil War, but also as respects its general course of siding with the so-called Evangelical sects and thus partaking of their evils, agitated against it in its evil policies and refuted them (his servants conspired against him . . . slew the king, 23; 24) as it was engaged in these spheres of its activities (in his own house). But such a consultation and refutation was abhorrent to the common people (people of the land, 24; 25) and even the general run of the Y.M.C.A.'s full and associate members, and they vehemently disapproved such consultation and refutation and in turn refuted these in their course and secured their dismissal from the Association (slew all. . . conspired against king Amon). Such common people made the evangelistic movement the ascendant one among God's more favored people (people . . . made Josiah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah heals,</span><span class="font3"> his son king in his stead, 24; 25). Other acts of the Y.M.C.A. are recorded in histories and encyclopedias of the more favored movements of God's people (rest of the acts . . . chronicles . . . Judah, 25;). After the Y.M.C.A. ceased to be the more favored ascendant movement, it</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">was given respectful treatment in the strong (Uzza) sphere of its fruitfulness (in the garden, 25;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(48) The Evangelistic movement had as its earthly leader Bro. D.L. Moody (1837-1899), one of the greatest evangelists of the entire Gospel Age. Indeed, in its various features as typed by Josiah, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Jehovah heals,</span><span class="font3"> in the Scriptures cited above under our subject, he was always its leading spirit. He was undoubtedly a consecrated brother of tireless zeal, full of good works and of practical common sense. Like our Pastor and the great Spurgeon of London, he was a self-educated man, having only a common school education, with no college or university diploma. The poverty of his widowed mother, who, when he was only four years old (1841) was widowed, gave him little chance for secular education. For years after he had become the world's greatest living evangelist his speech was quite ungrammatical and his bodily carriage quite clumsy. He consecrated at 17 years of age, in 1854, at Boston, whither he had but recently gone for work from his farm home near Northfield, Mass, (eight years old, 2K. 22: 1; 2C. 34: 1). So uncouth were his language and manners that, despite his evident earnestness, it was said that some of the cultured in the church counseled him to be silent in the testimony meetings. Some doubt is cast on this having been done to him in Boston, but it certainly was done to him in Chicago. It was undoubtedly due to his lack of culture that his request to become a member of the old Mount Vernon Congregational Church at Boston was denied, when it was first made; but it was granted a year later, after he had undergone instruction at the hands of the church's pastor and elders. And seven years later, in 1862, he began that course in his career which made the evangelistic movement the ascendant one in Christendom, and that in the Union army as a representative of the Y.M.C.A., in which he worked after his removal to Chicago from Boston in 1856. And unlike most Y.M.C.A. representatives in the Union and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Confederate armies, he attended strictly to his evangelistic work coupled with his merciful relief of wounded soldiers. Thus it was in the outstart of his army service in 1862 that he began his work of leading the evangelistic movement, which he did for 31 years (reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem, 1; 1). The Parallel years were April 659—April 628 B.C. and April 1862—April 1893 A.D, ; and the evangelistic movement was developed by the thoughts that God and His people loved it (Jedidah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[beloved],</span><span class="font3"> 1;) and that God adorned it with needed knowledge and grace (Adaiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[adorned by Jehovah],</span><span class="font3"> 1; ).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(49) The evangelistic movement was one of the most righteous movements of God's more favored people (did . . . right, 2; 2) in its relations to God (in the sight of the Lord, 2; 2) and followed strictly the evangelistic course of the Apostles (walked. . . David 2; 2) as its ancestors (father, 2; 2). It avoided a too conservative (turned not. . . right) and a too liberal course (left, 2; 2). This evangelistic movement was first active in Chicago and in the far-flung vicinity of Chicago. It started in real earnest in the Spring of 1869, while it was yet quite undeveloped (eighth year . . . while yet young, ; 3), at an Illinois county Sunday School convention, where Bro. Moody preached a fervent sermon, after which he announced that an inquiry meeting would be held in the town school house, which became crowded with inquiries, and the meetings, continuing a week, made many converts. From this small beginning the evangelistic movement started out conquering and to conquer. It actually went into high gear along Apostolic lines in 1870. This occurred in Bro. Ira D. Sankey's accepting Bro. Moody's invitation to become his colaborer, the latter to do the evangelistic work by preaching, and the former to do the evangelistic work by singing, for Bro. Sankey had a wonderfully sympathetic baritone voice of great sweetness and power. It was the union of these two consecrated brothers that increased the evangelistic</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">movement to serve the Lord in great heartiness along Apostolic lines (to seek after the God of David his father, ; 3). These two true yokefellows labored together in Chicago and vicinity with great evangelistic success. In 1873 Bro. Moody, who had twice before visited Britain, decided in response to several pastoral invitations to wage an aggressive evangelistic campaign in England, Scotland and Ireland, declaring that he would by God's help make 10,000 converts there. Accordingly, he and Bro. Sankey left the U.S. for England, arriving there in September, 1873 (twelfth year—April 1873—April 1874, ;) and for two years did an evangelistic work almost without an equal up to that time since the days of the Apostles (in the twelfth year, ; 3). Only the great revival movement led by the two Wesleys and Whitefield in the 18th century exceeded it in magnitude (23: 22; 35: 18).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(50) Bro. Moody did not mince words and acts in his denunciation of sin and error, neither in America nor among his associates in executive matters (Judah and Jerusalem, ; 3), where he denounced denominationalism (high places), the illicit unions of the (nominal) church and the world (groves), false doctrine (carved image) and creedism (molten image). He utterly refuted power-grasping and lording churches (brake down the altars of Baalim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[lords],</span><span class="font3"> ; 4) that were before him (in his presence); and the creeds that were exalted over these churches (the image . . . above them) he utterly undermined (cut down); and the above-mentioned unions (groves), false doctrines (carved image) and creedisms (molten image) he by Scripture, reason and facts pulverized (brake . . . dust) and dishonored by these the memories of those who served them (showed. . . graves . . . sacrificed unto them). The evangelistic movement thus destroyed the relics of their leaders (burnt the bones . . . altars, ; 5) in their churches, and so did it cleanse the more favored people's sphere in America (Judah) and their sphere of executorship (Jerusalem). This it also did</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">among the churches of Scotland (Manasseh, ; 6), England (Ephraim), Wales (Simeon) and Protestant Ireland (Naphtali); for two years (1873-1875) Bros. Moody and Sankey labored in these lands, converting approximately 50,000 people, infusing a more spiritual life among the consecrated, reforming sinners, including thousands of drunkards, unto justification, and undermining with strong refutative Biblical arguments the above-mentioned evils (with their mattocks round about). Its work was done in all the large dries of Britain and Ireland; sometimes its audiences numbered 25,000, e.g., at London. It was only after it had waged such campaigns in all the large cities of these countries, and had done its work of decimating (had broken down, ; 7) in the minds of multitudes the false churches (altars) and unions of the (nominal) church and the world (groves) and had pulverized false doctrines (graven image into powder) and overthrown sin and error (cut down the idols) throughout Great Britain and Ireland (throughout. . . Israel), that it in the persons of Bros. Moody and Sankey returned to its sphere of executorship in America (returned to Jerusalem).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(51) Between April 1879 and April 1880 (eighteenth year, 3; 8), after it had well nigh finished its fight against evil (purged the land, ; 8) under the lead of Bro. Moody, the evangelistic movement started a series of educational movements that had as its heart to inculcate knowledge of the Bible as the great educator of Christians. This was started by the founding of a seminary for the training of young women at Northfield, Mass., not only in secular, but especially in Bible knowledge, through believing directors and teachers (Shaphan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[rabbit,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the secular studies that they taught]; Azaliah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[near Jehovah,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the Biblical knowledge that they taught]; Meshullam </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[friend,</span><span class="font3"> these directors and teachers were friendly to the objects of the school], 3; 8). This educational movement was intended to build up Christianity after the ideals of Bro. Moody, and it sought to enlist into its help the leading crown-losers of America (go up to Hilkiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[portion of Jehovah,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to their relation to God], 4: 9). A little later, 1881, Bro. Moody founded the Mt. Hermon School for young men, whose teachers and directors, of like mind to those of the Northfield Seminary, were as such more influential than the first set and were by the movement sent to enlist into its help the same leading crown-losers of America (Maaseiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[work o f Jehovah]</span><span class="font3"> the governor of the city, ; 8). Still later it by Bro. Moody founded, at Chicago the Moody Bible Institute for home and foreign missions. Its teachers and directors (Joah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah's brother,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the consecrated character of its teachers and directors]; Joahaz </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah possesses], ; </span><span class="font3">8) also were sent to enlist the support of the leading crownlosers in America, and to help them apply Bible teachings to the development of the church as they saw it (to repair the house . . . God), requesting them to sum up the Bible teachings of this movement given the Lord's people (sum the silver . . . house of the Lord, 4;). These truths had been gathered together by those minor leaders who introduced people into the temple's court (keepers . . . gathered, 4;), especially those gotten from Bros. Moody's and Sankey's Scotch and English, Irish and Welsh visit in 1873-1875 (hand of Manasseh and Ephraim . . . remnant of Israel, ; 9), as well as from America and Canada (Judah and Benjamin), after which they went to their sphere of executorship (Jerusalem,; 9).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(52) Such truths they were to deliver, first, to those in charge of the work of repairing the house of God (deliver . . . doers . . . oversight of the house ... to repair . . . house, 5; ; Put it in the hand. . . oversight of the house, ; 10) and, secondly, to those working under their charge (gave . . . workmen... in the house ... to repair and amend, 5; 10). Some of these wrought in justification matters (carpenters, 6;), some on putting brethren in their proper place (builders, 6;)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and some on developing new creatures (masons, 6;), who by their labors and truths were to acquire justified ones (buy timber, 6; 11) and Spirit-begotten ones (hewn stones, 6; 11), so as to make good repairs on God's house (repair the house, 6;). Such chargees gave these truths to the workers in justified matters (artificers, ; 11) and to those who wrought on the developers of justified and sanctified ones (builders, ; 11), the justified ones being intended to serve as connecters for the consecrated (couplings, ; 11) and to give a firm footing for the worshipers, which certain movements had undone (to floor. . . destroyed, ; 11). So faithfully did the colaborers work that they were not creedbound in their teachings (no reckoning . . . money . . . dealt faithfully, 12). Bible (Jahath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[united],</span><span class="font3"> ; 12) and other religious book publishers (Obadiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[servant of God\) </span><span class="font3">superintended the publishing work (Merari, ; 12), while Bible expounders (Zechariah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[rememberancers of Jehovah])</span><span class="font3"> and historians (Meshullam </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[friendf)</span><span class="font3"> as scholars (Kohathites) used their offices to prosper the cause (set it forward, ; 12). Additionally, those who could defiver discourses rendered help (Levites . . . skill. . . musick, ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">12). These presided over the work of lowlier helpers (over bearers of burdens, ; 13). In fact, these were superintendents of all who served in any capacity (overseers . . . wrought. . . service). Moreover, of the less prominent workers (Levites) some were scholars (scribes), some superintendents (officers) and some those who led people to justification (porters,; 13).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(53) As the chargees were dispensing the truths that were brought to the justified and consecrated (brought out the money . . . house of the Lord, ; 14) the chief crown-losers (Hilkiah) found the Bible given by Christ to be a neglected and disobeyed book (found . . . law . . . Moses,; 14). These, first of all, brought the Bible to the attention of the teachers and directors of the Northfield Seminary (said unto Shaphan the scribe, 8; 15), declaring that they had found it neglected and disobeyed in God's house (found. . . law. . . Lord); and they put it into the hands of these teachers and directors (gave . . . delivered to Shaphan, 8; 15). These made a study and interpretation of it (read it, 8;). These brought this neglected and disobeyed book to the attention of the entire evangelistic movement (came to the king; carried the book to the king, 9; 16). They reported that all the teachers and directors of the three institutions had done as charged and were delivering their truths found among God's people (gathered the money. . . house; all committed. . . they do, 9; 16) to the superintending colaborers and their helpers (delivered ... do the work, 9; 17). Thereupon the teachers and directors of the Northfield Seminary reported to the evangelistic movement that the leading crown-losers had delivered to them the Bible as a book long lost beneath the traditions of men and as recently rediscovered (Shaphan shewed the king . . . delivered me a book, 10; 18). The study of the Bible and its interpretation by the teachers and directors of the Northfield Seminary was by them presented to the evangelistic movement (Shaphan read. . . king). The effect was greatly to sadden the evangelistic movement into deep repentance at the prevalent non-use and non-practice of the Bible (king had heard. . . rent his clothes, 11; 19). And this movement urged the crown-lost leaders, who usually met at the annual summer conference at Northfield (Hilkiah, 12; 20), the Student Volunteer leaders, who also met annually in the summer conference at Northfield (Ahikam </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[my brother stands}),</span><span class="font3"> the teachers of the Mt. Hermon school (Abdon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[servile},</span><span class="font3"> Micah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[godlike],</span><span class="font3"> 12; 20), both the teachers and directors of the Northfield Seminary (Shaphan the scribe) and the teachers of the Chicago Moody Institute for home and foreign missionaries (Asaiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[whom the Lord made})</span><span class="font3"> to make diligent search of the Lord's will pertinent to the gross neglect of the Bible on its and the people's behalf (enquire ... for me . . . people . . . Judah. . . left in Israel, 13; 21);</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">for it feared that God's displeasure thereover was very great (great is the wrath. . . kindled. . . poured out), since the people's predecessors had not faithfully obeyed the Word (our fathers have not hearkened. . . kept the word) as it was written in the Bible (to do according . . . written, 13; 21).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(54) These five groups (Hilkiah . . . Asahiah; they that the king had appointed, 14; 22) made diligent search in the teachings of foolish-virgin students of prophecy (went unto Huldah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[weasel]</span><span class="font3"> the prophetess), who made special study of the Day of Vengeance passage (wife of Shallum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[revenge]),</span><span class="font3"> in, which they hoped for a better, day, the Millennium (Tikvah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[hope]),</span><span class="font3"> but were poor in the knowledge of the Truth (Harhas [poor]), though they diligently had, as their charge, the graces (keeper of the wardrobe). This group of foolish-virgin students was highly placed in the sphere of the executorship of God's more favoredpeople (dwelt... in the college). These messengers of the evangelistic movement diligently studied the views of these foolish-virgin students of prophecy (communed with. . . spake to her to that effect, 14; 22). The latter declared to the former their understanding of the Lord's mind on the pertinent matter (she . . . Thus saith the Lord, 15; 23) to be told their sender (Tell the man that sent you to me). Men like A. T. Pearson, F. B. Meyer, Joseph Seiss, A. J. Gordon, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> spoke and wrote a great deal on the Day of Vengeance. These were a part of antitypical Huldah, but their erroneous views on most of the matters as to the end of this Age are indicated in the meaning of Huldah (weasel, an unclean animal). However, they understood that the great tribulation, as being the trouble of the Day of Vengeance, was not far off. These informed the messengers by their writings and addresses that God was going to overthrow Christendom (I will bring evil. . . inhabitants thereof, 16; 24), according to the Bible's teachings (even all the words; curses. . . in the book), even as the evangelistic movement had heard</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">explained (king. . . read, 16; 24). This was to come because God's nominal people had proven untrue to God (forsaken me, 17; 25), had used their human all in the service of sin, error, selfishness and worldliness (incense unto other gods), to the end that they enwrathed God, against them (provoke me to anger) with their evil deeds (works of their hands). For this reason God's wrath was aroused against His nominal people and their sphere of executorship (kindled; poured out) and would not cease until it had done away with them as such (not be quenched, 17; 25).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(55) But these foolish-virgin students of prophecy had a word of comfort for the evangelistic movement, which sent the inquirers to them (king . . . enquire . . . thus shall ye say to him, 18; 26), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">viz.,</span><span class="font3"> that the Bible indicated (Thus saith the Lord) as to the teaching that it had heard (words . . . heard) that its conscience was tender (heart was tender, 19; 27) and its disposition humble (hast humbled thyself) on hearing God's pertinent Word (heardest. . . against this place . . . inhabitants thereof), that they should be desolated and accursed (desolation and a curse), on account of which it abased itself, lost its spirit of joy and exercised heart's grief (humbledest. . . rent thy clothes and wept, 19; 27), hence God regarded it with favor (heard thee). These foolish-virgin students of prophecy forecast that the Lord would bring the evangelistic movement as the ascendant one to an end before the great tribulation would destroy Christendom and the sphere of its executorship and that that movement would prosper to the end of its ascendancy (gather thee ... in peace, 20; 28), that its end would be in respect (grave) and that it would not experience the forecast punishment upon Christendom and its sphere of executorship (eyes shall not see all the evil. . . this place) and upon all the supporters of that sphere (inhabitants of the same, ; 28). This message those sent to inquire thereover brought back to the evangelistic movement (brought. . . again, 20; 28). The seriousness</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of this situation very greatly impressed the evangelistic movement, especially its leader, Bro. Moody, and it gathered all the leaders of God's more favored people and of the sphere of its executorship (gathered. . . elders of Judah and of Jerusalem, 23: 1; 29). The movement and all the stronger ones of God's more favored people and all leaders of its sphere of executorship went among God's people (king . . . house . . . men of Judah. . . Jerusalem, 2; 30), together with the main and subordinate leaders, its preachers and all its great and small supporters (priests, and the prophets . . . Levites . . . people. . . both great and small). To these this movement expounded the Bible's teachings newly discovered, but long neglected respecting consecration (read . . . words . . . covenant which was found. . . Lord).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(56) Thereupon the evangelistic movement, Bro. Moody leading therein, in its office as such (king stood by a pillar ... in his place, 3; 31) solemnly vowed to keep the covenant of sacrifice (made a covenant) in matters of the Lord (before the Lord), to keep His teachings in harmony with the Bible's types and rules of practice (commandments. . . statutes) wholeheartedly and wholesouledly (heart. . . soul) and to carry out their consecrations according to the Bible (covenant. . . book). The movement did this work in evangelistic meetings held in churches, workshops, Y.M.C.A. buildings, large auditoriums, in meetings for the Student Volunteer Movement held in colleges and at special annual gatherings of students' conferences and Christian Workers' conferences at Northfield and in the three above-mentioned educational institutions founded by Bro. Moody—all this being done under Bro. Moody's direction. By these and personal effort means this movement aroused an exceptionally large number of people to consecration. Our readers will remember that our Pastor wrote that it was through the Moody evangelistic movement that the Lord called large numbers to consecration, thereby</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">completing provisionally the fulness of the Gentiles by 1878 and 1881, the work taking place in the U. S. and Canada (caused all ... in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it; stood to the covenant, 3; 32). Especially did the supporters of the sphere of its executorship take the matter of consecration very deeply to heart and life (inhabitants of Jerusalem . . . covenant. . . God of their fathers, ; 32). Not only so, but the movement charged the chief crown-lost leaders and second degree prominent leaders (commanded Hilkiah . . . priests of the second order, 4;) and evangelists (keepers of the door) to put away from God's people (out of the temple) all power-grasping and lording teachings (vessels ... for Baal) and those on the union of the church with the world (for the grove) and those in the interests of a clergy class (host of heaven).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(57) By its teachings it decimated these outside of the supporters of its sphere of executorship (burned them without Jerusalem) in the condition of human corruption, where they belonged (fields of Kidron </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[turbidf),</span><span class="font3"> and showed that the memories of them belonged to the evils of sectarianism (ashes . . . Bethel [ (counterfeit) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of Goclf</span><span class="font3"> 4;). It denounced as officeless the power-grasping riches, ease and luxury loving clergy (put down the idolatrous priests, 5;) whom evil movements among God's more favored people had established to use their choice human powers to serve sectarian churches among God's more favored people and their supporters in executorship (whom kings of Judah. . . burn. . . high places: . . Judah. . . about Jerusalem), also those who served powergraspers and lords over God's heritage (Baal), the papacy ( [counterfeit] sun), sectarian Protestantism ([counterfeit] moon), the denominations (planets) and the clergy (host of heaven, 5;). It cast out from God's people, outside the sphere of its executorship, the theory and practice of the union of the church and the world (brought out the grove . . . without Jerusalem, 6;)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and assigned them to the condition of depravity and death (unto the brook Kidron). So set forth, it was utterly overthrown from the Word by the evangelistic movement (burned it. . . Kidron) grinding it to dust (stamped it small to powder) and assigning it to death and corruption as being of the Adamic curse (cast. . . graves . . . people). It utterly refuted the efforts of the antichrist systems (Sodomites) to become one in united effort with those which claimed to be related to the church (by the house of the Lord, 7); for in the service of such the churches made instruments of hiding the abominations of the union of the church and the world (women wove hangings for the grove). By its preaching it exposed publicly the leaders of the nominal church's sects (brought out. . . cities of Judah) and proved the churches where such leaders served to be defiled (defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense), which it did throughout the sphere of God's more favored people from the nominal kingdom (Geba </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[hill],</span><span class="font3"> 8;) even to the defiled new creatures who yet were in the teachings of the covenant (Beer-sheba </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[well of the oath]).</span><span class="font3"> It also refuted in churches that publicly sought an entrance into the sphere of politics (high places . . entering . . . Joshua the governor of the city) a union of church and world. Such churches stood in error and weakness as to how entrance was gotten into the sphere of executorship of God's more favored people (left hand at the gate of the city). The nominal-church leaders (priests of the high places, 9;) exercised no real ministry for the Lord (not up to the altar) in the sphere of executorship for God's more favored people (Lord in Jerusalem).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(58) These, nevertheless, partook of a measure of sincerity and Truth with those of minds tike theirs (eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren, 9;). While Bro. Moody early in his career as an evangelist used the eternal torment theory to drive frightened sinners to repentance, during most of his career</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">as such he stressed the love of God and the death of Christ as its main manifestation to work in his hearers repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus, and thereby set forth eternal torment as a defiled thing (defiled Topheth </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[place of burning],</span><span class="font3"> 10;), which was the theory of those who taught eternal wailing (valley of the children of Hirmom [w</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ailing]),</span><span class="font3"> and that to the end that no one should teach that their own were doomed to eternal torment (no man . . . son or his daughter) to pass through the fire to Molech </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(king </span><span class="font3">[error]). Moreover, it set aside the doctrines (took away the horses, 11;) that certain movements of God's more favored people had supported, favored by the papacy, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> the mass, transubstantiation, auricular confession, selfatonement, justification by works (kings... to the [counterfeit] sun), which were alleged to be the means of entering into relations with God (entering in ... the Lord) by the office (chamber) of the Romish priest as the alleged gift of the king (Nathan-melech </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[gift of the king]),</span><span class="font3"> whose work was to give alleged rest to their penitents and followers (chamberlain) and which were outside of the sphere of executorship of God's more favored people (suburbs), and it completely destroyed as of Biblical sanction the organizations of the papacy (burned. . . [counterfeit] sun with fire). Also the churches that were in the height of the higher office that the corrupt Methodist movement (altars . . chamber of Ahaz, 12;) had made by movements of God's more favored people (kings of Judah had made) and the churches that the evil supernaturalist movement had made (Manasseh) for the nominal professors of Christianity and for the justified (two courts . . . Lord) it overthrew as unbiblical (the king beat down) and displaced them therefrom (brake . . . thence) and set forth their remembrances as being corrupt and dead (dust. . . brook Kidron). The Romish churches (high places, 13;) which faced the sphere of executorship of God's more favored people (before Jerusalem), and which were in favor of the corrupt kingdom of the papacy (right. . . mount of corruption), which the papacy (Solomon) had erected for the illicit union of state and church (Ashtoreth [.star </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Penas])</span><span class="font3"> as the abomination of traffickers in religion, business and politics (Zidonians [/Ls/zens]), and for the Romanist hierarchy (Chemosh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[subduer])</span><span class="font3"> as the abomination of the autocrats (Moabites) and for eternal torment (Milcom, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">king</span><span class="font3"> [error]), the abomination of sectarian Protestantism (abomination. . . Ammon </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[tom </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">of my people]),</span><span class="font3"> did the evangelistic movement prove Biblically to be vile and defiled (did the king defile).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(59) It utterly refuted creedisms (brake in pieces the image, 14;) as objects of worship, undermined Biblically the union of the church and the world (cut down the groves), and defiled them with the proof of their coming from the Adamic corruption (filled. . . bones of men). Moreover, the church of many sects (altar at Bethel [(counterfeit) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">house of God],</span><span class="font3"> 15;) that the Lutherans introduced (high place which Jeroboam </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[strife of the people] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Nebat [view] . . . had made), the misleader of Protestantism (made Israel to sin), even both the Lutheran Church and its sects the evangelistic movement refuted (he brake down), utterly overthrowing the sects (burned the high place), and pulverized its position (stamped it small to powder) and overthrew its union with the world, especially with the state in Europe (burned the grove). Turning its attention to its history (turned himself, 16;) and perceiving the respect given its misleaders in Europe (spied the sepulchres . . . mount), it charged those acquainted with its history to show disrespect to the memory of these misleaders (took the bones out) and blasted the memory and reputation of them in their church (burned them upon the altar) and rightly held it up as a polluted thing (polluted it), according to the teachings of Martin Bucer of Strassburg, whom God had sent from the Zwinglian movement to undo Lutheran sectarianism, denouncing its evils and sects</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and stressing them as enemies of the Church (word of the Lord . . . proclaimed . . . proclaimed these words).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(60) As it considered the memories of those who had more or less to do with making Lutheranism sectarian, it came across the memory of Martin Bucer and asked after his character and acts (What title is that that I see?, 17); and the leading sectarian Lutheran leaders (the men of the city) answered it that that was the memory of Martin Bucer, a servant of God, who came from the Zwinglian movement and forecast the acts that would be done against Lutheran sectarianism (sepulchre . . . which came out of Judah) and forecast the things that the evangelistic movement had done against that sectarian church as the counterfeit house of God (proclaimed. . . thou hast done . . . Bethel). It left undisturbed and unpolluted the memory of Martin Bucer and charged others to do the same (let him alone; let no man move his bones, 18;), which charge was fulfilled (let his bones alone); and they left undisturbed the memories and refutations of those Lutheran leaders who desired fellowship with Marrin Bucer (with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[guard\).</span><span class="font3"> But it refuted all of the Lutheran bodies that maintained the Lutheran sects in its sectarianism (all the houses . . . places . . . cities of Samaria, 19;), even those that the movements of God's less favored people had raised up unto provoking the Lord (which the kings of Israel had made... to anger), according to their deeds in sectarianism, a counterfeit church (did. . . acts . . . Bethel). And the leaders of these sects it refuted in their own churches (slew all the priests . . . places . . . upon the altars, 20;) and destroyed the reverenced memories of the leaders in their churches (burned men's bones upon them). Then it betook itself to its sphere of the executorship of God's more favored people (returned to Jerusalem). Moreover, those who dealt with the fallen angels (workers with familiar spirits, 24;) false teachers (wizards), creeds (image) and sin, selfishness and worldliness (idols) and every other thing abhorrent to God and His faithful people wherever they showed themselves (abominations that were spied) in the sphere of God's more favored people and of its executorship (in. . . Judah and in Jerusalem) the evangelistic movement put away, that it might fulfill the Word of God (perform ... the law . . . book . . . priest found... of the Lord). Not only did it do this in its own sphere, but also in all the spheres of God's people (took away all of the abominations . . . countries ... of Israel, ; 33) and persuaded all in these spheres to serve God (present. . . serve the Lord their God); and during the time of the evangelistic movement's ascendancy these ceased not to serve Jehovah, as their fathers' God (all his days . . . from following ... the God of their fathers,; 33).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(61) In evangelistic zeal, devotion and efficiency there was no other movement among God's more favored people equal to it, as in zeal for recensioning, publishing and circulating the Bible there was no movement among God's more favored people equal to the antitypical Hezekiah movement (tike unto him . . . king before . . . after him, 25;), for it turned to the Lord wholeheartedly, wholesouledly and wholemightedly (all his heart. . . soul . . . might), according to the gospel of Christ (according . . . law of Moses). But despite its great devotion and service God was not swayed away from the severity of His punishment as a result of His displeasure against the sphere of His more favored people (turned not from. . . wrath . . . kindled against Judah, 26;). This was the case in view of the arousement of His displeasure at the sins (because of the provocations) that the bad supernaturalistic movement had committed unto stirring up God to severe punishment (Manasseh had provoked withal). So great was God's displeasure thereat that He forecast that He would send God's more favored people away from their sphere of Truth, its Spirit and its ministry, outside of His favor (said, I will remove</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Judah also out of my sight, 27), even as He had done to His less favored people (as I have removed Israel), yea, that He would cast off from His favor the sphere of His more favored people's executorship (cast off this city Jerusalem), despite the fact that He had chosen it (which I have chosen) as such, and despite the nominal people of God among whom He had set His honor, character and word (the house of which I said, My name shall be there).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(62) Moreover, the evangelistic movement by charge and example in its sphere of excutorship laid the greatest stress in its preaching and singing upon the sacrifice of Christ as the ransom basis of justification and consecration, urging repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus as the Lamb of God that beareth the sins of the world, and upon this basis invited believers to consecrate (commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the Lord your God; kept a passover unto the Lord in Jerusalem, 21; 35: 1) as a service to the Lord (unto the Lord, 21;), as this is charged in the Bible as to justification and especially consecration (written in the book of this covenant). They observed this in harmony with the Gospel Age's general call (killed . . . fourteenth day of the first month, ; 1); for while, in harmony with the 1845 years' parallel, the fulness of the Gentiles came in probationarily in April 1878, some of these called ones fell away shortly, so that by April 1879 to April 1880 (the eighteenth year, 23; 19) there was need of added calls, which went forth unto a final completion probationarily by Oct. 1881, when the general call ceased. It was especially in this time that God used the evangelistic movement under Bro. Moody's supervision to complete the general call, as our Pastor pointed out. It was this work that constituted the great passover of the evangelistic movement, beginning in the Spring of 1879 and typically set forth in 21-23; 35: 1-19. Apart from the chronological setting of this passover in the parallel, we are led to understand the matter</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">as just explained from the fact that the number of the paschal lambs and bullocks of the burnt offering totals 41,400 (thus 30,000 + 2,600 + 5,000 lambs = 37,600 and 3,000 + 300 + 500 bullocks = 3,800, both kinds totaling 41,400, a multiple of 12); for divided by 12, the number of the Little Flock, the quotient is 3,450, which may mean that that many were called to the high calling in the 2*4 years involved, thus ending the general call, Oct. 1881.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(63) The evangelistic movement arranged for the chief evangelists, who besides Bro. Moody included Bros. Sankey, (Major) Whipple, Pentecost, Stebbins, Dixon, Pitt, (Sam) Jones, (Sam) Small, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to do each one's part in the work (set the priests in their charges, ; 2); and it strengthened them to serve the Lord by their evangelistic addresses and other connected services (encouraged. . . service ... of the Lord). Moreover, it encouraged the local pastors, inquiry workers and personal workers as the consecrated teachers of the Lord's people (said unto the Levites that taught. . . holy, ; 3) to put the due Truth where it belonged (Put the ark in the house), thus leaving all speculating and learned knowledge alone (not be a burden upon your shoulders), but to content themselves with the movements of the Interim star-members (Solomon. . . did build), since these followed the Apostles as teachers and executors for the Lord (son of David king of Israel), and to give themselves wholeheartedly to the Lord's service in the interests of His people (serve . . . God. . . Israel). Furthermore, it urged these antitypical Levites in harmony with their work as preachers (Gershonites), literature publishers and distributors (Merarites) and students (Kohathites) (prepare . . . houses of your fathers, ; 4), in harmony with their forms of service (after your courses) and in harmony with the Apostolic writings (writing of David) and those of the Interim star-members (writing of Solomon). It impressed upon them to stand ready to serve in the Lord's temple according</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">to the particular service of their particular group, thus using their positions, everyone according to his talents, spirit of consecration and providential situation (stand . . . according to the divisions . . . fathers . . . division. . . Levites, ; 5). Furthermore, it urged them, thus arranged, to set forth Christ as the slain Lamb, whose blood satisfied Justice for the believer and constituted his robe of righteousness (kill the passover, ; 6). to set themselves apart from sin, error, selfishness and worldliness unto the Lord's will wholly (sanctify yourselves), and to assist their brethren that they may act according to God's Word set forth by the Lord Jesus as touching the antitypical Passover as firstborn ones (prepare your brethren . . . do . . .

<p><span class="font3">(64) The evangelistic movement in its leaders did by far more than others in bringing hearers to justification, consecration and Spirit-begettal (Josiah gave . . . lambs and kids . . . thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks, ; 7), given by their laying down much of their lives (king's substance). These leaders sacrificed themselves most fieely for the people (people, ; 8), the main (priest) and the subordinate (Levites) leaders. The leading foolish-virgin workers and scholars, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> Arthur T. Pearson, A. J. Gordon, F. B. Meyer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (Hilkiah), especially able supporting ministers, like Drs. Cuyler and Storrs, of Brooklyn, Hoyt of Philadelphia, Spurgeon of London, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (Zechariah), and especially helpful higher clergy, like Bishops Simpson (Methodist), Cheney (Episcopalian), Mallalieu (Methodist), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (Jehiel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah lives],</span><span class="font3"> rulers of the house of God), gave the leaders for the antitypical passover much help for justification, consecration and Spirit-begetting purposes (two thousand and six hundred [lambs]) and helps on God's demonstrating His acceptance of Christ's sacrifice (three hundred [bullocks]) as antitypical burnt offerings. Scholarly brothers (Conaniah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[prepared by Jehovah],</span><span class="font3"> ; 9), literature publishers and distributors (Shemaiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">\heard by Jehovah]),</span><span class="font3"> missionary preachers (Nethaneel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[gift of God\), </span><span class="font3">personal workers (Hashabiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[regarded]),</span><span class="font3"> inquiry room workers (Jeiel </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[God's treasure]),</span><span class="font3"> and liberal contributing laymen, like Messrs. Wanamaker, Farwell, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (Jozabad </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah given]),</span><span class="font3"> as chiefs of the subordinate leaders (chief of the Levites), helped with justifications and consecrations the subordinate leaders on the basis of our Passover (gave unto the Levites . . five thousand [lambs] and five hundred oxen). Thus were the preparations made for a great part of the antitypical passover (So the service was prepared, ; 10). The chief leaders were set to serve in their part of it (priests stood in their place) and the subordinate leaders according to their several forms of service were set to serve in their places (Levites in their courses), even as the evangelistic movement had charged (according . . . commandment).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(65) The leading evangelists set forth in their preaching, lectures and writings Christ as the antitypical sacrificed Paschal Lamb (they killed the Passover, ; 11 [1 Cor. 5: 7]) and by their ministries they assured the newly consecrated and Spirit-begotten ones that its merit imputed to them was their righteousness (priests sprinkled the blood [upon the antitypical Altar] from their hands); and the subordinate leaders convinced them, especially in the inquiry rooms, that their humanity was fallen and that by overcoming they must be divested from all fleshly-mindedness and depravity (Levites flayed [skinned] them). Temporarily the leading evangelists abstained from setting forth God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice, in that they at first did not stress God's acts of justification, consecration and Spirit-begettal (removed the burnt offerings, ; 12), in order all the more to stress Christ as the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world, in the interests of the justified, consecrated and Spirit-begotten ones (give . . . divisions . . . people, to offer [their lambs] unto the Lord), according to the teachings of the Bible given by Christ (written. . . Moses). Thereafter they stressed the evidences of God's</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">manifest acceptance of Christs sacrifice, as this was apparent in the preaching of the Gospel, God's working repentance toward Himself and faith toward the Lord Jesus unto justification. Then they stressed as further evidence of such acceptance: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consecration, Spirit-begettal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sanctification and deliverance (And so they did with the oxen [burnt offerings]). The subordinate leaders set forth Christ's sufferings as those of the antitypical roasted Lamb as being most severe (roasted the passover with fire, ; 13), even as shown by God's pertinent arrangement for Jesus as the High Priest (according to the ordinance), but the parts of the antitypical burnt offerings that the justified and consecrated believers were to accept they set forth as less severe (sod [boiled]) by the pertinent doctrines (pots), precepts (caldrons) and corrections (pans), and quickly set these forth to the justified and consecrated believers for their appropriation (divided them speedily among all the people).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(66) In these ministries it was mainly the subordinate leaders who were active (afterward they [the Levites], ; 14). They readied the necessary features of the antitypical Lamb and of the burnt offerings for the subordinate and chief leaders (made ready for themselves, and for the priests). This was because the chief leaders were much and long occupied in sacrificing as to the acceptance of Christ's sacrifice to God and showing forth His great love (priests . . . busied. . . burnt offerings and the fat until night). The subordinate regular evangelists preached the pertinent features of the Truth (singers the sons of Asaph </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[gatherer],</span><span class="font3"> ; 15) and took their parts (were in their place), even as the Apostolic writings charged (according to the commandment of David) as to such evangelists (Asaph), as to the Sunday preachers (Heman [/ras/y]) and as to the occasional speakers (Juduthun </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[praising]),</span><span class="font3"> who forecast matters for the evangelistic movement (the king's seer). Those who had the work of leading inquirers to repentance and faith were all at</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">their posts in the inquiry rooms (porters . . . gate). They were often occupied until midnight in order not to fail of doing their part in this antitypical passover (not depart from their service) and their needs in their partaking in the benefits of the antitypical passover were cared for by their brethren, the subordinate leaders (their brethren the Levites prepared for them). Thus this whole service occurred during the Gospel Age's general call, at its very end (April 1879-October 1881), in order to set forth as such Christ as our Passover under the general call (service. . . was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, ; 16), and to set forth God's acceptance of Christ's sacrifice by setting forth those things whereby God expressed it, through giving and correcting teachings as to repentance, faith justification, sanctification and deliverance with the accordant Truth in the Church (offer burnt offerings upon the altar), even as the evangelistic movement had charged (according to the commandment of king Josiah).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(67) The justified and consecrated believers (children of Israel, ; 17) who came under the operation of this evangelistic movement not only participated in the merit of the Lamb in justification, consecration and Spirit-begettal (kept the passover at that time), but the faithful and measurably faithful participated in the joys and privileges of the whole of the subsequent Christian life (feast of unleavened bread seven days). Surely not since the days of &quot;the great revival&quot; of the eighteenth century under the leadership of John and Charles Wesley and George Whitefield was there so great a setting forth of calls to justification, consecration and Spirit-begettal as the antitypical passover held from April 1879 to Oct. 1881 (not holden. . . from the days of the judges; of Samuel the prophet, 22; 18), in the days of any of the less or more favored movements of God's people (days of the kings of Israel ... of Judah) as was that held by the evangelistic movement in the days of the closing general call (as</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Josiah kept), the main and subordinate leaders and God's more and less favored people and the supporters of the more favored executorship participating (priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel were present. . . Jerusalem, ; 18). This special evangelistic activity began in the year from April 1879 to April 1880, but continued until Oct. 1881 (eighteenth year . . . Josiah . . . was this passover kept, 23; 19). This evangelistic movement continued to act as. the ascendant movement for years after this great antitypical passover, but with decidedly smaller results so far as to Spirit-begetting taking place. In fact, it officiated as such a movement until April 1893, when it came to an end as such a movement through the preparatory movements of the Congress of Religions held in the Summer of 1893 in connection with the Chicago World's Fair, which events are typed in 2 Kings 23: 28-30 and 2 Chro. 35: 20-27.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(68) The historians and encyclopedists of the evangelistic movement have described its great work, especially in the many biographies of Bro. Moody and in shorter articles on his colaborers, such writings appearing in America and Britain (acts . . . written . . . chronicles . . . Judah; Israel and Judah, 28; 26, 27). After the great antitypical passover of 1879-1881 (After all this, ; 20) and after the evangelistic movement had fulfilled its work in completing the general call to God's temple (prepared the temple, ; 20), while it was yet operating as such (in his days, 29;), the Satan system in its divided condition, which set in just after the individual Satan was bound toward the impenitent fallen angels, 1874-1878, some of the fallen angels standing for that system in its secular aspects (Pharaoh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[sun king\-</span><span class="font3">nechoh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[conqueror]</span><span class="font3"> king of Egypt, 29; 20), through the efforts that especially Messrs. Bonney and Barrows, prime movers in arranging for the Chicago Congress of Religions, put forth to hold this congress, sought to overthrow that section of the impenitent angels under Satan himself which sought to maintain the Satan system in its religious aspects in the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">nominal church (king of Assyria, 29;). Here, as in some other places, Assyria stands for Babylon; for as a matter of fact the battle of Charchemish (Charchemish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fortress of the subduer],</span><span class="font3"> ; 20) was fought by Pharaoh-nechoh with Nebuchadnezzar about a year before the latter succeeded his father on Babylon's throne, and just after Nebuchadnezzar aided by the Medes had overthrown the Assyrian Empire. The reason why Josiah opposed Pharaoh-nechoh is that ever since the days of Ahaz Judah was an ally of Assyria. The battle was one that concerned the peoples of Christendom (Euphrates </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fructifying,</span><span class="font3"> 29; 20) and in the type was, until the two phases of the World War, one of the ten decisive battles of the world. The evangelistic movement (Josiah), true to its alliance with the nominal church, opposed the efforts of those fallen angels, who sought by Messrs. Bonney, Barrows, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> to bring all religions upon one platform and thus through the heathen religions to secularize the nominal church, a thing that of necessity the evangelist movement had to oppose (went out against him, 29; 20), which resulted in the overthrow of the evangelistic movement as the asscendant one among God's more favored people (slew him, 29;) in destruction-doomed Christendom (Megiddo </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[destruction],</span><span class="font3"> 29;) at their encounter (seen him, 29;). The involved impenitent fallen angels through the Bonney-Barrows movement by messengers sought to dissuade the evangelistic movement from opposing their purpose (sent ambassadors, ; 21), telling it that it had no conflict with it (What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?, ; 21), alleging that it had no quarrel with the evangelistic movement, but with an empire of which it was no part (not against thee . . . wherewith I have war).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(69) This secularizing movement of the impenitent fallen angels claimed that the gods had charged it to hasten against the nominal church (commanded. . . haste), and admonished the evangelistic movement not to meddle with the gods [the original word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font3"> is plural, though often used of our God, and here may be translated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gods,</span><span class="font3"> for Pharaoh would hardly as a polytheist have meant that Israel's God had charged him to make war] (forbear thee from meddling with god[s], ; 21), claiming that they were with them (with me), lest they [the gods] destroy it ([t]he[y] destroy thee not). But the evangelistic movement would not cease its opposition to their fell purpose (would not turn his face from him, ; 22). It changed its appearance into looking tike the nominal church (disguised himself), in order the more safely and the better to oppose them (might fight with him), and gave no heed to the words of these secularizing fallen angels as coming from the gods (hearkened not unto the words of Necho from . . . god[ s]). It came to battle in the condition of destruction (fight. . . Megiddo [destruction]). The sharp speakers and writers made a special target of the evangelistic movement, especially from the standpoint of its years-long opposition to sectarianism, which now they designated its refusal to coalesce with heathen religions to be. They also charged it with bigotry, self-opinionatedness, prejudice and intolerance, as marking its position of refusing to fellowship on one platform with heathen religions (archers shot at king Josiah, ; 23). So hurt was it by these charges that it asked its supporters to take it out of the debate (Have me away), declaring that these charges had sorely hurt it in the debate (sore wounded). Its supporters took it out of the organization whereby it did its evangelistic work toward sinners (out of that chariot, ; 24) and placed it in the organization whereby it did its work toward the consecrated (put him in the second chariot). In this organization it ceased to be the ascendant movement of God's more favored people (carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, 30; . . . he died,; 24), and was brought to its sphere of executorship (brought him to Jerusalem, 30; 24).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(70) It was given most honorable and sincere respect for its worthiness (buried him; was buried, 30; 24), even as one of the worthy movements of God's more favored people (one of the sepulchres of his fathers, ; 24), yea, as one standing by itself in the uniqueness of its ministries (in his own sepulchre, 30). It was mourned, first of all, by all God's more favored people and by the supporters of its sphere of executorship (Judah and Jerusalem mourned,; 24). Bro. Russell in the double Tower for Nov. 1, 15, 1893, reproduced and enlarged in D, 157268, Babylon's Confusion Ecclesiastical, poured out his heart's grief over the demise of this evangelistic movement through the leaders of the nominal church fellowshipping with the leaders of heathenism in that Congress of Refigions (Jeremiah lamented for Josiah, ; 25) and all the speaking and writing brothers and sisters made lamentation in speeches and writings until 1914, for the ceasing of this movement from being the ascendant movement among God's more favored people (singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations). These were made an arrangement among God's people (ordinance in Israel, ; 25) and were put into mourning writings (written in the lamentations). Its acts and goodness are described in histories of the less and the more favored movements of God's people as being in harmony with the Bible (acts . . . goodness . . . law, ; 26). All its special deeds are recorded among the accounts of historians of both sets of movements of God's people (book of the kings of Israel and Judah, ; 27).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(71) Having finished the study of antitypical Josiah, the evangelistic movement, there yet remain four kings in Judah to be considered. Three of these four kings were sons of Josiah, and, therefore, their antitypes indicate some thought relationship to the evangelistic movement. The first of these kings in the type reigned but three months. The third of them reigned three months and ten days; and the other two of them reigned eleven years each. The first of these four in the type was named Jehoahaz </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jehovah possessed).</span><span class="font3"> He</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">reigned during three months of 628 B.C. and types the consecration movement that Bro. D.L. Moody inaugurated when the evangelistic movement ceased to be the ascendant movement. The parallel dates, therefore, were the years 628 B.C. and 1893 A.D. In 1870 Bro. Moody and his fellow helpers started to emphasize consecration (23 years old, 2 Kings 23: 31; 2 Chro. 36: 1, 2). This movement was closely related to the Holy Spirit (Hamutal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[dew-like],</span><span class="font3"> Jeremiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[highly exalted by Jehovah]',</span><span class="font3"> Libnah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[whiteness, transparency]).</span><span class="font3"> But after the movement got operating as the ascendant movement it lasted only three months, because it fell away (he reigned three months); for shortly after coming into the ascendancy, on account of the section of the fallen angels who stood for secularism taking control, this movement turned to the various evils that former evil movements committed (evil. . . according to . . . fathers, 32;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(72) The secularizing fallen angels (Pharaoh-nechoh [otot-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">god conqueror],</span><span class="font3"> 33; 3) soon captured this movement, which, to gain favor, fruitfulness (Riblah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fertile]), </span><span class="font3">associated itself with the secularized movement and was made to secularize itself in a strong set of secular thoughts and acts </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Hamath</span><span class="font3"> [/br/rejw]), which condition resulted in the movement's losing the place of ascendancy that it had maintained for three months (not reign in Jerusalem), and they secularized the sphere of its Truth and its spirit unto its impoverishment and the enrichment of the secularizing fallen angels (a tribute . . . talents . . . talent, 33; 3). Thus whatever of Divine Truth this movement had became subject to the secularizing fallen angels. Of course, these secularizing fallen angels had no use for the consecration movement, and therefore deposed antitypical Jehoahaz and put in its place a unionistic movement (Eliakim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[whom God raised up],</span><span class="font3"> 34; 4), because this unionistic movement served the purpose of the secularizing fallen angels better than did the consecration movement. But to give it the appearance of a righteous</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">and Divinely-approved movement the secularizing fallen angels changed the movement's appearance into one allegedly established by Jehovah (changed. . . Jehoiakim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[whom Jehovah established})'.</span><span class="font3"> and they brought the consecration movement completely into worldliness, that so generally prevailed at that time in the nominal church (took Jehoahaz . . . Egypt [/br/re^]), and in that condition of worldliness this movement ceased altogether in its ascendancy as a Divinely-favored one (died there).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(73) The unionistic movement was begun in its earliest stage by Bro. D. L. Moody in 1868, when he cast aside for his evangelistic work the sectarian spirit that prevailed among the churches and that opposed his non-sectarian evangelistic campaigns (25 years old, 36; 5). This unionistic movement was in the ascendancy in executorship from 1893 to 1904 (reigned eleven years), the parallel years being 629-618 B.C. The doctrine that especially nourished this movement was one of freely giving up items in the stewardship doctrine of each denomination by conceding something redeemed by Jehovah and held in high honor to one another (Zebudah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[given] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Pedaiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah redeemed] . . .</span><span class="font3"> Rumah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[high],</span><span class="font3"> 36; ). This unionistic movement was evil in its activities in relationship to God (did. . . evil. . . Lord, 37; 5). The evil that this movement did is detailedly described in Jeremiah and has been explained, type and antitype, in the eighth chapter of our second volume on the Parousia Messenger. Hence we will not give any further explanation on it here. Satan was by no means pleased that this movement was given by the secularizing fallen angels a secularizing character. Hence in 1897 he began a set of antagonistic activities against this movement (Nebuchadnezzar . . . came, 2 Kings 24: 1; 6).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(74) For three years this movement was subject to the religious phase of Satan's empire, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> from 1897 to 1900 (Jehoiakim. . . three years). Thereupon this unionistic movement sought to secularize itself as against Satan's religious purposes (rebelled against him, 1;); and by 1904 Satan greatly restrained this movement in its religious phase and made it a captive in his religious empire (fetters . . . Babylon, ; 6). At the same time Satan perverted to the interests of his religious empire many of the stewardship teachings of the Lord's Word in his unionistically inclined churches, as they were held in the various denominations, and as they became unionistically inclined (carried of the vessels ... of the Lord to Babylon,; 7), and made use of these to further the interests of his religious empire (put them in his temple at Babylon, ; 7). The acts of this unionistic movement are found described in the writings of the historians of the more favored people of God (acts ... all... did .. . written . . . kings of Judah, 5; 8). The unionistic movement after ceasing to be the ascendant movement (slept with his fathers) was succeeded by the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement (Jehoiakin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah appointed] . . .</span><span class="font3"> stead, 6; 8). It will be noted that in 2 Kgs: 24: 8 Jehoiakin is said to have been 18 years old when he began to reign, and in 2 Chro. 36: 9 it is said that he was eight years old when he began to reign. The latter is a copyist's mistake whereby he omitted the words &quot;and ten&quot; after the word &quot;eight.&quot; It was in 1886 that Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement was started by Bro. D.L. Moody; and this movement, like the preceding one, caused unionistic error to prevail and perverted stewardship doctrines of the denominations to evil ones in matters pertaining to God, even as the preceding movement had done (Jehoiakin was eighteen years old. . . reigned. . . Jerusalem three months . . . did evil, 8; 9). It was the strong doctrine of the great commission, misapplied in the Harvest, that mothered this movement (Nehushta </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[brazen]),</span><span class="font3"> a commission that our Lord gave in Matt. 28: 18-20 (Elnathan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[God gave],</span><span class="font3"> 8;). Above it was mentioned that it did evil, like the previous movement (evil . . . Lord, 9; 9).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(75) It was while the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement was in the ascendancy among the more favored people of God that Satan's servants in their religious capacity, both fallen angels and wicked men, made an onslaught on the sphere of executorship of this movement, and brought it under siege conditions (servants . . . Babylon. . . Jerusalem . . . besieged, 10;). Even Satan himself in his religious aspect worked against the movement's sphere of executorship while his servants, human and spiritual, were besieging it (Nebuchadnezzar . . . city. . . besieged it, 11;). Under this method of attack the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement surrendered to Satan in his religious aspect (Jehoiachin. . . went. . . king of Babylon, 12;). The movement, the great commission (mother), its supporters (servants), its leaders (princes) and all its officials (officers) gave themselves up, and Satan in his religious aspect captured the movement (took him). This was in the eighth year after Satan began to assume the Babylonian aspect of his reign of that period (eighth year of his reign). Satan took from the sphere of its executorship all of the stewardship teachings of the nominal churches (carried treasures . . Lord, 13; 10); he also took all of the choice theories of the movement's sphere of operation (treasures of the king's house); and he utterly devastated the Divine teachings which the Interim star-members had made for God's temple (pieces . . . gold which Solomon. . . made in the temple ... as the Lord had said, 13;).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(76) Satan made captives of all who were in the sphere of this movement's executorship (carried away all Jerusalem, 14;), the leaders (princes) and all the able controversialists of the movement (all. . . valour), even the full number of the nominal church's crown-losers and justified ones who were active in this missionary movement (ten thousand). Among these were all the directors (craftsmen) in the various denominations' missionary boards and societies and all the policy and doctrinal creators of their missionary work (smiths). Thus Satan got under his control all except poverty-stricken persons subject to the Students'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Volunteer Missionary Movement (poorest sort. . . land). In the eighth year of Satan's particular reign in Babylon at this time he carried the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement away captive into Babylonian spheres of work (carried away. . . Babylon, 15; 10). He also took into this captivity the strong doctrine of the great commission, misusing it as still applicable after the Harvest began, in addition to the movement's supporters (mother. . . wives, 15;), with all in official positions in the movement (officers), as well as the most prominent subjects of the movement (chief men). He made them all his captives, taking them from the sphere of the movement's executorship to the sphere of Satan's executorship in the nominal church (captivity . . . Babylon). He also took all of the warriors of the movement, even a perfect Divine number of them (all. . . might. . . even 7,000, 16;), together with the Missionary directors and the policy and theory makers who totaled a perfect number of crownlosers and justified ones (craftsmen and smiths a thousand). All of these were powerful and able warriors for the cause of the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement (strong and apt for war). Even these Satan took under his control as captives of his to his perverted religion on the subject of missions (king . . . captive to Babylon).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(77) Satan made the combinism movement allied to the unionistic movement the ascendant movement in place of the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement (king of Babylon made Mattaniah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[a gift of Jehovah] . . .</span><span class="font3"> king in his stead, 17; 10). To palm off this movement, which, as the Federation of Churches, allied itself with the state in the U. S.-combinism movement, as one pleasing to Jehovah, Satan changed its exterior character into one apparently pleasing to God (changed his name to Zedekiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[justice of Jehovah]),</span><span class="font3"> God permitting it in allusion to Jehovah's exacting justice for the sins of Judah against the Law. Thus an imitation character of Jehovah's justice was by Satan put over the favored people of God in its sphere of executorship (Judah and Jerusalem). In 1942 the Students'</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Volunteer Missionary Movement was given some freedom from its captivity (seven and thirtieth year . . . Jehoiakin, 2 Kgs. 25: 27;; Jer. 52: 31), for in that year, due to the course of Japan in forcing America into the war, Satan changed his method of dealing (Evil-merodach </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fool of death,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to Satan's folly in forcing America into the World War, Phase II] king of Babylon) and began to favor the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement (did lift up the head of Jehoiakin), because he thought it would serve his purpose in helping Japan to victory in countries where missionary work was being done. Hence he took away restraint from that movement (out of prison) and gave it preference to all other movements in the fallen nominal church (spoke kindly. . . throne . . . kings ... in Babylon, 28; ; 32). Satan invested with new authority the Students' Volunteer Missionary Movement (changed his prison garments, 29; ; 33) and supported it with full provision as long as it lasted (did eat bread before him ... his life). Satan continued to give this movement such advantage as long as it existed to his advantage (allowance. . . continual. . . king, 30; ; 34).

<p><span class="font3">(78) Above the remark was made that Zedekiah represents the combinism movement, and we desire to add to that remark that this combinism showed itself not only in a quasi-alliance of state in the U. S. and church, but also, especially, in the Federation of Churches, in a quasialliance with the state in Protestant countries, and the tendency to the start of such a movement was made in 1883 by Bro. Moody, by which he sought to combine Christian people in an alliance for evangelism that more or less ignored the denominational stewardship doctrines (Zedekiah. . . years old. . . reign, 2 Kgs. 24: 18; 2 Chro. 36: 11). This movement was the ascendant movement until Oct. 1914, in actual time lasting ten and a half years, but according to the Hebrew method of counting it was eleven years; for the Hebrews counted a part of a year a full year if the occasion entering into that year was the beginning of a whole year (eleven years in Jerusalem, 18; 11; 52: 1). The theory that produced this movement was a counterfeit of the doctrine of the oneness of the Church (mother's name was Hamutal </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[dewlike,</span><span class="font3"> in allusion to the counterfeit of the oneness of the true Church, which was urged as the counterfeit reason for federationism], 18; ; 1). This movement wrought evil in matters pertaining to the Lord, even as a counterfeit unity of the true Church found in a federation of churches should be expected to do. These evils are detailedly described in Vol. 2 of the Parousia Messenger and hence will not be here further mentioned (did. . . evil . . . Lord, 19; 12; 2). In such evil conduct it followed in a worse degree the evils of the unionistic movement (according . . . Jehoiakim, 19; ; 2). It refused to humble itself before that Servant, who spoke to it from God's Word (humble . . . Jeremiah. . . mouth of the Lord, ; 12).</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">(79) In discussing the combinism movement it is necessary for us to remember what we showed in B, Note III, pp. 394-400; for while there was a quasi-alliance between the federation and various states, yet the six states of Europe that were more or less related to the federation in Combinism acted under Satan for the overthrow of Combinism in the sphere of the more favored people of God and the sphere of this movement's executorship. We ask our readers carefully to read over Note III in B, pp. 394-400, where the destruction of Christendom national is also emphasized, as well as the destruction of Combinism, its favored people and its sphere of executorship. Since the matter has been given in considerable detail in that note, we will not explain the features there explained that come in the section that we are studying, requesting our readers to keep in mind the remark just made on the relation of Federationism and the State. For that Combinism implies a semi-alliance with the State. God was</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">highly displeased at the evils committed, especially by antitypical Manasseh, antitypical Amon, antitypical Jehoiakim and antitypical Zedekiah. So greatly did this anger express itself that God cast off Combinism's sphere of executorship and the more favored people of God (anger . . . Jerusalem and Judah . . . cast. . . presence, 20; ; 3). This anger of the Lord showed itself in Combinism in church and state, by letting it rebel against Satan in his religious aspect (Zedekiah rebelled. . . Babylon, 20; 13; 3). This rebellion was committed by Combinism against its sworn allegiance to Satan's purpose with Combinism (made him swear by God, ; 13). Combinism became very stubborn and obdurate in apostatizing from the Lord (stiffened his neck . . . from turning . . . God). For the chronological data typed in Combinism we refer our readers to Note III in B, pp. 394-400, as well as to our discussion on the P.B.I. chronology in a chapter on its chronology in E-7. Since the matter has been discussed there thoroughly, we will make no more discussion thereon in the section of our present study (ninth year, 2 Kgs. 25: 1;; 4).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(80) The besieging of Combinism started in 1912, as indicated in the note above referred to, through its first stage leading to World War, Phase I (king of Babylon . . . against Jerusalem). There were many steps that Satan caused to be taken whereby Combinism was besieged (pitched. . . forts . . . about). The siege of Combinism's sphere of executorship continued into the 11th year of its ascendancy (eleventh year 2; ;5). Combinism and its supporters were famished, ran out of supplies in its sphere of executorship (famine city), which resulted in Combinism in state and church being unable to supply its subjects (bread. . . land, 3; ; 6). The outbreak of the World War, Phase I, caused Combinism's warriors to be scattered in flight secretly (men of war fled, 4; ; 7). The flight was made by the way of escape open between the two walls, parts of Combinism, i.e., church and state (gate . . . walls), even where Combinism produced its main fruitage</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">(king's garden). Combinism fled into unfruitful conditions (king . . . plain), pursued by the demon warriors, who overtook it in the sphere of the nominal church (Chaldeans </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[demons]</span><span class="font3"> pursued. . . overtook . . . Jericho, 5; ; 8) and the warriors of Combinism, especially in its religious phase, were widely scattered away from it (army. . . him). Combinism in both of its features, federation of state and of church, fell into the power of the demons (took the king, 6; ; 9). They captured Combinism, especially in its religious phase, and brought it to Satan in a condition fruitful to Satan's purpose (carried. . . Babylon to Riblah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fertile]), </span><span class="font3">where Satan was especially powerful (Hamath [/br/re^]); and in this condition Satan sentenced Combinism (judgment upon him). He destroyed all of Combinism's movements (slew the sons of Zedekiah, ; 10) openly in its presence (before his eyes). He also cut off all of the leaders of God's more favored people where they were fruitful (slew. . . princes . . . Riblah). Satan also blinded Combinism to what he was doing with it (put out the eyes of Zedekiah, ; 11) and held it with strong bands and thus carried it captive into his ideals of Babylon (fetters . . . Babylon) and restrained it in its captivity until it became extinct (prison . . . death).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(81) For the exposition of 8-10; ; 12-14, please see B, p. 397, par. 2 to p. 398, par. 1. Satan's chief representative (Nebuzar-adan </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[whom Nebo protects])</span><span class="font3"> among fallen angels led into Satanic captivity the rest of the people that were supporters of the sphere of God's more favored people's executorship and those that had already fallen into Satan's hands (rest of the people, 11; ; 15). He left free from captivity only the least developed of the sphere of Christendom's teaching and spirit, to do the lowliest work in that sphere (12; ; 16). The demons set aside the 12 Apostles under Christ's headship and the 35 Interim starmembers ( [two] pillars of brass, 13; ; 17) with Christ as their head (chapiter, 17; ; 22) from being held in esteem among</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">God's nominal people. Additionally, they set aside the New Testament (brazen sea) and its foundations, the Old Testament books (bases), as they were esteemed among the nominal people of God (brass), and carried these as they were esteemed by the nominal people of God away into Satanic captivity (brass . . . Babylon). God's arrangements to enable consecrators to complete their sacrifice (caldrons, T 47, 1; 14; ; 18), the refutations (shovels), the corrections (snuffers), the ethical teachings (spoons) and sin-offering teachings (basons), even all of the teachings as they appeared to the nominal people of God, they likewise took away for Satanic purposes. The doctrines (cups), Scriptural passage (firepans) and the sin-offering doctrines (basons) as they appeared to God and the new creatures, which were both true and Divine in character (gold. . . silver), the chief representative of Satan took into Satanic uses (15; ; 19). The star-members, represented in the 12 Apostles and the 35 Interim star-members (two pillars, 16; ; 20), with Christ as their Head (chapiter), and the New Testament in its cleansing office (sea), with the Old Testament books as its foundations, as set forth by the justice of God as the Bible's support to the 12 tribes of Spiritual Israel (twelve brazen bulls), as taught by the Interim star-members (Solomon), were in the estimation of the nominal people indescribable (weight). The 12 Apostles and the Interim star-members were by the nominal people of God considered imperfect (18 = 3 X 6 [number of imperfection and evil], 17; ; 21). Yet they were for the 12 tribes of Spiritual Israel (twelve cubits), and were in harmony with the four attributes of God (four fingers), and had no strength of their own (hollow). The 35 Interim star-members were as such given by God some power and strength, though not to the same degree as He gave to the 12 Apostles.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(82) Christ (chapiter) as viewed by the people was a hybrid, a God-man, hence imperfect (five cubits [5 is a half of 10]), though actually perfect, 7. He was the Head of each of these antitypical pillars (17 [the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">three</span><span class="font3"> here is a copyist's mistake]; ; 22), but as a God-man was imperfectly understood by the nominal people. Despite this the fruit of His redemptive work was very manifest in His headship of these two classes of star-members (network and pomegranates, 17; ; 22). Thus these two sets of starmembers' represented Christ's redemptive work among the nominal people of God. Originally there were 400 pomegranates (1 Kings 7: 20), some of which seem to have dropped off, typifying His redemptive work's fruit to the humanity of the four saved human classes, though the nominal people of God did not properly comprehend these two Gospel-Age antitypical pillars. The fruit of Christ's redemptive work was complete for the human race (an hundred [four hundred; complete for humans ]; ; 23). Satan's chief supporter among the fallen angels took the Papacy (Seraiah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[warrior of Jehovah]),</span><span class="font3"> the Federation of Churches (Zephaniah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[Jehovah's secret])</span><span class="font3"> and the three parts of Christendom: Roman and Greek Catholicism and Protestantism, out of their place of ruler ship (three keepers of the door, 18; ; 24). And from the place of executorship of the nominal people of God Satan's chief officer among the fallen angels took the chief controversialists (officer . . . war) and the total number of the counselors of the Feder affair of Churches (seven [five is a copyist's error] men. . . king's presence), whose sphere was in the sphere of executorship of the more favored people of God, the scholars of these chief controversialists (scribe) who prepared the nominal people of God for controversy and all (three score [6 X 10]) the evil denominations and sects of the people of the sphere of the nominal-church teachings, even all of whom were found in the midst of the sphere of executorship of the Federation of Churches (city, 19; ; 25). Satan's chief officer among the fallen angels took all of these to Satan in his sphere of fruitfulness (Riblah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fertile], </span><span class="font3">20;; 26) and Satan cut these off entirely from their former power while he was at his sphere of fertility in his sphere of strength (Hamath </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">[fortress],</span><span class="font3"> 21; ; 27). Thus all of the more favored people of God were taken captive out of their sphere into Satan's sphere, where he cut them off from their former positions (put to death). In enumerating the number of captives in Jer. 52: 28-30 no mention is made of the 10,000 captives taken when antitypical Jehoiakin was made captive. The total number of captives here set forth is 4,600, and this would indicate that all of these who were lower than those of the Divine class were made captives of Satan in one way or another during the three loosings upon Christendom of Satan's controversial weapons. What is stated in 2 Kgs. 25: 22-25 we expounded in the ninth chapter of the Parousia Messenger, Vol. II, so it needs no repetition here. In the first period of Christ's reign (first year of Cyrus, 2 Chro. 36: 22), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Parosuia and Epiphany, in fulfilment of the Lord's teachings given through &quot;that Servant&quot; (mouth of Jeremiah), God aroused our Lord Jesus to proclaim freedom for all Spiritual Israelites throughout all the earth, and caused it to be written as the statements of Jesus that God had given the kingdoms of the whole world to Him and had charged him to erect God's temple for the kingdom of God among God's more favored people, inviting all among God's people to go up and occupy themselves with the developing of the Church for the Kingdom (2 Chro. 36: 22, 23).</span></p></li></ul>

<h4><a name="bookmark85"></a><span class="font3">APPENDIX I</span></h4>
<h4><a name="bookmark86"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark87"></a>LAMENTATIONS</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">IN ITS FIRST application the book of Lamentations expresses Jeremiahs grief over the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, and the taking of the latter's vessels and furniture, and of Israel, into captivity in Babylon. This application is, of course, that of the type. But it has two antitypical applications. The first of these is the grief of the Interim's star-members, those who officiated between the Harvests, over the overthrow of the true Church as Jesus' sphere of rulership, and as God's temple, and of the captivity, in symbolic Babylon, of the Lord's people as such, and in its various capacities as such (the temple's furniture), and of the Bible (laver), and of the Truth teachings (vessels), together with their defiling during such captivity. Jeremiah, from this standpoint, represents the Interim's star-members. Its second antitypical application is the grief of the Epiphany Messenger over the Levites' desolating the Lord's Harvest people as the sphere of Jesus' rulership and as God's temple and their making captives of God's Harvest people as such in Little symbolic Babylon, and in their various capacities (furniture), and the Bible (laver), and the Truth teachings (vessels), together with their defiling during such captivity. It is not our intention to discuss here the type as such, nor the second antitype as such. Rather we will here discuss the first antitypical application of the book's contents. The comments will be brief and in the nature of a paraphrase, rather than extended explanations. The line of thought in this book is epitomized in Ps. 137, with this difference, that this book describes the grief-experiences of the star-members, and the Epiphany messenger, while Ps. 137 describes the grief-experiences of the whole Israel of God during the Interim</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and Epiphany. We will, therefore, begin our exposition with a paraphrase ofPs. 137.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Besides the teachings of Great and Little Babylon, God's real people were seated respectively in the two abovementioned periods, and were in grief as they respectively thought of the Lord's people in the Jewish Harvest and in the Parousia (1). They respectively let the earth-tending leaders in Great and Little Babylon have the Old and New Testaments in charge respectively (2). Their respective captors required them to declare the respective Truth message, even their respective devastators required them to be joyful in declaring a teaching of their respecrive reaping times (3); but how could they declare their respective truths in a strange sphere of teaching and spirit (4)? Nevertheless, they respectively vowed not to forget the respective spheres of Jesus' rulership over His people; rather would they forget their chief power and work, than so to do (5); and rather would they be speechless in their respective times, if they did not prefer their respective spheres of Jesus' rulership over His people to their greatest joy (6). Their respective attitudes were prayers that God might keep in mind the civil powers' course toward the respective spheres of Jesus' rulership over His people, as they urged its respective complete overthrow (7). Their respective attitude toward Great and Little Babylon, which are to be annihilated, was that they who would treat them as they treated God's true people would be favored by God (8); and that they who would dash the little sects of both Babyions against the doctrines of the Truth would be favored by God (9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now for Lamentations proper. Jesus' sphere of ruler ship over God's people, once having many subjects, was in the Interim solitary, which was the case during the ascendancy of the Greek Catholic Church during the Smyrna period, of the Roman Catholic Church during the Pergamos, Thyatira and Sardis periods and of each sect of Protestantism after its</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">respective Little Flock movement was perverted into a sect. It became as a widow, when God seemingly withdrew from it. Despite the fact that it had been great among nonChristian nations and the chief sphere of God's work, it had become a serving subject in her people (1: 1). Deeply did her captive people weep because of the errors in which they were involved; distress showed itself over their present teachings; among former lovers none comforted them; for their friends had betrayed them and become their enemies (2). God's more favored people were captives in Babylon, because of being overcome by temptations and service of evil. They abode among the heathen without peace. All their persecutors, those in state, church, aristocracy and Inquisition, overtook them amid great difficulties (3). The concourses of the Church as the light-giver were 'distressed, because clear traveling as to justification, sanctification, class standing, peace of justification and tribal growths in the 12 graces were lacking. Those who had led into the Church no more did so; the star-members and their special helpers grieved; their consecrated ones were in trouble and the Church as sphere of Jesus' rulership over God's people was in deepest sorrow (4). The Church's, especially the star-members' attackers, tike Anicetus against Polycarp, Dionesius against Hippolytus, Athanasius against Arius, Jerome against Jovinian, Theodemir against Claudius of Turin, Radbertus against Ratramnus, Lanfranc against Berengar of Tours, Bernard against Peter Abelard, Rome's Innocent IV against Grosseteste, Alvarus Pelagius against Marsiglio, Courtenay against Wyclif, D'Ailly against Huss, and the main opponents of the twelve starmembers of Philadelphia, were counted leaders in Babylon. Its enemies were prospered in state, church and aristocracy; for God had afflicted it for the many wrongs committed in it by its faultful members; and its members went into Babylonian captivity through her enemy, the nominal church (5). Of course, under such conditions, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">beauties of holiness were lost by its members; her leaders, having become weak because of lacking spiritual food, were easily overtaken by their pursuers (6). When the Church's members came into the power of the nominal church and had no helpers, then, in the days of their trouble and woes, they remembered the great privileges of grace, knowledge and service that the brethren of the Jewish Harvest had. Her attackers, seeing her miseries, mocked at her rests of faith (7).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Church, which embraced crown-retainers and crownlosers, the latter greatly predominating, had transgressed much; therefore, it was removed from the sphere of Jesus' rulership over His people, and fell into dishonor of the entire class that had honored it, because they saw her shameful sinfulness; it sorrowed and retrograded (8). In its qualities was seen her sinfulness; it considered not the results of its course; hence it marvelously sank lower in wrong. None comforted it; the star-members brought its afflictions before the Lord; for the nominal church magnified itself (9). It, by its theologians, used its powers against all the Church's goodly powers, privileges and possessions; for it saw that the unregenerate entered into the Church, though God forbade them so to do (10). All its members sighed, for they sought spiritual food. To preserve their beings they had given up all their favors, privileges and possessions. The star-members of the Interim pleaded with God to take note of, and give attention to these things, recognizing that they had become vile in Babylon's, sight (11). Their plight was an indifferent thing to passersby. Considering, they would recognize that none had such grief as they, done to them by their opponents, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> those named in the preceding paragraph, but arranged for by the Lord's wrath for sin (12). God, from on high, sent destruction into the very beings of the Interim's star-members, and overcame them. He had manipulated them into traps; He had conditioned matters for their defeat, making them desolate and weak (13). Their</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">faultfill habits were, by God's power, bound upon them; in combinations they enslaved their wills, weakening them, and delivered them to enemies (14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He allowed to be subdued in conflict all the able men that supported the star-members, and arranged for the companies of nominal-church theologians to suppress their warrior supporters; He allowed the faithful to be greatly oppressed by trials (15). These things greatly saddened the star-members, and that because a comforter was nowhere at hand for their relief Those whom they begat for the Lord were made desolate, because Babylon was victorious (16). The true Church longed for mercy; but none comforted her. The Lord arranged, as to His people, that her enemies surround her. The Church was avoided as defiled with heresy and evil deeds (17), yet the star-members vindicated God's justice in this, since even they were more or less rebellious as to His Truth; for successive generations of them imbibed errors that previous ones had controverted. They, by their attitude, called upon all their hearers to witness their grief at the consecrated and warriors being captured by the errors and wrong practices of their disseminators (18). They called upon friends, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g,</span><span class="font3"> Berengar of T ours upon his friend Hildebrand, but were by these deceived. Their main and subordinate leaders perished as such while seeking for the bread of life in the doomed and erring Church (19). Their attitude told the Lord their sorrows, disturbed sympathies and great discouragement, because of their having endorsed grievous error in Babylon. Controversy that they waged with outsiders took away supporters, and among their supporters deadly errors cut down their espousers (20). All, including their opponents, knew of their sorrows and troubles; but none offered comfort to them. They rejoiced that God had consented to their sufferings. But they knew that God would bring the day of wrath upon their class, when they will have sorrows like the Interim's star-members (21). Their attitude was that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God would, in due time, cause all their oppressors' wrongs to come up for punishment before Him and render to them as He had consented to their rendering to them for their errors of doctrine and practice, because their sorrows discouraged their hearts (22).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chapter 2 gives a more intense description of the overthrow of the true Church by Babylonians than does chapter 1. God caused trouble to engulf His Church, as the light of the world, in His displeasure, He cast her, the adornment of His people, down from spiritual to earthly things; and remembered her not in the time of His displeasure (2: 1). He has consumed all abodes of His people without pity. He consented to the overthrow of the strong teaching of His favored people in His wrath and abased them to the earth, and has consented to the pollution of the leaders and their leadership (2). In His sore displeasure He cut off the strength of His people. He drew back Jesus, His chief Favorite and Power, from the conflict with Babylonian theologians in the Interim, and consented to destructive injuries working against and devouring His people on all sides (3). He consented to their enemies' using deadly controversial weapons against them; and with power consented, as an enemy, to the overthrow of every goodly privilege, power and possession of His people by the errors and wrong practices of Babylonians, and thus destructively poured out His wrath (4). God Himself acted as though He was turned into an enemy; He consumed His people; He consented to all their main teachings being devoured, to the destruction of their strong teachings, and to the increase of His people's grief and distress (5). He consented to enemies destroying His Church as a compact company, as one plows up a garden. As to the assembly of His people as a distinct company, He had consented to its destruction. He has consented to it that the teachings of justification by faith, sanctification of Spirit, taking ones' standing before the Lord and the rest of faith be forgotten in His Church, and has consented to make little the favored movement and the main leader (6). He has acted as if He had cast off His Church in its capacity of encouraging, etc., the brethren, as if He had hated it as His meeting place with His people, as if He had surrendered the power of its main teachings to the enemy, who have defiled it by their agitations, even as to its special blessings (7). His determination was to destroy the power, the Truth, of His people. He measured out the course of attack upon them, and did not withdraw His destroying power. Therefore, under the blows of Babylonian theologians in the Interim, He consented to the weakening of her special and ordinary powers, which in their defenders lament and grow weak together (8). Those who led others into the sphere of Jesus' rulership over God's people became immersed in secular things. He consented to the destruction of the teachings and practices that held them in place. The favored movements and their leaders were scattered among heathen. The Truth as one whole was nonexistent in the faith of believers. Its expounders no more saw God's plan (9). The leaders of God's people were in the deepest mourning over these evils. The consecrated of Jesus' sphere of rulership of His people were in the deepest shame (10). The star-members lost their insight into the Truth because of their grief; their sympathies were greatly disturbed, their analytic powers had sunk to earthly subjects, because of the overthrow of God's people, and because they were but slightly developed, and the beginners fainted away in the ways of God's religious government (11). They cried out to their developers for solid and liquid spiritual food, while they fainted, as sin-wounded ones, in the ways of God's religious government, or as they died on the bosom of their developers (12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Interim star-members wondered as to what witness they should give the Church or as to what they might compare her; and as to what they could lay hold on as sufficient to comfort it as God's light-shiner, since as wide as the ocean was her breach, and it was incurable (13). Its teachers had imagined fruitless and senseless things for it, but as flatterers had not pointed out its faults, to prevent its becoming a captive in Babylon, but had seen false views and things that brought exile to it (14). All passersby make signs of derision, despising and disapproval at the Church, saying, Is this the religious government that men call the perfection of holiness, and the joy of all society (15)? Inimical theologians and ecclesiastics spoke against the Church; they uttered despising and hatred. They boasted that they had completely swallowed it, that this was the time that they had expected, that they had overtaken it and witnessed its defeat (16). For the wrongs of His people the Lord had fulfilled His anciently foretold Plan and Word as to them. He caused them to be cast down without pitying them. He made their enemy, the nominal church, triumph over them, and had given them power as their opponents (17). Their hearts cried out unto the Lord as the Defense of His people as light-shiners. They entreated Him to grieve with them ceaselessly, pleading with Him not to permit His most favored people to cease to be (18). The Interim starmembers exhorted the Lord's people to cry out in the night time, which the Interim was, from the beginning of each watch of the night onward, and freely to pour out their hearts before God, and to do this emphatically for the lives of the beginners in the way of God, who fainted for spiritual hunger in prominent places in the concourses of God's religious government (19). These star-members pleaded with God to think of what those were to whom He had done such things. They asked whether those who had developed the babes should in the distress consume them, even the youngest? Should the main leaders and the teachers be cut off in the Church of God (20)? Warriors and the ancients he amid earthly things, cut off in the concourses of God's religious government. Their consecrated and their warriors are defeated by</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Babylonian arguments. God, these star-members said, had cut them off in the time of His displeasure, refuted and not pitied (21). While God's people were engaged in various stage of their experiences, God called them to experience terrors on all sides, resulting in none escaping nor remaining in the day of God's anger. Yea, those whom these star-members gave the first ministries after their begettal of the Spirit as a reckoned birth, the Babylonian church consumed (22).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In chapter 3 more details of the Interim's star-members' sufferings are set forth. They recognize, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Wyclif, Huss, Hubmaier, Cranmer, Servetus, in fact, all of them, that they were a class that had experienced tribulations by God's chastening wrath (3: 1). Providentially their ministry, from the outstart until the Sardis period, was accompanied increasingly with much error away from the Truth (2). This made them successively feel that God had turned against them; increasingly His power seemed to do this to them continually (3). God had worn out their internal and external substance; and every one of them seemed wrecked by their tribulations (4). Through the power of their adversaries He seemed to work against them, and surrounded them with the saddest of experiences and sufferings (5). They were set amid Greek, Roman and Protestant errors; as ancient dead ones (6). He made them prisoners in inescapable conditions, chained by hard conditions (7). He seemed to refuse to answer their loud supplications (8). He made their teachings come into close contact with the most subtilely developed errors; and their consequent courses of argument seem unclear (9). He seemed to place them in positions where strong enemies lurked for them; and powerful adversaries hid to pounce upon them (10). His course seemed to lead them away into the errors of the Dark Ages and to make divisions amid their members, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Luther and Zwingli; Zwingli and Hubmaier, Cranmer and Servetus, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> making each one stand alone in desolation (11). He seemed to turn parts of the Bible as a propelling weapon against them, and to shoot sharp sayings against them in many of their debates (12). He seemed to cause many of His sharp Bible sayings to enter their very vitals (13). Throughout the entire Interim they have been objects of ridicule and mockery to all nominal Christians, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Polycarp, Irenaeus, Hippolytus, Arius, Claudius of Turin, Berengar of Tours, Abelard, etc. (14). He arranged for them experiences that were the keenest disappointments, and made them think unclearly with bitterest woe (15). Their powers to masticate their teachings were made inappropriate to the task, and they were covered with mourning (16). Their course became one of unrest and seeming failure (17). They feared that their strength and expectation were doomed to despair as to the Lord's help (18), as they kept in mind their tribulations and sorrows-full of the bitterness of wormwood and gall (19). They still kept them in memory and were humiliated (20). Nevertheless they kept in mind as a thing that gave them hope (21) that it was of the Lord's unfailing compassions that they were not devoured (22).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yea, God's compassions were in every time of need new, since He was great in faithfulness (23); for God was their possession; hence their hope was fixed in Him (24). God is good to those who hope in Him, even to those who seek Him whole-heartedly (25). It is a blessing both to hope and in peace to wait for God to deliver (26), and to learn from youth up to accept and do God's will (27). In the starmembers' isolation they held their peace, because they believed that their burdens were given them by the Lord to bear (28). They humbled their utterances in the hope of deliverance (29). They permitted, unresistingly, others to smite them, and received their fill of blame (30); for the Lord will not cast off His own forever (31). Though He give a cup of sorrow to His own to drink, yet He will be merciful in the abundance of His compassion (32). He takes no pleasure in striping and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">tubulating the people (33). God does not approve of oppressing any earthly captive (34), of taking away a man's rights in matters pertinent to the Lord (35), and of undoing a man in his cause (36). What one can make a thing occur when God refuses to command its happening (37)? God does not speak both right and wrong (38). Why should any one murmur against punishment that comes to him for his sin (39)? The Interim's star-members exhorted to selfexamination and self-proving, and then to return to God from wandering from Him (40), to prayer to the Lord above from the heart (41), to confession of sin and rebellion, which He had not forgiven (42). God was much displeased with His people and pursued them with punishment. He had cut them off from Him and not shown them pity (43); yea, He hid Himself from them that their prayers might not reach Him (44). They have been made as reprobates and off casts from among the people (45). False religionists have caused their mouthpieces to speak against God's people, especially against the star-members (46). Fear and traps, ruin and overthrow have been their portion (47). The starmembers deeply grieved for the overthrow of God's people (48). Unremittingly and unceasingly they experienced sorrow (49).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Until the Lord took note, looking down from His throne (50), their knowledge distressed their disposition on account of all God's people (51). Their theological enemies pursued them very hard, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Athanasius did so to Arius; Bernard to Abelard; Eck to Luther; Toplady to Wesley, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.,</span><span class="font3"> even as hunters hunt birds (52). They had shortened their lives by their restraints and hurled their teachings at them (53). Their afflictions became so severe that they sank almost to despair (54). But they called upon the Lord out of their degraded restraint, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> ten of the star-members of the Philadelphia Epoch, from Luther to Miller, in their blindness and restraint, bringing out the things of the Word for sectarians (55). The Lord responded to their prayer; they pleaded that God turn not a deaf ear to their pantings and supplications (56). The Lord mercifully drew near to them when they called upon Him, and bade them not to be afraid (57). They were enabled, by God's answers, to acknowledge that God took their side as new creatures, and delivered them as such (58). They saw that God took note of the wrongs done them; therefore they prayed that He vindicate their cause (59). They recognized that God had taken note of all the acts of vengeance wrought by their opponents, and of all the latter's evil surmises against the star-members (60). They recognized that God had given attention to their many reproaches against them and all the charges that their minds surmised against them (61), even the doctrines of those who arose as opponents against them and their plots against them throughout the Interim (62). They asked God to take note of their ceasing and of their beginning to oppose the starmembers; since these were the subjects of their discussions (63). The hard labors of the Interim's star-members, occasioned by their enemies' attacks and errors, appealed to God to give these adversaries a punishment commensurate with the evil deeds that they wrought (64). Their sufferings also appealed to God to mete out their opponents' deep grief; and as the bulk of these were willful sinners, the starmembers' sufferings appealed to God to devote them to condign punishment, (65). These sufferings appealed to God to follow these evil-doers to a completion, and in God's displeasure to cut them off from life, since most of them were second-deathers (66).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In chapter 4 the star-members again take up the sad plight of God's captive people at the hands of the Babylonians during the Interim. The Divine things given by Jesus and the Apostles became darkened in the Interim, even those of the Most Holy. The members of the Church were scattered at the beginning of every concourse of the Church as a religious government, and thus the brethren were separated among the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">sects (4: 1). God's children, new-creaturely Divine vessels of grace, were disesteemed as but humans, those of human origins (2). Even the most beastly of antichrists nourished their babes; but God's people in this respect became cruelly treated, as the loveless and careless clerics forsook their young in isolation (3). The babes were allowed to starve from lack of spiritual milk; and the but slightly developed longed for the bread of life, which none broke for them (4). Those who once had the most luxurious spiritual food are deprived of food in the concourses of God's religious government; and those robed in the precious robe of Christ's righteousness partake of refuse as spiritual food (5). God's people in the long Interim were treated worse for their errors than the punishment of the sins of Christendom, overthrown quickly in the time of trouble; and none leaned on them for support (6). The star-members were of pure character in their righteousness. They were full of justice in their sacrifice and were therein developed in love (7). But their teachings were regarded as the darkest of error. They were not recognized as travelers over the concourses of God's religious government. They were regarded as starvelings, dried up and lifeless as to grace (8). Those refuted were more favored than those starved for lack of spiritual food; for these gradually weaken unto spiritual death for lack of the bread of life (9). Sects that pitied their young had, in the spiritual famine, arranged to devour their babes in grace, who became the food of the sects as God's people went to ruin under Babylonian blows (10). The Lord worked out His punishments for wrong; He meted out the stripes of His displeasure. He set destruction into operation in His Church as light-shiner, and had consented by Babylonian theologians to the overthrow of its Apostles and Prophets as its foundation (11). Worldly movements and people would not have believed it possible that an inimical state and nominal church could have passed through those who admitted people into</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">756 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God's religious government (12). This was due to the sins of its alleged teachers and the errors of its alleged leaders, murderers of prominent saints (13).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They wandered in error in the concourses of God's people without insight into the Word; they defiled themselves with the murder of God's saints, resulting in men refusing to be contaminated with their defiled characteristics (14). These cried out to others of them to avoid such unclean persons, urgently pressing their charge, lest they become contaminated by the contact. These evil ones betook themselves in their flight into error to the heathen, who said among one another that such depraved characters should not be allowed in their midst (15). God's displeasure at these evil ones scattered them from one another. He held them in high disfavor; for they regarded not the true main leaders of God's people, nor favored their minor leaders (16). But as for the Lord's people, their powers of perception failed because of their delusive hope of help. They looked for help from the civil powers of the present evil world as antitypical Egypt, which could give them no assistance (17). Instead, under the lead of the apostate church, they hunted with persecuting intent God's people, so that they dared not show themselves among the concourses of God's nominal people. Their destruction approached nearer and nearer; their lives were drawing to a close; and their exit from life was at hand (18). With great speed did the persecutors of God's people go about their persecuting work, going with speed after them in the kingdoms of Satan's empire and in their isolation (19). Their teachers who ministered life to them, as the especially anointed of the Lord, the star-members, were the special objects of their false slanders, the class of whom God's people said that under their protecting ministries they would continue, even God's nominal people (20). God's people did not begrudge the joy and gladness of those in harmony with Christendom, who were protected by the secular power (Uz, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">strength)</span><span class="font3"> They knew that in</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">due time these would have to drink of the cup of God's wrath, stupefied in error and exposed as evildoers (21). In due time the Lord would complete the punishment of the sins of His people. It came gradually and progressively, having a small beginning in the Sardis period by the reformation through individuals, a large increase during the Philadelphia period through its twelve Little Flock movements and its completion during the Parousia. God would never again allow them to become captives in Great Babylon; but He would punish the errors of Christendom by permitted publicity and exposure of its sins by pertinent secular and religious truths, and by the troubles of the time of wrath would complete the exposure of its wickedness unto its standing stark naked as an evildoer (22).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Chapter 5 particularizes the chief woes of God's people at Babylon's hands during the Interim. Mindful of the blessed conditions of the Apostolic period, they, during the Interim, prayed God to consider their experiences after the Apostolic times, pleading that He give it His special attention, especially the reproaches that fell to them (1). Their Truth and their Spirit became the property of strangers who turned them into counterfeits, and their condition of justification as the Court was trodden down by aliens (2). They were motherless and fatherless, and their nourishers were bereaved of their supporters and leaders (3). They had to serve sorely for whatever refreshment they got, and for whatever warmth became theirs in a cold world of indifference to them (4). Their wills were persecuted; they were ground down by weighty burdens, and enjoyed no peace (5). They had to pledge fealty to the secular and papal and sectarian powers to be given sustenance (6). Their predecessors did evil and ceased to be; and they, their descendants, had to suffer for their errors (7). Even the lowliest tyrannized over them; and none delivered them out of their power (8). To get some of the Truth could only be at peril to life and limb, because of the controversial arguments that the errorists made against them in their isolation (9). Their view of things was dark with error because of the frightful spiritual famine (10). They humbled the ecclesias of the Church and the consecrated in the sects of the nominal church (11). Their main leaders, by the power of their adversaries, were publicly set forth as evildoers, and their subordinate leaders were dishonored (12). The warriors were made to grind out the spiritual wheat for sectarians; and the undeveloped were given burdens too heavy for them to bear (13). The leaders had to hide away from the public and the warriors from controversial message (14). The joys of the Truth had ceased, and conduct harmonious with it gave way to sadness, inconducive to the flourishing of the graces (15). Movements favored by God as the sign of the royalty of God's people had fallen away from them; and wretchedness became theirs for their errors (16). Therefore, their courage was weak and their perception was darkened (17). Because the Church as the light-shining embryo Kingdom was a desolation, error and wrong stalked amid their ruins (18). Yet they recognized God's eternal existence, and His royal authority perpetually (19). They asked why God had so perpetually given them no favorable attention, and had so long left them desolate (20). They prayed throughout the Interim, especially in the Philadelphia Epoch, for Him to return to them His favor, which would make them favored indeed, pleading that He might restore to them the experiences of the Apostolic Age (21). But throughout the Interim they recognized that He had quite rejected them, and was displeased with them for their predecessors and their errors and sins (22).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since Ps. 74 and 80, as well as Ps. 137, treat of much of the same matter as Lamentations, we will close our exposition of it with a brief paraphrase of them, as we began it with a brief paraphrase of Ps. 137, paraphrasing Ps. 80 first. Both Psalms apply to the Interim first and then to the Epiphany. We will</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">give only the Interim applications. The Lord's people in the Interim invoked God to cause the Truth to go forth in enlightenment as their Caretaker, as the One that led the Apostolic Church in Little Flockship, and as the One who worked in wisdom, power, justice and love, as typed by the Shekinah light, the cherubim and the mercy seat (1). They prayed that God exercise His power in the Truth before His Sardis Church, before His Philadelphia Church and before the approaching Laodicean Church, that He might give them His saving power (2). They pleaded that He return to them and grant them His favor, whereby they would be saved (3). They begged to know how long it would be that God would not be displeased with His people's prayer (4). He gave them only sorrows for food and drink in large measure (5). They recognized that God made them an object of strife among those near them and that their adversaries laughed at them among one another (6). Repeating the thoughts, yea, almost the very words of v. 3, they pleaded with God to return to them, and to grant them His favor, whereby He might give them His saving power (7). Like a vine to bear fruit, God brought His people out of the present evil world and drove out sin, error, selfishness and worldliness from their minds, hearts and wills, and firmly put them into the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit (8). He gave them a sufficient condition for them as New Creatures to live and prosper, developed them deeply in the Truth and in its Spirit; and they spread out over the entire sphere of the Truth and its Spirit (9). They spread over the countries of the world as a protection to them as the salt of the earth, and in each one became multiplied as developed out of the justified class (10). They became active among those sinners who restlessly developed rebellion against God and His principles and among the more orderly of the peoples (11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">They asked God for an explanation as to why the Spirit, Word and providences of God as protectors of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His people have been broken down from being such protectors, with the result that all passersby do them injury (12). They declare that the lawless man of sin, coming out from among the great ones of earth, had trampled them down to utter waste, and that the ferocious civil power of Christendom consumed them (13). They prayed earnestly to God to return to them, and to give close attention and renew His favor to His people (14) and to the sphere of the Truth and its Spirit, which by Christ He filled with God's people, and to every member of them once made by God strong for Himself (15). By Babylon had God's people been ruined in destruction; they were cut down as God's people by the Babylonian theologians, hierarchy and clergy, supported by their followers. By the withdrawal of God's favor as a rebuke, God's people perish (16). They pray that God's chief power rest upon Jesus for Second Advent purposes, as the One of His chief favor, even upon Him as Adam's chief descendant whom God exalted as His Vicegerent (17). This would result in God's people no more apostatizing from Him. Then they pleaded that He might energize them, that they might pray to God and be to His glory (18). For a third time in the language of vs. 3 and 7 they entreated God to return to them, to grant them His favor, whereby He might give them His saving power. In v. 3 they address Him as God, in v. 7 as God of hosts and in v. 19 as Jehovah God of hosts, the emphasis on God being thus increased each time, but otherwise the three verses read just alike, and the repetition serves to emphasize the requests, as is also done in the progressive additions that they make as to God, v. 3 applying to the pre-Sardis, 7, to the Sardis and v. 19 to the Philadelphia period of the Interim. As we think over Ps. 137 and 80 and Lamentations in the light of the foregoing expositions, we cannot but recognize how deeply our dear Interim brethren and starmembers suffered; and when we realize the small fulfilment of these three Scriptures in the Epiphany we</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">can also recognize the same of God's Epiphany Little Flock and the Epiphany star-member.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ps. 74, treating of the experiences of God's people during the Interim, also gives the same general lines of thought as Ps. 137 and 80, viewed, however, from a somewhat different angle. Its divisions are the following: Vs. 1-11 treat of their, mistreatment during the Interim; vs. 12-17 speak of God's works on behalf of His people during the Jewish Harvest, as the basis of their plea for deliverance, and vs. 18-23 contain a prayer for their deliverance. They asked whether God was going to cast them off in Babylon endlessly, and why His displeasure continued against them as His people, who had fed upon His Word (1). They pleaded that He remember in mercy His Church, bought by Christ's precious blood long before, His heritage that He delivered from the present evil world, His embryo religious government as the light of the world, and God's own dwelling (2). They desired that He make His delivering acts turn to His long desolated Church, even all the desolations of His sanctuary wrought wickedly by God's and His people's opponents (3). These opponents agitated fiercely in His ecclesias, and set up their creeds as teachings victorious over God's people (4). Babylon's theologians, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Cerinthus who opposed John, Athanasius who opposed Arius, Theodemir who opposed Claudius of Turin, Alvarus Pelagius who opposed Marsiglio, the Cologne inquisitors who opposed John Wessel, the ones here mentioned as being opposed being the five principal men of the Interim, got themselves great reputations in Babylonian church circles for using their controversial weapons against the Interim star-members and their special helpers (5). These devastated the ornaments of teaching and practice belonging to the true Church by their refutational and constructive teachings (6). They were destructive against the true Church, and with their errors defiled it, and by their misrepresentations degraded it (7). They, with all the power of their affections and volitions, determined to destroy it, and did destroy all the true Church's ecclesias everywhere (8). The true brethren saw no more their teachings; nor for long intervals did they have general teachers; nor did they have in their midst any one understanding time prophecy (9). With deep feeling, they sought from the Lord to know how long inimical controversialists would, by their errors, reproach God, the Truth and the brethren. Especially did they plead with God over the matter of how long such foes would continue victoriously to teach things vilifying God's character. Would it last forever (10)? They were filled with questions as to why God withdrew His power, yea, even Christ Himself, from delivering them. They pleaded with God actively to send Him to work for their rescue (11). Vs. 1217 contain statements revelatory of the Church's calling to mind God's Jewish-harvest dealings with His people (&quot;We wept when we remembered Zion&quot;). Then God was Zion's king, doing works of salvation everywhere in society (12). He then made a breach in the curse, so that, by justification through faith God's people passed through unscathed (13). Satan's thoughts God then utterly overthrew, and made him to be spoil for His people in their isolation (14). God then overthrew Jewish hierarchism and its effects, devastated its errors and traditions, and also those of heathen Rome (15). That was a time given over to God, even as the Interim also was in His power; for God had then given the Truth and the New Testament (16). Then God arranged the conditions of society, and used the reaping time and the trouble time of that Harvest for His purposes (17). Vs. 18-23 show that God's Interim people pleaded for deliverance, expressing in v. 18 the same thoughts as in v. 10, except that in v. 18 the nominal-church laity are also included among the blasphemers of God's character. They pleaded that, as God's guileless beloved One, their being be not given up to the many wicked ones, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">asked that God forget not His humble Church (19), pleading that He give attention to His covenant; for the erroneous and sinful parts of society were full of cruel institutions and individuals, like persecuting governments and rulers, inquisitions and inquisitors, monasticism and monks, and universities and professors (20). They prayed that God's oppressed people do not return from Babylonian captivity in shame, so that the humble and necessitous of God's people might reflect credit upon Him by explaining His plan of wisdom, power, justice and love (21). They pleaded with God to become active in defense of His own person, character, plan and work, and while so doing, to keep in mind how the man of sin misrepresented Him continually (22), pleading with Him not to forget the teachings of His opponents; for the lawlessnesses and outbreaks of His opponents against Him kept increasing always (23). Surely this Psalm describes some of the Interim's untoward experiences of God's people, and has an application to the Epiphany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ATHALIAH AND JOASH—TYPE AND ANTITYPE </span><span class="font2">2 KINGS 11: 1—12: 21; 2 CHRON. 22: 10—24: 27</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">AS promised in the foreword, we treat of a specialized antitype, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> Athaliah and Joash. From this standpoint Athaliah </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(whom Jehovah afflicts)</span><span class="font3"> represents the American Romanist Church from about 1881 to 1928; Jehoiada </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Jehovah knows)</span><span class="font3"> usually the Christ, Head and Body, but sometimes the Head only, from about 1881 to 1932; and Jehoash, or Joash </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(God-given),</span><span class="font3"> the American policy of separation of state and church. The American Romanist Church, by riots, boycotts, intimidations, by securing the cancellation of leases for auditoriums, by censoring the press and by denunciation and misrepresentation of antiRomanist propaganda, greatly limited the exercise of the freedom of press, speech, assembly and propaganda (2 K. 11: 1; 2 C. 22: 10). To save space we abbreviate 2 Kings to 2 K. and 2 Chro. to 2 C., as, for the same reason, we will not refer to the words commented on, but only to the number of the chapter and verse, even omitting the chapter number after its first mention, giving the Kings citations first, when used, and, if it or a Chronicles citation is lacking, indicating it by a semicolon. Therefore our brief comments will have to be studied with constant reference to the Bible, which should be kept open at the chapters and verses commented upon. Or, better still, two Bibles may be used, one opened to the pertinent passage in 2 Kings, the other to the pertinent passage in 2 Chronicles. But the doctrine of the bill of rights in the U.S. Constitution, united as a symbolic wife with the Lord Jesus, through its supporters preserved by stealth from such limitation the religious exercise of the policy of separation of state and church, which with its supporters had, however, to be protected by more or less secret methods, and thus preserved it despite the threats of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">American Romanist Church, which was in the meantime (1881-1920) in ever-increasing ascendancy (2; 11). But from 1920 to 1928 the Christ, Head and Body, strengthened the Body for the overthrow of such a condition. To this end the Christ enlisted the cooperation of the leading warriors among the four bad and the one good Levite groups, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font3">(1) the Societyites, the P.B.I.'tes, the Standfasts and the Olsonites, and (2) the crown-losers in the Epiphany movement (4; 23: 1). These five warrior leaderships enlisted for this purpose among the American Truth people all the crown-losers of the various groups that they could get and brought them in thought to civil, financial and ecclesiastical America (4; 2); the Christ, through the articles on Romanism in the 1922 Herald of the Epiphany coming to a solemn agreement with them as to America, civil, financial and ecclesiastical, on standing faithfully for the doctrine of the separation of state and church, which was truly expounded to them in those articles, all gathered up in the Double Herald, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> the Sept., 1922, issue, whole number 14, which we will reproduce in the last part of this Appendix, and which He guaranteed should come to the ascendancy (4; 3).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(2) The Christ divided these into three groups, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> (1) those who should watch and fight as to the political aspects of the questions at issue, (2) those who would be public speakers on the subjects, and (3) those who would support the Epiphany brethren in their part of the fight, with those outside of the Truth movements doing their part among the outsiders, the chief and subordinate leaders being the only ones permitted to serve in a most public capacity (5, 6; 46). This especial care of God's House, the Church, in connection with the pertinent doctrine was to be with the main and subordinate leaders (7). These were especially to guard with their Truth arguments the doctrine of the separation of state and church and to refute everyone who would attempt its injury (8; 7). The five</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">leaderships, even the main and subordinate leaders, did as the Christ, Head and Body, charged, including all who served in the Church, whose spiritual ministries were not interrupted during this quasi-secular and religious conflict (9; 8). The Christ, Head and Body, gave to the five leaderships the pertinent offensive and defensive writings (spears and shields) of our Pastor and the pertinent writings based on our Pastor's writings (Double Herald, Elijah's Letter and John's Rebuke [bucklers], 10; 9). The Epiphany brethren, the only ones fully equipped for the conflict, as the guard of God's House, covered in their part of the conflict the full features of the controversy as it involved the Church, its sacrificial humanity and the doctrine of the separation of state and church (11; 10). The participants in the fight so placed, the Lord Jesus, as Head of the priesthood, set forth the Truth on the separation of church and state, gave it the right and power to be in the ascendancy, and with the underpriesthood qualified it thereto, expressing their hearty approval by their services and the desire of their heart that it would prosper (12; 11). The pertinent proclamations of the Epiphany brethren and of outsiders, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> anti-Romanist orders, societies, etc., and anti-Romanist authors, editors, lecturers, etc., came to the attention of the American Romanist Church; and in hostility she came against these, even in their religious standing (13; 12). Here she witnessed the doctrine of the separation of state and church set forth as starting out to be in the ascendancy, even as was customary in such cases, the Truth leaders and their announcements in support of the pertinent ascendant doctrine and many secularist defenders of the pertinent doctrine rejoicingly proclaiming it. Thereupon she grossly violated Truth and righteousness in her protests; and she who was traitorous to the Constitution's bill of rights charged with treason those who defended its provisions against her treasons against them (14; 13).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(3) Thereupon the Christ, Head and Body, charged the Truth leaders not to refute her on religious, but on secular grounds, her dabbling into politics, i. e„ to refute political Romanism, and charged them to refute with their religious and secular Truth everyone that arose to support her (15; 14). This charge was carried out, the leaders and their followers avoiding to attack her religious doctrines, and thus letting her pass beyond these to her secular politics, and in relation to such secular doctrines they refuted her (16; 15). The Christ, Head and Body, united the people and the doctrine of the separation of state and church into an agreement with the Lord to stand as His people on this matter, as He also united the people and this doctrine into an agreement (17; 16). These events marked the years 1922-1927. It will be recalled that the American hierarchy, led therein by the pope, sought in the person of Al Smith to seize the American presidency, and thus its governmental machinery, and thus get more political power, but the consequent anti-Romanism agitation of real Americans—&quot;the religious issue&quot;—of the 1928 presidential campaign broke up the hierarchy's elaborated religious structure in its power-grasping and lording aspects over the American people, made impotent its exponents in their propaganda, shattered their pertinent political doctrines and killed the hierarchy in its pertinent ambition and activity (18; 17). This was followed by the Lord Jesus' arranging for more servants of the general Church to be put into the office of pilgrims, auxiliary pilgrims and evangelists, according to the Bible and according to the Lord's arrangements made through that Servant, as can be seen in the ever-increasing numbers of such reported in our annual reports (; 18), and He also set up in official positions brethren to keep unclean Levites away from the fellowship of the Faithful (; 19). The Lord used the fivefold Levitical leaderships, the refuters and the faithful Epiphany brethren, all of whom were in the places of prominence and influence in their respective groups, and also participating non-Truth people, to take the doctrine of the separation of state and church from its ascendant religious position, by way of the Epiphany brethren, to its proper ascendant secular position, which it thereupon occupied (19; 20). This happy result, occurring during Mr. Hoover's administration (1929-1933), caused real Americans joy and thus on secular ascendant grounds these by the pertinent secular truths refuted the American Romanist Church, and on this subject peace prevailed (20; 21). These four years were indeed famine years for the Romanists so far as gaining special privileges in American political offices and influence are concerned.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3">(4) While the starting of Joash's reign is put chronologically in the seventh year of Jehu's reign, and while in the antitype this time feature is true in the two parallels above mentioned, yet we are not to understand the relation to be such from the standpoint of the separate and unrelated fulfillments, one of which we are now studying, and others of which have this same peculiarity in common with it. The policy of the separation of state and church had a particularly trialsome time as its ascendancy period; it grew out of that doctrine implied in the Oath-bound Covenant which requires that the Church be separate from the world (21; 2 K. 12: 1; 2 C. 24: 1). This policy was by its adherents well administered as long as they continued under the teaching influence of the World's High Priest (2; 2). Nevertheless, the sects of Christendom were not during its ascendancy taken away, and the multitudes continued to perform their religious services in these sects (3;). As helpers of this policy the World's High Priest gave it two supporting classes: (1) sympathetic Truth people and (2) sympathetic non-Truth people, through whom it developed stronger and weaker supporting movements (;3). The disposition of this policy in its adherents was to restore the privileges and powers of the Church from the desolations wrought by the adherents of the wicked American Romanist Church in diverting these privileges and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">powers to the Romanist hierarchy's structure (; 4, 7). The World's High Priest and this policy in its adherents suggested to the main and subordinate Truth leaders whom they had assembled for this purpose that they enlist the human all of the consecrated and seek to win other believers to consecration, so that as many as possible would bestow of their human all to restore to the Church its desolated privileges and powers, a thing that they were charged to hasten with fitting zeal, this feature of the work being mainly committed to the main leaders to superintend, but the main and subordinate leaders, lacking the necessary zeal, did not hasten this work, with the result that it lagged (4, 5; 4, 5). Indeed, during a long period (1922 to about 1929) there was gross lack of zeal displayed by the main and subordinate Levite leaders among Truth people; and, resultantly, the others were grossly lacking in zeal to repair the true Church in the indicated respects (6;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(5) Noring this lack of zeal, the policy of the separation of state and church, in its adherents, gathered the World's High Priest in His Body members and the main Levite leaders and asked them why they were not inciting the consecrated to carry out their consecration and the justified to consecrate according to the Lord's Word on behalf of repairing the breaches in the Church (7; 6). It, in its adherents, forbade these to take for their own advantage of the human all of the consecrated; instead it charged them to make their own and the other consecrateds' own available to recover the Church from the ill effects of the American Romanist Church's ascendancy (7). Thereupon the main Levitical leaders agreed not to make selfish uses of their own and their brethren's human rights and privileges, and agreed to refrain from attempting to do the work that belonged to the Little Flock specifically (8;). According to the pertinent doctrine's demand, they set forth the doctrine of consecration in harmony with the thought of the sacrificed humanity</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">of Christ and the Church, connecting it with the doctrine of justification as it belongs to the prospective Youthful Worthies; and the main leaders, who occupied themselves with the doctrines of justification and consecration, induced responsive ones to consecrate (9; 8). This led to a general proclamation of consecration and a winning of Youthful Worthies (; 9). This resulted in a joyful consecration of the abler and less able of the responsive ones, even to a completion (; 10). And as these consecrations greatly increased, the special repre sentative of the antitypical king and the special representative of the Church's High Priest took these consecrated ones into their special charge, set them in their ecclesias and continued to present the doctrine of consecration in its relation to that of justification, continuing this course right along, with the result that many consecrations were made and carried out (10; 11). The antitypical king and the High Priest made the human all of the consecrated available for the use of the repairers of the breaches in the Lord's house, by enlisting the services of those who wrought in matters of doctrine and ethics and of refutations and corrections for the repair of the Church (11, 12; 12). The Levitical leaders, however, did not develop the doctrinal, preceptorial, refutational, correctional or proclamational Divine truths (13;), since they superintended the consecration works on the Church (14;). Nor did they require a strict accounting from the workers, who, put upon their honor, wrought faithfully (15;). But the main leaders accepted for their needs such parts of the consecrations as were given them for their personal needs, which, therefore, did not go to the general upbuilding work of the Church (16;).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(6) In this way the work on the Church progressed to a completion as to repairing the Rome-made breaches; and the true Church was set forth properly and in strength (; 13). The parts of the consecrated human all, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> mental acquisitions and abilities, not so used were presented before the antitypical king and</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">the High Priest, who through His Epiphany messenger developed the doctrinal, ethical, refutational and correctional Divine truths for the use of the Church and the antitypical Levites in the ministries given them severally to perform; and under the superintendence of the World's High Priest all ministered with these in the Church continually during the pertinent activities of the World's High Priest (; 14). But these activities came to an end, about the Summer of 1932. And the pertinent activities of the World's High Priest in relation to the separation of state and church were honored by the believers as being in harmony with that Servant's ascendant teachings, because of their inherent and active goodness for God's people, for God and the true Church (; 15, 16). But after such activities had come to an end, American political and religious leaders gave the doctrine of separation of state and church lip service merely, and advised a course that corrupted it. This set in during the 1932 presidential campaign, when political leaders, like Messrs. Roosevelt, Morley, Tugwell, etc., and religious leaders, like Cardinal Mundelein, Hughes, priest Coughlin, etc., as representatives of the Romanist hierarchy, corrupted and undermined the practice of the separation of state and church (; 17). Consequently these and their supporters pursued a course that abandoned the true Church in its pertinent principles and works, practiced symbolic harlotry between the State and the Romanist Church, and accepted certain of the latter's doctrines, particularly autocracy in the state and hierarchical influence over the officials of the state, which has been resulting in the Lord's displeasure coming upon America and its civil and religious powers because of these sins (; 18). Our longsuffering and loving God did not utterly forsake America for these wrongs; but through the Epiphany movement, the antitypical Elisha (the good as distinct from the Rutherfordian Societyites) and other Truth people's movements the Lord has sent pertinent teachings, rebukes and corrections to America,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to bring it back to the proper practice of the separation of state and church, but, alas! America in its ruling, political, financial and religious classes has refused to heed these teachings (; 19).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(7) Our exposition has now brought us up to the present; and from here on we will in this study take up things that are to occur in the very near future. Under the influence of God's Spirit the Epiphany messenger in his office as such will write and publish in the form of an Extra Edition of the July 15, 1940, Herald of the Epiphany, Whole No. 121, an exposure of the pertinent evils, an expostulation against them and an announcement that America's forsaking the Lord in this matter has brought a continuance of the depression upon it, and, worst of all, its forsaking by God for its forsaking Him (; 20). This will result in the American Romanist Church conspiring with the American Federation of Churches (in this general act these seem also to be pictured by Herodias and Salome), and, at the charge of the state (in this general act it seems also to be pictured by Herod), hurling false teachings and charges at him, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., </span><span class="font3">charging him with being an intolerant bigot, a stirrer up of religious prejudice and strife, an evil-doer, a false prophet, a fifth-columnist, a traitor to his country and to Christianity, and thus will effect the suppression of his influence and activity as a Divinely-used mouthpiece to the public (v. 25 shows that the rest of the priesthood will at the same time be cut off from public mouthpiece ship, thus likely completing the picture as typed by the beheading of John the Baptist). This will be done publicly, before the nominal people of God (; 21). Thus will be proven that there will he forgotten the Lord Jesus' goodness to America in its policy of the separation of state and church, when the cormpted and misled adherents of that policy cause to be cut off His special representative from his mouthpiece ship to the public. The latter while being so cut off will call attention to the fact that the Lord is regarding this</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">matter, and will make requisition therefore [see Dr. Young's better than the A. V. rendering] (; 22). Quickly will the Lord's wrath express itself for the cutting off of the true Church from public mouthpieceship; for after antitypical Hazael has defeated antitypical Jehoram (Hazael giving Jehoram many wounds, 2 K. 8: 28, 29), it will require antitypical Joash (Jehoash) to pay for its support of antitypical Jehoram against antitypical Hazael by everything short of war; and after the latter's overcoming the papacy for similar support of antitypical Jehoram, it will set its face against political, financial and ecclesiastical Joash (17; ) and make a campaign against these ruling classes in their disloyalty to the practice of separation of state and church. They will come against antitypical Judah and Jerusalem and cut off their political, financial and ecclesiastical leaders from among their adherents (; 23).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">(8) In antitypical Hazael's paganism he will devastate the good religious things of America benevolently independent, America evilly reactionary, America apostately autocratic and America properly separate from church. Furthermore, antitypical Joash, ecclesiastical, financial and political, will be required to pay to antitypical Hazael an immense indemnity, which will undoubtedly include its immense gold and silver reserves<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark88">2</a></sup>, to bribe antitypical Hazael to raise its siege of antitypical Jerusalem, political, financial and ecclesiastical, by compliance with which the latter will secure the former's raising of the said siege (18; 23). With only a small host will the former by God's retributive justice accomplish these things, despite the latter's immense opposing resources in men and materials, all because of the latter's apostasy from pure Americanism on the separation of state and church and its cutting off of God's mouthpiece—the true Church—from its public ministry for protesting and expostulating against, and forecasting Divine retribution for, that apostasy (; 24). And when antitypical Hazael will leave these apostates from true Americanism, these will be in greatest distress, disunion and impotency. Yea, former supporters of these apostates in their apostasy, the Lord raising them up thereto to wreak vengeance for their cutting off the true Church from its public ministry, will conspire against them, while they, greatly wounded, will be taking a rest on some fortified theory of theirs, and will overthrow them (20; 25). These conspirators will be certain clericalistic members of the Feder affair of Churches and certain autocratic members of the Romanist Church, but the policy of separation of state and church will be respected as one in harmony with that Servant's teachings, but not with all due honor on account of its apostasy in its adherents (21; 26, 25). The historical acts of this policy, especially of its various subdivisions, of its furthering the work of the Lord's people before its adherents forsook it and of the great indemnity put upon its adherents, in some cases are and in other cases will be recorded by American historians (19; 27). Another American policy is typed by Amaziah, the successor of Joash (21; 27). We now reproduce Herald No. 121, which was used to give a testimony against the cooperation between the state and the Romanist Church in America.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this principle was maintained, generally speaking, inviolate up to the time of the Arthur administration (1881-1885), since when, and up to 1921, gradually and increasingly there arose a working cooperation, a quasi-alliance, between our public officials and the Romanist church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Romanist church's acts toward and of that quasi-alliance, and her ambition &quot;to get America,&quot; with her ultimate design to effect an actual union of the state and herself in America, are seen in the following things increasingly done during the years 1881-1921: (1) training her American members to believe in the union of state and church, (2) contrary to her history and principles expressing great admiration for Democracy and the institutions of American Democracy, (3) influencing her members to vote as a bloc, as she directs, (4) putting her members as such into political office, (5) putting her dependables, whether Romanists or not, into strategic positions in all kinds of public capacities, (6) using her orders, political clubs, societies, etc., to secure her pertinent ambitions, (7) entering into deals and bargains with statesmen, politicians and officials, (8) creating an atmosphere compelling aspiring statesmen, politicians and officials to recognize and advance her designs, (9) using national, state and municipal officials to give her favors, publicity and prestige, (10) seeking through legislative, judicial and administrative agents to overthrow her opponents and their use of the freedom of press, speech, propaganda and assembly, (11) manipulating</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for her interests, prestige and designs the instruments of publicity—newsgathering agencies, the press, movies, radio, lecture platform, professorial chairs, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.</span><span class="font3"> (12) wheedling from national, state and municipal funds financial aid for her hospitals, schools, Indian missions, etc., (13) stimulating Romanist immigration, urbanizing and citizenizing her immigrants rapidly and sending them to the polls to vote in her interests; and (14) cultivating her parochial schools, and attempting to de-Americanize and devitalize our public schools with a measure of success?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that sensing the drift of these fourteen things, patriots from 1922 to 1928 set into operation counteractive measures, culminating in the agitation against the Romanist hierarchy's 1928 presidential candidate, Al Smith, whose defeat they accomplished, because they believed that- the hierarchy sought through his election to seize control of the U.S. governmental machinery?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the four years, 1929-1933, of Mr. Hoover's administration were famine years for the Romanist hierarchy, during which years the hierarchy would, at the political trough, &quot;fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the hierarchy, starved as to special U.S. political privileges during Mr. Hoover's administration and from their experience with Mr. Roosevelt's favoring them during his N.Y. governorship, knowing that with him as president they would &quot;come to their own,&quot; as they put it, gave him the Romanist vote in a practically solid bloc in the 1932 election, as they did again in 1936 and would do it a third time, if he runs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the pertinent facts of Mr. Roosevelt's administration and those of the Romanist church during it prove that that church has &quot;come into its own&quot; in and from a quasi-alliance with him and certain members of his administration, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> a working</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1. </span><span class="font3">understanding, a close cooperation, between them, more patent by far than the earlier quasi-alliance between that church and American statesmen, politicians and officeholders?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that after priest Coughlin, who vouched for the fact, had interpreted to him the labor encyclicals of popes Leo XIII and Pius XI, he in his Detroit speech during the 1932 campaign, in giving his views of a new deal for labor, asserted that they were sanctioned by these popes, &quot;the highest religious authority on earth,&quot; which statement solidified the vote of the hierarchy and their following for him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that his course abounds with acts that prove that the American Romanist church through its main representatives, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Cardinal Mundelein, has been his chief adviser since 1932?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that at the advice of the hierarchy he advocated the New Deal in both of his presidential campaigns, and has since his first election introduced various forms of it into Congress and made a subservient Congress enact them as &quot;must legislation,&quot; both in its autocratic features and in its benevolent features, the former of which are plainly unconstitutional, and the latter of which are very praiseworthy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he appointed many prominent Romanist university professors and priests to high and influential offices on various of his boards and administrations, particularly on certain boards that have to do with labor matters, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Walsh, Ryan and Haas, a thing that was formerly unheard of, he doubtless reasoning and that rightly, that they, as priests and Romanist university professors, would have commanding influence in conciliating striking or near-striking labor, whose leaders often are Romanists?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he has appointed to key positions (from Rome's standpoint) Romanists, like Mr. James Farley as postmaster general, Messrs. T.J. Walsh and F. Murphy as attorney generals, the latter to the U.S. Supreme Court, Mr. J.P. Kennedy as the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ambassador to Great Britain and priest O'Hara, president of Notre Dame University, as a U.S. delegate to the PanAmerican Congress at Lima, Pem?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he has advanced to various political offices, particularly to various of his bureaus, a disproportionate number of Romanists, as gestures to the Romanist church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he told &quot;Elder Statesman&quot; C. Michelson that if he did not appoint a Romanist (F. Murphy) to the Supreme Court in the place of deceased Romanist P. Butler, the Romanists would raise tumultuous protests?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that to appoint fit persons, regardless of denominational affiliations, to public office is unobjectionable to one imbued with real Americanism; but that to appoint any one to public office because of his denominational affiliations, particularly if the appointment is urged or given as such because of that denomination's past or future support or boycott, is highly objectionable, since it smacks of the union of state and church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he has lost no opportunity to praise, and that in over-eulogistic terms, the Romanist church, members of her hierarchy, priests and prominent laymen, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Cardinals Mundelein and Hayes, Archbishop Curley, Bishops Sheil and Walsh, priest Coughlin, Messrs. Smith, Kennedy, Walker, etc., the Franciscan Fathers for their work in the Mississippi Valley, the Catholic Notre Dame, Carroll, etc., universities, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he has especially honored and continues especially to honor Romanist hierarchists, priests, university professors and prominent laymen </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as Romanists </span><span class="font3">on many occasions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Cardinal Mundelein, whom he entertained as house guest at the White House and at his Hyde Park mansion, often closeting himself with him, seeking his counsel, causing U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Philips, his counselor and the U.S. naval attache to meet him on his</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">steamer at its arrival in the Bay of Naples, taking him off the steamer before it reached its wharf into a U.S. naval boat, taking him to the flagship of the U.S. fleet where its U: S. Rear-Admiral and other naval officers and crew stood at attention as he came aboard, having the Rear-Admiral entertain him at a feast on his flagship, after which he boarded the train at Naples for Rome, accompanied by the U.S. ambassador, his counselor and naval attache as his escort of honor all the way to Vatican City, and arranging for similar honors at Rome for him and Cardinal Dougherty on the occasion of their arrival for the election of Pius Xi's successor?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that often he entertains such at White House meals, and not infrequently attends their functions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he, a Protestant and a president of a country whose constitution frowns upon a union of state and church, frequently sends personal repre sentatives of his to special Romanist occasions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> he sent Mr. Farley as his personal representative to the jubilee of the New York archdiocese, where Cardinal Hayes presided, whose ring was kissed by the kneeling Mr. Farley while the latter acted as the president's personal representative; that he sent an aide as his personal representative to Cardinal Mundelein's funeral; that he sent Mr. Farley as his personal representative to the New Orleans' Eucharistic Congress, where Mr. Farley, while acting as such, kneeling, kissed Archbishop Rummell's ring, and knelt before Cardinal Mundelein seated on a throne as a prince of the Vatican state and that he also sent our Romanist Ambassador to Britain, J. P. Kennedy, as his personal representative, to the coronation of Pius XII, where, while acting as the presidents personal representative, he, kneeling before the pope and kissing his ring, got the pope's blessing?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, at the hierarchy's and other Romanists' urging, he approached Mexico diplomatically to seek amelioration for the Mexican Romanist hierarchy and church from the Mexican government, that, at the urging of the hierarchy, he, under the coaching of Dr. Walsh, vicegerent of the Jesuit Georgetown University, insisted on Russia's making certain concessions to the papacy before he would enter diplomatic relations with Russia, and that, at the demand of the hierarchy, knowing that the Spanish rebels could get all needed munitions from Germany and Italy, and that the Loyalists could get such only from America, and that only if the embargo were lifted, he prevented the lifting of the embargo on arms for Spain, and thus in part occasioned, as per the American hierarchy's plan, the overthrow of a Democracy, the Spanish Republic, by the Fascist rebels?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that at his and Mr. Hull's blessing, as &quot;amateur diplomats&quot; with a quasi-mission for the U.S., Romanist Bishop Ryan of Omaha and Dr. M. S. Sheehy, head of the religious educational department of the Catholic University (Washington, D. C.), made a ^wasv-diplomatic trip to the South American republics, after which Dr. Sheehy submitted to the U.S. State Department a confidential report of their &quot;amateur diplomacy&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it has been widely reported in the U.S. press, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g,</span><span class="font3"> The New York Times, that in 1932 he promised the hierarchy that, if elected, he would open diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Vatican as soon as public opinion in America could be brought about to it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, conditions not warranting it during his first term, he was reported to have promised it again during his 1936 campaign for re-election?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he has been reminded of this promise as a political debt by various members of the hierarchy, especially by Cardinal Pacelli, now Pius XII, who, according to The New York Times' Rome correspondent, Mr. Arnaldo Cortesi, visited the U.S. during the 1936 campaign to secure from Mr. Roosevelt</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the fulfilment of this promise (mark the psychological time chosen for the cardinal's visit); and the press reported that this was one of the things discussed by him and Mr. Roosevelt when the former visited the latter at his home after his election?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that one year later, in 1937, Cardinal Enrico Gaspari, nephew of the Cardinal Gaspari who with Mr. Mussolini negotiated the Vatican Treaty in 1929, according to a wireless dispatch from Rome to The New York Times, the information having been &quot;learned from good sources at the Vatican,&quot; came to America to prepare &quot;the juridical status for the possible opening of diplomatic relations between the State Department and the Holy See&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the press reported that Cardinal Mundelein, during his last stay at the White House as house guest, just before his last visit to Pius XI, urged Mr. Roosevelt to fulfill his long-standing promise to effect diplomatic relations with the Vatican, in anticipation of which the pope built a $550,000.00 mansion in &quot;embassy row&quot; at Washington for his nuncio?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the secular press announced, and the papal press in America and Rome hailed the appointment of Myron Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican as a step toward the U.S. entering diplomatic relations with the Vatican?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, in harmony with his promise, this appointment seems to be a feeler, a trial balloon, to enable him to weigh how public sentiment would react to the thought of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Vatican?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, if this is his thought, he has learned that his course of appointing Mr. Myron Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican has met with the official protest of the president of the Federation of Churches as such and of the supreme governing bodies of the Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Evangelical, Adventist, etc., churches, as</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">well as of very numerous secular and religious publications and of multitudes of men and women prominent in public life?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that his claiming to send Mr. Taylor to cooperate with the pope in peace efforts is unreasonable, since the pope's strong partisanship against Germany and for the Allies disqualifies him in the estimation of informed people from being an influence for peace with Messrs. Hitler and Mussolini?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, among many others, Dr. G.A. Buttri ck, the world-renowned president of the Federation of Churches, and Dr. C.C. Morrison, the able editor of the Christian Century, charge him with wanting to make Romanists think that Mr. Taylor is his ambassador to the Vatican, which lists him as such in its schedule of ambassadors accredited to the pope, and at all times treats him as such, and to make Protestants think that Mr. Taylor is his personal representative, not ambassador?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the following acts prove that he furthers the Romanist schemes to draw financial help from the government: he secured financial grants for the National Youths' Administration, which has been created at the advice of, and largely in the interests of that church; he allocated huge sums to help the churches, the Romanist church being the only one to accept such, while Protestant denominations refused them; in an address at Temple University, Philadelphia, Pa., in 1936 he stated that he had allocated $400,000,000.00 for education, which sum was distributed mainly among Rome's parochial schools, colleges and universities; he. secured, through a commission, the end of the hierarchy's opposition to the U.S. allocating money to the public schools, by its promising them money from the same source for their parochial schools; he favored in 1937 the Harrison-Fletcher bill, so drawn as to include parochial schools, authorizing $350,000,000.00 to be allocated to education in the U.S.; and he sent a bill to Congress in 1939 asking</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">784 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">for $1,000,000,000.00 for public and private (which includes Romanist) schools?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in carrying out the autocratic features of the New Deal, which the hierarchy advised, he sought to force, likely at the hierarchy's advice, the adoption of a code on the press that would have largely destroyed the freedom of the press, a thing greatly desired in her interests by the Romanist church, an effort that was finally dropped only after years of unrelenting resistance from the press?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that on likely occasions he elaborately advertises the Romanist hierarchy and church, as can be seen from his pertinent addresses, letters of felicitation and informal sayings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he showed that he put the judgment of the hierarchy and the Romanist church above that of the Supreme Court, as can be seen from his scolding it for its decisions against autocratic features of the New Deal advised by the hierarchy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it is inexpressibly painful to be compelled, though in the interests of America, to detail the above matters disparaging to our president, deservedly beloved because of his kind heart, generous deeds and other noble characteristics?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that prominent members of his administration work hand-in-glove with him in this quasialliance with that church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, above all others, Mr. Farley, his postmaster general, cooperates with him in this course?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in pursuance of this policy Mr. Farley has dismissed thousands of non-Romanist, and appointed Romanist postmasters in their place, otherwise very largely Romanized the U.S. Post Office service and caused a bill to be introduced into Congress, which passed it, making it almost impossible to remove such Romanist postmasters, by exemptions in their favor as to civil service examinations, etc.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he makes the dedicatorial ceremonies for some new post offices Romanist celebrations,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">as can be seen in the case of the dedication of the Philadelphia post office?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he assured the Romanist members of the New York City post office that his first concern as postmaster general was to care for them and their fellow-Romanist post office employees, and that his acts prove that he has kept his word?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he has built the Democratic National machine largely after the model of Tammany Hall, which is the New York hierarchy's political machine?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he makes it a point to be present at all the more important Romanist occasions, like visiting popes, partaking in hierarchical celebrations, funerals, congresses, conferences and honoting popes and other hierarchs, even by kneeling and kissing, as the U.S. postmaster general, their rings?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that a similar course has marked other members of Mr. Roosevelt's inner circle of colaborers, like Messrs. Kennedy, Walker, Tugwell, Hopkins, Welles, (James) Roosevelt (as his secretary), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc., e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> having private audiences with popes, taking prominent places at Romanist celebrations, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">etc?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Mr. Sumner Welles frequently, but secretly dines with the pope's ablegate at Washington, claiming in justification that he gets from him very valuable information, especially, on South American affairs, a thing kept up despite the protests of defenders of the principle of separation of state and church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Senator Wagner at a Romanist function stated that he drew his inspiration for the Wagner Labor Act from the labor encyclicals of Leo XIII and Pius XI?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that out of respect Congress adjourned at the death of Pius XI, a thing that resulted in widespread protest, and that members of Congress as such attend high Romanist functions, are given prominent</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">786 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">places there, and certain Senators accepted membership on a Romanist anti-Communist committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the above acts of the Roosevelt administration prove that there is a quasi-alliance, i. e., a working understanding, a close cooperation, of it and the Romanist church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that acts of the Romanist church, especially of her hierarchy and others of her leading representatives, prove that on her part there is a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">quasi</span><span class="font3">alliance—working understanding with the Roosevelt administration?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the hierarchy and other leading mouthpieces and organs of that church vociferously, widely and uncontradictedly have claimed that the New Deal originated in the labor encyclicals of Leo XIII and Pius XI, and that it was by them recommended to' Mr. Roosevelt as originating in these encyclicals ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that that church has repeatedly and successfully exerted pressure on the Roosevelt administration to further its policies in international matters, e. g., in matters as to Mexico, Russia, Spain and the embargo; as shown above?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that that church, as a church, dabbles in national, state and municipal politics, as is seen from her course in elections, her introducing through underlings bills into Congress, the appearance of her repre sentatives before Congressional committees and her introducing through underlings bills into state legislatures and municipal councils, patent examples of which are her New Deal recommendations, her making candidates declare their stand on state support of her parochial schools, and her course through Tammany in New York City?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she systematically, wherever possible, seeks to make raids on national, state and municipal funds to support her parochial schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, orphanage and old folks'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">homes, which also smacks of a union of state and church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in very many states and municipalities she has succeeded in getting such support, as well as free bus rides, text-books (of her own creation and selection) and special health service for her parochial schools, as she has, as shown above, succeeded in getting very much financial help from the national administration in certain of these respects?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she demands pledges from candidates for such support and threatens to, and actually does, boycott at elections candidates who will not promise such aid, especially in state and municipal elections, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g,</span><span class="font3"> in Ohio and New York City?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she carries on propaganda in America in favor of union of state and church, not only in her schools, colleges and universities, as her text-books prove, but in press, pulpit and platform, and that at times by her highest mouthpieces, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Pius XII in a recent letter to the American hierarchy advocated this doctrine and his ablegate in the U.S. did the same thing in an address recently?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she causes her-members to vote in a bloc in elections, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g,</span><span class="font3"> her hierarchy, other leading mouthpieces and press boasted of electing Mr. Roosevelt in 1932 and 1936, and for his favoring her, will doubtless do it again, if he runs again?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the fact that she controls the vote of the vast bulk of her members causes many a politician to dance at the crack of her whip, and to fall all over himself to do her will?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that if it is in her interests, she flaunts the Constitution's Bill of Rights in its pledges of freedom of speech, press, propaganda, as can be seen in her tacit approval of Mr. Hague's flaunting these in Jersey City, in her boycotting papers, magazines, etc., that print anything objectionable to her, in her members, with her tacit approval, breaking up meetings where anti-Romanist lectures are given or are to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">be given, and in her underlings introducing many bills and ordinances against the exercise of liberty of press, speech and propaganda, as witness recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that anent the unconstitutionality of the autocratic features of the New Deal, the Jesuit magazine misnamed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">America,</span><span class="font3"> one of the ablest and most influential Romanist organs in America, editorially set forth the thesis that &quot;the Constitution should be junked to legitimate the New Deal&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the public press reported that through her hierarchy she secured from Mr. Roosevelt during the 1932 campaign and again during the 1936 campaign the promise to establish diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the Vatican, a promise that the press reported he was to fulfill as soon as public opinion in America could be brought about to it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she praises Mr. Roosevelt on all possible occasions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g,</span><span class="font3"> claiming through Cardinal Mundelein that in two years he did more for her than other presidents in 60 years?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the pope sent him his blessing in 1933, congratulated him at his election in 1932 and 1936, and assured him that he prayed for him, his family, mother and administration, which blessings and prayers, we trust, will not have the same results as had the popes' blessings and prayers for the two Spanish armadas, Austria in the Thirty Years' War, royalty, aristocracy and clergy in the French Revolution, France in the Franco-Prussian War, Poland, Belgium and France in the present war, Spain in the Spanish-American War, especially Cervera's fleet, and the Central Powers in the World War, which results seem to prove the popes' blessings and prayers to be a. liability?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Romanist church seeks to make it appear that she is the one prop of the U.S. government and the one indispensable church in America, by having the most prominent statesmen, politicians, office-holders and unofficial but outstanding citizens present as conspicuous guests, with pertinent press notice, at her special functions, which she advertises widely?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she advertises herself by over-weeningly large, laudatory, illustrated and widespread publicity, and thereby seeks to make the impression that she is the one and only worthwhile religion in America, worthy to be united with state?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she, in her hierarchy, struts about in state at congresses, conferences, political gatherings and patriotic celebrations, as the special guest of honor, where she expects and gets special attention, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> at the recent Republican National Convention, at Philadelphia, where and after Cardinal Dougherty delivered the invocation, the temporary chairman began his address as follows: &quot;Your eminence, the Cardinal Dougherty, Mr. Chairman, Convention delegates and ladies and gentlemen, etc.&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she worms her way into reading masses as integral parts of special celebrations, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> at various places where the Centennial of Texas was celebrated, at the Sesquicentennial of the Constitution at Philadelphia, where in the stadium, preceded by a parade of 100,000 Romanists, Cardinal Dougherty solemnized a mass before 100,000 Sesquicentennial celebrants?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the insincere and self-seeking character of such performances appears when it is remembered that Pius IX's Syllabus of Errors, an ex cathedra ecumenical utterance, hence from the Romanist standpoint, infallible, condemns as erroneous every one of the principles of the Constitution's Bill of Rights, and that the hierarchy and Romanist church favored the Romanist Mexican oppressors against the Texan patriots in their war?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that for self-advertisement the Romanist church capitalizes on the reputations of great and prominent Protestants by offering them university degrees and honors, to impress upon the public her greatness and liberality, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> the president, secretary of state and other cabinet members, ambassadors, great scientists, inventors, educators, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she specializes on seeking to place her priests, educators and prominent laymen into prominent governmental positions, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> in cabinets, administrations, political committees and bureaus and legislative, judicial and executive offices, whereby to further her designs on America she has honeycombed political America with her dependables in strategic positions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she systematically boycotts unfavorable radio starions and programs and movies by worked-up, packed, chain phone calls, wires and letters, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Judge Rutherfords broadcasts, the New York movie on the Spanish war exposing Franco's butcheries, and the movie at Providence, R. I., called Strange Cargo, all this to fasten her control on radio and screen?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that now that Cardinal Mundelein, her liaison officer with the president, is dead; she is grooming Archbishop Spellman for her liaison officer with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, following the lead of Cardinal Mundelein, she has been loudly advocating support of the Roosevelt policies, most of which originated in her according to her claims?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she claims to be his special adviser?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she in many ways puts herself above the law, even as Archbishop McNichols of Cincinnati declared at a meeting of the National Catholic Welfare Conference a couple of years ago—that there is no obligation to obey unreasonable laws, she reserving the right to decide which laws are reasonable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the interests of parochial schools she as a fixed policy has sought to injure the public schools, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> fought the reading of the Bible and the offering of the Lord's prayer there, and then, after accomplishing these purposes, has denounced them as &quot;godless,&quot; &quot;irreligious&quot; and &quot;sink holes of hell&quot;; for years forestalled the national government's helping support the public schools, only lately relenting thereon after being promised a part of the money granted therefore; for years fought, and that successfully, various bills authorizing the creation of a secretary of education as a member of the president's cabinet; among other things, sought to forestall it by the arrangement of a secretary of welfare in its stead; denounced public schools as infidel, dangerous, inefficient and wicked, a thing that she especially does at the opening of each school year; bores from within by filling boards of education and teaching staffs with her dependable adherents, who, in their double allegiance as to the U.S. and the pope, a foreign king, have given her the preference therein and lowered the standards of the public schools, e.g., by providing in many cases inferior text-books and weak and unfit courses that divert time and attention from vital matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she greatly resented the Supreme Court's decisions against the autocratic features of the New Deal, as a repudiation of the labor encyclicals of Leo XIII and Pius XI?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it has been widely reported that she by her special mouthpieces advised the president's courtpacking plan?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she is responsible for the introduction of very many similarly-worded bills in Congress, state legislatures and municipal councils intended to abridge the liberty of the press, mails, speech and propaganda, to silence criticism of her?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she causes to be introduced into legislative bodies bills intended to cripple her opponents and benefit her?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that to pave the way for her coveted union of state and church her mouthpieces doll her up as supremely beautiful and attractive, invent Romanists as participating in or doing alone great feats in American history and in general doll her up as the one prop and indispensable church for America?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by subtle manipulation she has succeeded in placing her adherents or dependables as a majority on national and state committees, to her great advantage?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she has gotten immense influence with the executive and legislative branches of our national government and with the legislative, executive and judicial branches of many state and municipal governments?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she pretends to regard highly the U.S. Constitution, with which, especially in its Bill of Rights, papal principles and history are in violent opposition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she seeks to intimidate all who displease her by their activities, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> our first lady for becoming a patroness of the movement that sought American homes for Loyalists' children made homeless and orphaned by Franco, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic News</span><span class="font3"> voicing her opposition to Mrs. Roosevelt's pertinent activities in this threat: &quot;If she does not disavow such activities, she will find herself in an embarrassing situation&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she seeks to intimidate the press, lecture platform, radio and movies by boycotting and worked-up, packed, mass phone, wire and letter propaganda on the part of her adherents and dupes along lines mentioned above?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she seeks to dominate the labor movement and veteran organizations and the army and navy chaplaincies by advancing her dependables to key positions therein?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, contrary to her former policy in America, she even seeks to control secret societies by boring from within?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she has been seeking to organize a Romanist political party of her own in America, as she did in Spain, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Austria, etc., though her influence in the Democratic party has decreased her pertinent activity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that she is seeking to mould America after her ideas, to which end her hierarchy issued a 9,000-worded plan embodying, among other things, the following: (1) bringing back God into the government (her way of wording a union of state and [Romanist] church), (2) organizing capital and labor into the closed-shop guilds of the dark age (under clerical control) and (3) regulating by Romanist theories property, labor, security, wages and the social order, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> she seeks to put the U.S. government and social order into the papal straitjacket.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that her above-mentioned acts not only prove that she is in a quasi-alliance with the Roosevelt administration, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> a working understanding, a close cooperation between them, but also that she performs in America acts that smack of a union of state and church, and that she is definitely working to create in America a union of state and church with herself as the church united with the American state?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible designates as symbolic fornication such a quasi-alliance and church activities that smack of a union of state and church, as well as an actual union of state and church, and sets forth the Romanist church as typed by the profligate, idolatrous and persecuting Jezebel, who was, contrary to God's law, united in marriage with Ahab, the type of autocracy (Rev. 17:216; 18: 3, 9; 19: 2; 2: 20-23; 1 Kings 16: 30, 31)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Romanist church is under God's abhorrence and special condemnation (Rev. 2: 20-23; compared with 1 Kings 21: 23-25; 2 Kings 9: 30-37; Rev. 18: 3-24), which will during the fast-approaching Armageddon be shortly consummated in her complete and eternal destruction, and that all that support and further her are heaping guilt upon themselves</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1. </span><span class="font3">before the Lord, which must bring Divine retribution (Rev. 2: 20-23)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible designates the papacy by the following names: That Wicked One, The Man of Sin, The Mystery of Iniquity, The Son of Perdition (2 Thes. 2: 1-9), The Antichrist, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> counterfeit Christ (1 John 2: 18; 4: 3), The Abomination that Maketh Desolate (Dan. 11: 31; 12: 11), The Abomination of Desolation Spoken of by Daniel the Prophet (Matt. 24: 15) and The Beast (Rev. 13: 1-8) and that, therefore, they sin greatly who support and further it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, therefore, the Roosevelt administration and all who support its supporting and furthering the Romanist church are sinning greatly before the Lord?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know what makes this sin especially detestable to the Lord is this fact: that the Church is Christ's Espoused, who is to keep herself symbolically chaste, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., </span><span class="font3">separate from all worldly alliances, as she so waits to become His Bride at His Second Advent (2 Cor. 11:2; Rev. 19: 6-8; 21: 9, 10), that the Romanist church has forsaken such chastity, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> separation from worldly alliances, and has in symbolic fornication become united with the state in some cases, and in others has joined a quasi-alliance with governmental administrations, and thus as Christ's Espoused has become a symbolic harlot, rejected by Christ as His prospective Bride (Rev. 17: 3-6, 15, 16, 18; 19: 2, 3)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Roosevelt administration by the guilt of symbolic fornication with the Romanist church has incurred God's disapproval, which, among other ways, has punished it by the failure of most of the New Deal policies, by giving it up, unhelped by Him, to its ill-advised Romanist advisers and by prolonging the depression in America unto the present, long after Britain, France, Germany, Italy recovered from the depression?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that its persisting in this course of symbolic fornication means that it has forsaken the Lord, evidenced by its forsaking certain Divinely-pleasing ideals of government that America formerly cherished, and that its forsaking God has resulted in God's forsaking it (2 Chro. 24: 20)?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, its having forsaken God in these particulars and God's having, as a result, forsaken it, it has by Him been abandoned to papacy's counsels, which with others have prevailed upon it to take such an unneutral stand toward the totalitarian powers as has aroused great resentment in them against it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that such a course toward the totalitarian powers might naturally result in one or more of them attacking America, if and after they defeat Britain, and that if they do attack America and are victorious, which its present abandonment by God, we fear, presage, America will, as a Divine punishment for its above-mentioned sins, doubtless have to pay that power or those powers an indemnity so huge as to stagger imagination?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that for over 18 years THE HERALD OF THE EPIPHANY, by exposing Rome's worldwide political doings, but especially her political dabblings in America, has sought to draw away our beloved country—America, so long God's favorite among the nations, but now, alas, abandoned by Him—from entanglements with the Romanist church, in which activities over 4,000,000 copies of its issues have been circulated, and that by these protests, as well as by those of other magazines, papers, books, booklets and pamphlets, God has been expostulating against the evil, and must resort to the rod, if reformation sets not in?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that ultimately by God's returning favor on repentance, good will come from these misfortunes to America and to all other countries, which, after recognizing the Romanist church to be a human source of their evils, will forever destroy it out of their midst in the fastapproaching Battle of Armageddon</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Having published the first part of Herald No. 14 in the form of Extra 23 under John's Rebuke in EC 446-467, we omit it here. We start with the second part of the Double Herald (whole No. 14) subheaded:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ANTI-CHRIST'S IDENTITY AND RISE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Scriptures refer to the one and self-same character by the following terms: &quot;That Wicked One,&quot; &quot;The Man of Sin,&quot; &quot;The Mystery of Iniquity,&quot; &quot;The Son of Perdition&quot; (2 Thess. 2: 3-8), &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; (1 John 2: 18; 4: 3), &quot;The Abomination that maketh desolate&quot; (Dan. 11: 31; 12: 11), &quot;The Little Hom&quot; (Dan. 7: 8, 21), &quot;The Abomination of Desolation&quot; (Matt. 24: 15), and &quot;The Beast&quot;?—Rev. 13: 1-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it was to be during the Gospel Age— the last period of &quot;the present evil world&quot;—that Anti-Christ was to be revealed?—2 Thess. 2: 3—8; 1 John2: 18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that according to prophecy the second coming of Christ was to be preceded by Anti-Christ's appearing, prosperity and withering?—2 Thess. 2: 3-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that some believe that Antichrist is an individual, and that his coming is yet future?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Antichrist—having had his small beginning—his begettal—in Apostolic times, and coming to his great end at Christ's Second Advent—a period of at least nearly nineteen hundred years cannot be an individual and literal man, since no individual</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and literal man lives so long?—2 Thess. 2: 7, 8; 1 John 4: 1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this fact, that Antichrist has existed from the days of the Apostles—at which time he was begotten—until now proves that Antichrist is some selfperpetuating System, whose successive members have represented him before the successive generations of the Gospel Age?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the word Antichrist is compounded from the Greek words </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anti,</span><span class="font3"> meaning instead of, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christos,</span><span class="font3"> meaning Christ, and that the word Antichrist literally means instead of Christ, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> a substitute Christ, hence a counterfeit Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Antichrist is, therefore, a counterfeit of the true Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that there is a great Antichrist and many lesser antichrists?—2 Thess. 2: 3-8; 1 John 2: 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the True Christ consists of Jesus the Head and the Church His Body—a company that has in its successive members been present in the world during the Gospel Age, and that is set forth in the Bible as a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;new,</span><span class="font3">&quot; a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;perfect Man &quot;</span><span class="font3">&nbsp;in implied contrast to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Man of Sin &quot;</span><span class="font3">&nbsp;?—1 Cor. 12: 12, 14, 27; Gal. 3: 16, 29; 1 Cor. 15: 23; Rom. 12: 4, 5; Eph. 1: 22, 23; 2: 15; 4: 4, 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Church—Christ's Bride—shares His name, Christ, according to some of the passage just cited, for the reason that a bride shares her husband's name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that unless we understand The Christ to be one Body, consisting of many members—Jesus the Headmember and the Church the Body-members —we are unprepared to understand, as a counterfeit of The Christ, the great Antichrist, who, as we have seen, must be a System, consisting of many members, having a headmember and many body-members?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as the true Lord is the Head of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">798 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Christ, so a false lord must be the head of the Antichrist—the counterfeit Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as the true Church is the Body of The Christ, so a false, an apostate Church, must be the body of the Antichrist—the counterfeit Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it is just because a false lord is set forth as the true Head, instead of the true Lord Jesus, the true Head—and that it is just because a false church is set forth as the true Body, instead of the true Church—the true Body of Jesus Christ, the true Head—that the counterfeit head and body constitute the Antichrist—the counterfeit Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that we must therefore search for one false head who is put in the place of Jesus as Head of the Church, and for one false church which is put in the place of the true Church as the Body of Christ, if we would find out just what is the great Antichrist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible, History and Reason prove that the Antichrist already has come, and has sat in the temple of God, and has been revealed and smitten, though his final destruction is yet future?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that there is especially one System in the world whose workings reach back from our times to those of the Apostles, whose head falsely claims to be the head of the true Church and whose body members falsely claim to be the true Church?—2 Thess. 2: 7; 1 John 4: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this System must be the Antichrist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this System is the Papacy, in which the pope as its head is the counterfeit of Jesus the true Head of the true Church, and the Roman Catholic Church as its body is the counterfeit of the true Church, the Body of Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible, History and Reason prove that the Papacy is the great Antichrist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this does not mean that individual Roman Catholics are antichrists, many of whom are godly people and real children of God; but it does</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">mean that the Papal System as such—not an individual —is the Antichrist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible teaches that the Antichrist would have its rise out of, through and amid a falling away—an apostasy—from the true Christianity, introduced by Christ and His Apostles?—2 Thess. 2: 3, 1 John 2: 18, 19; 4: 1,3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it started in the unholy ambition of certain leaders to gain the position of preeminence and power in various churches, even while the Apostles lived?—3 John 9-11; 2 Thess. 2: 4, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the zeal of the Apostles and their faithful helpers to maintain the true organization, teachings and practices of Christianity greatly curtailed the unholy ambition and influence of such leaders? Acts 20: 20, 24, 27-31; Gal. 2: 4, 5; 2 Pet. 1: 12-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that these ambitious ones became more successful after the Apostles fell asleep?—Acts 20: 29, 30; 2 Pet. 1: 14, 15, compare with2: 1-3, 15; Matt. 13: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the second century they undermined the organization of the true Church, especially by two things, the first of which was the dividing of the Church into two classes: (1) the clergy, as the ruling class, and (2) the laity, as the subject class?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the second century they also undermined the organization of the true Church by a second thing—the dividing of the clergy into two classes: (1) the ruling clergy, to whom, contrary to apostolic usage—according to which the words elders and bishops, or overseers, apply to the same persons and office (Acts 20: 17, 28; Phil. 1: 1)—they limited the name bishop; and (2) the subordinate clergy, to whom they limited the name elders, presbyters, which latter word was later corrupted in form and meaning into the word priest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the third century the bishops gained more power, and began to be considered the successors of the Apostles, and that it was especially through the influence of Cyprian, bishop of Carthage in Africa, who died in 258, that the doctrine of apostolic succession was introduced?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that late in the third century the more powerful bishops became known as archbishops and metropolitans, having under them all of the clergy of their respective districts and provinces?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the fourth century the five most powerful of the metropolitans—those of Jerusalem, Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople and Rome— developed into patriarchs—first, or chief fathers—and the superiors of all bishops in their respective sections of the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the fifth century the position of supreme ecclesiastical authority became an object of rivalry and contention between the bishop of Rome and the bishop of Constantinople?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Roman emperors during the sixth century, beginning with Justinian, 533 A. D., acknowledged the supremacy of the bishop of Rome as Pope, over all the clergy and churches of the Roman Empire and of the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this fact and certain events occurring within six years from its beginning &quot;set up&quot; the Papacy in power as the Man of Sin, in the year 539 A. D.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the above-described gradual apostasy from the original organization of the Church completely perverted the Divine organization of the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the falling away—the Apostasy— affected not only the organization, but also the teachings that Jesus and the Apostles gave the true Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the second century, mainly through the teachings and activities of certain converted heathen philosophers, the doctrinal truths of the Church began to be corrupted through the introduction of heathen philosophical views?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during that century they began to introduce the Pagan doctrine of the condition of the dead, and to undermine confidence in the Millennium?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the third century the philosophical theologians and ambitious clergy began to undermine the Scriptural teachings on the relation and unity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, by introducing an unscriptural view of their relation and unity; continued to corrupt and deny the Scriptural doctrine of the Millennium; perverted the present mission of the Church, which is to gather the Elect from the world for joint-heirship and rulership with Christ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font3"> His Second Advent, for the conversion of the world, into the mission of converting and reigning over the world </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">before</span><span class="font3"> Christ's Second Advent; and introduced into the Church from heathendom its views on the punishment of sin and began to teach errors on various phases of baptism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the fourth century they rejected the true doctrine of the relation and unity of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and established by aid of the civil power the false teaching on that subject; wholly rejected the doctrine of the Millennium as following Christ's Second Advent, and the true mission of the Church during the Gospel Age, in favor of its converting and reigning over the world before Christ's Return; united Church and State in an unholy and, to the Church, degrading alliance for the conversion of the world and the Millennial Reign before Christ's Return; and developed further the previously mentioned errors and the magical effect of external rites?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that during the fifth and sixth centuries, in addition to placing increased emphasis on the abovementioned errors, further errors on the person of Christ were introduced; purgatory, and the mass, as a sacrifice for sins committed after baptism—the greatest of Catholic errors—began in their first principles to be taught; errors on grace, free will, predestination,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and the Lord's Supper began to spread; and errors on the Second Advent, the end of the world, the Judgment Day, the resurrection of the dead, the rewards of the righteous and the punishment of the wicked increased?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in addition to these organizational and doctrinal corruptions, during these six centuries there set in very many corruptions in, and evil additions to the practices introduced into the Church by Christ and the Apostles, all of which corruptions and evil additions led to dead formality instead of living spirituality in the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that these corruptions of, and evil additions to primitive Christian practices include auricular confession, penances, monasticism, asceticism, fasts, feasts, worship of saints and their relics and image, pilgrimage, processions, and that they include elaborate and heathenish ceremonies in worship, regalia, vestments, buildings, festivals, weddings, deaths, funerals, lustrarions, incense, crucifixes, etc., etc., etc., and that they fostered increasing ignorance, superstition, credulity, etc., etc., etc., none of which are traceable in the Bible, but all of which were more or less present before the end of the sixth century?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that all of these features of the apostasy led to a terrible lowering of the standard of life in the Christian Society, Church and Family?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that out of, through and amid all of these corruptions of Church organization, doctrine and practice, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> out of, through and amid the above-described great apostasy from primitive Christianity, the Papacy—the Antichrist—developed, even as St. Paul and St. John declared it would develop out of, through and amid an apostasy?—2 Thess. 2: 3; 1 John 2: 18, 19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the above-mentioned facts of the great apostasy are authentic History's corroboration of the fulfilment of St. Paul's and St. John's prophecies respecting the rise of the Antichrist—the Papacy, as the counterfeit Christ—out of, through and amid a great falling away from primitive Christianity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Reason assents to the conclusion that a System with the nature, origin, character, doctrine and history—harmonious with the Biblical forecast—of the Papacy's rise has all of the earmarks of the Antichrist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, additional to the Scriptural, Historical and Reasonable evidence respecting Papacy's rise, showing it to be the Antichrist, there are many other lines of proof for the same fact derived from Scripture, History and Reason respecting Papacy's course </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font3"> it was set up in 539 A. D?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that at is necessary for us to acquaint ourselves with at least an outline of these facts in order that we may properly take our part in the Drama of the Ages now being enacted on the stage of ominous World-events in their relation to Christ's Second Advent, the Deliverance of the true Church from the world, and the establishment of God's Kingdom throughout the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Christ's Second Advent cannot now be delayed because of Antichrist's coming, since the latter has already come?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in harmony with Biblical usage, both in the Hebrew of the Old Testament and in the Greek of the New, human </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">notables</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rulers</span><span class="font3"> are sometimes meant by the Hebrew word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elohim</span><span class="font3"> and the Greek word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">theos.</span><span class="font3"> both of which are usually translated by the word God?—Gen. 23: 6; Ex. 7: 1; 21: 6; 22: 8, 10, 28, compare with Acts 23: 5; Ps. 82: 6, compare with John 10: 34, 35; 1 Cor. 8: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the following is the literal translation of 2 Thess. 2: 4: &quot;Who opposes himself against, and highly exalts himself over, every one called a God [human ruler] or an </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">augustused</span><span class="font3"> one [one treated as an Augustus, the highest title of the Roman emperors, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> any one to whom fealty is sworn and homage is given as the highest civil ruler], so that he seats himself</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">[as an intruder and usurper pushes his See] into God's Temple [the Church, 1 Cor. 3: 16, 17] exhibiting himself that he is a God [a mighty ruler]?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in 533 A. D. Justinian, the Roman Emperor, publicly and by an imperial rescript recognized the Bishop of Rome as the head of all the clergy and of all the churches?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he sent in 535, to Sicily, and in 537, to Italy, his army under Belisarius, who in his war with the Goths in Italy was so successful that by 539 he had freed Rome and Italy from their power, which resulted in the Pope's becoming in civil, as he had already been in religious affairs the chief power in Rome and its adjacent territory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that accordingly from 539, the year of the Gothic empire's fall in Italy, must be dated the beginning of the civil power of the popes as temporal rulers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that from shortly thereafter with, ever increasing emphasis various popes as the head of the Antichrist, supported by the clergy, the body of Antichrist, came, while grasping for civil power, into conflict with civil rulers—&quot;opposing himself against. . . everyone called a god [civil ruler] or an augustused one?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this manifested itself first against the Roman Emperors' Italian exarches whose capital was at Ravenna, then for several centuries against the Longobard rulers, then for centuries against the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and then for centuries against every other European ruler who would not be subject to the Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in such activity the Man of Sin fulfilled the prophecy of 2 Thess. 2: 4: &quot;Who opposes himself against. . . every one called a god [civil ruler] or an augustused one . . . exhibiting himself that he is a god [civil ruler]?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that gradually from 539 onward the Antichrist claimed higher and higher prerogatives for</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">himself, until he claimed the supreme place on earth, not only in religious, but also in civil matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that these claims and their realization reached their summit especially in the reign of Pope Innocent III., 1198-1216 A. D., and that they were clearly set forth as a matter of faith necessary for salvation, in the infamous bull, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Unam Sane tarn,</span><span class="font3"> issued by Pope Boniface VIII., 1294-1303 A. D.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in these claims and their realization the Antichrist likewise fulfilled the prophecy of 2 Thess. 2: 4: &quot;and highly exalts himself over every one called a god [civil ruler] or an augustused one..., exhibiting himself that he is a god [civil ruler]?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the meaning and realization of Antichrist's claims to supremacy in political matters over all secular rulers are best illustrated in the activities and successes of Pope Innocent III, who brought back to Papal control the temporarily fieed Papal States, brought Sicily under the Papal suzerainty, interfered in the elections of German emperors until his tools and partisans were elected, compelled the King of France to regulate his domestic life according to his views, induced the Spanish king to pay him tribute as his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">political</span><span class="font3"> superior, sanctioned the overthrow of the Greek and in its place the establishment of a Latin empire at Constantinople, subject to him, ordered the king of France to enforce his interdict and commands against England, forced England under John Lackland to become a Papal fief, paying tribute twice annually to him, formerly protested against the cornerstone of civil liberty, the Magna Charta, additionally gained political control in Portugal, Poland, Livonia, Sweden and Bulgaria, and finally, a few months before his death, received homage at the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215 A. D., from over 1500 assembled prelates and from the ambassadors of almost all the kings, princes and fiee cities of Christendom, not only as head of the Church, but also as</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">supreme lord and judge of all kings, princes and peoples?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that these claims and their realization are in most striking contradiction to God's Word and the example of Jesus and the Apostles, which inculcate the subjection of all of Jesus' followers in secular matters to the civil powers until the end of &quot;the present evil world&quot;?— John 18: 33-37; Matt. 20: 20, 21, 24-28; Mark 10: 42-45; Luke 22: 24-27; Matt. 22: 21; Rom. 13: 1-7; 1 Pet. 2: 1315.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when the Mystery of Iniquity—he Antichrist—first began to work, and for several centuries afterward, there was something in the way that hindered the self-exalting and power-grasping clergy in the early Church from gaining what proved to be the goal of Antichristreligious and political supremacy over mankind?—2 Thess. 2: 6, 7, see Revised Version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the hindering thing was. the Pagan Roman Empire, with a heathen Roman Emperor at its head?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that one of the official titles of the Roman Emperor was Pontifex Maximus—greatest, or chief priest?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Roman Emperor had this title because he was the supreme head of the religion, as he also was of the government, of the Roman Empire—things implied in his official titles?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as long as the Roman Emperors had and used these powers as the head of the Pagan Roman government and religion, there was a hindrance in the way of Antichrist's obtaining supremacy in State and Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Antichrist could gain such power only if the hindrance was taken out of the way, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3"> if Pagan Rome would become what proved to be Papal Rome, and if the heathen Emperor would become what proved to be a Papal Emperor subject in religion and government to Antichrist?—2 Thess. 2: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the self-exalting and power-grasping clergy in the second, third and fourth centuries increasingly as time went on made most extraordinary efforts at the so-called Christianizing of Pagan Rome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that they greatly lowered the standards of Christian doctrine and practice, and adopted many heathen views, practices and customs to facilitate the conversion of Pagan to what was growing into Papal Rome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when the size of their following warranted it they made special efforts to win over rulers and to impress upon them their need of the clergy's support?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this sometimes led to their winning the confidence, favor and support of certain rulers, and sometimes to their stirring up the fears, envy and opposition of other rulers, up to 313 A. D., when Emperor Constantine openly espoused the side of the self-exalting and power-grasping clergy and their party, by which Antichrist experienced his birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that such a course on the part of the clergy was one of the causes of arousing certain Pagan Roman emperors to persecute all Christians?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by 313 A. D. Antichrist succeeded in putting a so-called Christian emperor on the throne of Rome in the person of Constantine, and thus took out of the way one of the features of the hindrance (a heathen emperor as the head of the State) to Antichrist's supremacy in government and religion?—2 Thess. 2: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that shortly afterward Constantine made a partial counterfeit of Christianity the religion of the Roman Empire, by uniting Church and State, and thus a second part of the hindrance (the Pagan religion as the religion of the Empire) was taken out of the way?—2 Thess. 2: 6, 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when Emperor Justinian in 533 decreed the pope to be the head of all the clergy and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the Church, as a direct consequence a third part of the hindrance (the right of the Emperor to the office of Pontifex Maximus—Chief Priest) in the way of Antichrist's ambition for supremacy was taken out of the way?—2 Thess. 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when in 539 Belisarius, Justinian's general, freed Rome and Italy from the control of the Goths he not only removed the final part of the hindrance to Antichrist's exercising political authority, but also laid the foundation upon which immediately the Pope began to build that temporal power which in due time enabled Antichrist to exercise supremacy in governmental matters?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that many, yea, the majority, of those who wrought on the development and in the interests of Antichrist did so piously and conscientiously, under the delusion that they were thereby enhancing God's glory and gaining His approval?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Antichrist's phenomenal success in attaining supremacy in Church and State, so perseveringly and cunningly sought after for many centuries, was at every step favored and furthered by Satan?—John 14: 30; 2 Thess. 2: 9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that of all devices formed for deceiving, enslaving, oppressing and injuring mankind Antichrist is easily the chief, and as such is the very climax of Satanic cunning and ingenuity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Antichrist is thus proven to be the supreme product and the highest representative of Satan's Empire among men?—John 14: 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Satan first offered the faithful Christ the supremacy in the earth on sinful conditions; and failing to win Him thereto, sought and won the unfaithful Antichrist on those conditions for that position?—Luke 4: 5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Satan was one of the most attentive listeners to the teaching and preaching of Jesus and His Apostles, and that after having learned all that he could from them he very diligently studied</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">every part of the Old and New Testaments, even as a counterfeiter scrutinizes every part of genuine money; and that from such study he constructed his counterfeit of The Christ, His teachings, practices and organization, and palmed off his counterfeit: the Papacy, its teachings, practices and organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it took centuries for Satan to work out and palm off the Papal religion as the counterfeit of the true Christian religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that among other things he had to work out a theory of the primacy of the Pope, in the Antichrist, as a counterfeit of the primacy of Jesus, in The Christ, Head and Body?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he began the work of palming off his counterfeit primacy during the second century, through the Judaizing heretics called the Ebionites, through whose Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles he set forth the fable of a Bishopric of St. Peter for 25 years at Rome?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that there is no sure evidence that St. Peter was ever at Rome, much less that he ever was the Roman bishop?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this fable of the Ebionites was adopted as a part of Roman Catholic tradition, and that early in the third century the seat of the Roman bishop began to be called the See of St. Peter?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the fourth century the Roman bishop was considered, in his capacity of being one of the five patriarchs, as the first among equals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the fifth century Satan began to spread misinterpretations of Matt. 16: 16-19; Luke 22: 31, 32; John 21: 15-17, to the effect that they taught that Jesus conferred the primacy of authority among the Apostles upon St. Peter, despite the fact that apart from the keys— (1) the power of opening an entrance for the Jews, at Pentecost, and (2) the power of opening an entrance for the Gentiles, in Cornelius' home, into the Church, Jesus conferred upon all the other Apostles the same authority as upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">810 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">St. Peter (Matt. 18: 18), and despite the fact that Jesus taught that none of the Apostles was to be over any other Apostle?—Luke 22: 24-26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when the claim was made that the Bishop of Rome was the successor of St. Peter as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">the prince of the Apostles,</span><span class="font3"> and therefore was the chief of the patriarchs, the other four patriarchs disputed the claim?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when for the first time the claim was in the fifth, century set forth that not as the first among equals, but as the superior over the four other patriarchs and all other prelates, the Roman Bishop was the head of the Church, this claim was disputed on all sides as an entirely new teaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that gradually this claim gained adherence for assertions and reasons like the following: The Roman Bishop was the successor of St. Peter; he was Bishop of Rome, the most famous city of the world; he had charge of the graves of Sts. Peter and Paul; he was independent of the court intrigues at Constantinople; he was always orthodox; he was usually able and active; he had the solid backing of the Western churches against the rival and divided claimants in the Eastern Church; each group of controversialists in the theological conflicts of the Eastern Church sought his favor and decision against their opponents; his clients always in the end won out in these controversies; the continued growth of the Western and decrease of the Eastern Church; the abandonment of the Western Christians to their fate by the Government at Constantinople during the wandering of the nations; and the paternalism of the Roman Bishop toward the people amid the sufferings due to the wandering of the nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that none of these assertions and reasons is of Divine sanction?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Innocent I. (402-417), Coelestin I. (422-432), Leo L, the Great, (440-461) and Gregory L,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the Great, (590-604) were the most influential Roman Bishops in effecting the acceptance of the primacy of the Roman Bishop as head of the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Leo I., the Great, in 445 succeeded in securing the legal recognition of the primacy of the Roman Bishop over the Western Church, and that in 451 he protested not without effect against the 28th canon of the Council of Chalcedon which declared the Bishop of Constantinople and the Bishop of Rome to be equals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it was in the sixth century that the Bishop of Rome arrogated to himself the title of Pope— Papa—as exclusively his, though this title had for several centuries been common to all bishops?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in order to prove the primacy of the Pope as head of the Church the following improvable propositions must be proven: (1) that St. Peter was the head of the Church; (2) that St. Peter was Bishop of Rome; (3) that both as Apostle and as Bishop of Rome St. Peter was head of the Church; (4) that St. Peter was to have a successor as head of the Church; (5) that St. Peter's successor as head of the Church had to be the Bishop of Rome; and (6) that the Pope, as Bishop of Rome, is St. Peter's successor as head of the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Satan not only counterfeited The Christ—Jesus the Head and the true Church His Body —by the Antichrist, in which the Pope is the Head and the Roman Catholic Church the Body, but also in the Papacy he counterfeited almost everything else that is a part of genuine Christianity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in doctrinal matters Satan through the Papacy set forth a counterfeit teaching for almost every doctrine of the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in harmony with this procedure Satan through Antichrist has set forth counterfeit doctrines on the Bible, on tradition, on God, on the relation of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, on Jesus Christ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">on the Holy Spirit, on angels, on man, on sin, on man's fall into sin, on the penalty of sin, on death, on hell, on purgatory, on the Ransom, on the Abrahamic Covenant, on the New Covenant, on repentance, on faith, on justification, on consecration, on self-denial, on sanctification, on baptism, on the Lord's Supper, on confirmation, on penance, on matrimony, on ordination, on extreme unction, on the Church, on the Gospel Age work, on the priesthood, on the saints, on their sacrifice, on the last day, on time, on eternity, on the last judgment, on the Millennium, on the resurrection, on the end of the world, on heaven, on eternal life, and on eternal death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the ascetic practices of the Papacy, as seen, for example, in monastic life and the celibacy of the priesthood, are some of Antichrist's counterfeits of the selfdenials inculcated in the Bible?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the bulk of Papacy's saints are Antichrist's counterfeits for the faithful Body members of The Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papal sacrifice of the Mass is Antichrist's counterfeit of the true sacrifice that the faithful Body of Christ has been making of themselves throughout the Gospel Age?—Rom. 12: 1; 1 Pet. 2: 5;Heb. 13: 15, 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the infallibility of the Pope is in Antichrist Satan's counterfeit of the infallibility of our Lord Jesus?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the college of cardinals is in Antichrist Satan's counterfeit of the more prominent servants of Jesus among men as the antitypes of Israel's seventy judges—the Sanhedrin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papal reign from 799 to 1799 is in Antichrist Satan's counterfeit of the Millennial Reign of The Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as the Pope and the hierarchy counterfeit Jesus and His Church, so monks and nuns, as the intermediaries between Antichrist and the Catholic laity, counterfeit the Ancient and Youthful Worthies as the Millennial intermediaries between The Christ and the world of mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papal laity are in Antichrist Satan's counterfeit for the Millennial subjects of The Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Purgatory is Antichrist's counterfeit for the Millennium, when The Christ will purge the earth from the curse and obedient people from all imperfection and sin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's doctrine on the penalty of sin is Antichrists counterfeit for the symbolic lake of fire—the second death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that counterfeitedly many of the true saints and martyrs of God (Rev. 17: 6; 18: 24) have been in Antichrist treated by Satan as the Millennial incorrigibles?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the tortures to which the true saints and martyrs of Jesus were subjected are in Antichrist Satan's counterfeit of the judgments of the Lord that will in the Millennium teach earth's inhabitants righteousness?— Is. 26: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the above discussion does not dilate on clerical immoralities and other wrongs since these, having existed in all age and classes, cannot prove Papacy to be Anti-Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that if the Roman Hierarchy were as chaste and good as angels, Papacy would yet be the AntiChrist because of counterfeiting the Christ in His organization, doctrines and practices?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it is just because Antichrist in his teachings, practices and organization is so complete a counterfeit of The Christ in His teachings, practices and organization that Satan has by Antichrist attained his greatest power, influence, and success in the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ANTI-CHRIST'S DARK REIGN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that after 539—when the Ostrogoths were overthrown in Italy—the Italian exarch, the political</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">814 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1. </span><span class="font3">representative of the emperor in Italy, having made Ravenna his capital, the Pope gradually began to assume the functions of a civil ruler at Rome and in its suburbs?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Gregory I., the Great (590-604), said that the one who occupied his office as Bishop of Rome discharged the functions of a civil ruler and of an ecclesiastical shepherd, and that at times it was difficult to determine to which of these capacities some of his acts belonged?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Gregory II. (715-731) successfully encouraged the revolutionary remnant of the Exarchate of Ravenna to come under his political leadership?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Popes' controllership of this territory was through the gift of Pepin, the king of the Franks, legally confirmed in 755?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Charlemagne in 774 renewed and enlarged this gift of his father Pepin, and thus confirmed the Pope in his temporal power over the Papal States as a. fief of the Frankish Empire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in this way the Papal States rose?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Popes were not content thus to be subject to the Frankish Empire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the aim of the Papacy was absolutism, in State and Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it is a doctrine of Antichrist that of Divine right every human being should be subject in all things to the Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the ninth century there were only two hindrances to Papal absolutism—the supremacy of the Frankish emperors over the Papal States in matters of State, and the claims of the Frankish metropolitans to independence in the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that through the greatest forgery of all history—the forged decretals among the so-called Isidorean decretals—the Papacy overcame the Frankish metropolitans' opposition to Papal absolutism in the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it was also through these same forged decretals, especially through the part of them that treats of the so-called donation of Constantine—which sets forth the fable that Constantine the Great, 330, out of gratitude for Pope Sylvester's curing (?) him of leprosy, surrendered to the Pope as a gift the whole of the Western part of the Roman Empire as the Pope's civil domain, placing upon the Pope's head the imperial crown, and thereupon left Rome and built Constantinople as his capital over the Eastern part of the Roman Empire—that gradually the Popes overcame the supremacy of the emperors and kings and became the chief civil power in the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's contentions for supremacy in civil matters caused many conflicts and wars?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that to secure such supremacy among other things the Papacy excommunicated unsubmissive kings and emperors, placed interdicts—prohibition of all rites of the Church—over entire countries, absolved subjects from their oaths of allegiance to their kings and emperors, and aroused the former to revolution against the latter, resulting in some of the latter losing their thrones?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that one of the most drastic cases of Papacy's acts along these lines occurred when Hildebrand, as Gregory VII, 1073-1085, excommunicated Henry IV. of Germany, released his subjects from their oath of allegiance, and compelled him, when penitent, to do penance by fasting and standing almost naked for three days in the bitter cold of January in the court of the castle at Canossa, where Gregory was then visiting, before that haughty and self-willed pontiff deigned to receive into his presence and absolve the royal penitent?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that even Catholic, theologians now admit that the Isidorean decretals are forgeries in those parts of them that make these extravagant claims of power in Church and State for the Pope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">816 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that a good and true cause does not require or have forgeries as its basic credentials?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that powers secured by such fraudulent claims and used for such fraudulent purposes must have been invented by Satan and intended by him for use in his own interests?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the powers so gained were used more effectually than other powers ever were used against God, His servants and mankind?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that such uses stamp them as of Satan's invention, and therefore prove that Papal absolutism in Church and State is of Satanic origin?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Antichrist still claims by Divine right the authority to reign in secular and religious matters over all rulers and peoples of the earth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that according to the International News Service the present Pope, Pius XL, on Sept. 9, 1921, shortly after his elevation to the cardinalate, publicly made, at Milan, Italy, the following declaration: &quot;The Vatican must be considered, not an international power, but a supernational power. . . . The world must consider Italy as the second country in importance and Rome the universal capital, because the Pope resides there.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the reason why the Pope does not now do to the nations and rulers what among others Gregory VII. did to them in the eleventh century, and what Innocent III. did to them in the thirteenth century, is not for lack of will so to do, but only for lack of power to enforce his will so to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Scriptures treat of the desolating abomination as an especially wicked thing?—Dan. 11: 31; 12: 11; 8: 13; Matt. 24: 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this desolating abomination is Antichrist—the Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the expression of Matt. 24: 15: &quot;the abomination of desolation . . . </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">stand in the holy place&quot;</span><span class="font3"> is practically synonymous with the expression</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of 2 Thess. 2:4: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;he sitteth in the temple of God”—</span><span class="font3">the true Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that St. Matthew's expression, &quot;When ye shall see the abomination of desolation. . . stand in the holy place,&quot; is synonymous with St. Mark's expression (Mark 13: 14): &quot;When ye shall see the abomination of desolation. . . standing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">where it ought not.&quot;</span><span class="font3"> and that this latter expression proves Antichrist to have no right whatever to be in the Church—that he is there only as an intruder and usurper?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy, the Antichrist, teaches that the sacrifice of Jesus atones for only the original sin of man and his actual sins committed before baptism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Antichrist teaches that the sacrifice of the mass atones for all actual sins committed after baptism, whether those who have committed such sins are now living or dead?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy teaches that when in the mass the priest in the consecration service utters over the bread and wine the words, This is My body—this is My blood, the bread and wine are changed into the actual flesh and blood of Jesus Christ, which the priest then offers as an unbloody sacrifice to God for the sins of the living Catholics and of the dead in Purgatory?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by the doctrine of the Mass the daily—the continual—sacrifice, the continual efficacy of the one Ransom sacrifice of our Lord Jesus to cleanse us from all sin (1 John 1: 7), was taken away by the Antichrist?—Dan. 8: 11-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Ransom-Sacrifice is the place, or foundation, of the Sanctuary—the Church—Dan. 8: 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the doctrine of the Mass is the most abominable feature of the Papacy, because it is subversive of the foundation of Christian doctrine and practice—the Ransom?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the doctrine of the Mass with its concomitants of Purgatory and indulgences has been the mint whereby Antichrist has coined inexhaustible treasures through the fears and superstitions of its deluded adherents?—Dan. 8: 12, margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it is Antichrist's doctrine of the Mass which makes Antichrist the &quot;desolating abomination&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible also calls Antichrist—the Papacy—a &quot;little horn&quot;?—Dan. 7: 8, 11, 24, 25; Dan. 8: 913,23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in Biblical symbols a horn represents a power—a kingdom or a king?—Dan. 7: 7, 8, 24; Dan. 8: 3, 5, 8, 9, 20-23; Rev. 17: 3,12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the two-homed ram of Dan. 8: 3, 4 represents the Medo-Persian Empire?—Dan. 8: 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the one-homed he-goat of Dan. 8: 5-8 represents the Grecian Empire under Alexander the Great the conqueror of Medo-Persia?—Dan. 8: 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the four horns which took the place of the one great horn (Dan. 8: 8) represent the four kingdoms into which the Empire of Alexander was divided?—Dan. 8: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that one of these four divisions was Alexander's original kingdom—Macedonia—and that the Roman ambassadors acknowledged the subjection of Rome to the victorious Alexander as a part of his Empire—at that time especially Macedonia?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it is for this reason that the &quot;little horn&quot; of Dan. 8: 9-13 represents first Pagan and then Papal Rome as having come out of one of the divisions of Alexander's Empire—that of Macedonia?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the waxing great against (margin) the host of heaven and overthrowing them (Dan. 8: 10) represents the conflict in the ecclesiastical heavens whereby the Pope contended with all rival religious claimants, and gained the victory over them in the contention for the primacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the expression (Dan. 8: 11),</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;He magnified himself even to the Prince of the Host,&quot; means that the Pope would exalt himself to Chiisf s place as the Head of the Church, and as the rightful Ruler of mankind?—Rom. 14: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Dan. 8: 23-25 treats of the Papacy and is an explanation of Dan. 8: 9-13, even as Dan. 8: 19-22 is an explanation of Dan. 8: 3-8?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Dan. 7: 7, 8, 19-26 gives a more minute picture of the Papacy in its relation to the Roman Empire than is given in Dan. 8: 9-13, 23-25?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the four beasts of Dan. 7: 3-8 represent in their respective order the four universal Empires—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece and Rome? — Dan. 7: 17; 2:31-35,36-43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the ten horns on the head of the fourth beast-the Roman Empire—(Dan. 7: 7) represent the ten nations that would establish a seat of government and exercise rulership on Italian soil—the original territory of the Roman Empire?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that those ten nations, with the year of the end of their rule on Italian soil, are the following: (1) the Western Empire, 476 A. D., (2) the Heruli, 489, (3) the Ostrogoths, 539, (4) the Exarchate of Ravenna (representative of the Eastern Empire), 751, (5) the Longobards, 774, (6) the Franks, 870 (the French in later periods ruled more or less on Italian soil), (7) the Austro-Germanic Holy Roman Empire, 1806 (Austria later ruled in parts of Italy), (8) the Normans, 1194, (9) the Spaniards, 1714, and (10) the present Italian kingdom?— Dan. 8: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that apart from these ten nations the Papacy is the only other government that had a seat of government and exercised rulership on Italian soil?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy, therefore, must be the &quot;little horn&quot; of Dan. 7: 8, 11,20, 21,24-26?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the three horns (Dan. 7: 8) that were plucked up by the roots—utterly destroyed— before the Papal horn came up were the Western Empire, which fell in 476, the Heruli, who fell in 489, and the Ostrogoths, who fell in 539, on whose ruins Papal civil power was built?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy conspired successfully for the successive overthrow of each of these three governments?—Dan. 8: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as symbolized by the eyes and mouth of the &quot;little horn&quot; the Papacy—Antichrist—is especially marked by his deep and subtle knowledge (eyes) and great utterances (mouth)?—Dan. 7: 8; 8: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy in his scholars is deeply learned, as evidenced in their many books, in subtle, Satanic perversions and in minute accuracies of all branches of human knowledge, especially in those serviceable to his interests, as symbolized by the manlike eyes of the &quot;little horn&quot;?—Dan. 7: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's utterances (the mouth of the &quot;little horn&quot;) are great—self-exalting—in their teachings, claims and objects?—Dan. 7: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that some of these great claims for the Pope as Papacy's head are set forth in the 62 blasphemous Papal titles which were arranged by Monsignor Capel, one of Papacy's prominent writers, and of which we submit a number as samples: Most Divine of all Heads, Holy Father of Fathers, Pontiff Supreme over all Prelates, Overseer of the Christian Religion, the Chief Pastor, Pastor of Pastors, Christ by Unction, Heir of the Apostles, Abel in Primacy, Noah in Government, Abraham by Patriarchate, Melchisedec in Order, Aaron in Dignity, Moses in Authority, Samuel in Judicial Office, Peter in Power, High Priest, Supreme Bishop, Prince of Bishops, Key-bearer of the Kingdom of Heaven, Pontiff Appointed with Plenitude of Power, Vicar of Christ, Head of the Holy Churches, Chief of the Universal Church, Bishop of Bishops, that is, Sovereign Pontiff, Ruler of the House of the Lord, Apostolic Lord and Father of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fathers, Chief Pastor and Teacher, Physician of Souls, Rock against which the proud gates of hell prevail not, Infallible Pope, Head of all the Holy Priests of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that among other &quot;great things&quot; that the &quot;little horn&quot; has claimed as the Pope's titles the following are some examples: Prince of the Universe, Lion of the Tribe of Judah, Priest and King who is to be adored by all people, and who is very like unto God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Ferrari's Ecclesiastical Dictionary —a standard Roman Catholic work—says the following of the Pope under the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">wordPapa,</span><span class="font3"> article second: &quot;The pope is. . ., as it were, God and the vicar of God. . ., is crowned with a triple crown as king of heaven, of earth and of hell. ...

He occupies one and the same tribunal with Christ. . .</span><span class="font3"> The pope is, as it were, God on earth, the only prince of the faithful of Christ, the greatest king of all kings, possessing the plenitude of power, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">to whom the government of the earthly and heavenly kingdom is entrusted. . . .</span><span class="font3"> The pope is of so great authority and power that he can </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">modify, declare</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">interpret</span><span class="font3"> the Divine law. . . . The pope can sometimes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">counteract</span><span class="font3"> the Divine law by limiting, explaining [away], etc.?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that their canon law in the gloss denominates the Pope—&quot;our Lord God?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that next to Satan Antichrist has exalted himself more than all other beings and systems combined?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Revelator (Rev. 13: 5, 6) prophetically describes the Papacy—Antichrist—as having a mouth speaking great things, and that he declares that in such speaking he blasphemes God and God's name— character, plan, works and office—agreeing on this point with the prophecy of Daniel that we have just been considering?—Dan. 7: 8, 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">822 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's—Antichrist's—claims in teaching, practice and ambition, some of which we have briefly mentioned, are these blasphemies?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that such high self-exaltation must some day meet the deepest humiliation, and that such blasphemies must some day be repudiated?—Luke 14: 11; Rev. 18: 1-24; Jer. 51: 44, compare with Rev. 17: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible also prophesies that the Papacy—Antichrist—would change—pervert God's times and laws?—Dan. 7: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that according to this passage the times that Papacy changed are certain dispensational periods of God's Plan?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in fulfillment of the prophecy of Dan. 7: 25 the Papacy claims that the period of her power and reign over the nations—approximately from 799 to 1799, which was a part of the Gospel Age—was the Millennial reign of Christ and His saints mentioned in Rev. 20: 4-6, whereas the Bible teaches that this reign will follow the Gospel Age and Christ's Second Coming?—Acts 3: 19-21; 15: 14-17; Dan. 7: 13, 14, 18, 22, 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in fulfilment of the prophecy of Dan. 7: 25 the Papacy—Antichrist—teaches that the period of the breaking and removal of its power to reign over the earth is the &quot;little season&quot; of Rev. 20: 7-9, which the Bible teaches is to come after the Millennium?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in Papacy's changing these times — dispensational periods of God's Plan—it has given us a counterfeit Gospel Age, a counterfeit Millennium, and a counterfeit &quot;little season&quot; following the Millennium, thereby again furnishing proof that the Papacy is Antichrist—the counterfeit Christ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in Dan. 7: 25 God has given a prophecy that the Papacy would change—pervert—God's laws?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this means that the Antichrist—the Papacy—would pervert God's doctrinal, preceptorial, promissory, hortatory, prophetical and typical ordinances and arrangements, to many of which perversions we have previously referred?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in fulfilling this prophecy Papacy— the Antichrist—has perverted—counterfeited—practically every feature of true Christianity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this prophecy proves God's foreknowledge of Papacy's terrible perversions of Truth and Righteousness?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible foretells the great craftiness, hypocrisy and cunning of the Papacy?—Dan. 7: 8; 8: 25; 11: 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by the two kings of Dan. 11: 27 the ecclesiastical power and the civil power in Christendom, prior to 539 A. D., are meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that at that time both of these rulerships sat at the table of power, each ambitiously seeking to deceive the other as to its real intentions, and to take to itself supremacy in the other's sphere?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by such a course the Papacy introduced the usually mendacious practice that is now called diplomacy?—Dan. 8: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that no system ever caused craft to prosper so greatly as did the Papacy?—Dan. 8: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's dealings in dark expediency and secret diplomacy with rulers and nations, individually and collectively, have been more hypocritical, cunning, deceitful and selfish than those of all other similar dealings combined?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the craft, hypocrisy and cunning of Papacy have created Jesuitism, than which nothing more deceitful and unconscionable was ever invented among men by human or Satanic ingenuity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as Jesuitism is the child of Papacy's craft, cunning and hypocrisy, so is it the truest representative of Papacy's spirit and practice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by such hypocrisy, cunning and deceitfulness Papacy has counterfeited Christian tactfulness, which Jesus said should always be harmless? Matt. 10: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy—Antichrist—has always degraded individuals in proportion as they have come under its influence?—Rev. 17: 2; 18: 2,3; 19: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's degrading influence has also been national, in that in the same proportion as nations have been under Papacy's influence they have been lowered in civilization, education, freedom, prosperity, and other elements of national greatness? Rev. 18:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the thoroughly Catholic nations Spain, Mexico, the Central and South American countries, Austro-Hungary, Poland, Bavaria—are examples of Papacy's degrading national influence?—Rev. 19: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that even in preponderantly Protestant countries the great majority of murderers and other notorious criminals are subjects of the Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy prospers in proportion as it keeps nations and individuals in ignorance, and that therefore the countries of Christendom where illiteracy is greatest are Papal countries?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy educates the laity only where Protestant competition forces it to do so for self-protection?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy by teaching its people numberless superstitions has deeply degraded them mentally and religiously?—Rev. 17: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by teaching the principle of unquestioning obedience to its commands and by inculcating blank, unreasoning acceptance of its teachings Papacy has greatly degraded its subjects mentally, morally and religiously?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the very nature of the case Papacy by its exaltation of the hierarchy and subjugation of the laity cannot but degrade its subjects, as all history attests that it has done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that many Papal institutions, like the confessional, pilgrimage, indulgences, masses, purgatory, monastic vows, asceticism, the celibacy of the priesthood, monasteries and nunneries are from the nature of the case directly degrading in their influence on the majority of their users?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy by having taken the Bible and its teachings away from its people has taken from them the greatest incentive to mental, moral and religious elevation (John 17: 17), and by teaching them its own errors gives them the most effective means to their degradation?—Rev. 17: 2; 19: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy, since 539 A. D., has incited more wars than all nations combined?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by arousing the nations of Christendom to enter the crusade against the Mohammedans to recover the so-called Holy Sepulchre the Papacy caused many millions of people to lose their lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that for centuries after the kings of Christendom saw the folly of the crusades the Papacy sought, happily in vain, to arouse the nations to further crusades against the Moslems?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy, to further its own political and religious ambitions has embroiled nations in war?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy was directly responsible for the wars against the Waldensians, Albigensians, Hussites, the Huguenots and the Netherlanders, because of their relinquishing the Papal faith?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy aroused Charles and Philip of Spain to war against many Protestant countries, like England, Holland, Germany and Denmark?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy, to crush Protestantism, instigated the Thirty Years' War, in which many millions of people perished?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that for about 125 years after the Reformation began there was scarcely a war in Europe that the Papacy did not incite?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy then sought—unsuccessfully in some cases—to incite still other wars?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that since that time the Papacy has had more or less to do in occasioning and inciting other wars?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's intrigues with Austria respecting the Romanizing of Servia's state religion occasioned the World-War?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that its doctrine of the Divine Right of Kings contributed mightily to the starting and continuing of the World-War?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, leaving the World-War out of consideration, careful historians charge the Papacy with the responsibility of destroying 50,000,000 lives through the wars that it has fomented?—Dan. 8: 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this proves that Papacy—next to Satan, who through introducing sin into our race (John 8: 44) murdered the whole human family—is the archmurderer of all history, and has by its course regarding war greatly degraded the peoples?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy would now foment any war that it thinks would result in its interests or in the overthrow of its enemies, and that this means that it would be glad to cripple by war every Protestant country-including America and Britain?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by such a course as to war Papacy has in part fulfilled the prophecies which speak of its cruelty and destructiveness?—Dan. 8: 23-25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy—Antichrist—is the chief foe of civil and religious liberty on earth?—Dan. 7: 21, 24, 25; 8: 10, 12, 13, 23-25; 11: 33; Rev. 13: 6,7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that, in the passage cited after the previous question, by the expression &quot;saints&quot; and &quot;sanctuary&quot; the faithful followers of Christ are meant; that by the expressions &quot;host of heaven&quot; and &quot;stars&quot; religious teachers are meant; and that by the expression &quot;the host&quot; the remainder of the people of Christendom—the laity—are meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that these passage foretell Papacy's antagonism to civil and religious liberty and its persecution of its opponents and its oppression of its subjects?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's claim of being the final authority on religious and civil questions, and its demand of absolute obedience to its teachings and commands, from their very nature are destructive of religious and civil liberty and are promotive of religious persecution and civil oppression?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy—Antichrist—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as such</span><span class="font3"> must be subversive of religious and civil liberty, oppressive to its subjects and murderous to its opponents, especially its religious opponents—the so-called heretics?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the Dark Ages through Papacy's influence and teachings religious and civil liberty were non-existent?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Do you know that for this reason the Papacy has relentlessly sought to suppress the reading of the Bible among others than her mouthpieces?—Dan. 8:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in harmony with this principle the Papacy has hindered and persecuted the translation of the Bible into living language?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that so far as possible the Papacy kept the Old and New Testaments—God's two Witnesses—covered with the &quot;sackcloth&quot; of dead language during the long period of her power?—Rev. 11:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by dark ctimes the Papacy hindered the translation and spread of the Bible until, during the last century, through the Bible Societies, backed by the spirit of true liberty, fraternity and equality, it was effectually prevented from further successful hindrance of the good work?—Rev. 11: 3-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that for the common people to have been found with Bibles in the vernacular during Papacy's ascendency meant persecution, and frequently death, through the &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy has made bonfires of multitudes of Bibles on the plea that the Bibles of heretics were mistranslations?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Catholic laity may have the Bible only by special clerical permission, and then usually only when annotated with grossly misleading Papal comments?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that these facts prove that the Papacy fears the Bible as its greatest foe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy has not only proscribed the Bible, but all other books that, more or less deriving their light from the Bible, teach differently from the Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy keeps a double list of such books—called the index of prohibited books and the index of expurgated books—the former being totally prohibited to its adherents, apart from special dispensations, and the latter permitted only after certain papally disapproved parts are deleted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the above are only a few of the ways in which the Papacy has &quot;cast down the Truth to the ground&quot; and trodden down the saints and the laity?—Dan. 8: 12, 13; John 17: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Bible repeatedly and emphatically prophesies that the Papacy would oppose and persecute God's faithful people—the true saints?—Dan. 7: 21, 25; Dan. 8: 11-13, 24; Dan. 11: 33; Rev. 13: 6, Rev. 17: 6; Rev. 18: 24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papal persecutions of the saints were from every standpoint immeasurably more severe than were the Jewish and Pagan—Roman—persecutions of the saints?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Jewish and Pagan persecutions of the saints were intermittent, more or less lenient, restricted usually to individuals, often perfunctorily carried out, more or less humane in methods, and usually largely escapable, whereas Papal persecutions of the saints were continual for many long centuries, cruel in the extreme, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">diabolic in method,</span><span class="font3"> directed not only against individuals, but also against whole communities and nations, fanatically systematic and in most cases entirely unescapable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the longest non-papal persecution— that of the Roman Emperor Diocletian—lasted ten years, while Papal persecution lasted for more than twelve hundred years?</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in this way the Roman Catholic Church caused the Civil Power to persecute saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in such doings that Church antityped the heathen and wicked Queen Jezebel, and that the Civil Power antityped King Ahab of Israel, through whom Jezebel persecuted Jehovah's prophets, and that the persecuted saints antityped those persecuted prophets?—Rev. 2: 20; 1 Kings 16: 29—19: 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that even before the year 539 Papacy influenced the Emperors Constantine, Valentinian, Gratian, Theodosius, Arcadius and Honorius to pass penal laws against heresy, Constantine passing two, Theodosius fifteen, Arcadius twelve, and Honorius eighteen, all of which are to be found in the Theodosian, or Justinian codes?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that while from 539 onward the civil powers, incited thereto by the Papacy, persecuted dissenting saints, it was especially since early in the thirteenth century, through Innocent III., 1198-1216, who authorized the so-called &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition, 1204, that the persecution of the heretics—usually God's saints—by the so-called &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition and by national crusades took on a form of ruthlessness unequaled in human history, not excepting the ruthlessness of the World-War?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy, sometimes by threats, sometimes by flattery and sometimes by rewards—bribes— aroused the persecuring fury of rulers, armies and civilians?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy offered these prospective murderers of God's saints plenary indulgence—full release—from purgatorial sufferings, if they would make some who actually were God's saints suffer even unto death?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the most cruel and revolting tortures were applied to the saints by the Inquisitors in their efforts to induce them to &quot;recant&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the following are some of the things that the &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition did to exterminate God's saints, and with them God's Truth—scourging them; stretching them on racks 6 and 8 inches longer than their natural sizes; disjointing their bones; breaking their teeth with hammers; cutting out their tongues; slicing off their cheeks; cutting off their ears, lips and noses; gouging out their eyes; pouring melted</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">lead into their empty eye-sockets, into their ears and down their throats; pulling out their nails with hot pincers; cutting off their fingers, toes, hands and feet; cutting off the breasts of women; ripping open pregnant women and tearing from them their unborn infants, which they sometimes would then bum at the stake with their prospective mothers; torturing with special instruments the most sensitive parts of the human body; skinning, boiling, roasting and burning them alive; forcing urine and excrement down their throats; breaking their arms by sudden raising and letting them fall not quite to the floor with chains attached to pulleys in the ceilings and tied to their hands, which were forced back of them, while 300 pound weights were attached to their feet; forcing them to submit to the embraces of a machine called the &quot;kissing virgin,&quot; which was covered with horseshoe nails and knife blades whose points entered the bodies pressed against the machine; applying thumbscrews and Spanish boots to them, the former crushing their thumbs and the latter lacerating their feet and legs up to the knees; impaling them; pulling their bodies apart by tying their feet with long ropes to two horses which were then made to run at full speed in opposite directions; stripping them and tying them to fleet horses which dragged them until dead over rocky fields; casting them off of eminences upon spears below; beheading and disemboweling them; burying them alive; torturing and murdering their nearest relatives before their eyes, etc., etc., etc.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the victims of the &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition, under 45 of its &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisitor-Generals, totaled 347,704 men and women, besides many others tortured by other &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisitor-Generals?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition hired physicians to watch its victims undergoing torture, so that the physicians could stop the tortures just short of killing the victims, in order that after somewhat of convalescence the tortures could again be applied to the partly cured and highly sensitive victims?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that not only did Pope Innocent III. authorize the &quot;Holy&quot; Inquisition, but he offered a plenary indulgence — full release — from purgatorial sufferings to all who would join in the crusade against the Waldenses and Albigenses of France and Italy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in response to his call a half million men from France, Germany and Italy joined the crusade and devastated entire provinces?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that at Beziers, 1209, they slaughtered 60,000 men, women and children; that at Lavaur, 1211, they slaughtered thousands of others; and that in one day in the province of Languedoc alone they devastated dries, towns and country, slaughtering over 100,000 Albigenses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that on that day the crusaders attended mass in the morning, and throughout the rest of the day devastated Languedoc and murdered its inhabitants?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papal clergy publicly thanked God for the &quot;victory&quot; over these &quot;heretics&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that under Charles V. and Philip II. of Spain, in the Netherlands alone 100,000 Protestants were martyred by Papal instigation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that following the example of Charles and Philip of Spain, and instigated thereto by the Papacy, the French kings, Francis, Henry, Charles and Louis XIV., fiendishly persecuted the French Protestants—Huguenots— in various provinces of France, slaying them by the hundreds of thousands, and exiling over a million of them, sparing neither men, women nor children, and that with indescribable tortures?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that among others of these massacres that of St. Bartholomew's Day, 1572, begun by treachery to the Protestants, carried out with extremes! cruelty and destroying approximately 70,000 people, was instigated by Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that both the Pope and the French king had medals struck in commemoration of this infamous massacre, as if it were something of which one should boast?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Pope had a picture of the St. Bartholomew massacre hung in the Vatican, bearing the inscription, &quot;The Pontiff approves the fate of Coligny&quot;— the French Protestant leader and French Admiral, who was treacherously invited to a royal wedding ostensibly arranged for the reconciliation of the French Catholics and Protestants, but really intended to bring all the prominent French Protestants to Paris for what turned out to be St. Bartholomew's massacre?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Coligny's head was severed from his dead body by the French queen's order, then embalmed and sent by her as a trophy to the Pope, while the Parisian populace dragged the trunk of the body through the streets of Paris?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that after receiving Coligny's embalmed head the Pope had the above-mentioned picture hung in the Vatican?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Antichrist in 1641 called upon the Irish to enter a war of religion to kill or exile Protestants, and that in Ulster alone 154,000 Protestants, men, women and children, were either killed or exiled, amid utmost barbarity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that O'Neil, the Irish primate, called the massacre &quot;a pious and lawful war,&quot; and that Pope Urban VIII. granted plenary indulgence to its executors as &quot;gallantly doing what in them lay to extirpate and wholly root out the pestiferous leaven of heretical contagion&quot;— Protestantism?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the above facts as well as hosts of others almost as atrocious are so well authenticated that even Papal historians are forced to admit their truth, though trying to mitigate the force of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by these massacres during 1260 years the Papacy forced the faithful followers of Christ into the symbolic wilderness—isolation—out of which the faithful emerged with large and sure freedom only from 1799 onward?—Rev. 12: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by these as well as by other methods of Satan &quot;it was given to him [the Papacy] to make war with the saints and to overcome them&quot; and to &quot;wear out the saints of the Most High&quot;?—Rev. 13: 6, Dan. 7: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it is for these reasons that Antichrist—the Papacy—is described as &quot;drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus&quot;?—Rev. 17: 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this blood is now on Papacy's hands and calls for vengeance, which very shortly will be executed in the destruction of the entire Papal system?— Rev. 6: 9-11; Rev. 18:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy—Antichrist—would reenact these persecutions here in America, if it only had the power, as within the last 50 years in Mexico, Central and South America it has aroused mobs to kill Protestant missionaries?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy curses every one to eternal torment who teaches or practices contrary to her theories and practices?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy has cursed the faithful followers of Christ with blood-curdling curses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the Romish Pontifical the following is only one of Papacy's authorized curses against Protestants: &quot;May God Almighty and all His saints curse them with the curse with which the devil and his angels are cursed! Let them be destroyed out of the land of the living! Let the vilest of deaths come upon them, and let them descend alive into the pit [of eternal torment] ! Let their seed be destroyed from the earth-by hunger and thirst and nakedness and all distress let them perish! May they have all misery and pestilence and torment! Let all they have be cursed! Always and everywhere let them be cursed! Speaking and silent let them be cursed! Within and without let them be cursed! From the crown of the head to the sole of the foot let them be cursed! Let their eyes become blind; let their ears become deaf; let their mouths become dumb: let their tongue cleave to their jaws; let not their hands handle; let not their feet walk! Let all the members of their body be cursed! Cursed let them be, standing or lying, from this time forth forever; and thus let their candle be extinguished in the presence of God, at the day of judgment! Let hungry wolves devour their corpses! Let the devil and his angels be their companions for ever! Amen, Amen; so be it; so let it be&quot;?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it was not God's Spirit that dictated this curse?—Matt. 5: 43-45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that only Satan and his chief earthly representative—Antichrist—could pour out such a curse?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that a religion whose spirit draws up and authorizes such a curse must have been invented by Satan and must be the basest kind of a counterfeit of true Christianity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ANTI-CHRIST'S REVELATION—SMITING—END</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that some of the Scripture passage that treat of the development of the Papacy to its greatest height of exaltation speak of its being revealed later in its true character and of its being then smitten by the Truth?—2 Thess. 2: 6, 8; Rev. 13: 3, 10; Dan. 7: 26; Dan. 8: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the time for Papacy's revealment as the Antichrist of the Bible was the period of the Reformation?—Dan. 11: 32-35; 2 Thess. 2:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Reformation proceeded through two phases, the first being characterized by unorganized, or undenominational movements, from 1309 A. D. to 1498 A. D., the second being characterized by organized, or denominational movements, from 1517 A. D. to 1846 A. D.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that both of these phases of the Reformation emphasized, and proved from the Bible with historical corroborations, the fact that Papacy is the Antichrist of the Bible, and thus they revealed the Man of Sin as such?—2 Thess. 2: 6, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that St: Paul, by the expression, &quot;spirit of His mouth,&quot; in 2 Thess. 2: 8, meant the power of the Truth as given in the Bible, which is God's figurative mouth— that through which He speaks to us?—2 Thess. 2: 8, compare with Rev. 1: 16; 2: 16; 19: 15, 21; Is. 49: 2; Eph. 6: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that St. John by the second use of the term &quot;sword,&quot; in Rev. 13: 10, also means the Truth given in the Bible?—Eph. 6: 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Truth as contained in the Bible is the great weapon by which the Lord according to prophecy has revealed and smitten Antichrist as such?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that History proves that such a predicted revelation and smiting of Papacy has taken place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Marsilius of Padua, one of the ablest men of the fourteenth century, began in 1309 to learn the Biblical principles that enabled him to recognize the Papacy as Antichrist, usurping power in both Church and State?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that by 1324 he had so thoroughly learned these principles as to have written in 90 days a large book entitled The Defender of the Peace, which from Scripture, Reason and History disproved Antichrist's claims of power and authority in Church and State?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that even to this day Marsilius' book is a standard on the subject that it discusses?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Marsilius had as colaborers certain of the ablest scholars of his day, including men like John of Jandun, Michael of Cesena, general of the so-called schismatical Franciscans, and William Occam, the foremost theologian and philosopher of his time?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in the literary war waged by these</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">838 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">against the defenders of the Papacy the latter were thoroughly refuted, and thus Papacy began to be revealed as Antichrist?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that John Wiclif of England, the ablest theologian and philosopher of his day, especially from 1378 to the end of 1384 attacked the Papacy as Antichrist with unanswerable power, and greatly added to the Scriptural arguments on this subject advanced by Marsilius?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he started from the basis that no religious doctrine or practice should be permitted in the Church, unless it be proven to be Biblical?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this principle moved him to reject most of Papacy's doctrines and practices as erroneous?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that multitudes in England under his teachings rejected the Papacy and its chief doctrines and practices?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Wiclif increased greatly the revelation of Papacy as Antichrist, and assisted in its smiting?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in 1391 John Huss of Bohemia became interested in Wiclif s writings and shortly afterward began his career as a reformer, sealing it in 1415 with a martyr's death at the stake, to which a Papal council condemned him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he manifested the Papacy as Antichrist to hundreds of thousands in Bohemia?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that John Wessel of Holland was used by the Lord to make still more manifest as of Antichrist not a few of the Papal doctrines?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he laid down as basic the four cardinal principles of the Reformation by sects as it was developed from 1517 to 1846?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Jerome Savonarola in Italy likewise wrought fruitfully in the work of manifesting the Papacy as Antichrist and shared in its smiting until his death as a martyr in 1498?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that all of the reformers hitherto</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">mentioned led &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unorganized—undenominational—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">reformatory movements which, one and all, contributed a share in the work of revealing the Papacy as Antichrist and in smiting it with the Word of God?—2 Thess. 2: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this class of Reformers are a part of those referred to in Dan. 11: 33 as &quot;they that understand among the people shall instruct many, yet shall they fall by the sword and by flame, by captivity and by spoil?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the next verse, by the expression &quot;They shall be holden [assisted] with a little help,&quot; refers to the Reformation by sects begun in 1517 by Luther, and ended in 1846 by Miller in the Second Advent movement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the following are the four fundamental principles of the Reformation by sects— usually called the Protestant Reformation: (1) The Bible is the sole source and rule of faith and practice; (2) Justification is by faith alone through the merit of Christ; (3) Christ alone is the Head of the Church; and (4) all and only the Faithful are Priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Lutheran church placed the chief emphasis on justification by faith alone as against the Papal doctrine of justification by faith and works?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Presbyterian church placed the chief stress on the Bible as the sole source and rule of faith and practice as against the Papal doctrine of tradition as a source and rule of faith and practice?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Episcopal church placed the chief emphasis on the sole Headship of Christ in the Church as against the headship of the Pope?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Baptist church placed the chief stress on the exclusive priesthood of the Faithful as against the Papal doctrine of its priesthood?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Congregational church stressed the doctrine of the equality of all the brethren in the Church as against the Papal doctrine of the superiority of the priests to the laity?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">840 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Methodist church stressed the doctrine of consecration and heart religion as against the formalism of the Papal religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Disciple church emphasized the doctrine of the Apostolic organization of the Church as against the doctrine of the Papal organization of the Church?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Advent church stressed the doctrine of eternal life to be gained in the resurrection of the dead at Christ's Second Advent as against the Papal doctrine of eternal life being inherent in man?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that other denominations stressed other important truths?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the above-mentioned churches wrought out the Reformation by sects, or denominations, from 1517 of 1846?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that each of them stressed an important truth as against a Papal error?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it was by the truths that they emphasized against Papal errors that they both revealed the Papacy as Antichrist and smote it with the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this smiting was the means by which the Lord consumed much of the Papal power in Church and State?—2 Thess. 2: 8; Rev. 13: 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that before this revelation and smiting began the Papacy was almost omnipotent in Church and State?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when it was finished the Papacy's power in Church and State was very largely consumed?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the advocacy of the principle of liberty in the Church from the Papacy led to the advocacy of the principle of liberty in the State from the Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as sisters Religious Liberty and Civil Liberty supported one another against Papal absolutism— the ancient ravisher of both?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that with the support of Protestantism many nations cast off the Papal political power,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> Britain, all Scandinavia and Holland, and most of Germany and Switzerland?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that other countries and certain provinces obtained temporary freedom from Rome politically, but were later by bloody wars and Jesuitical intrigues forced into subjection to it by Austria, Spain and France?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that as the principles of religious and political liberty gradually spread, the Papacy's political power, even in Papal countries, gradually diminished?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that it was the French Revolution and especially Napoleon—1789 to 1809—that broke forever the spell of Papal political authority over the nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that France was for a thousand years Papacy's most dependable ally?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that through France above all other nations Papacy exercised its political power to the subversion of Truth and Righteousness throughout Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that France above all other nations at Antichrist's instigation persecuted and warred against movements protesting against the Papacy, like the Waldenses, the Albigenses, and the Huguenots?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the Papacy could depend on France when it could depend on no other nation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that France was as drunken by Papal doctrine as any other nation on earth?—Rev. 17: 2; 18: 3; 19: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this extreme subserviency to Papacy on the part of France prepared the latter to strike Papacy the hardest blow of all history, once France learned that she had been deceived, wronged and exploited by Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the wrath of revolutionary France poured itself out in stripping the Papacy of all its vast French wealth and privileges, in abrogating its services, in massacring or banishing those of its clergy who refused to wed, in freeing its monks and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">842 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuels—Kings—Chronicles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Appendix 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">nuns from monastic life and institutions and in banishing from social and political life everything derived from Papacy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Napoleon Bonaparte more than any other individual broke Papacy's civil power?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that he and his generals four times, from 1796 to 1808, invaded the Papal States, exacting the first time a large indemnity, the second time a still larger indemnity and a part of the Papal territory, the third time abrogating entirely the temporal power of the Pope, setting up a Republic in its stead, and, taking Pius VI. to France as a prisoner, where he died the next year, 1799, and, when later the Pope received again a part of his temporal power, at the fourth invasion taking away every shred of it from him, in 1808-1809?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Napoleon's disregard and defiance of the Papacy's anathemas and claims of Christs Vicarship and his rough handling of and trampling upon the Papacy not only broke the temporal power of the Pope, but also the superstitious dread of the Papacy which the bulk of Europe had felt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that despite a precarious assumption of temporal power by the Papacy, which it arrogated to itself, as a ward either of France or of Austria, and which was finally ended by Italy in 1870, the Papacy has scarcely since Napoleon's time dared breathe aloud the claims of supremacy over the kings of earth of which it formerly boasted?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that when the final settlement of the Napoleonic wars came the Papacy despite its wishes was not even invited to send representatives to the Peace Congress at Vienna, in 1815-1816, as it also was snubbed in the same way by the Peace Congress at Paris in 19191920?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that this proves that the civil rulership of the Papacy is broken, despite Papacy's political intrigues to have it restored?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that almost all the States of Europe that had been united with the Papacy as the State religion have in their midst separated Church and State and have destroyed Papacy's civil power in their lands?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that the curtailment of Papacy's civil power and the casting off of their union with it on the part of the European States is what is meant by the &quot;ten horns&quot; of the symbolic &quot;Beast&quot; making the Catholic Church desolate and naked, and eating her flesh?—Rev. 17: 16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that before long these same nations will &quot;bum her with fire&quot;—destroy the Papacy entirely?—Rev. 17: 16;2Thess. 2: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Papacy's present diplomatic activity and increased influence among the nations is her final boasting—&quot;I sit as a queen,&quot; etc.—immediately preceding her final and complete destruction?—Rev. 18: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Napoleon was an unconscious instrument in God's hands to ruin Papacy's temporal power and break the spell of superstitious dread of the Papacy that hung like a dark cloud over the nations, and that his activities in this and other respects are described in Dan. 11:29,30, 36-45?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in Dan. 11: 2-45 there is a prophecy of world events from the days of Cyrus of Persia, 536 B.C., until Napoleon's death, 1821 A. D.?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that in this section of Scripture the King of the North stands, first for the Grecian Empire in its Syrian subdivision especially, then for its successor, Rome, and then for Rome's successor—the European Concert of Powers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that &quot;the King of the South&quot; is Egypt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that Dan. 11: 5-17 treats of the conflicts between Alexander's successors, especially in Syria, and the Egyptian rulers until the time of Cleopatra?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that from there onward the prophecy touches only on the more prominent persons and events of history connected with the two great invasions of Egypt by the King of the North before Napoleon's invasion—the third great invasion—also on the conflict between the civil and clerical power in Christendom, on the activities and the persecution of the saints and on the Reformation until, apart from verses 29 and 30, which are thrown in parenthetically, it describes Napoleon's activity in verses 36-45?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that verse 17 treats of Rome's occupation of Egypt by Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony and of their relations with Cleopatra, queen of Egypt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that verses 18 and 19 treat of Augustus' and Antonym's quarrel as Rome's and Egypt's representatives, verses 17-19 describing the first great invasion of Egypt from the North?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that verse 20 refers to Augustus Caesar, the tax-gathering Roman Emperor (Luke 2: 1-3), and that verses 21-24 refer to Tiberius Caesar, under whom Jesus Christ—&quot;the Prince of the Covenant&quot; (verse 22)—was crucified?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that verses 25-28 treat of the second great invasion of Egypt from the North, that under Emperor Aurelian, when Zenobia, queen of Palmyra, a descendant of Cleopatra, claimed and exercised authority over Egypt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Do you know that verses 29, 30 treat of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt—the third great invasion of Egypt from the North—and are thrown in parenthetically to give the connection and contrast between the first and second invasions, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the third great invasion of Egypt from the North?</span></p>
