<p><span class="font2">&quot;SAVED BY HOPE.&quot; (Romans 8:24) Just that important it is to have the hope which Almighty God set before mankind when it first came into a state of need The need for knowledge of that saving hope was never more pressing than today, when the world has fallen into most desperate straits. Most grateful we are to have such an excellent statement of the hope as that set forth in the widely heard lecture &quot;The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind&quot;, and we gladly preserve it in print and release it in this booklet to all mankind for whom God's kingdom is at hand with all the blessings for which human hearts have long waited.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>The Kingdom Hope of All Mankind</span></h1>
<p><span class="font5">M</span><span class="font3">ANKIND has known human kingdoms since the days of mighty Nimrod, the king of Babel, the first king spoken of in reliable history. That was over 4,000 years ago, or more than thirteen centuries before the city of Rome was founded (753 B.C.) and became a kingdom. Yes, it was more than fourteen centuries before an Indian king or chieftain near the Himalaya mountains became father to Buddha the oriental religious leader (570-560 B.C.). Today, after so long a time, some kingdoms still remain, alongside of other forms of political government, including the United Nations organization born in 1945 (A.D.). All the distinct kingdoms, empires and forms of political governments that have existed since Nimrod have failed to realize the hopes of the people, and now the political and religious leaders of the modern world proclaim the United Nations to be the only hope of all mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, if we use merely our powers of reason we can see that the U. N. is a vain hope. Why so? Because if the kingdoms, empires and other political governments have failed separately, how can they possibly succeed by uniting together a grand collection of failures? Many failures added together do not sum up to success. Besides that, no man individually is able to save himself and lift himself up out of his own difficulties. For this basic reason, if all mankind do combine together in one worldwide union, it will not make it more possible for the human race to save itself from the conditions that have afflicted it for these six thousand years. All humanity must turn elsewhere than to itself for true hope and its realization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where, then, must all mankind turn with the assurance that it will not be disappointed? Since it is precluded from looking to united mankind or to united nations for relief and salvation, only one direction remains in which to look, and that is to the Almighty Creator of earth and of man. According to the very meaning of the word &quot;God&quot;, the Creator of the earth and of all the visible universe is God, the one living and true God. In him lies the foundation for the true hope. What is more, this Almighty God holds out a hope for all those of mankind who are willing to accept it and rely upon it. In writings that he caused to be written by his active force or spirit he is called &quot;the God of hope&quot;. One human writer, whom the Creator's spirit caused to write, says this prayer for believers today: &quot;Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the holy spirit.&quot; And to show that we gain knowledge of the true hope through what this Creator God caused to be written by his holy spirit, the same writer says: &quot;Whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.&quot; -Romans 15: 4,13, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American Standard Version</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The value and importance of having this true hope cannot be overstated. The sacred scriptures that the &quot;God of hope&quot; caused to be written make up the book called &quot;The Holy Scriptures&quot; or &quot;The Bible&quot;; and in this Bible it is written: &quot;For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that [which] we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.&quot; (Romans 8: 24, 25) If we do not have the true hope, we are sure to misplace our trust, and, after we have waited patiently, we are certain to gain no salvation, but to be destroyed together with our false hope. On the other hand, if we become acquainted with the true hope and put our trust and reliance upon the One that offers such hope and that can really fulfill it, then we are certain to be saved after we have patiently waited upon the Creator God to make hope come true. Many centuries before the days of Nimrod, at the very beginning of mankind's existence when it came in need of a hope, the Creator expressed and held out a glorious hope; and the fact that to this day the hope is not seen as realized does not make the hope foolish or foundationless. If it were already realized, what need would there be of hoping? But because we do not yet see it realized, we must hope on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nevertheless, we do not &quot;hope against hope&quot;; that is to say, we do not hope without good cause or reason. True hope was uttered by Almighty God the Creator, and he even had it written down for us to read now, six thousand years later. He cannot lie; for it is written of him: &quot;In hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal; but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message.&quot; (Titus 1:2,3, Am.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Stan. Ver.) He will stand by his written word and will make it good, for his own vindication. He backs up his word by his own almighty power, and hence there is no possibility for his word of hope to fail. Not only do we have his unchangeable written Word, but now there exist all the arrangements and developments that he has made during the past six thousand years for the bringing of this hope to fruition. His arrangements and developments are recorded on the pages of reliable history, and he will not now reverse them all at this late date, so near to making his promise true. His Word and arrangements produce faith in us. Such faith, based on his Word, is the ground for all our happy expectations. Concerning this he says in his written Word: &quot;Now faith is the substance [or, ground] of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.&quot; (Hebrews 11:1) So we may hope on for the little while longer, because we have such a substantial basis upon which to rest ourselves in faith and hope. We can hold fast to our desire for what God has promised, with faith that it is obtainable, and expect to receive and realize it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For thousands of years the world of mankind has been pinning its hopes to political and religious governments clear down to this &quot;atomic age&quot; and its United Nations. Hence men in general have been in just the condition that God describes them in his Word, namely, &quot;having no hope, and without God in the world.&quot; (Ephesians 2:12) Their hope in the United Nations today is a vain hope; and as time and events go on, more and more of all mankind will discern that they are without hope, as far as salvation from nations and men is concerned. Since, therefore, our hope lies outside the realm of helpless mankind and unsuccessful man-made governments, we ask: What is the right and true hope, hence the only hope, of all mankind today? The Creator's own Word answers, The kingdom of God! It will be one kingdom over all the earth and over all its peoples.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>THE KING APPOINTED</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">God the Creator has appointed the King to represent him and rule for him in this kingdom of salvation for all humankind. This one is his own beloved Son, whom he brought forth as &quot;the beginning of the creation of God&quot;, &quot;the firstborn of every creature.&quot; God's own Word uses such expressions respecting his faithful and devoted Son. (See Revelation 3:14 and Colossians 1:15.) As Creator he used this only begotten Son as his Servant in creating all other things. It was to this Son that God said at the climax of earth's creation: &quot;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&quot; (See John 1:1-3 and Colossians 1:16-18 and Genesis 1:26.) God's promise that his faithful Son and Coworker should be the King in the coming kingdom of God was made shortly after He created man and woman, in the very garden of Eden or paradise in which God placed them upon this earth. Because it was so many thousands of years ago the apostle Paul says God made the promise &quot;before times eternal&quot;, or long time-periods ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That was at the sad time when the perfect man and woman had willfully disobeyed God their Creator and had taken their stand on the side of His adversary, whom the Bible calls &quot;that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan&quot;. (Revelation 12:9; 20:2) Now all three stood before God for judgment, namely, Adam and Eve and the Serpent, Satan the Devil. First, God pronounced his curse upon the wicked deceiver, the old Serpent, and said to this invisible spirit creature who was pictured by the serpent on the ground: &quot;I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&quot; (Genesis 3:14, 15, Am. Stan. Ver.) That Seed, which delivers mankind from the Serpent's power, is the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot; and is his Son; and this promise in Eden meant that the Son of God should have a kingdom with which to bruise the Serpent and all his wicked seed and destroy them. But before entering upon his kingdom for the destruction of all wickedness, the Son must suffer the assaults of the Serpent and of all his brood and must be bruised to the death for his faithfulness to God his Father. But Almighty God would heal the bruise by raising him from the dead, and then he would in due time put him in the power of the Kingdom to destroy the Serpent and all his seed of evildoers. For that reason God's Seed and his kingdom represent the true and only hope of all mankind. The trustworthy facts show that the Seed is Jesus Christ, his Son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The kingdom of Nimrod in the third millennium before Christ was the first kingdom to be established upon earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was nothing less than an effort by Nimrod, under the Serpent's control, to turn the hope of all mankind away from the promised kingdom of God to a counterfeit manmade political government. God's own Word brands Nimrod's kingdom as a devilish move against the good purpose of the living and true God, whose name is &quot;Jehovah&quot;. In that third millennium before Christ Jehovah God brought on a global flood, which wiped out all mankind except God-fearing Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, and the wives of all four men. Nimrod was a great-grandson of Noah through Ham and his son Cush. Concerning him as the first king on earth God's Word tells us in the first book of the Bible: &quot;And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah : wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel.&quot; (Genesis 10: 8-10, Am. Stan. Ver.) Babel, or Babylon, was more than a thousand miles west of India. Nimrod's being a mighty hunter &quot;before Jehovah&quot; meant he was in opposition to Jehovah God and that he carried on military campaigns against weaker men and peoples and that other men worshiped him, considering him even superior to Jehovah God. King Nimrod did not please or honor God the Creator, but served God's great adversary. So the Serpent, Satan the Devil, deceived many people into thinking Nimrod was the promised seed of the woman that was to bruise the Serpent's head. Hence, at his death in the flesh, Nimrod was declared to be immortalized and was deified for worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All the kingdoms of this present evil world have stemmed from Nimrod's kingdom. The Babylonish spirit of opposition to Jehovah which all such kingdoms show proves it. Not long after Nimrod's violent career a faithful servant of Jehovah God, named Abraham, was born, not far from the location of Babel or Babylon. He was descended from Noah through his son Shem, and did not believe that Nimrod was the promised Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;. God moved Abraham out of Babylon's neighborhood down into the land of Palestine, and God promised to give it to this man's descendants. Because of Abraham's faithfulness and obedience to him God said concerning Abraham's wife Sarah: &quot;I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.&quot; (Genesis 17:15,16) This son named Isaac was then used to picture the Son of God who was to become the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;, the Ruler in the promised kingdom of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Abraham's day there was a kingdom in the land of Palestine that was in harmony with Jehovah God. It was the kingdom of King Melchizedek at the city of Salem, which city later became Jerusalem. King Melchizedek was also then the priest of the Most High God Jehovah. He blessed Abraham, saying: &quot;Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth; and blessed be the most high God. which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand.&quot; (Genesis 14:18-20) Out of respect for God, to whom King Melchizedek ministered as priest, Abraham gave him tithes, or the tenth part of the goods, as a contribution. Because of King Melchizedek's faithful priesthood Jehovah God used him as a prophetic picture of the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;, the coming High Priest and King of God's kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Inasmuch as Abraham was willing to obey God to the very point of sacrificing his beloved son Isaac, believing that God was able to raise him from the dead, Jehovah God said further to Abraham: &quot;Thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.&quot; (Genesis 22: 17,18) That meant that when the heavenly Son of God would come to earth and be born as a man to be bruised by the Serpent, he would be a descendant of Abraham through Isaac, and he would become a king and by means of him God would bless all the families of the earth that became his subjects and obeyed him. In this way Jehovah God strengthened the hope of all believers in the coming kingdom of God. Why? Because here God swore by his own self to, this promise respecting the Seed of Abraham; and that strengthened hope is for us to hold to like an anchor fixed in heaven, beyond the veil of Christ's flesh. Wherefore, concerning this oath-bound promise to bless all the nations of the earth through the kingdom of his Son Jesus Christ, God's Word says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;God, being minded to show more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath; that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled far refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us: which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil [namely, in heaven]; whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.&quot; -Hebrews 6:13-20, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Besides King Melchizedek, another king whom Jehovah God favored and used as a prophetic picture of the royal Seed was David the king of Jerusalem. David was born at Bethlehem in Palestine, about six miles southwest of Jerusalem. Fittingly he was a descendant of Abraham, through his great-grandson Judah. Because King David faithfully worshiped Jehovah God and desired to build a temple to him at Jerusalem, God promised that the Seed of the &quot;woman&quot; would be born as a man descended from David's royal line and in that way the kingdom would remain in the line of David for ever and ever. By means of his prophet, Jehovah God said to King David: &quot;I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son.&quot; -2 Samuel 7:12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For this reason none of the worldly kingdoms in the past or in the present time could fulfill the Kingdom hope of all mankind, because none of them have been or are ruled over by this promised Descendant of King David, the Son of God or Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;. The claims that</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christendom's kings are representatives of the Son of God on their thrones have proved to be false. This explains why the promised blessings of the kingdom of God have failed to come through Christendom's kings and rulers anointed by the religious clergy. None of these were descendants of faithful Abraham through King David, but the kingdoms of these rulers of Christendom to this day have merely served the Devil's purpose to sidetrack the people's hope from the true kingdom of God by his Christ.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE ONE IN WHOM NATIONS MUST TRUST</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ himself personally, who was born at Bethlehem nineteen centuries ago of the line of King David, is the One appointed by Jehovah God for the people to trust in. Due to this the Scriptures speak of him as the &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope&quot;. (1 Timothy 1:1) Before his birth as a man, the angel of God told his human mother that the Kingdom promise made to David God would fulfill to her son, who should be called &quot;Jesus&quot;. (Luke 1:3033) A prophecy by God's angel to the faithful Daniel foretold the very year when Jesus should present himself publicly as the Messiah or Christ, that is to say, as God's Chosen One anointed to be the King of the promised government for the blessing of all the families and nations of the earth. (Daniel 9:24-27) In that very prophesied year Jesus was baptized in the Jordan river by John the Baptist. He was anointed with the spirit of God as soon as he came up out of the water, thus becoming </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Anointed One</span><span class="font3">; and the voice of God was heard to say out of heaven: &quot;This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.&quot; (Matthew</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3:13-17) For this very reason, that old Serpent, Satan the Devil, led his demons on in an attempt to destroy Jesus Christ, or at least to bruise his heel as God's prophecy in Eden had foretold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When on earth what could Jesus Christ show to prove he was worthy to be ruler in God's kingdom and that he could fulfill the hope of all mankind? He could show that by his human birth from the virgin Jewess named Mary he was descended from Abraham and King David and was born at the place foretold in prophecy, Bethlehem. Being born of an untouched virgin, he had no human father. The life which he had from God his Father in heaven was transferred down to the virgin's body, so that he was born as a perfect human creature untainted by sin, disease, and condemnation of death. Hence he had the right to eternal life on earth. After his baptism in the Jordan he had God's own word from heaven that he was the approved Son of God. At the same time he had been anointed with God's spirit to be the king of the foretold kingdom of God and to occupy its throne forever. He thus became the heir of the Kingdom promise made to David. However, this kingdom was not to be an earthly kingdom, even if it did rule over the earth. It was to be a heavenly government. For this reason, at the Jordan river, Jehovah God started Jesus on the way back to heaven by begetting him with his divine spirit to become his spiritual Son once again. For him to become fully a spirit Son of God again, he must lay down his human life first. On this account, when Jesus began preaching after his baptism and his anointing with the spirit, he preached a kingdom higher than our earth. He preached: &quot;The kingdom of heaven is at hand.&quot; -Matthew 4:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To back up the truth that he was the Son of Jehovah God from heaven and was anointed to rulership in the promised Kingdom for the blessing of all mankind, Jesus performed many signs or miracles as a man on earth. He preached the gospel or good news of the Kingdom to the poor people free of charge. He multiplied food to feed the hungry multitudes. He cured the people of their many ailments, opening the blind eyes, unstopping the deaf ears, loosing the dumb tongues, casting out the demons that obsessed men and women, cleansing the plagued, restoring the crippled, and even raising the dead back to life. The record is that &quot;there went virtue out of him, and healed them all&quot;. (Luke 6:19) He exposed the religious frauds and oppressors and hypocrites, and fearlessly told the common people the truth in order to make them free. He committed no sin in deed, word, or thought, but kept the law of God perfectly and fulfilled all the prophecies of God's Word respecting him. Thereby he remained innocent and perfect and held on to his right to everlasting life and his worthiness to rulership in the kingdom of God. He did not try to glorify himself so as to get the popular worship. No; but he endeavored to get the people to glorify Jehovah God, and he let his words, deeds and course of life testify to the people as to who he was, namely, that he was the promised King on whom to rest their hope. Hence we read these words by the apostle Matthew:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Many followed him; and he healed them all, and charged them that they should not make known: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, Behold, my servant whom I have chosen; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment to the nations. He shall not strive, nor cry aloud; neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. And in his name shall the nations hope.&quot; -Matthew 12:1521, Am. Stan. Ver., marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He did not follow any religious practice of living a lonely, contemplative life, strictly disciplining himself by mortifying himself, or torturing himself in one way or another in order to gain some supposed merit or special credit by such self-punishment. He needed no such merit, for he was born perfect and he maintained his sinless state and kept himself in God's love and approval. Despite his perfection, he did not hold himself apart, but mixed right in with the people to do them good by speech and works, although the people were so imperfect, sinful and diseased and afflicted. Instead of torturing himself and begging for alms, Jesus expended his strength and vitality for the direct, positive help of the people, &quot;that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our diseases.&quot; (Matthew 8:17, Am. Stan. Ver.) This course glorified God and did the people good, whereas self-centered, self-torture for his own merit would have done the people no good, but would have been following worldly religions. Torture </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">did</span><span class="font3"> come upon Jesus Christ, but not at his own hands. It was at the hands of his enemies, the priests and the teachers of false religion, under the influence of the wicked demons. All this seed of the Serpent were at enmity with Jesus for being the Seed of God's &quot;woman&quot;. Therefore they persecuted him. They opposed his pure worship of God and his preaching of the kingdom of God. Finally they seized him secretly and handed him over to the state authorities and had him publicly nailed to a torture stake to die like a seditious, blasphemous criminal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No one should be stumbled at this. This was all just as God's written prophecies had foretold. Jesus Christ, reading those prophecies, knew he must die as a man and thus be 'bruised at the heel' by the Serpent Satan the Devil and his wicked seed. But he was willing to undergo this, in order that he might prove God's Word true and might be the King to bruise the head of the Serpent and destroy all the wicked opposers of God. By his faithfulness to God to the cruel death upon the torture stake Jesus proved his unbreakable integrity toward God his Father and he displayed his worthiness to be the promised King in whom all the nations should hope. Jehovah God had made no mistake in choosing him and sending him. Thus Jesus Christ laid down his perfect human life that the merit, value or worth of it might be made free for the good of all mankind, all those appreciating it and willing to accept the benefit of it for their salvation. Having released that perfect human life for all mankind's good, Jesus would never take it back again to live again as a human. He would let that human life remain as a sacrifice forever, in order that condemned, dying mankind might get the benefit. He said: &quot;If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.&quot; (John 6: 51) Because he had died in sinless innocence and was not deserving of everlasting death or destruction as a wicked sinner, Jesus was not left to remain in death. On the third day Almighty God did for Jesus what Jesus had done for a number of human creatures, namely, Almighty God raised him from the dead. -1 Corinthians 15:3,4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How, though, did God resurrect or raise Jesus out of death? Not as a human creature, not as a man, for that would have meant that God had refused Jesus' sacrifice and that Jesus was taking back his human sacrifice and depriving all mankind of its value to buy eternal life for all believers. No; but Jehovah God raised Jesus from the dead a spirit person with heavenly life and glory, more powerful and more glorious than before he had been born as a man. For such reason Peter, an apostle of Jesus, writes to say: &quot;Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit.&quot; (1 Peter 3:18, Am. Stan. Ver.; Douay) After his resurrection he was invisible as a spirit, but he proved he was alive from the dead by materializing human bodies to reveal himself to his disciples and to build up their faith and hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As such resurrected spirit person with all the needed power in heaven and in earth, Jesus Christ could ascend to heaven and sit at his Father's right hand and, in due time, become the King of the long-awaited kingdom of God. Note this fact, then: The hope of all nations of all mankind is therefore not in a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font3"> king, such as King David or King Hezekiah or King Josiah, who still sleep in the dust of the earth. Rejoice, all you nations, because our hope is in a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">living</span><span class="font3"> King, a heavenly King, who needs no successors, but who now has immortality and therefore lives for all time as a superhuman King at God's right hand of power. Jehovah God has thus given us all &quot;a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&quot;. -1 Peter 1: 3, Am. Stan. Ver.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A CHOICE NOW FACES YOU</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">Accordingly, for nineteen centuries now, Jehovah God has held in readiness one rightful, worthy King for all mankind, fully able to take over earth's rulership at God's appointed time. He is the resurrected, immortalized Jesus Christ in heaven. Why, then, should we not put our hope in God and in his provision for us? The true Christians, not the imitation Christians, will do so; and the apostle Peter says to these Christians that Jesus as King was &quot;foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God&quot;. (1 Peter 1: 20, 21) God is certainly the only One able to correct completely the conditions on earth that the Serpent, Satan the Devil, spoiled and upset at the very beginning of the existence of man and woman. And God promised to do this by the Seed of his &quot;woman&quot;. What right has devil or man to determine who shall rule and dominate this earth forever? Who ruled this earth before man got here, six thousand years ago? God! Who ruled it after perfect man was created and instructed what to do on earth? God! Who was it that flooded this earth clean of the violent giants and doers of wickedness in the days of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth? It was God! Jesus Christ was His fellow worker in creating the earth, and God has the right and power to appoint this One to be his King over all the earth. And if we hope in God to do this, our hope is right and is well-founded and will never be disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus Christ, the glorified Son of God, must therefore reign as King over the earth in order to remove all wickedness from it and to correct all the misrule and misarrangement of things that Satan the Devil has caused upon earth. Not one of the man-made kingdoms from Nimrod's kingdom down to this day has ever done this, but conditions on earth have grown only worse, and the modern-day United Nations with its partial control of atomic power will not be able to do it. It will make matters only worse, despite the boast of politicians and religious clergymen that the U. N. is this world's last hope and that it will establish an enduring peace and usher in a better world with morality, justice and human brotherhood. In the last analysis of earth's destiny, it is now either the United Nations or God's kingdom by his Christ. The two cannot occupy the same domain at the same time and rule to cross purposes in defiance of each other. The U. N. does not represent God's kingdom and can never be transformed into God's kingdom, and yet it assumes to take the place of God's kingdom over the earth. Unavoidably, either the U. N. or whatever future form of world government the U. N. evolves into must go on and God's kingdom must never come and take control, or else the man-made form of world domination must go out and God's rightful kingdom must come in. A choice now faces us all individually. In which of these two do you choose to put your hope? To put our hope in God's kingdom and its King . Jesus Christ means to be wise, because we have definitely reached the end of this world and the man-made form of world domination must go. It could never meet the long-standing needs of all humankind. In the coming showdown fight over the issue the man-made arrangement will perish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Declaring positively that the King Jesus Christ will reign over all the earth without a rival government in existence, God's prophecy says: &quot;In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.&quot; (Psalm 72:7-9) The prophecy that announces the coming of this global ruler to God's organized people says: &quot;Behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; . . . and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.&quot; (Zechariah 9:9,10) In fulfillment of these prophecies Jesus Christ, and not the U. N., must reign over all mankind. By his assuming the Kingdom power at God's due time, Jesus Christ comes again as he promised, and manifests his Kingdom power toward the earth, although all the kingdoms of this world be to the contrary. All his enemies must bite the dust; and the U. N. will not escape this fate, for the King of the righteous new world has come!</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>THE CAPITAL AND REPRESENTATIVES</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">All the earth is included in the domain of the new world's King, but the capital from which he rules mankind is not and will not be upon this earth. Let no one be deceived into thinking that the U. N. capital in New York or antiquated Jerusalem in Palestine will become the capital city of the righteous new world. In Jesus' days on earth he rode on an ass amid a joyous multitude that cried out: &quot;Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord: Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.&quot; (Mark 11:9,10) But when Jesus thus rode into Jerusalem, its political and religious rulers refused to receive him as King. Back there, Jerusalem was subject to the bondage of &quot;the Jews' religion&quot; and of Roman politics. That old Jerusalem was destroyed by Roman armies in 70 (A.D.), and now the antique Jerusalem that exists today as a bone of contention between several major religions of this world is just as much in bondage. She is subject to the U. N. organization and does not want the glorified Jesus Christ as her King. Showing that this earthly Jerusalem could never become the new world's capital but that the true capital is located in heaven, where Jesus Christ sits at God's right hand, the apostle Paul writes: &quot;Jerusalem which now is, ... is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.&quot; (Galatians 4:25,26) The heavenly Jerusalem or Zion is therefore the divine organization which Jehovah God has made the capital of the new world and in which he has laid Jesus Christ as the precious cornerstone and foundation of the new world's kingdom. -Isaiah 28:16; 1 Peter 2:3-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Before King David made ancient Jerusalem his capital city over the nation of Israel, Jehovah God was the invisible King over his chosen people, and King David continued to confess God as such. Jerusalem was then the capital for only a small part of mankind, the nation of Israel in the small land of Palestine. But Jehovah's King of the new world will not be ruler over just King David's nation and Palestine, but will rule all mankind and all the earth. To fulfill the prophecy it was necessary for Jesus to be born as a descendant of the Hebrew Abraham and the Jewish King David, but the reign of Jesus Christ in the new world is not to be considered as the rule of a fleshly Jew nor the rule of a fleshly person of any nationality or color. It is the rule of the heavenly Son of God who laid down his perfect human life for all mankind, Jew and non-Jew. Hence there is no room for any prejudice against him by non-Jews or nonChristians, be they Mohammedans, Hindus, Buddhists,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">or other religionists and nationalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Because of his heavenly exaltation and the wideness of his domain he will rule from a spot higher than the low hills of Jerusalem in Palestine, namely, from the heavenly capital organization itself, of which ancient Jerusalem was only a prophetic picture. It is to that loftier elevation, not to the Jerusalem on earth, but to the new heavenly Jerusalem, that mankind of all nations and people must turn with faith and hope and must yield their unswerving allegiance. (Zechariah 8:20-23) Now that Jesus Christ has been put in power in the heavenly capital to establish the new world and to rule, that old Serpent, Satan the Devil, and his wicked demons have been tumbled from heaven down to this earth, where shortly the head of the Serpent will be bruised with destruction under the heel of Jehovah's King, Jesus Christ. Then, too, all the seed of that Serpent, both demons and men, will lick the dust with him, at the battle of Armageddon. -Rev. 12:1-13; 19:11 to 20:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is quite manifest that Jesus did not accept his kingdom from any people or nation on earth, and certainly not from the Serpent, Satan the Devil, even though this wicked one is &quot;the god of this world&quot;. (Matthew 4: 8-11; Luke 4:5-8) After he refused the rule of the earth from the hands of the Devil, he did not try to make himself an earthly human king by seizing power as Nimrod did or by trying to overturn and usurp the power of any kingdom of that day, the Roman empire or any other political government. There is a favorite saying among democratic politicians: &quot;The voice of the people is the voice of God.&quot; But the man Christ Jesus was no democrat and did not accept that worldly saying. He withdrew from any popular, democratic election, even by his own people the Jews. After his miracle of feeding a multitude of five thousand men with five loaves and two fishes, the Scriptures tell us, &quot;when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.&quot; (John 6:15) From God's holy Word Jesus knew he must die and sacrifice his human life rather than become an earthly king at Jerusalem. He needed no popular or national election to make him King, because God had anointed him with spiritual power to be the king of a new world. Only God himself could confer that kingdom upon him; and Jesus chose to wait upon God and accept the Kingdom from no hands but God's. This shows again that no person of any nationality should have any prejudice against Christ's rule. It will not be a rule by any national group over the rest of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Just as Jehovah God was the invisible King over the nation of Israel before it called for its first human king, so Jesus Christ, the Son of God, will rule the earth with all power in heaven and in earth during the new world. Nonetheless, he will have visible representatives on earth in personal touch with the people. Who will these be? Not one of them will be any man or woman appointed by the political powers and governments of this world, for this world is Satan's and is opposed to Christ's rule and will meet its disastrous end at the battle of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The politicians and commercial lords and religious rulers have chosen to be a part of this evil world, and they will perish with it. In the new world Jesus Christ the King will do the appointing of his visible representatives on earth. He will appoint only those who are his sons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">How is this? It is because as a man he died that he might give life to those who render their allegiance to him as King. Because he gives the benefits of his sacrificed life to them, he becomes their &quot;everlasting Father&quot; and they become his children. (Isaiah 9:6,7) These will include his faithful forefathers, whom he will raise from the dead to life on earth, and concerning them we read: &quot;Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.&quot; (Psalm 45:16) They will include the former King David, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah and Enoch, besides many other faithful men who proved their integrity to God and who were not Jesus' forefathers. Suggesting that these will all be earthly representatives of the heavenly kingdom of God, Jesus said to the unbelieving religionists of his day: &quot;Ye. shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.&quot; (Luke 13:28) It is therefore seen that such visible princes will not all be men who were once Jews according to the flesh. All the faithful from Jacob on back to the first martyr Abel were not Jews; and Noah was the faithful man from whom the present three branches of the human family descended, Japhetic, Hamitic and Semitic. In this light it is seen there will be no grounds for prejudice against the princely representatives on national grounds as having all one nationality previously. In fact, all former nations will be represented according to the flesh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The thing to require of these princes is not a certain former nationality, but their faithful representation of God's kingdom with justice and impartial loving-kindness toward all. Their faithful course toward God in the past, and Christ the King's choice of them as his sons, guarantee that they will be faithful visible princes among all mankind. The King in heaven would never permit them to be other than that, for the prophecy says of his reign: &quot;He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.&quot; (Psalm 72:4) It is to bring about our deliverance from all oppressors that he causes the destruction of this Satan-ruled world at Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the comforting enlightenment from the Bible it is plain that the destruction of this oppressive world in the universal war of Armageddon does not mean destruction to our earth by atomic chain-reactions or other fiery means. Nevertheless, the Armageddon of destruction will consume Satan's oppressive organization as if by fire and will purge this earth as thoroughly as the flood of Noah's day did. The physical earth is part of the King's universal domain, and he will not break Jehovah's Word that says: &quot;The earth abideth for ever.&quot; &quot;He formed it to be inhabited.&quot; (Ecclesiastes 1:4; Isaiah 45:18) For this blessed reason the apostle Peter says that, following the old world's destruction, &quot;we, according to his promise, look for NEW heavens and a NEW earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; (2 Peter 3:13) And with the kingdom of Jehovah's king overhead in control and with the faithful princes in office on earth as visible representatives of the heavenly kingdom, the new-world arrangement will indeed be new heavens and a new earth. Political laws of one nation against another, or of one class of people against another, will find no place therein. The law then to be in effect will be God's law, and it will come down from heaven through God's King and will be faithfully and impartially applied and observed by the earthly princes. Speaking of the heavenly Jerusalem or Zion, the prophecy says: &quot;Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.&quot; (Isaiah 2:3, Am. Stan. Ver.) The faithful application of that law will secure justice to all and will teach all mankind true righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The heavenly King will have no cause for shame because of the earthly conditions under which his subjects will live. He will make their living conditions perfect, so that they will want to live forever upon earth. Nineteen centuries ago when he hung upon the torture stake at Calvary the charge against Jesus as posted over his head was: &quot;The King of the Jews This!&quot; And one of the criminals impaled alongside him said: &quot;Jesus! remember me, whensoever thou shalt come into thy kingdom.&quot; What was Jesus' answer? The record tells us: &quot;And he said unto him -Verily I say unto thee this day: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">With me shalt thou be in Paradise</span><span class="font3">.&quot; (Luke 23:38-43, Rotherham's translation; also Lamsa) Jesus' answer assured that dying malefactor that when God's kingdom should be established with Jesus Christ as King, it would transform this earth into a global paradise. If our Savior had not died that day on the torture stake, the just for the unjust, that dying malefactor would have had no basis for a future life in paradise. But because Jesus died sacrificially for all men and because God resurrected him from the dead, Jesus could enter into his heavenly kingdom and he could in due time resurrect the dead, including that sympathetic malefactor. The Scriptures say: &quot;Have hope toward God, . . . that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.&quot; -Acts 24:15. Jesus Christ the King resurrects his faithful footstep followers to life in heaven with him, because they lay down their lives in sacrifice, copying his example. They will reign with him over all those of mankind who remain upon the earth. (1 Peter 1:3,4; Revelation 2:10;3:21) Resurrection will put all of Jesus' joint-heirs with him in the heavenly kingdom, but it will put his subjects right back here on earth. Many persons of good-will of this present living generation will not need to be resurrected from the graves because they will be preserved through the swiftly nearing battle of Armageddon. They will survive on earth into the new world, just as Noah and his household survived the end of the old, antediluvian world in the flood. For all those of mankind who put their hope in Jesus as King and loyally accept him as God's appointed Ruler, he will make all the earth an Edenic paradise. Why? That his faithful human subjects may live in it for all eternity in happiness, to God's praise. Everlasting life in it will be possible for them because their King made an</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">eternal sacrifice of his perfect human life for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What marvels we may hope for that King to do for his subjects! We all remember that, while on earth, he performed miracles for the sick, imperfect, demonized, deaf, dumb and blind, crippled, dying and dead people. So, what wonderful miracles may we expect him to do now that he has come into his kingdom, to make his subjects perfectly happy, free from God's condemnation due to sin inherited from Adam! He will rid the earth of misery, sickness, old age, death and demons. By his gift of eternal life to obedient mankind he will make them his sons and daughters and will bless them with everlasting youth in human perfection. And peace will reign from pole to pole between man and man and between man and beast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">No political government or ruler, no worldly religion, can offer you such a hope as this. It is impossible for them. But what is impossible with men is possible with the Almighty God, Jehovah. Upon the solid, unchangeable foundation of His Word this hope is based. It, and it alone, is the Kingdom hope of all mankind, and its glorious realization is near at hand. In an outstanding way this is the day of the fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Jehovah's King Jesus Christ: &quot;And in his name shall the nations hope.&quot; Persons of good-will everywhere are now putting their trust in the kingdom of Jehovah God by Christ Jesus, and are being blessed. By faithfully directing their lives henceforth according this only hope at this crucial end of the world, they will be &quot;saved by hope&quot;.</span></p>
