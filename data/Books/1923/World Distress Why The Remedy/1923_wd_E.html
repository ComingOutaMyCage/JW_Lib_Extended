<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Why is Evil Permitted ?</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE earth is full of sorrow; and every one has more or less huyna&quot; ailments, pains and weaknesses, Crime is prevalent in every land; haired, ill will and malice are manif</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">est</span><span class="font6">sted without limit; and the question frequently comes to the mind of the one who is asked to consider the divine arrangement: Why fhould a just and wise and loving God pennit evil to be in the world and afflict the people so much?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Evil is that which produces unhappiness; and anything which either directly or indirectly causes suffering may be classed sis evil. The question is asked: Why did God permit Satan to tempt our first parents and causa them to violate his law? Could he not have prevented all this trouble, the fall of man, and the thousands of years of suffering that have been upon humankind? The statement that Jehovah is ull-powerful at once k-ads to the conclusion that he could have prevented it hud his wisdom dictated that he should do sc. The fort that he did not do so is sufficient proof that he permitted it for some wise and good purpose. When we we and uud&lt;rstand the outworking of his great plan, his wisdom is manifest in all that he has permitted, and his love is ever manifest in the method provided for the restoration and blessing cf mankind.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Can Man be Made Good through Evil?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">God created the first man perfect, mentally, morally, and physically. As suggested in a discussion of this subject in Volume 1, Studies in the ScniiTWa, Page 119: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“God could have made Tnanklr.d devoid uf ubllliy to div-cere between rijjLt and wrong, or aide only to dlweru and to do right; but to bare made him so would hare been to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">«</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">make merely a living machine, uad certainly not n mental Image of His Creator. Or he might have made num perfect and a free agent, ns he did, and have guarded him from StlUlU's temptation.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Iii no other y&gt;ay could man ultimately be brought to everlasting hupjiiaesH. He must be free to exercise his own will; uud be must learn to exercise that in harmony with the divine will, and to so exercise it voluntarily in order for complete happiness to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God created everything for his own pleasure, (Revelation 4: 11) God has no pleasure in wickedness. (Psalm 5:4) There is no way, therefore, that he could so well teach his subjects the baneful effects of wiong-doing and the good effects of right-doing as by permitting them to experience these very things. Jehovah created man to be above all other earthly creatures, and endowed him with moral sense of discerning good and evil. Had his experience been limited io good alone by his being protected and shielded, from evil influences, then man would never have gained by experience a knowledge of the baneful effects of evil: but it would have required constant guarding of man at all times, which would have destroyed his free moral agency. The moral sense and the power to discern right and wrong, and the liberty to use this sense possessed by Adam, were important in making </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> the likeness of the Lord.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark8"></a>God’s Object in Permitting Evil</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">It is </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">manif</span><span class="font6">est from the revealed plan of God that he saw an actual experience with evil would be the surest and best and most lasting way to servo mon eternally; nnd for that reason he did not prevent evil, but permitted </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">to an</span><span class="font6"> to come in contact with it. While God created the first </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font6"> perfect in his organism,-yet the man was without experience; and experience can be obtained only by passing through certain conditions. The Scriptures,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">' however, hifutm us tlmt when the activity of evil baa been permit!'d long rutugh to give n'-BU a full mid complete b--^ - n o£ its baneful effects. it will cea«e to be active; for all of God's subjects will be willingly submissive tu him and will follow lore and justice.— i t’orinthui'.:; 15:25, ^<sup>L</sup>i; Hebrews 2: 11.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark10"></a>Why Man Suffers For Adam’s Sin</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">But it may Le aeked: If ths Lord would permit evil to come tu utu? num, Adam, why should he permit Adam's offspring for thousands of years tn ft-1 the elk-ch cl it? When lit* iH-wii God’s plan we can see the economy of it and iliul wisdom and love prompted his act ion. Adam was put on trial iu Eden white he was perfect; and while in that condition he begat nu children. After be Lad vi-Juhd the Uw ami hud been ..-.nfenred to death mid driven from Eden, then he begat children, who were born and lived on the. earth- God arrange a that tins judgment of ojndumimtijn. should affect all of Adam's offspring, so that cna rvclcmpitive price would benefit all men. </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hn</span><span class="font6">porfr it because uf sin, Adam vuuld beget only imperfect children. The I</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Bible</span><span class="font6"> tells us: “Behold, 1 was ehapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.&quot; (I’.-altu •’■lijr “Vi hei ■ fore, as by one num sin Entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death patsc-d upon all men. for that all have sinned-&quot; (lieirimis 5:12) God provided redemption ot njauhiiid by the sacrifice uf he other perfect one. Hud the judgment rv.-ultii-g from Adam’? viulutiuB mfected him alone, then i: ever Ada<sup>1</sup> i get life ui uuj time thereafter he must be redeem rd by the ibni’h uf another perfect being, uud every uue of his offspring who would get life would likewise have to be r--!.-.med. Lt each one was required tu hare si tepante and distinct trial, then there would liuve Lu be a ‘- .parate and distinct r.&lt;vemrj fur tacii one. Therefore Gud includco them</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">C </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">World Distress—Why? The Remedy </span><span class="font6">all in one judgment, in order that one Redeemer might purchase them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It wu' Jebjvtih'x purpose before Hie foundation uf the world to redeem man from the lauiditiim of death a' <sup>1</sup> ■,¥&lt;; him a fair and impartial trial for life after in-had received hi.? full experknei.' with the baneful effects of sin. And when the world is put on trial, each one will l.iiov, sin and the results of yield lug to it; whereas A du r i uhi'tj iirsl tried, had not experienced these things. We lLlii properly siy that when Adam Violated God's law the entire human race vas in his loins, u □produced. The Lord, then, could niakv provision for the satisfying of tl: - judgment against Adam and all of bis offspring Ly another equal to Adam going voluntarily into dealt. The Lord made this promise through the Prophet: &quot;J will ransom them from the power of the grave ; 1 will redeem them from death: 0 death, I will he thy plagues; O grave, 1 will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes&quot; (Ho^ca 13:14) The only way this redemption could be aeeomplisbeil was by the death of u perfect man, and in all the earth there was not one. ‘'None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him&quot;—Psalm 49: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Then it was that Jesus was transferred from the spirit plane to the human. being born as a man, but not begotten by any of Adam’s '-'lispring, ’When he grew to manhood’s estate he was perfect, mentally^ moralli and physically, had none of the contaniinatitnis of the Adamic stock in him, and was the exact counterpart of the perfect man Adam, who stood in liden, unscathed or unmarked by sin. Jesus had come now for the very purpose of redeeming mankind, as he slate-: ''The Nou of man came not to. be ministered unto, hut to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.&quot; &quot;&nbsp;i urn eoiue that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.'”—Matthew 30: S3; John 10: Id.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Another Teasou why Jehovah permitted evil was that it afforded the opportunity of developing from amongst mankind a New creation., which will be the highest and most exalted amongst nil of his creation. Jeeus is the Head of this new creation; the church constitutes his bodv members; and these, associated together in glorv. will be the instrument through which Jehovah will minister restoration blessings to all the human family. It has pleased the heavenly Father to develop this new creation through suiTering. (Hebrews 2:10,11) Jesus left the courts of glory, where he enjoyed happiness supreme hi his association with the great Jehovah God. Ite was made flesh and dwelt amongst men. He grew tip as a tender plant. Perfect in organ ism, he was a beautiful creature. For thirty-three and one half years he associated with sinners. Ue did not refuse to cal bread with publicans and sinners. Ur came in contact with the.-&gt;' because they were members of the Adamic race, and one of the purposes of his experiences on earth w us to acquire a knowledge of the sufferings which sin hud brought upon mankind, in order that he might be fully sympathetic in dealing with mankind in the time of trial. Of him the Prophet tays: “He was wounded far our transgressions, he was bruised for our.iniquities: th-? chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripe- we are healed. He was oppressed, and he «u.- afflicted” (Isaiah 53:6-7)—all for the sake of (ring prepared to deal properly with humankind during his glorious reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It has pleased the heavenly Father to develop the of the body of Christ through experiences cl suifering, and that is why St. Paul says: “If we .-.utter, we shall also reign with him.&quot; (2 Timothy 2:12) And again he states that we are joint-heirs with Christ J i. . us, “if eo be that we suffer with him.&quot; (Eomaus</span></p>

<p><span class="font6"><sup>if</sup>Out of Zi&lt;m, the jwrfectiuri nf beauty. God hath sh ined?'

<p><span class="font6">tion, seeing this, will give praise to God end his Christ for ever imd ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus we sec there are three primary reasons why God permit? evil: (1) To give mankind n full and Complete lesson in the baneful effects of evil doing; (2) for a sufficient length of time to afford opportunity io fill tile earth with people who get their experience I) font il.ei!'

<p><span class="font6">In view of the great plan of redemption jmd the ci-us-;.[neni institution of all thing* through Christ, ve can rhnt blessing? result through the permission of evil which could not have been so fully realized in any other way.

<p><span class="font6">bund; nntl Aduni and Evo having the jwwer to produce children anil populate I he earth, Lucifer intended in this way to get control of the human race and establish a dominion of hrt own. This was an evil course. It was disloyalty on his part to Jehovah; and for this reason he fell from God's favor.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Satan, the Ruler of the Earth</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Prophet describes him and his fall thus: “How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, ton of the morning 1 how art thou cut down to the ground, winch didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north: 1 will ascend above the heights of the clouds; 1 will be like the most High. Yet thou shrdt he brought down to hell, to the aides of the pit.”—Isaiah 14:18-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus raid of Lucifer: “I beheld Satan as ligh</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">tning </span><span class="font6">fall from heaven.” (Luke 10:18) He fell from God’s favor. He was degraded and his name was changed; and theTcafter he is known in the Scriptures as the dragon, the old serpent, the devil and Satan.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Why Evil Prospers</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Every creature named by Jehovah is named for a purpose, and the name signifies much. The word Satan means oppose?. In Eden he was the opposer of God and bus been ever since, and the oppose? of everything that is righteous. He opposed Jesus when our Lord was on earth, operating through various agencies, and has opposed the followers of Jesus ever since, causing them to be persecuted. When God expelled Adam and Eve from Eden he stated: ‘T will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and it Khali bruise thy head and thou shall. bruisn !ii.-heel.&quot; The seed means the offspring; and thereafter Sa</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">tan</span><span class="font6"> and his emissaries or offspring have persecuted all those who have followed righteousness. The teed of the woman hero pictured tho seed emanating from the Abrahfimic covenant, which seed is the Christ (Galor </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">fians</span><span class="font6"> 3:16,27, 29) Satan has always opposed this seed, and this explains why true Christians are persecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name serpent meant deceiver; and one of Satan’s favorite methods at all times has been deceit, practised upon the people. By meant of fraud and deceit he has gotten false doctrines into the minds of the people, blinding them to God's true Word.—2 Corinthians 4: 3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The word dragon means devourer. Satan has sought to devour everything that is righteous. 11c caused the prophets to be persecuted and killed. He instigated the persecution of Jesus at the hands of the Pharisees; and his attempt is to devour everything that is righteous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The name devil means slanderer. Satan slandered God in the garden of Eden; and all the malicious, slanderous accusations against the Lord and his followers from then until now have emanated from this evil one, .Jesus speaking of him says that he is a liar and the father of lies.— John 3:44.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark32"></a>False Religions Stain God’s Character</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">God established with the nation of Israel the true religion, commanding that they should worship him as the true God. Satan the oppeser established with tho heathen nations round about the false religion, causing the people io worship him, images aud demons; and from this source spring all the falsa religions. The Lord established the true Christian religion, and Satan thereafter established the mystery of iniquity, the faithless religion, claiming to worship God and at the same time misrepresenting him and misrepresenting the Lord Jesus</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Why Does not God Kill the Devil ?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Seeing that Satan is the author of evil and the instigator of wickedness in the earth, why does God permit him to live? Why does not God kill the devil?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Here wo give a brief answer. God purposed I hut every one of hid itiieUigeuL creatures should lutve experience with the baneful effects of evil, mid that they might choose between good and evil. He decreed long centuries ago that Satan should be put to death, but he has withheld the execution of ibis fentenco until a sufficient number of the human race has bretl brought forth to till the earth; and ihtse are given experience with in order to see the results thereof, in order that when being brought to a full knowledge of the truth and with a full opportunity io du right, they will choose righteousness and live. God in his wuduin hus provided this means of teaching the human family that utiibi lion. EelhHhnets, uud Wrongdoing lead io deg radii t ion; and that humble obedience to the Lord and following after righteousness lead to exultation.</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Prophecy and. its Fulfilment</span></h2>
<p><span class="font12">T</span><span class="font6">HE Bible abounds with proplietie statements. These are called dark sayings, because not under-atandable by man ar the time wjhen written.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prophecy means the foretelling of events that are expected to happen in the future. When these events do occur and are recorded, we call it fulfilled prophecy or history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">No human mind could clearly discern what the future will bring forth. Hence we must conclude that prophecy proceeds from God and is written for man's instruction, to be understood by him in God's due time. The Apostle states: ‘Tor prophecy came not in old time by the will of </span><span class="font6" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">th am</span><span class="font6"> ; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the holy spirit.” (2 I’eter 1:21) These men really acted as the mouthpieces or amanuenses of the Lord, to speak or record prophetic sayings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The fact that prophecy proceeds from Jehovah is proof conclusive that a time must come when that prophecy would have fulfilment, for the reason that the great, all-wise God would do nothing for an idle purpose. That we might be sure of this, Jehovah caused his prophet to write: “So shall my word be that gocth forth emt of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which 1 please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.”—Isaiah 55:11.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">To illustrate this point we give some </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">ovnif</span><span class="font6">ijiji-s of prophecy and their fulfilment. Through his holy prophet God foretold the redemption of man. (Hosea 13:11) He- foretold that this mighty One who would come to earth would be born a Jew, (Deuteronomy, 18: 15) Hr</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Clues to Prophetic Dates - Times, Years, etc.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Jews were God’s typical people: that is to say, he chose that people and organised them into a mition. gave them his law, and used them to foreshadow events to transpire. (Hebrews 10:1; 1 Corinthians 10:11) Because the Jews violated his law. God time and again warned them that he would east them oil and permit the Gentiles to take them captive and establish a world empire; and that their punishment thereafter should be for a period of seven symbolic times, These seven symbolic times and the period of time in years is explained by Volume 8, ‘The Time is at Hand/’ Studies ik tub ScaiPTUBis, page 8’1:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“In the Bible a ‘time’ is used in the sense of a year. . , . Cimwiueoiiy, . . - sgveu ‘times&quot; represent 2530 . . . literal yeans.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'J’he Scriptures plainly show that this decree of Jehovah was enforced against Israel in the year GOG B. C., and that there Nebuchadnezzar became universal geciije ruler.

The Scripture de lines a soul as a being, a breathing creature. &quot;The Lord Gor funi-'d man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nosrrik the breath of life; and man became a Jiving soul.<sup>:J</sup>—Geneeis 3:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It must be conceded that the dust of the ground out of which God formed man was without life or consciousness. The breath which he breathed into his nostrils was not conscious. But when Jehovah made the body out of the dements of the earth mid then united with it the breath which living creature- breathe, thiz start'd animation. That pur to work the machinery, and the result was a living, sentient, moving being, a soul. The words soul and being arc- synonymous terms.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Adam and Eve were in Eden, having given dominion over the tilings of Eden. They had the right Then lire if they remained obedient Then God (God said Then Adam “In the day that thou eatrat [of the tree of knowledge of good and evil] thou shalt surely die.” (tTei ■ sis '.’-'i I Satan practiced a fraud upon mother Eve.

IVben. he speaketh a lie he speaketlr of his own; for he 1= a liar, and the father of it."—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From that day until now Satan has blinded the minds of men by inducing them tn believe that the soul of man is immortal and that man cannot die. St. Paul says of him that he blinds the minds of men lest the truth shine into their lives.—3 Corinthians 4:4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Who is Immortal ?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Since immortality means th ar which is not subject Then death, who then is immortal? The Scriptures answer: ‘’God only hath immortality?’ (I Timothy 6:16) God ifi the EJelf-esisting One, from everlasting. When Jesus was on earth, ha was not immortal; but immortality was granted, Then him as a great reward at his resurrection. He said: “As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given Then the Son Then have life in himself.■' (John 5:26) When ho arose from the dead he -aid: “I tun he that liveth, flud was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore.”-—Revelation 1: 18.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">the full step followers of Jesus. All men are mortal; therefore subject Then death. The apostle Haul plainly givs; Tn Adam all die.'* (1 Corinthians 15; 22: ’hen the Apostle plainly points out that immortality is a reward for faithfulness. 11c- encourages the Christian Then seek immortality. (Romans 2:7) If a person inherently possessed a thing ha would not be seeking if. The apostle Paul, then, addressing himself Then the consecrated Christians who prove their faithfulness unto death mid whose reward is promised Then be heavenly, says: “Ite dead shall be raised incorruptible, . . . for this corruptible must put on incorruptible, find this mortal must put on </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">im</span><span class="font6">ortal‘iy.

Death is swallowed up in victory.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:32-54) it must 1-? manifest tn every reasmuiblc mind that if every man possessed inherent immortality, then this statement of St. Paul equid not be true. We know that it is true; for he wrote under inspiration, lie shows that immortality is given as the greatest reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These words of St. Paul are addressed not Then the world hut only Then the consecrated Christians. Then such Jesus said: “Be thou faithful unto death and 1 will give thus a crown of life.&quot; (Revelation. 2:10) The crown of life means the highest state of life; hence the state of immortality, that which is not subject Then death. Again. Jesus said of those who partake in the first resurrection, the chief resurrection, that over such the second death’ shall have no power,—.Revelation 20: fj.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God has always been immortal Jesus and his church arc granted immorality; and no other creatures in the universe wit! ever be immortal.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark77"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark78"></a>All Men Mortal</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The word pcris/t is defined by Webster mid other lexicographers as follows: Then bo destroyed; Then pass away: Then become nothing, Jesus said; &quot;God so loved the world, that he gave hi,- only begotten Son, that whosoever believe th in him should perish, hut have everlasting life?<sup>1</sup> (John 3:1G) Plainly the condition here is that everlasting life depends upon faith in the Lord Jesus, and that all others do perish. They could not perish if immortal. Again Jrsus said concerning his coming: “I am come tluit they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&quot; (John 10:10) If a soul is immortal, then of necessity it would possess life, and the coming of Jesus and his death and resurrection would not Im necessary Then give them life. Hence it is sewn that the theory of inherent immortality is a direct and positive denial of the great ransom sacrifice. Satan desires Then blind the people Then this great truth; for there is uo other name save that of Jesus whereby men can be saved.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark80"></a>The Resurrection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Nothing is more clearly taught by the Scriptures tliun the resurrection of the dead. If loan is inherently immortal it would mean that he cannot die. And if he is not dead there could be no such thing a? a resurrection. Resurrection means n restanding Then life, or a recreation, or a bringing back Then life. The scriptures above cited show that all men came under the condemnation of death; and that it is the soul, the being, the creature, that dies. Referring Then the dead, Jesus said: •'Harvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that nre in the graves shall hear his voice [of the Son of maul, and shall come forth.’<sup>1</sup> (John 5:2S,2!&gt;) Then this St. Paul adds: “There si tall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.&quot;—Acts £4:10,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus died and rose again from the dead. He so stated hini-df. (Revelation 1: IS) His resurrection is a guarantee thiit all tlv.&quot; dead khal! be awakened out of death. If immortal, thiy would bo impossible. because already alive. For inis reason many deny the resumctfcn. Then meet their argument St. Paul said: &quot;If there be no resurrection at* the dead, then !■■ Christ not risen; mid if Christ be not risen, then, is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. . . . Then they also which are fallen a &quot;kep in Christ are ; ■■-'-1.■ &lt;:.*’ (I Corinthians 15: 13-16) Mark here that that which perish' - cannot be immortal. Hence the Apostle plainly say* that except for tin&quot; resurrection nil have juri.-hed- Then he proceeds Then show that the irsurrection of Jesus is a guarantee that all the dead sli.il I be brought forth from the grave again, &quot;'Hut now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruit.' of tilt ni that slept.

<h3><a name="bookmark103"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark104"></a>Restoring Life Adam Lost</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus was the beginning of Gael’s creation. (Jehu 1:2) Jehovali caused the life of the Logos (Jesus) to tr transferred from i-pirit to human. He was begotten by the invisible power of Jehovah. (Matthew 1: 20) He was bora on the human plane, holy, harmless, undefiled, separate front sumere. (Hebrews 7:26) When Jesus was on earth he was not of the angelic order, bat he was made lower than the angels. (Hebrews 2:7,9) He was made flesh, and dwelt among men. (John 1:14) He was flesh and blood. (Hebrews 2:14) Why was Jems made lower than the angels? Why made a man? SL Paul ambers: “We see Jesur, who was madir u little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that he by the grace of Ged should taste death for every man.” (Hebrews 2:9) He grew to manhood’s estate; and when he had reached the age of thirty years he was perfect as a man, physically, mentally, morally; and at the age required to officiate us a priest he v. tu in every respect the exact counterpart of the perfect man, Adam, when he stood in Eden, surrounded by all the glory and beauty of that place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Why hud Jesus coxae thus to the earth? He uuswers: “The Son of man come not to be ministered unto, bat to </span><span class="font6">minister</span><span class="font6">, and to give his life a ransom,*' (Matthew 20: 28) Again, “1 am come that they might have life, and that they might Lave it mure abundantly.” (John 10:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">10) Jesus had come for the express purpose of providing a way of life to the human race. Furthermore, he said: <sup>:</sup>T lay down my life, that I might take it again/’—John 10:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So, as Volume 5, Studies in the Sciuptuiles, “The Atonement,” points out, page 441:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Our Ixtrd did not go to cverinstlnt' torment, hence wo jinvc this indisputable testimony that cverlfiHflng torment Is not the wago of sin.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Adam, the perfect man, had sinned; and Jehovah had entered the judgment against him, requiring his life, which judgment had been entered in heaven. Thai which would be required to satisfy the judgment against Adam, and indirectly against his offspring, must be the equivalent of a perfect human life, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">presented</span><span class="font6"> in Aearcn, No man could ascend into heaven. Jesus, the perfect roan, therefore, must die and arise from the dead and ascend on high, and there present to Divine Justice the value of his perfect human life. This is why he said: &quot;I lay down my life that 1 might take it again”; that is to say, take it to be used in harmony with the divine purpose. At the age of thirty years Jesus presented himself in full consecration to do the Father’s will. It T.aa the will of God that he should lay down his life. (John 10:11-19) Three aud one-half years thereafter he died upon the cross. Three days later he arose from the dead. Forty days thereafter he ascended into heaven.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark105"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark106"></a>Man Guaranteed Life on Earth</span></h3>

<p><span class="font6">The Bible gives a dear answer, showing why these conditions exist.

What is the real cause?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark111"></a><span class="font8"><a name="bookmark112"></a>Increased Perplexity Opens Prophecies Not Understood</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">No one can get the proper answer io tills question without a knowledge of the divine plan. There never was a time so important for man to understand God's purposes us now. This plan is set forth in the Bible, and it i- now due to ba understood. Vi*c have reached the time of the end, the time when the Lord said that &quot;'the wise shall understand.&quot; (Dahid 12:10) The <sup>,f</sup>wise’<sup>J</sup> within the meaning of this scrip tore are those who honestly,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">diligently and sincerely seek the truth in Ged's Word; and who fearlessly put aside the teachings of men, mid follow the Lord, and his teachings only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Brieily stated the answer is this: God created man perfect, and gave </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font6"> a perfect home in Eden. Man violated God's law. after having been warned that- a violation would result in his destruction and th'.<sup>1</sup> sentence of </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">hims</span><span class="font6">elf to death. A</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">dam</span><span class="font6">, the perfect man, under sentence of death, now expelled from Eden, began to die, which death process continued for a period of nine hundred and thirty years, during which period of time all the children that he begat were born. These were brought forth in the earth as imperfect, because their father was under condentnatiun of death. This is what is meant by the Prophets statement: ‘■'Behold, I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.<sup>w</sup> (I </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Win</span><span class="font6"> 51:5) All were born sinners for this reason. (Romans 5:12) Jehovah made a promise to redeem man from death and to restore him to his original condition if obedient to God’s law. Tha carrying out of this plan has required a long period of time. In the course of time God sent into the earth his beloved Son, to provide the ransom sacrifice, and through this the redemption of man. Jesus came that men might have life and have it more abundantly. (John 10: ID; Matthew 20:28) He died upon the cross and arose from the dead; aud his death and resurrection provided for the opening of the wav to all men to come back into iiarm.ony with God in hie due time.—Hebrews 2:9; 1 Corinthians 15:12-22.</span></p>
