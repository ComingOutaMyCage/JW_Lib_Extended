<p><span class="font0">NAME</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>THE GREATEST NAME</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">MILLIONS of men and women have lived on this earth and died. In most cases their names have died with them, and their remembrance has been forgotten. But some great names, such as Avicenna, Edison, Pasteur, Beethoven, Gandhi, and Newton, live on. These names are connected with the achievements, discoveries, and inventions of the people who bore them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">However, there is a name greater than any other name —the greatest name. To this name are attached all the wonders of the past and present in the entire universe. Mankind’s hope for a long and happy life is related to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Many have wished to know this name. They searched for it and asked about it, but they did not find it. To them it remained a mystery. In fact, no man can discover that name unless the Owner of the name reveals it. Happily, God has done just that. As a result, those who believe in him, in his books, and in his messengers can know about him. He revealed His name to Adam, then to Abraham, to Moses, and to His other faithful servants of old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Koran tells of someone “who was deeply versed in the Scriptures.” (27:40) A commentary book, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tafsir Jalalayn,</span><span class="font6"> says in explaining this verse: “Asaf the son of Barkhiya was a righteous man. He knew God’s greatest name, and whenever he called on it, he was answered.” This reminds us of a Bible writer, Asaf (Asaph), who wrote Psalm 83:18. This verse says: &quot;That people may know that you, whose name is Jehovah, you alone are the Most High over all the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">At Koran 17:2 we read: “We gave Moses the Scriptures and made them a guide for the Israelites.&quot; In those Scriptures, Moses addresses God, saying: “Suppose I am now come to the sons of Israel and I do say to them, ‘The God of your forefathers has sent me to you,’ and they do say to me, 'What is his name?’ What shall I say to them?” God answered Moses, saying: “This is what you are to say to the sons of Israel, ‘Jehovah the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.' This is my name to time indefinite.”—Exodus 3:13, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In ancient times the Israelites knew this great name of God. It was even used as a component of their personal names. So just as one finds today the name Abdullah (Servant of God), the ancient Israelites had the name Obadiah (Servant of Jehovah). The prophet Moses’ mother was named Jochebed, which possibly means “Jehovah Is Glory.” The name John means “Jehovah Has Been Gracious.” The name of the prophet Elijah means “My God Is Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The prophets knew this great name, and they used it with profound respect. It is found more than 7,000 times in the Holy Scriptures. Jesus Christ, the son of Mary, highlighted it in his prayer to God: “I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me ... I have made your name known to them and will make it known, in order that the love with which you loved me may be in them.” (John 17:6, 26) In his famous commentary on the Koran, Baydawi comments on Koran 2:87, saying that Jesus used to “revive dead persons by God’s greatest name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What, then, happened to make that name a mystery? What does that name have to do with the future of each of us?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">How Did the Name Become a Mystery?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some think that “Jehovah” in Hebrew means “Allah” (God). But “Allah” corresponds, in Hebrew, to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Elohim', </span><span class="font6">the plural of majesty of the word </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'eloh'ah</span><span class="font6"> (god). A superstition arose among the Jews that prohibited them from pronouncing the divine name, Jehovah. So it became their custom that while reading the Holy Scriptures, whenever they came to the name “Jehovah,” they pronounced </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Adho-nai’,</span><span class="font6"> which means “Lord.” In some places they even altered the original Hebrew text from “Jehovah” to </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">'Adho nai'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Christendom followed the same course. They replaced the name Jehovah with “God” (“Allah” in Arabic) and with “Lord.” That contributed to the development of the false doctrine of the Trinity, which has no basis in the Holy Scriptures. Because of this, millions mistakenly worship Jesus and the holy spirit and consider them equal to God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Hence, the leaders both of Judaism and of Christendom share the blame for the widespread ignorance concerning the greatest name. But God prophesied: “I shall certainly sanctify my great name, . . . and the nations will have to know that 1 am Jehovah.” Yes, he will make his name known among all the nations, because he is not the God of the Jews, or of any other nation; he is the God of all mankind.—Ezekiel 36:23; Genesis 22:18; Psalm 145:21; Malachi 1:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Greatest Name and Our Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Holy Scriptures say: “Everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved.” (Romans 10:13) Our salvation on the day of judgment will be related to our knowing the name of God. That includes knowing his attributes, works, and purposes as well as living in harmony with his</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">* For the proof that Trinity is not a Bible teaching, see the brochure </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Should You Believe in the Trinity?</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc, 1989</span></p><img src="1994_t-72_E_files/1994_t-72_E-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:246pt;height:125pt;">
<p><span class="font6">high principles. For example, Abraham knew God’s name and called on that name. As a result, he enjoyed a good relationship with God, showed faith in him, relied on him, and obeyed him. He became God’s friend. Likewise, our knowing God’s name draws us close to him and helps us to develop a personal relationship with him, assuring us of his love —Genesis 12:8; Psalm 9:10; Proverbs 18:10; John 17:26; James 2:23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Holy Scriptures say that Jehovah God “kept paying attention and listening. And a book of remembrance began to be written up before him for those in fear of Jehovah and for those thinking upon his name.” (Malachi 3:16) Why do we have to ‘think upon’ the greatest name? The name Jehovah literally means “He Causes to Become.” This reveals Jehovah as the One who causes himself to become the Fulfiller of promises. He always brings his purposes to realization. He is the almighty God, the only Creator, who has every fine attribute. There is no simple word that can wholly express God’s divine nature. But the greatest name, Jehovah, which he has chosen for himself, calls to mind all his attributes, qualities, and purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the Holy Scriptures, God tells us of his purposes toward man. Jehovah God created man to enjoy an everlasting, happy life in Paradise. His will for mankind is that they form one family, united in love and peace. The God of love will fulfill that purpose in the near future. (Matthew 24:3-14, 32-42; 1 John 4:16-21) God explains the reasons for mankind’s suffering and shows that salvation is possible. (Revelation 21:4) At Psalm 37:10, 11, we read: “Just a little while longer, and the wicked one will be no more; and you will certainly give attention to his place, and he will not be. But the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, and they will indeed find their exquisite delight in the abundance of peace.”—See also Koran 21:105-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Yes, God will be known by his great name. The nations will have to know that he is Jehovah. What a wonderful privilege to know the greatest name, to testify to it, and to cleave to it! In that way, in us will be fulfilled God’s joyful purpose: “Because on me he has set his affection, I shall also provide him with escape. I shall protect him because he has come to know my name. He will call upon me, and I shall answer him.,.. With length of days I shall satisfy him, and I shall cause him to see salvation by me.”—Psalm 91:14-16.</span></p>
