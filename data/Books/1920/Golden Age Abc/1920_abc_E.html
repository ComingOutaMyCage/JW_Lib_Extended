<p><span class="font6">Dear little reader or listener: Come with me and let us learn some precious lessons out of God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A</span><span class="font5"> Here we see Adam and Eve, the first man and woman, made perfect and good and given a beautiful home, where they lived for about two years; then, because they disobeyed God they lost their home and were not allowed to enter Eden any more. But God has promised that all the world shall be beautiful and peaceful like the Garden of Eden; then we shall have the privilege of showing God how much we love him, by doing his will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And here we see the Bible chained to a reading desk, Bibles were very scarce in those days, and there was not much Bible study, but now we can all have one each. Let us read it every day and learn of the glorious time coming when “the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea&quot;, and people will have on the bells of their horses, &quot;Holiness unto the Lord!&quot;—Haba kuk 2:14; Zechariah 14:20.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Cain was Adam and Eve’s first son, and Abel was the second. Here we see the parents heartbroken; for Cain, who was born after they were turned out of Eden, when he grew up to be a young man, killed his own brother Abel because he was jealous of him. God accepted Abel’s sacrifice, for it was a slain lamb (pointing forward to Jesus), but Cain offered the fruits of the land, showing that he tried to please God by his own works; and the fire from heaven did not burn his sacrifice. Let us not think that of ourselves we can please God, but only through Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T&gt; And look at Daniel! What a brave man he was! And oh, what faith he had in God! Just imagine: he would rather trust God and go into the lions’ den than not talk with him in prayer. How we admire him! Let us never forget to ask God’s help to begin the day and his forgiveness at the end, together with our praise and thanks, and let us also remember to be always Christlike, though we may be laughed at. “Dare to be a Daniel.&quot;</span></p>

But God took care of Elijah; for when he had to run away for his life and hide in a cave, God sent ravens to bring him food. And so it is with us: if we are fearless in telling the truth for Jesus, and of Jesus, God will always take care of us, no matter how poor or unknown we may be; and in this glorious Golden Age we shall have a grand reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">■C Felix was a governor of Judea, before whom St. Paul gave a stirring address. On account of having a Jewish wife he understood Paul, whose words made Felix fear for his own future in the thousand-year day of judgment, which will soon be here. Paul had not done anything wrong, but Felix would not let him go, hoping that Paul would pay him some money for his release. Felix sent often for him from prison; but Paul did not give him money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9">G</span><span class="font5">Here we see Goliath, the giant of the Philistines, who, every morning and evening, for forty days, challenged the Israelites, Saul, Israel’s king, was head and shoulders taller than any one of them, and the Philistines hoped that Saul would come out against Goliath, and that thus they would kill him and take the Israelites prisoners. But every man in that army was afraid. David, a boy, who visited the army to bring good things to his brothers, and who, before this, had killed a lion and a bear while shepherding his father's sheep had such faith in God that he asked King Saul if he might fight against Goliath. On being permitted, he took his sling and five smooth stones out of the deep brook in the valley, and, throwing one, he stunned the giant Goliath, and then cut off his head with the giant’s sword. Surely, we can . learn a great lesson from this: with God's help, everything that is good is possible. Let us rely upon God as David did.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font5">Esau and Jacob, Isaac's two sons, were twins, <sup>A</sup> though Esau was a little older and therefore heir to that wonderful promise that God made to Abraham. But, having no faith in it, Esau had sold it to Jacob for a &quot;mess of pottage”, that is, something good to eat.’ Now, nearing the death of his father Isaac, it was only fair that. Jacob should have what Esau had sold to him—the blessing. So Jacob took Esau’s place and received it. He was not wishing to gain lands or oxen, because he left </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font5"> and went to work for his Uncle Laban, but he was happy because he carried with him this blessing of God, which had said: Through thee and thy seed &quot;shall all the families of the earth be blessed&quot;.

<p><span class="font9">J</span><span class="font5"> Ah! everybody loves babies, and here is Jesus when he was a baby, just in a wooden trough where the oxen had fed, because all the houses and hotels were so full they could find no other place. Think of the Son of God being laid in a manger! Do we not see how different God is from rich, and proud human beings? Jesus was just a poor boy, and yet what a lovely and lovable one. The Bible says: “Jesus increased in wisdom and age </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">[margin], </span><span class="font5">and in favor with God and man”. (Luke 252) Let us learn well this great lesson of humility, always being glad to help the poor and needy, remembering that we ourselves are but dust.— Genesis 3:19.</span></p>

They rebelled against Moses and Aaron, and so, to teach all the Israelites a lesson, God caused the earth to open, and they fell in. Let us always remember that God’s ways are best, even though we may not see how they can work out. When Messiah's kingdom is set up, let us be sure that we do as the Lord wishes.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font5">It is almost hard to realize that Satan, the wicked adversary, the devil, was once a beautiful angel, but it is true; and God gave him the care of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. (Ezekiel 28:13-15) However, because he wanted more power and rulership, he was not true to that trust. He told Eve the greatest lie that ever was told; for though Adam heard God say that if he ate of one special tree, he would surely </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">die,</span><span class="font5"> Satan said to Eve: “Ye shall not surely die”. (Genesis 3:4) Jesus tells us that Satan was a liar and a murderer from the beginning. (John 8:44) Does this not also teach us a great lesson? Whatever God says in his Word, let us believe, whether it be “The dead know not anything&quot; (Ecclesiastes 9:5), or, “There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust”.—Acts 24:15.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Here is another baby! It is said Moses was such a beautiful child that passersby would turn to look at him. His father, who was a basket-maker, made a basket with a lid, and covered it inside and out with pitch, so that water could not get in, then his mother put the dear little baby inside and hid the basket away in the bulrushes which grew in the water, leaving Miriam, his sister (a girl about nine years old), to watch. Soon after, Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe. She heard Moses crying, her maids brought out the basket in which the dear little baby lay, and though the princess knew that he was a Hebrew, and that her father (Pharaoh) had ordered all the Hebrew boys to be killed, she took him and had him brought up as her own son.

However, Noah believed God and was saved. We are now in the time of trouble, of which this is a picture. Let us go to Jesus for refuge, and he will indeed be our Ark of safety to bring us out into the Golden Age.</span></p>

While it is true that Eve tempted Adam to eat of the forbidden fruit, yet God’s Word tells us that Adam sinned wilfully (1 Timothy 2:14): “Adam was not deceived&quot;. He made love, instead of his great Creator, his God, and he disobeyed God rather than lose his wife. Let us see to it that everything we do is right and good: “To obey is better than sacrifice&quot;. (1 Samuel 15:22) Let us say, when we are tempted to do wrong: No, I cannot do that; it is wrong. “Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.”—Colossians </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">3</span><span class="font5">:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">T&gt; Pilate was a Roman governor over the Jews. What <sup>A</sup> an opportunity Pilate lost for making a grand character! The Jews wanted the Romans to put Jesus to death because he told them the truth and they did not like it. The Roman way of killing people was by crucifixion, that is, hanging them on a cross; and Pilate allowed Jesus to be crucified. Thus Jesus, who was good and pure, and who had never done anything wrong, was killed by evil men. But God knew about it and permitted his Son to die and take the sinner’s place, that we might have life and blessings through him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Q And here we have Stephen, the first Christian martyr, a man full of love and zeal for the Lord, who “did great wonders and miracles among the people”, (Acts 6:8) But he was stoned to death because his hearers did not believe the truth. How many dear saints since then have lost their lives for following the teachings of Jesus! Indeed, many of our own brethren, in this enlightened day, and as recently as 1918, were imprisoned for preaching, “Thou shalt not kill”. Jesus said: “A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another, as I have loved you”. (John 13:34) Let us follow Stephen’s example, and die rather than give up the teachings of our Savior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thomas, one of our Lord’s disciples, was a skeptic, <sup>A</sup> that is, a man who will not believe unless he sees.</span></p>

Jesus gave him just a gentle rebuke, for he said: “Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed’ ’. (John 20:28, 29) Let us have faith in God’s plan (Ephesians 3:11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> as shown in the Bible; then Jesus will not have to rebuke us.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">T J Ah! here we have some slight idea of our great God, our glorious Creator, who sits enthroned on high; yet whose ear is open to our prayer. The foundation of his throne is justice. He never changes. God is love. God is light, or wisdom. How we love him when we think of his wonderful character: “the Father of mercies” (2 Corinthians 1:3), so loving and kind, so wise and powerful! Surely we can say with David: “All that is within me, bless his holy name”.—Psalm 103:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How true was that old prophecy, for Jesus was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, a very rich man, though all Jesus’ life was spent among the poor, doing them good and preaching the kingdom. Now we have the privilege of telling everyone who will hear of the Golden Age coming, and how Jesus by his death and resurrection and wonderful work buys us all back from sin and the grave; so that if we follow him we may never need to die.</span></p>

She was heart-broken, and dear Jesus was so sorry for her that he stopped the funeral procession and raised the youth to life. Let our hearts be so tender and full of love that we, like Jesus, will do all we can for those who are in trouble; let us also remember that Jesus worked these wonderful miracles to show what he will do for all who have died, how in the thousand-year day of resurrection, restanding, all those who have been sin-sick and dead in sin will receive life through his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">'V'</span><span class="font5"> If our hearts are given to the Lord, then we will want to set a good example; for the Bible says that “none of us liveth to himself” (Romans 14:7), meaning that everything we do influences someone, and we want to follow Jesus and do good. We have a chance every day to help someone else now, and the glorious Golden Age will be full of such opportunities. Let us always remember that all we do and say is setting a good or a bad example to those around us.</span></p>

Let us always remember what the Bible says: “The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil”. (1 Timothy 6:10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">R. V.)</span><span class="font5"> The mighty Logos became poor for our sakes, and as the man Jesus he said: “The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head,&quot;—had no place he could call his own. (Matthew 8:20) We do not need to be rich to serve Jesus, and to be like him.</span></p>

Jesus said: “This day is salvation come to this house”. (Luke 19:9) Let us at all times strive for God’s blessing. Let us be just and generous, as Zacchasus was (verse 8). so that salvation may come to our house, and to others through us.</span></p>
