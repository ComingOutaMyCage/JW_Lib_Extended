<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">An aerial view of the record-shattering crowd of 91,562 persons that filled all seats and overflowed into the playing field of Yankee Stadium, New York City, to hear the above public lecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Fascinating Speech</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">found in the pages of this booklet was delivered by the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society at the public meeting of the eightday New World Society Assembly of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Yankee Stadium, New York City, New York, U. S. A., Sunday afternoon, July 26,1953. The enormous turnout of people overflowed from the Yankee Stadium into nearby overflow tents, which were filled with 25,240 persons, and 40 miles away at the assembly Trailer City another record crowd of 49,027 listened by direct wire communication with Yankee Stadium, making a total attendance of 165,829. At the same time, the lecture was broadcast over radio station WBBR to an unnumbered invisible audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From the way this tremendous crowd of people from ninety-six different lands enjoyed this speech we are sure that all readers with hearts yearning for what is right, pure and good will enjoy it too, with great personal enrichment and comfort and with wise counsel for the future. So with keen pleasure we publish it herewith.</span></p>

<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>AFTER ARMAGEDDON — GOD’S NEW WORLD</span></h1>
<p><span class="font6">A</span><span class="font4">RMAGEDDON will be the worst thing ever to hit the earth within the history of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s new world will be the best thing ever to come to distressed mankind and will never pass away. For us to know that the best immediately follows the worst gives us courage to consider the subject of our discussion. We cannot have the new world without first Armageddon. So if we have yet to endure Armageddon, it will be better for us to face it with understanding, in the hope of surviving and entering into a new world of God’s making, a world altogether different from the one mankind has known now for thousands of years, to its sorrow. Armageddon will prove a great blessing in disguise. Our proper concern is how we may prepare that we may not be irreparably hurt by it but may endure it and live to enjoy the grand new things of God’s world of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At critical times men in public office and prominent in world affairs have spoken of Armageddon as something that can be avoided by the skillful efforts of men. Because of the background of the name “Armageddon” some men have taken it to mean a decisive conflict and they have used the word in a way to fit a certain occasion. In the campaign year of 1912 the Boston </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font4"> quoted the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">aforetime American president Theodore Roosevelt as saying: “With unflinching heart and undimmed eye, we stand at Armageddon and we battle for the Lord.” After which the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Globe</span><span class="font4"> quoted the Bible scripture to which Mr. Roosevelt referred, in Revelation, chapter sixteen, verses sixteen to eighteen. But if battling for the Lord God Almighty meant running for the presidency of the United States, then God Almighty lost the battle, for Mr. Roosevelt lost in the presidential election, and the man, Woodrow Wilson, who wanted to make the world safe for democracy won. No, that hot political campaign was not Armageddon, and the Lord God Almighty did not fight in it or have any man fighting in it for Him. He takes no part in the politics of this old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">More recently, on September 2,1945, just following Japan’s surrender on the battleship Missouri, General of the American Army Douglas MacArthur said: “Men since the beginning of time have sought peace. Various methods through the ages have been attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes between nations. . . . Military alliances, balances of power, leagues of nations, all in turn failed, leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war. The utter destructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative. We have had our last chance. If we will not devise some greater and more equitable system, our Armageddon will be at our door. The problem basically is theological and involves a spiritual recrudescence, an improvement of human character that will synchronize with our almost matchless advances in science, art, literature and all material and cultural developments of the past 2,000 years. It must be of the spirit if we are to save the flesh.” Six years later, under the shadow of the great Communist menace, General MacArthur saw good to repeat those very words as a quotation before a joint meeting of the United States Congress in Washington, D.C., April 19, 1951. About the same time the noted American Bernard Baruch said the world was shaping up to a fight between communism and individualism and the “first battle of the great Armageddon” was taking place within the United States and the “spiritual Armageddon” was already here.—</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Reader’s Digest,</span><span class="font4"> March 1951.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The problem, said General MacArthur, was basically theological and involved a spiritual revival; and from the theological quarter have come expressions of fear of Armageddon. At a time when the Fascist dictator Mussolini had some differences with the Vatican, a United Press dispatch, dated February 1, 1934, from Paris, was published throughout the nation. It said: “A plea by the Pope for a world-wide spiritual revival to avoid Armageddon was contained today in a dispatch from the Rome correspondent of the newspaper Intransigeant. The correspondent said the Pope, in an interview, denounced hypernationalism, emphasis on materialism and sex in education, and the military training of youth under the guise of athletics.” (Baltimore </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font4"> February 1, 1934) This papal warning of Armageddon was repeated from the Roman Catholic pulpit later that same month, according to the New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font4"> of February 23, 1934, which said: “From the pulpit of St Patrick’s Cathedral, the present ‘sorry mess that has been made of things in the world’ was blamed on Martin Luther and his associates yesterday by Father Joseph C. Fleming, pastor of the Church of St. John the Evangelist, White Plains, N.Y. ‘Whether we know it or not, the battle lines are forming for Armageddon, and the most disheartening reflection at the moment is the world’s indifference to this tremendous fact. The rotting kingdom of the world is fast being divided into two camps—an extreme communism, anti-human and anti-God, and the church of Christ, divinely fashioned to encompass and protect the archives of God’s revelation.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The foregoing charge that communism was a by-product of the Protestant Reformation was repeated by a Roman Catholic monsignor in the pulpit of the same St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Sunday, June 7, this year, much to the resentment of Protestant clergymen. (New York </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font4">June 15, 1953) Responsibility for Armageddon is thus being charged by Catholics to Protestants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Contrary to the usage of the name by politicians, military men and clergymen, Armageddon is no mere stormy conflict between two .political parties within a nation; it is no mere atomic war between blocs of nations for the domination of the earth—the much-feared World War HI; it is not the climax of the fight between the hateful Communist camp and Christendom’s most powerful religious system and its political, commercial and religious allies. Armageddon is what the sacred Scriptures of divine prophecy call it, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty,” the war in which the Creator of heaven and earth will face all his foes and will fight as he did in the days of old. God the Almighty foresaw the necessity for that war in due time and he foretold its coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">That war is therefore unavoidable. The facts of modem history prove we are in the “day of God the Almighty” and his war is near.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This war or battle takes its name from the symbolic place where it is to be fought, “the place that is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon,” or, “Armageddon,” The name means “Mountain of Megiddo.” The name “Megiddo” is understood to mean the “place of the assembly of troops.” The name “Megiddo” is historic. It named an ancient city on the plain of Esdraelon in Palestine and about fifty-five miles north of Jerusalem. Strongly fortified, Megiddo commanded an important pass from the north into the plain, and nearly all notices of it in the Holy Bible are connected with military transactions. Not that the war of all wars is to be fought out at the literal location of ancient Megiddo, but that the war of that great day of God the Almighty will have consequences like those of ancient battles at Megiddo, for then Almighty God fought to prove his sovereignty over the earth and to rescue his people upon whom his name “Jehovah” was called. Calamitous defeats changing the course of history were inflicted there upon the enemy, whereas miraculous victories were won by Jehovah God for the sake of his name and his chosen people. The name Armageddon or Hill of Megiddo is therefore loaded with mournful meaning for the haters and foes of Almighty God, Jehovah. It denotes the execution of destruction on them by divine power. The question is therefore, not, Who will win at this coming Armageddon? but, Shall we be on the winning side?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The march to Armageddon is on. Our position there in the battle lines will be determined by what side we choose to march with now and by the influences to which we choose to yield now. Exposing the side and the influences that we should avoid, the Christian apostle John, with the day of God Almighty’s war unveiled in vision before his eyes, wrote: “And the sixth [angel] poured out his bowl [of God’s anger] upon the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings from the rising of the sun. And I saw three unclean inspired expressions that looked like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go forth [not to the kings from the rising of the sun, but] to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. . . . And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.”—Revelation 16:12-16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Little do the people realize that the rulers and political guides of the nations are influenced by malicious superhuman forces that are irresistibly driving them on in a suicidal march to the decisive conflict of Armageddon. Those superhuman forces are the invisible demons of the mighty spirit organization of the Devil, Satan. The apostle Paul recognized the existence of the demons when he warned Christians of their real, hidden foes, saying: “Put on the complete suit of armor from God that you may be able to stand firm against the machinations of the Devil; because we have a fight, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.” (Ephesians 6:11, 12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> This same apostle identifies the princely ruler of these demons as the “god of this system of things” and the “ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience.”—2 Corinthians 4:4 and Ephesians 2:2, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Not Jehovah, but this prince of the demons, Satan the Devil, is the god of this old world. Jesus Christ, the Leader in Christianity, branded Satan as the invisible controlling power behind this old world, calling him “the ruler of this world.” (John 12:31; 14:30, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Satan the Devil is the one whom Revelation 12:3-9 names and pictures as the Dragon out of whose mouth the first inspired expression hops like a frog. Bible prophecy also uses a series of wild beasts to picture the great world powers that have had to do with Jehovah God’s people. (Daniel 7:1-12) So the “wild beast” out of whose mouth the second inspired expression hops is the system of human governments today in existence and which descended from the past world powers of human history. God’s Word exposes this earthly governmental system as the visible organization of Satan the Devil. For example, Revelation 13:1-8 shows that the great spiritual Dragon gives power, authority and a throne to this beastly system, which then opens its mouth to blaspheme God and his theocratic organization and fights against God’s holy ones, his faithful witnesses. Certain members of this beastly system may claim to be “Christian nations,” but look at their record in history and it will prove they are a part of the Devil’s old world and are serving that old Dragon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “false prophet” out of whose mouth the third inspired expression leaps like a frog is not an individual man. If we compare this chapter sixteen of Revelation with chapters twelve and thirteen, it convinces us that the “false prophet” is an outstanding beastly governmental system that takes upon itself the role of “prophet,” Who, then, is it? It is the seventh world power of human history, the mighty Anglo-American world-power system, which dates from the seventeenth century when the British empire was founded and the thirteen American colonies were established. As foretold in Revelation, chapter thirteen, this seventh world power of Anglo-American forces acting jointly was the prime mover in the formation and establishment of the League of Nations and its present-day successor, the United Nations. The Anglo-American world power turned into a prophet and predicted great Messianic things for the League of Nations. But when the League failed to prevent World War II and the atomic bomb had to be exploded, it proved this seventh world power to be a false prophet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Today the British and American statesmen and clergymen take the lead in recommending and supporting the League’s successor, the United Nations, and prophesy great things for it. It is mankind’s last hope. It is the “mainstay of our work to build a peaceful and decent world,” the “best means available” to the present generation for achieving world peace. Really, it is the supreme hope for a lasting world peace! Its agencies are the “greatest combined mutual insurance policy ever written in the modern world—insurance against war, poverty, sickness and ignorance.” World War III is inevitable if the United Nations is per-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">AFTER ARMAGEDDON—GOD'S NEW WORLD </span><span class="font4">11 mitted to fail, particularly if the Anglo-American world power gets out of the United Nations and if the United Nations gets out of it, that is, out of New York City. So they prophesy, but such predictions by this great political prophet will yet prove to be just as false as its predictions concerning the League of Nations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Of course, the announced desires, aims and purposes of the symbolic “wild beast” and of the “false prophet” are peaceable and are for liberating, uplifting and improving the people. The year 1953 was the year of the great peace offensive of Communist Russia, and, to match this, on April 8 of that year a Resolution on Disarmament was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations, “to prevent war and release the world’s human and economic resources for the purposes of peace.” If this world is so peaceful in its intentions and so lofty in its motives, why, then, should Armageddon come, any more than World War III should come? How could it be true that all the world’s rulers and all nations are marching to Armageddon? Why is that catastrophe unavoidable?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is because all nations and their rulers plan peace for and among themselves according to the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">status quo,</span><span class="font4"> that is, the state of human society that has existed for at least the past four thousand years. The peace and prosperity they seek is, however, not the peace and prosperity of God’s kingdom nor peace with his kingdom. It is not the peace and prosperity of Jehovah’s new world. Look at the facts of history. International peace in this world has never meant God’s kingdom. So international peace under the United Nations or any other man-made arrangement would never mean</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">God’s kingdom, never mean the converting of the nations to God, never mean their handing over their national sovereignty and swearing their allegiance to God’s choice of King of his new world. No, but the divine rule would still be true, that friendship with this world is enmity, hostility, to God. The divine principle would still stand, that if anyone loves this old world and its cravings of the flesh, its cravings of the eyes and its showy display of the means of life, the love of God is not in such a lover, because these things do not originate with Jehovah God but with the great Dragon, Satan, the god of this system of things. (James 4:1-4; 1 John 2:15-17) Whatever the clergy of Christendom may say and pray, and no matter what the “false prophet” world power may say and predict, it will not alter these basic truths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">So we repeat the question, Why must Armageddon of necessity strike all nations, whether of the Western democratic bloc or of the Eastern Communist bloc? The reason why is that they are, one and all, opposed to Jehovah’s appointed and now-installed Ruler of his new world. They refuse to recognize that Jehovah God, the Creator of heaven and earth, is the One to decide who shall rule this earth and when he shall rule it. When the nations attempt to don the Messianic role and do what only God’s Messiah and King can do, it plainly shows up their refusal to submit to God’s supreme purpose and to accept his fully-empowered Messiah, Jesus Christ, whom he has now enthroned in the heavens as the Rightful Ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Most High God Jehovah has indicated his times and seasons in his written Word. According to its time schedule God’s “appointed times of the nations” for them to rule all the earth without the interference of his kingdom ran out A.D. 1914. The outbreak of World War I in the summer of that year and all the spasms of international distress that have followed prove that fact according to Bible prophecy. Their time is up! Particularly since the close of World War I in 1918 Jehovah’s witnesses have served notice on all nations to that effect. The nations have refused to quit man’s un-theocratic rule and to yield over their sovereignty to Jehovah’s theocratic King of kings, Jesus Christ. It is now not a question of whether the East bloc of nations will yield to the West bloc or the democratic bloc will yield to the Communist bloc. It is a question of whether all nations of whatever political complexion will yield to the King of kings and Lord of lords, yes, yield to the Government of governments and the Kingdom of kingdoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The choice is now between the old world and the new world. No political party, government or bloc of nations should assume to offer itself as a substitute and take the place of God’s government for his new world. The religious clergy and member nations propose that the United Nations should exercise global domination. Despite the prayer chapel at the U.N. headquarters, despite the prayers and blessings of the clergy of Christendom, despite the predictions out of the mouth of the “false prophet,” that proposal and effort is nothing but an outright rejection by them of God’s kingdom by his Christ. It is the offering of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font4"> hypocritical, man-made substitute for God’s own perfect, rightful Government. This is no time for a cheap, deceptive, unworkable substitute. It is the time for the real thing, and God has now determined to give obedient men the real thing. Men inspired by fear warn that World War III is inescapable if the U.N. is permitted to fail; but the real truth is that </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span><span class="font4"> is inescapable for the very reason that the U.N. is not abandoned and junked and its member nations and all other nations do not “kiss the Son” or do homage to God’s chosen One, whom God has set as King upon his holy seat of government. The nations are in a tumult and the peoples are imagining a vain thing, while their kings and their high officials set themselves and take counsel against Jehovah and his Christ, his Messiah. (Psalm 2:1-12) The inspired expressions that jump out of the mouths of the symbolic “wild beast” and “false prophet” like unclean, croaking frogs are not in favor of Jehovah and his enthroned King, but are inspired by the demons and are goading the kings and rulers of this world on to Armageddon, over the issue of world domination. Will there be no halting of them till the worst?</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No! The Armageddon of total destruction is unavoidable for them. Why? Because the god of this old world is the Dragon, Satan the Devil, the implacable enemy of God, and he is the Serpent that once bruised the heel of the Christ. He is opposed to the new world, because he can not and will not be its god. He is extremely angry at God and his Christ and is for all-out war against them to the hilt! If he, the Serpent, must be bruised at the head by the Christ, then he is determined that all his visible and invisible offspring shall be bruised at the head with him. Modern facts viewed in the light of Bible prophecy and chronology disclose that that original Serpent, the Dragon, lost the war in heaven and has been hurled with his demons down to the earth, and that from heaven the warning cry has been sounded: “Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short time.” (Revelation 12:7-12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Using the short time for all it is worth, he persecutes Jehovah’s witnesses and by his own propaganda he tries to drown out their world-wide witness to the kingdom of Jehovah’s Christ. Out of the Dragon’s mouth there springs a froglike demonic expression for the power-holders and policy-makers of this old world to consume. This demon-inspired expression out of the Dragon’s mouth sounds the keynote for this old world. It dictates the line of argument that they must repeat for the saving and keeping alive of this old world and its political, social, commercial and religious systems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “wild beast” of untheocratic human government got its power, authority and throne from the Dragon. So it must hew to the party line, the Dragon line, and the frog hopping out of its mouth must croak in tune with that out of the Dragon’s mouth. And it does! The “false prophet,” the Anglo-American world power, which the Communist bloc call “imperialist,” puts on the appearance of being a pacific, lamblike power, but it, in fact, speaks like a dragon. Unlike a true prophet, who would preach in favor of Jehovah’s theocracy and in favor of handing national sovereignty and world domination over to God’s kingdom, the “false prophet” takes the wild beast as his ideal of the rightful government power over this globe. When the “false prophet” opens his mouth, out pops the demon-inspired expression and it follows the Dragon line, the old-world party line. So the “false prophet” proposed an international “image of the wild beast,” for the idolatrous worship of all peoples. Then he gave life to it. This political substitute for God’s kingdom copies man-made government as wielded by the seven successive world powers, Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome and Anglo-American democracy, every one of these dealing hostilely with Jehovah’s people, the people with the Messianic message and ideal. (Revelation 13:11-18) So the United Nations does not guarantee a new world. It is of the doomed old world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our appeal is therefore to the people as individuals. Let no one be deceived. The froglike inspired expressions croaking loudly throughout the earth do not come out of the Bible, nor out of Jehovah’s theocratic organization, nor out of the mouth of the “Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world.” They are not inspired by God’s holy spirit. They are inspired by demons of which Satan the Devil is ruler, and they hop out of the mouths of the Dragon, the wild beast and the “false prophet.” That is why they are leading the world rulers and their armies to a certain and decisive conflict with God the Almighty, which will mean a global Armageddon for them, never needing to be repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence this is no time for lasting, durable peace for this world. It is perilous to be thrown off guard by the peace propaganda, peace aims and peace moves of this world. It will never bring peace with God and his King of the new world. In proof of that, amid all their clamor for peace and security, watch the way they treat the announcers of his new world, Jehovah’s witnesses. Now that the new world government has been established in the heavens with Jesus Christ on the throne, the divine command Is: “This good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matthew 24:14, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Jehovah’s witnesses are the only ones preaching world-wide the established kingdom of the new world. They are doing this, not to convert the world, not to head off the nations before the signal for Armageddon is given, but simply, as Jesus predicted, “for the purpose of a witness.” Let accept this witness whoever will. The powers and authorities of this world will not take to this Kingdom witness. Watch how they deal with Jehovah’s witnesses who preach this good news. Then you will be able to judge rightly whether the peacemouthing nations are for God’s kingdom and for peace or are for war with him and his enthroned King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By attaining a superficial peace during which they could utter the cry foretold in prophecy, “Peace and safety!” the nations could better concentrate on opposing the Kingdom preachers and putting them down or howling them down. But never will they fully silence the Kingdom proclamation. Their persecution of bearers of the good news will be defeated in its aims. The opposition will turn out only for the furtherance of the good news. Woe, however, to the opposers of the good news and its bearers. The divine prophecies are definite that, when the cry of “Peace and safety!&quot; is combined with their united assault on the Kingdom proclaimers and their new-world society, it will be the most awful moment for all nations, institutions and systems of this old world. It will be the overt act provoking the explosive outbreak of Armageddon’s war. The preaching of the good news having accomplished its purpose, it will mean the end is here for the entire old world and its society. Says the apostle: “Then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape.” (1 Thessalonians 5:1-4,1VW) A most violent interruption that will be of this old world’s peace!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No mere World War III will that Armageddon be. This final Armageddon will be of universal proportions, involving the invisible heavens and the visible, material earth. It will be no mere settling of right and wrong here among the two billion people of this tiny earth, but it will be a settlement of right and wrong throughout the universe in one all-embracing &quot;war of the great day of God the Almighty.” Worlds will be in collision, Satan’s old world and Jehovah’s new world. Invisible, and not merely visible, powers of evil opposition to God’s kingdom will be knocked out of business; demons and their human dupes, all together destroyed. The masterminds behind this world and its wickedness must be overthrown and shorn of power, their stock piles of atom and hydrogen bombs and all their scientific weapons of wholesale slaughter reduced to nothing. Worldly-wise men will then not laugh at the battle accounts in the Bible of where Jehovah is reported as fighting for his people, for Jehovah has promised to fight then as when he fought in those olden days. Lump all those battle accounts together, including those at ancient Megiddo, and know that God Almighty will have at his disposal appalling forces of destruction to unleash against his puny foes of flesh and blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At the battle near Megiddo in the days of Judge Barak, according to the Bible record, “from heaven did the stars fight, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.” (Judges 5:19, 20, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font4">The description of the war of Armageddon at Revelation 19:11 to 20:3 gives forceful meaning to that account of the ancient fight at Megiddo, as it reveals to us that the King Jesus Christ with all the armies of holy angels in heaven will fight against their united foes at Armageddon. They will need to. For they will destroy more than just the wild beast and the “false prophet” and all the rulers of the nations and their armies and regimented peoples, plunging them into confusion and causing them blindly to turn their weapons of destruction against themselves in the forepart of the fight, and then finishing off all who would escape. They will fight against the invisible enemies back of this old world, the demons who spurred the rulers on to Armageddon and also the ruler of the demons, Satan the Devil, the Dragon. These will be restrained, chained as it were to a state of absolute helplessness; not only that, but be hurled into a place where they cannot have contact with either men or angels to tempt them or do them harm, namely, an abyss; not only that, but their abyss of imprisonment will be sealed oyer with God’s official seal that cannot be broken to let them out until they are to be executed with annihilation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What, then, does all that mean? This—the complete destruction of this old world, including both its wicked heavens and its corrupt earth. (2 Peter 3:7-12, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> How glad we can be, therefore, that Armageddon is not a mere man’s fight, not a mere human upheaval or world revolution of human society—like the American revolution or the French revolution—to be followed, after it is all over, with a repeating of nothing better than human politics and with the same basic conditions as prevailed for the past six thousand years—sin, sickness, disease, bloodshed, godlessness, devilishness, and death! No, it will not be a revolution of this old world, but an obliteration of it down to its very roots, with not a branch or a fruit of it surviving. What mankind needs is a completely new world, and that world can be only God’s promised new world. His time for a change has come, and it will come through Armageddon. For the past four thousand years there has been nothing new under the sun, but the almighty, all-wise God is able to make all things new, absolutely different from what they are now. We have his promise that he will do so, in these words heard by the last Christian writer of the Bible: “And the one seated on the throne said: ‘Look! I am making all things new.’ ” (Revelation 21:5, NW) This was after the apostle John saw the new heavens and earth coming into existence after the present heavens and earth had passed away, to fulfill the ancient prophecy voiced by Isaiah the prophet: “Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, ... behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”—Isaiah 65:13-17, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">THE NEW THINGS</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most important new thing about the new world will be the God of the new heavens and new earth. That deity for adoration will be the only living and true God, the new world’s Creator. In the prophecy he speaks authoritatively, saying: “Thus saith God Jehovah, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: ... I am Jehovah, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.” (Isaiah 42:5-8, AS) That signifies a new worship, the only worship permitted earth-wide, a worship differing from what this religiously confused old world carries on. True worship of the Creator is the all-essential. Man’s confused, false ways of worship are accountable for mankind’s present state of affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our first parents, Adam and Eve, had Jehovah as their God. As long as this was so they enjoyed blissful life in the perfection of God’s image and likeness in an earthly paradise. It was when they changed their worship in favor of the deceptive “god of this system of things” that they brought an alteration of all things for the human race, their descendants. They caused to come upon us God’s condemnation as children of rebellious sinners, accompanied by a heritage of selfishness, defects and blemishes of all kinds, pain and sufferings, all ending up in death in the dust of the ground. (Romans 5:12) Their chosen new god did not help them or relieve them. He only made already bad matters worse, and today we are getting near the worst state of affairs of the Devil’s world at the battlefield of Armageddon. After Armageddon the citizens of the world must worship the divine Source of all the brand-new things to be enjoyed. No other god will be permitted, nor will there be any other to worship, for Satan and his demon horde will be abyssed and all human gods will be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How will the only rightful, lawful God manifest his supremacy and sovereignty over all the earth? It will be by a theocratic world government. This is what the promised “new heavens” mean. They will be the new invisible, spiritual controlling powers over all mankind and will be in-corruptibly in favor of righteousness. Those who make up that world government will inspire the utmost confidence in its godliness and loyalty to what is right and its unselfish concern for what is for the good of its subjects. In that theocratic government the highly exalted Son of God, Jesus Christ, will be the anointed King. He will have associated with him in reigning his “bride,” that is, his glorified congregation of 144,000 faithful followers, all genuine Christians. The King Jesus Christ loved that new world so much that he laid aside his heavenly glory for over thirty-four years to be born as a babe and grow to perfect manhood, then to advocate God’s pure worship, proclaim His kingdom and finally die a martyr to the cause of Jehovah’s sovereignty over heaven and earth. His death proved his integrity toward God to be incorruptible. It did more. It furnished the ransom sacrifice for the release of all mankind who believe in what he has done for them and who accept and obey him as Jehovah’s anointed King. On the third day after he died the almighty God raised his faithful, self-sacrificing Son out of death and exalted him to a superior position to what he had before in heaven, a position second only to His own.—Philippians 2:5-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The “bride” of Christ, who will reign in the heavens with him, will consist of those select few Christians whom God takes out from among all nations and begets as his spiritual children with a heavenly destiny, and who prove their integrity to God’s cause even to the death, the way their heavenly Bridegroom did. So in all its members that will be a world government of integrity proved before all the universe, a lover of righteousness, a hater of iniquity, never subject to governmental corruption. Its earthly subjects in the new world will never have cause for faultfinding, complaining or petitioning the government for a redress of grievances. It will be a perfect government and will enforce God’s law, theocratic law, over all mankind alike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Because of its spirituality and highly exalted position, that world government will be invisible. Yet it will be very real to all earth’s inhabitants, by the manifestations of its power and guidance over men. Not to speak of what use it will make of the heavenly angels at its disposal, it will have representatives visibly on earth. These will be, not materialized angels, but meh of faith, who proved their integrity during the trials, temptations, hardships and persecution of this devilish world. In effervescent jubilation over the structure of God’s kingdom the psalmist said in prophetic address to the King Jesus Christ: “Instead of your fathers shall be your sons; you shall make them princes throughout the land.” (Psalm 45:16, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">AT)</span><span class="font4"> These are not to be princes in the political sense of today, but are to be devoted servants of God who will be made principal men in a group, or overseers, responsible men over a large or small body of the King’s subjects, and they will be spread throughout the land each with his territory assignment. They will not be bosses, “I am the law here” politicians or political-machine operators having the power of patronage for political favorites. You may look for them all to be tried servants with clean hands who humbled themselves under God’s mighty hand. They will be subject to the royal law of the coming world the same as all other subjects of the King; only they are to be given more responsibility of service because of their fitness, which, in turn, means they will have to account for more. The prophecy of Isaiah 32:1 (AT) will then continue -in force: “Behold! a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One new thing in the coming righteous world will be mankind’s parentage. At present it is popular to mouth the catch phrase, “the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man,” as though the brotherhood of man to man was because all had a common fatherhood of God. The only brotherhood of man that actually exists is because all men are descendants of one human couple, the sinners Adam and Eve, whom God had cast out of his family of children because of their rebellion against his Godship and his law. Those of mankind who cultivate and show the spirit of Satan the Devil have the fatherhood of the Devil. None such will survive the battle of Armageddon.—1 John 3:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this world those called “princes” are generally the sons of the reigning king of the land or are the sons of nobility and are a select few, in a class different from the king’s other subjects. In the new world the princes then appointed throughout all the land will be sons of the King Jesus Christ. But they will not be his children more than all others who submit to the Kingdom will be. Why not? Because all the subjects of Jesus Christ will become his children. This will not be so in a figurative sense. It will be so in a very literal way, for all humans alike, the princes and those over whom they have oversight, will receive their life through Jesus Christ. He gave his perfect human life that he might redeem for them the life that our first human father Adam had forfeited for all his descendants by sinning in Eden. (Matthew 20:28) He is the ransomer of all who become his obedient subjects. In this way he will have fulfilled upon him the prophecy: “The government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6, AS) He being the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Everlasting</span><span class="font4"> Father, they may be his children everlastingly. His government over them will be a paternal government, giving every subject the loving care, guidance and provision of an affectionate father. Although it will be a government of justice and unchallengeable power, it will be a rulership of love. How much mankind has needed such a rule of love instead of oppression and exploitation by parasite politicians!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The King will see to it that his subjects have a home worthy of a family of his, worthy of children of the King. He will see to it that they have a home the equal of that of the first humans in Eden, a paradise. As he hung upon the torture stake on Calvary to give his human life as a ransom for mankind, did he not say to the sympathetic evildoer who asked to be remembered in Christ’s kingdom: “Truly I say to you today, You will be with me in Paradise”? (Luke 23:42, 43, Lamsa; also Rotherham, Cureton, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Jesus was there prophesying to this dying malefactor that when he came into his kingdom he would restore Paradise to earth, not merely in the former territory of Eden but all over the earth, on all continents and islands. And if that sympathetic malefactor with a spark of faith in Jesus will be in that paradise by his power of resurrecting the dead, then it proves that the King will at that time have the power even to raise the dead the same as he had it when he was a man here on earth. All graveyards will thus be wiped out! Do you marvel at this? Then says the King: “Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.” (John 5:28, 29, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> The vast majority of those who will become his subjects will be those who have returned to earthly life on our paradise planet by his power to call forth and raise the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His apostle Paul solemnly declared before Caesar’s judgment seat: “There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Acts 24:15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> The unrighteous will be put on judgment, which means they will have an opportunity to gain everlasting life on earth under the Kingdom. As for those who do not prove worthy of being preserved forever by virtue of their trial life under the Kingdom, the King’s judgment will be one of condemnation to everlasting destruction, the second death from which there is no resurrection. By the King’s use of his power to resurrect his dead subjects we see further how he will be entitled to be called “Everlasting Father” as respects his subjects. His “bride,” his congregation of 144,000 members built on him as the Rock, will serve at his side as a mother to them.—Matthew 16:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The King of God’s new world will be unique in that he will be not merely the royal Ruler but also the High Priest of God. It was as such that he offered a perfect human sacrifice on earth, and when he was raised from the dead on the third day to heavenly life, he ascended to God’s presence and there presented the value of his sacrifice in behalf of mankind. (Hebrews 9:24-26) His “bride” of 144,000 members will form an underpriesthood under him; as it is written in.prophecy: “They will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will rule as kings with him for the thousand years.” (Revelation 20:6, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> The King’s practice then of religion will not then be a mere formality but will be sincere worship of his own heavenly Father and God, Jehovah. As Jehovah’s High Priest he will lead all his earthly subjects in the worship of the one living and true God, and idolatry of no kind will be permitted even secretly. He provided the effective sacrifice for ransoming men from the death inherited from Adam and for their cleansing from inherited sin. He will look after their spiritual health as well as their mental and physical health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the ancient theocratic nation of Israel, Jehovah’s high priest and underpriests served as health inspectors and saw that the people had a sanitary way of living and a safe diet; they quarantined those afflicted with contagious diseases and pronounced clean and admissible to normal human society those who had been recovered from infectious maladies. That was a prophetic picture of how Jehovah’s royal High Priest will take care of the health of all his subjects, healing them, correcting all their physical and mental deformities, and gradually lifting all those who submit to his treatment to the human perfection that was lost for them by their forefather Adam. As High Priest, also, Jesus will grant them the forgiveness of the sins they repent of while their imperfections are still upon them. His sacrificial blood will wipe such sins away. Like the Israelite priests of old, too, he will attend to the education of all his subjects in the requirements for everlasting life. Hence he will teach them the truth and absolute righteousness; and jails, correctional institutions, mental asylums and hospitals with all their staffs of attendants will not mar the land’s appearance in silent testimony to a depraved, criminal, deranged and diseased condition of the people. Only when his reign of a thousand years has corrected, uplifted and purified his obedient subjects to the standing of human perfection, free from all taint of sin, will he as High Priest pronounce any of his subjects clean and able to enter into the human society of the eternal world that lies ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In this mighty and miraculous and righteous way will he reconcile mankind to the God for whom he is High Priest. To Jehovah God the psalmist David said: “With thee is the fountain of life.” Jesus Christ also said: “The Father has within him the gift of life.” (Psalm 36:9; John 5:26, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Knox; NW)</span><span class="font4"> For this reason, at the end of his' millennial reign, the King and High Priest will turn over his family of subjects to the direct judgment of his heavenly Father, inasmuch as He is the original source of all life and the theocratic Sovereign of earth and heaven. The great Supreme Judge will apply a test to determine who are unswervingly devoted to truth, right, love and pure worship for all eternity. Those who, like Adam and Eve in the paradise of Eden, let any selfishness creep in, and commit an overt act of rebellion, will be eternally blotted out in the second death, as if they had never existed. The Devil and his demons will be released for a little while from the abyss of imprisonment in order to be used in this test and will also be annihilated in second death as wicked beyond correction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Those passing the test in perfect loyalty from the heart will be justified by the Supreme Judge to an endless happy life. Where? In an unfading paradise on earth. (Revelation 20:7-15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Thus the glorious climax will be a world absolutely clean, righteous and God-fearing, in both its new earth and its new heavens. To the omnipotent, allwise, all-righteous and all-loving God is this amazing result to be attributed through Jesus Christ, as it is written: “And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.” (Revelation 21:3, 4, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Rightly the saved world will adore him evermore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ACTION NOW BEFORE ARMAGEDDON!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Just a while ago we said that the vast majority of the subjects of the new world’s King will be people restored to life on earth by the resurrection of the dead. Why only the “vast majority,” and not all? Because there is a great crowd of people of good will today living who will survive the world catastrophe of Armageddon and enter the world of new heavens and new earth without going down into the grave or ever afterward having the need to die and cease to exist. That means that Armageddon is so near at hand it will strike the generation now living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">When giving the prophecy that mentions Armageddon Jesus said he would come to this universal war like a thief: “Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake.” (Revelation 16:15, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Further emphasizing the thieflike beginning of the war of Armageddon Jesus compared it to the Flood and said: “For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be. For as people were in those days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark; and they took no note until the flood came and swept them all away, so the presence of the Son of man will be.” (Matthew 24:36-39, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> The flood swept them all away except Noah and the seven members of his family and the ark-load of lower animals. This foreshadowed that the war of Armageddon will sweep all mankind away except those who now come under God’s new system of things in subjection to the Greater Noah, Jesus Christ. As there were eight human survivors of the ancient global flood, so through God’s miraculous power there will be human survivors of the war of Armageddon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The opportunity to live forever on earth under God’s kingdom will be open to the Armageddon survivors of good will. Jesus Christ, the King of the new world, once said: “If anyone observes my word, he will never see death at all.” “I am the resurrection and the life. . . . and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.” (John 8:51; 11:25, 26, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> After Armageddon this principle stated by Jesus will apply to the earthly survivors of good will. They will be on an open road to everlasting life on a paradise earth. That will be one of the marvelous new things of God’s new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have been considering at length the subject: After Armageddon—God’s New World, but as a follow-up of this consideration the question now confronts us, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Before</span><span class="font4"> Armageddon—what? That is a question each one of us must settle for himself. May we settle it with the same faith and hope that the apostle Peter expressed when he said: “Awaiting and keeping close in mind the presence of the day of Jehovah, through which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved and the elements being intensely hot will melt. But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” (2 Peter 3:13, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font4"> Hence he counseled us to action </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">now!</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If by faith we are getting ready to move into the new world close at hand, it obliges us to alter our lives now while this old world yet stands. It calls for our abandoning the doomed state of things and basing our hopes upon the new system of things and now bringing ourselves into accord with it. It requires living now according to God’s righteousness, worshiping him amid an apostate Christendom and a demon-controlled heathendom. This means our not following this world’s desperate schemes, plans, arrangements and institutions for perpetuating the Devil’s world. Why should we favor keeping the Devil in power in opposition to the God of the new world? In these remarkable days Jehovah God has formed a New World society under his King Jesus Christ. The society of these witnesses of Jehovah see the need of preparing at once for the terrible finale of the old world and the victorious entry of the new world. So they are now heeding the divine advice to take the action just described. In abandoning this old world you have a refuge that God has thus provided to which to flee for safety. Associate yourself with this New World society. With it enjoy a part in spreading God’s Word .and its life-giving message, praising God’s Kingdom and New World to others and seeking out all his “other sheep” and feeding and guiding them in God’s ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Awaiting the new world, therefore, does not mean an idle waiting until the end. It means our organizing in a forward-looking way now for tackling the post-Armageddon opportunities in the new world in a unified, harmonious, co-operative and mutually helpful way, as one people, dedicated to the one God, subject to his one King, and all of us being possessors of the hope of eternal life amid new heavens and a new earth. What an exalted purpose our living, now may have in the brilliant light of Jehovah’s revealed Word! It is a true purpose that will not run afoul, but is one that will realize a sure goal, to the proving that the worshipful Creator of the new world is faithful. His promised world of new heavens and a new earth will be eternal. Prepare now for that eternity of all new things, to live in it and be forever happy. Avoid perishing with this old world in the “war of the great day of God the Almighty.” Get ready now to live after Armageddon in God’s new world!</span></p>
