<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">FOREWORD</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">M</span><span class="font8">EN want to know the reason why things are as they are. Why is the world so full of confused ideas and shifting patterns? There are so many different beliefs, so many different religions, and all of them have their followers who advocate their particular faith with greater or less zeal. What should one believe in these days? Who is right?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Sound advice is, “Make sure of all things.” That means, Go to the highest authority you can find. The highest authority is the Holy Bible, Jehovah’s Word. God’s only-begotten Son said to him: “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) But Jehovah’s advice goes even farther. This book of highest authority does not ask us to accept just one statement of truth, and that blindly; but rather God’s prophet says: “Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah.” (Isaiah 1:18) That is it! Think the answer out, search for it in the Scriptures, as the early Christians did. “They received the word with the greatest readiness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) If these early Christians were eager to check the Scriptures to find out why things were as they were, then certainly we should be just as diligent in our search for the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Do not just take someone’s word for it, but “make sure of all things; hold fast to what is right”. (1 Thessalonians 5:21) The apostle Paul said that. But now listen to what John says: “Do not believe every inspired expression, but test the inspired expressions to see whether they originate with God, because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.” (1 John 4:1) This book will help you to run to and fro through the Holy Scriptures, to do what these apostles say. The </span><span class="font5">5 </span><span class="font8">purpose of this publication is to urge you to check everything with Jehovah’s Word of truth. You will notice that all the authority given in this book for the various teachings is Scriptural, and the texts from the Bible are arranged according to different themes for your study. You can check the doctrines yourself from your own Bible, regardless of the version you use, to see ‘whether these things are so’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, when you teach others a great responsibility rests upon you. You certainly want to be sure you are right and be “always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect”. (1 Peter 3:15) The apostle Peter here had the right idea: Give a reason; give proof; make sure of your belief, and do not be mixed up with the philosophies of men. Always have the highest authority, Jehovah’s Word, backing you up. Always remember, Jesus said to his Father: “Your word is truth.” He believed it; he preached it, and he lived it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In your proclamation of the good news you should always use the Scriptures. Therefore you should study them and understand how reasonable they are “to those who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong”, by means of the Word.—Hebrews 5:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">WHAT TO DO WITH KNOWLEDGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Knowledge is too precious to keep to one’s self; so we must tell it out. Paul felt this urge; hence he said: “Woe is me if I did not declare the good news!” (1 Corinthians 9:16) Jehovah’s Word is so full of good news; if only we knew all of it! It is not enough for those who know the good news merely to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">wish</span><span class="font8"> others knew it; it is for them to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">see</span><span class="font8"> to it that others know it. That is why Jesus said, ‘Go therefore, and teach.’ (Matthew 28:19, 20) Wishing never gives knowledge; but your talking, preaching and proclaiming the good news to others will certainly spread knowledge, and it must be the right kind of knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Paul told the young man Timothy: “Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching.” Timothy was interested in gaining everlasting life, and he knew the need of reading the Scriptures, following their teachings and preaching them in order to become mature. In this way his perceptive powers would be trained so as to distinguish between right and wrong teaching, as everything must be in agreement with God’s Word. Paul, as a wise counselor, advised Timothy to pay constant attention to his teaching, that is, what he was telling others. Today you should be sure what you say is in line with Jehovah’s Word of truth. Never get lax in taking in knowledge; and as you take it in, also give it out in the same unadulterated way that you receive it, because it will save both you and those who listen to you.—1 Timothy 4:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We must give the knowledge we have to others. We cannot selfishly store it up within ourselves forever. There is great pleasure in taking in knowledge and learning new things, making them our own, as we receive them from the Giver of all good and perfect gifts. But is it not true that “counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out”? (Proverbs 20:5) The witnesses of Jehovah and all lovers of righteousness want to draw out from their understanding of God’s Word and give it to others. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font8"> will be a great aid to every user of it to draw out the truth so others can have it freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">HOW TO USE IT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font8"> sets forth seventy principal themes and gives you a balanced picture or rounded-out coverage by answering the outstanding questions and objections on each of these themes just by using scriptures from the Bible. This publication is not a commentary on the Bible, but it brings together the many scriptures having to do with the theme under discussion. It will prove to be a convenient Bible aid to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This book does not take the place of the Bible nor does it try to limit the application of the texts cited to the various themes under which they appear. But the purpose of the book is to put pure Bible truth into the mind of the teacher and to let the Bible speak for itself. It should help the user to be more effective in his use of the Bible in every feature of his preaching activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Door-to-Door Witnessing: </span><span class="font6">The apostles preached “publicly and from house to house”. (Acts 20:20) As you do that, carry this handy book with you. It will not take you long to get acquainted with the seventy themes. Hundreds of different questions can very easily be answered by you as you go about preaching the good news of the Kingdom just by being acquainted with these themes. You always want to give a Scriptural answer. With the aid of this small handbook your presentation of the truth from house to house will always be fresh, versatile and adaptable. If an argument arises on any Bible question, you can always turn to “Subjects for Study” on page 406 and you will be able to find just the scriptures you need. You will find </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font6"> a ready aid in “announcing Jehovah’s kingdom”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Back-Calls: </span><span class="font6">When you meet an interested person at his home, make another visit soon. Call back, because your logical, coherent conversation is needed to arouse interest in the truth and to lead the interested person into a deeper consideration of the Bible truths with the help of Watch Tower publications based on these truths. On these revisits when presenting the publications of the Watch Tower Society to the people and showing the need of reading them, it is necessary for you first to clear out objections that exist in the mind of the person before it is possible to start a Bible study. Do not push such questions aside, but answer them </span><span class="font5">(Continued on page 404)</span></p>

For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. Though while he lived he blessed his soul (and men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself).

For the promise is to you and to your children and to all those afar off, just as many as Jehovah our God may call to him.’ Therefore those who embraced his word heartily were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.”</span></p>

They said: ‘Cornelius, an army officer,... was given divine instructions by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear the things you have to say.’... Cornelius said: ‘... a man in bright raiment stood before me and said: “Cornelius, your prayer has been favorably heard and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God. Send, therefore, to Joppa and call for Simon who is surnamed Peter.” ’... At this Peter opened his mouth and said: ‘For a certainty I perceive that God is not partial, but in every nation the man that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.’ While Peter was yet speaking about these matters the holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word. And the faithful ones that had come with Peter who were of those circumcised were amazed, because the free gift of the holy spirit was being poured out also upon people of the nations.... Then Peter responded: ‘Can anyone forbid water so that these might not be baptized who have received the holy spirit even as we have?’ With that he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 11:15-18 </span><span class="font6">‘‘But when I started to speak the holy spirit fell upon them just as it did also upon us originally. At this I called to mind the saying of the Lord, how he used to say: ‘John, on the one hand, baptized with water, but you will be baptized in holy spirit.' If, therefore, God gave the same free gift to them as he also did to us who have believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I should be able to hinder God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 15:7 </span><span class="font6">“Peter rose and said to them: ‘Brothers, you well know that from early days God made the choice among you that through my mouth people of the nations should hear the word of the good news and believe.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Bible is Jehovah God’s written word to mankind, revealing himself and expressing his purpose. Jehovah, as the Author, Inspired at least thirty-five different faithful men to write. Although the complete Bible is itself one book it is actually a library of sixty-six books, thirty-nine having been originally written in Hebrew and Aramaic and properly designated collectively the Hebrew-Aramaic Scriptures, and the other twenty-seven having been originally written in Greek and properly designated collectively the Christian Greek Scriptures. The writing of the entire Bible covered the period from 1513 B.C. to A.D. 98 of’ 99. The English word Bible is from the Greek word, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bibli'a,</span><span class="font6"> meaning “papyrus scrolls, rolls, volumes, books” or, literally, “small papyri or booklets.”</span></p>

He hath showed his people the power of his works, in giving them the heritage of the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:20 </span><span class="font6">“For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”</span></p>

You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly-prophesied about you, when he said: “This people honors me with their lips, yet their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep paying respect to me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” ’ ” [See Isaiah 29:13.]</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 24:27, 44, 45 </span><span class="font6">“And commencing at Moses and all the Prophets he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures. He now said to them: ‘These are my words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things written in the law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms about me must be fulfilled.’ Then he opened up their minds fully to grasp the meaning of the Scriptures ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 16:6, 12 </span><span class="font6">“Jesus said to them: ‘Be on the alert and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ Then they grasped that he said to watch out .. . for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Followers of tradition become persecutors of Jesus’ true followers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 1:13, 14 </span><span class="font6">“You, of course, heard about my conduct formerly in Judaism, that to the point of excess I kept on persecuting the congregation of God and devastating it, and I was making greater progress in Judaism than many of my own age in my race, as I was far more zealous for the traditions of my fathers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paul warned against religious tradition</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Col. 2:8 “Look out: perhaps there may be some man that will carry you off as his prey through the philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary things of the world and not according to Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gal. 1:7-9 “There are certain ones who are disturbing you and wanting to pervert the good news about the Christ. However, even if we or an angel out of heaven were to declare to you as good news something beyond what we declared to you as good news, let him be accursed. As we have said above, I also now say again, Whoever it is that is declaring to you as good news something beyond what you accepted, let him be accursed.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Acts 17:10, 11 “Immediately by night the brothers sent both Paul and Silas out to Beroea, and these, following their arrival, went into the synagogue of the Jews. Now the latter were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with the greatest readiness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Peter always turned hearers and readers to God’s written word</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 Pet. 1:25 “ ‘The word spoken by Jehovah endures forever.’ Well, this is the ‘word spoken’, this which has been declared to you as good news.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2 Pet. 1:19; 2:1; 3:1, 2 “Consequently, we have the prophetic word made more firm, and you are doing well in paying attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until day dawns and a daystar rises, in your hearts.” “However, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.” “I am arousing your clear thinking faculties by way of a reminder, that you should remember the words previously spoken by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.&quot;</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark147"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark148"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">A theory or system of social organization based on the holding of all property in common, actual ownership being ascribed to the community as a whole or to the state. In practice today, it is a system in which all economic, educational, religious and political activity is conducted or directed by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party. The state as the superior tends to make its subjects as inferiors totally dependent upon the state. Although claiming to be godless, in some instances screened religions are permitted to operate subservient to the state. Communism itself has become and constitutes a false religion preached around the world, for the reason that it arrogates to itself authorities belonging to God and causes the people to look to the state for salvation and to worship it, instead of God.</span></p>

This whole procedure is usually called, from one of its parts, ‘confession’; ... it is a judicial process in which the penitent is at once the accuser, the person accused, and the witness, while the priest pronounces judgment and sentence,... the confession is made not in the secrecy of the penitent’s heart nor to a layman as friend and advocate, nor to a representative of human authority, but to a duly ordained priest with requisite jurisdiction and with the ‘power of the keys’, i.e., the power to forgive sins which Christ granted to his church.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font6"> 1911, Vol. XI, pages 618, 619.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Israelite Priests Had to Admit Their Own Sins Before God and</span></p>

These things stand as a symbolic drama; for these women mean two covenants, the one from mount Sinai, which brings forth children for slavery, and which is Hagar. Now this Hagar means Sinai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children....

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Its Purpose</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 15:14 </span><span class="font6">“Symeon has related thoroughly how God for the first time turned his attention to the nations to take out of them a people for his name.”</span></p>

And they will by no means teach every man his fellow citizen and every man his brother, saying: ‘Know Jehovah,’ because they will all know me, from the least to the greatest of them. For I shall be merciful to their unrighteous deeds and I will by no means call their sins to mind any more.” ’ In his saying ‘a new covenant’ he has made the former one obsolete. Now that which is made obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.”</span></p>

And tongues as if of fire became visible and were distributed to them, and one sat upon each one of them, and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance. . . Peter . . . raised his voice ... ‘These people are, in fact, not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day. On the contrary, this is what was said through the prophet Joel, “ ‘And in the last days,’ God says, ‘I shall pour some of my spirit out upon every kind of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams.’ ” ’ Peter said to them: ‘Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.’ ”</span></p>

For if the code administering condemnation was glorious, much more does the</span></p>

In fact, even that which has once been made glorious has been stripped of glory in this respect, because of the glory that excels it. For if that which was to be done away with was brought in with glory, much more would that which remains be with glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heb. 12:22-26 “But you have approached a mount Zion and a city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and myriads of angels, in general assembly, and the congregation of the firstborn who have been enrolled in the heavens, and God the Judge of all, and the spiritual lives of righteous ones who have been made perfect, and Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and the blood of sprinkling which speaks in a better way than Abel’s blood. See that you do not implore him not to speak. For if they did not escape who implored him not to give divine warning upon earth, much more shall we not if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens. At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, saying: ‘Yet once more I will set not only the earth but also the heaven in commotion.’ ”</span></p>

And the men of Ai... chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them at the descent: and the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.... And Jehovah said ... Israel hath sinned; yea, they have even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: yea, they have even taken of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also; and they have even put it among their own stuff. Therefore the children of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they are become accursed: I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the devoted thing from among you.... And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned against Jehovah, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonish mantle, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. . . . And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? Jehovah shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">DEDICATION. </span><span class="font6">An act by which a person or thing is initiated into some way, course or use. Christian dedication is the act of a person in setting himself apart by solemn agreement, unreservedly and unconditionally, to do the will of Jehovah God through Christ Jesus, as that will is set forth in the Bible, being made plain by God’s holy spirit. It means one must live a holy life, separate from this world, and serve God henceforth to eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSECRATION. </span><span class="font6">As used in the Hebrew Scriptures, literally, to “fill the hand”, to put full power into the hand of those who are to serve in a priestly office. Installation into the priesthood. To Christians it is God’s act of installing them as priests of God under the great consecrated High Priest, Christ, and empowering them to act as such. It applies only to Christ and the anointed, spirit-begotten members of his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">SANCTIFICATION. </span><span class="font6">A setting apart for God’s holy purpose or use. God sanctifies his spirit-begotten ones by means of his holy spirit and word of truth. They become God’s “holy nation”, a people for</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 14:27 </span><span class="font6">“Whoever is not carrying his torture stake and coming after me cannot be my disciple.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 47:19, 20, 25 </span><span class="font6">“Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate. So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; ... And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">One Must Be Drawn to God by</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:37, 41 </span><span class="font6">“Now when they heard this they were stabbed to the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: ‘Brothers, what shall we do?’ Therefore those who embraced his word heartily were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 3:19, 20 </span><span class="font6">“Repent, therefore, and turn around so as to get your sins blotted out, that seasons of refreshing may come from the person of Jehovah and that he may send forth the Christ appointed for you, Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cost of Dedication Must First Be Calculated</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 14:28-33 </span><span class="font6">“For example, who of you that wants to build a tower does not first sit down and figure out the expense, to see if he has enough to complete it? Otherwise, he might lay its foundation but not have the funds to finish it, and all the onlookers might start to ridicule him, saying: ‘This man started to build but had not the funds to finish.’ Or what king, marching to meet another king in war does not first sit down and take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand troops to cope with the one that comes against him with twenty thousand? If, in fact, he cannot do so, then while that one is yet far away he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace. Thus, you may be sure, none of you that does not say good-bye to all his belongings can be my disciple.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dedication Is Followed by Water Baptism</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 10:47, 48 </span><span class="font6">“Then Peter responded: ‘Can anyone forbid water so that these might not be baptized who have received the holy spirit even as we have?’ With that he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 16:30-33 </span><span class="font6">“And he brought them outside and said: ‘Sirs, what must I do to get saved?’ They said: ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus and you will get saved, you and your household.’ And they spoke the word of Jehovah to him together with all those in his house. And he took them along in that hour of the night and bathed their stripes, and, one and all, he and his were baptized without delay.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prayerful, Sincere Dedication Is Accepted by Jehovah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 10:3-5, 30, 31, 44 </span><span class="font6">“Just about the ninth hour of the day he saw plainly in a vision an angel of God come in to him and say to him: ‘Cornelius!’ The man gazed at him and, becoming frightened, said: ‘What is it, Lord?’ He said to him: ‘Your prayers and gifts of mercy have ascended as a remembrance before God. So now send men to Joppa and summon a certain Simon who is surnamed Peter.’ Accordingly Cornelius said: ‘Four days ago counting from this hour I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, when, look! a man in bright raiment stood before me and said: “Cornelius, your prayer has been favorably heard and your gifts of mercy have been remembered before God.” ’ While Peter was yet speaking about these matters the holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Sam. 1:9-28 </span><span class="font6">“So Hannah rose up ... And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto Jehovah, and wept sore. And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.... And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her; and it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bare a son; and she called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of Jehovah.. .. For this child I prayed; and Jehovah hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore also I have granted him to Jehovah; as long as he liveth he is granted to Jehovah.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Examples of Dedication</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:5-7 </span><span class="font6">“Hence when he comes into the world he says: ‘You did not desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body for me. You did not approve of whole burnt-offerings and sin offering.’ Then I said, ‘Look! I am come (in the roll of the book it is written about me) to do your will, O God.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Heb. 11:24, 25 “By faith Moses, when grown up, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pharaoh, choosing to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dedication Must Be Faithfully Carried Out</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:31, 32 </span><span class="font6">“Without understanding, false to agreements, having no natural affection, merciless. Although these know full well the righteous decree of God, that those practicing such things are deserving of death, they not only keep on doing them but also approve those practicing them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eccl. 5:2, 4-6 </span><span class="font6">“Be not rash with thy mouth and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou vowest. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 1:27; 2:17, 24 </span><span class="font6">“The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.” “Thus, too, faith, if it does not have works, is dead in itself. You see that a man is to be declared righteous by works, and not by faith alone.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSECRATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">It Is God Who Consecrates</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 3:13-17 </span><span class="font6">“Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him. But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: ‘I am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?’ In reply Jesus said to him: ‘Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carry out all that is righteous.’ Then he quit preventing him. After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and, look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him. Look! also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 5:4-6 </span><span class="font6">“Also a man takes this honor, not of his own accord, but only when he is called by God, just as Aaron also was. So, too, the Christ did not glorify himself by becoming a high priest, but was glorified by him who spoke with reference to him: ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father.’ Just as he says also in another place: ‘You are a priest forever after the likeness of Melchizedek.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 7:28 </span><span class="font6">“For the Law appoints men high priests having weakness, but the word of the sworn oath that came after the Law appoints a Son, who is perfected forever.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Lev. 8:22-24 “And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. And he brought Aaron’s sons; and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The Devil—a mighty spirit person, an angel. Originally a righteous cherub of God’s creation by means of the Word, the First-begotten Son of God. He was not created a devil or Satan, but made himself such by his rebellion against Almighty God. He was the beginner and introducer of sin in the universe, and is extremely wicked, the great enemy of God and all his righteous creatures. Sentenced to death at the time of his rebellion, but permitted to remain in order that God’s supremacy might be proved. He will be abyssed at Armageddon by Christ Jesus, and finally annihilated at the end of Christ’s millennial reign. Also known as Satan. A false, mimic god.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Originally a Righteous Creature of God—Placed as Protectorate over Adam and Eve in Eden</span></p>

Thou wast the anointed cherub that covereth: and I set thee, so that thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.”</span></p>

But each one is tried by being drawn out and enticed by his own desire. Then the desire, when it has become fertile, gives birth to sin; in turn, sin, when it has been accomplished, brings forth death.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ezek. 28:15, 16 </span><span class="font6">“Thou wast </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">per</span><span class="font6">fect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till unrighteousness was found in thee.

That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Job 1:9-11; 2:3-5 </span><span class="font6">“Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Job </span><span class="font6">fear God for nought?

<p><span class="font6">“And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.

<h3><a name="bookmark206"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark207"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The teaching that life spontaneously sprang from inanimate matter and that the higher life forms came about by gradual (or sudden) changes in lower organism; that this accounts for not only the varieties, but also for the different “kinds”. No Creator exists, according to this theory. Some evolutionists believe God created some primitive forms, but evolution, as above described, brought about changes that led to the present-day higher forms; this denies special creation of the various “kinds”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“Kind”: A family or group of living creatures or things that are interfertile among themselves, but not fertile with others outside their family. (That is, whose sex cells will unite to form, or begin to form, an offspring; but with those of another “kind.” or family are absolutely incompatible and unable to unite.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">An Evolutionist’s Description of the Theory</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The theory of evolution asserts that (1) the beings now living have descended from different beings which have lived in the past; (2) the discontinuous variation observed at our time level —the gaps now existing between clusters of forms—have arisen gradually, so that if we could assemble all the individuals which have ever inhabited the earth, a fairly continuous array of forms would emerge; (3) all these changes have arisen from causes which now continue to be in operation and which therefore can be studied experimentally.&quot; —Theodosius Dobzhansky, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Genetics and the Origin of Species, </span><span class="font6">pp. 7, 8.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark211"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark212"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">“Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.” (Heb. 11:1) Faith is an intellectual understanding and appreciation of God’s Word and a confident reliance upon that Word. The true “Christian faith” is the sum of beliefs concerning Jehovah God and his kingdom as delivered to us by his chosen Seed, Jesus Christ, and his inspired disciples. It is based upon the ancient Hebrew Scriptures, to which Jesus constantly made reference to support what he taught and to which later the inspired Greek Scriptures were added as a source of accurate knowledge for developing faith.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 10:13, 14 </span><span class="font6">“For ‘anyone that calls upon the name of Jehovah will be saved’. However, how will they call upon him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach?”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 5:1, 2 </span><span class="font6">“Now that we have been declared righteous as a result of faith, let us enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have gained our approach by faith into this undeserved kindness in which we now stand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 4:13 </span><span class="font6">“For it was not through law that Abraham or his seed had the promise that he should be heir of a world, but it was through the righteousness by faith.”</span></p>

But God raised him up from the dead, of which fact we are witnesses. Consequently, his name, by our faith in his name, has made this man strong whom you behold and know, and the faith that is through him has given the man this complete soundness in the sight of all of you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Tim. 3:16 </span><span class="font6">“Indeed, the sacred secret of this godly devotion is admittedly great: ‘He was made manifest in flesh, was declared righteous in spirit, appeared to angels, was preached about among nations, was believed upon in the world, was received up in glory.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 1:6, 7 </span><span class="font6">“You have been grieved by various trials, in order that the tested quality of your faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark217"></a>Freedom</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark218"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark219"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">In its broadest sense and as used in the Bible and in the field of government it means merely “acting at will”. It is the acting and the performance of acts freely according to one’s will, with or without restraints, for the general welfare. The subject of freedom involves the faculty of “free will”, which God as Creator Superior has given to angels and men so that they can conduct themselves voluntarily in a way pleasing to their Maker. It is this field of “free will” action wherein governments, both theocratic and man-made, grant controlled liberties and freedoms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah as Sovereign Superior Solely Enjoys Absolute Freedom; Acts at Will Without Restraint.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">He Alone Is Independent</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 40:13, 15 </span><span class="font6">“Who hath directed the spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him? Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 9:20, 21 “O </span><span class="font6">man, who, then, really are you to be answering back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him that molded it, ‘Why did you make me this way?’ What? Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for an honorable use, another for a dishonorable use?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 45:11, 12, Mo </span><span class="font6">“And would you question me about the future? would you dictate </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to me </span><span class="font6">about my work? says the Eternal [Jehovah, AS], Israel’s Maker, Israel’s Majestic One, I, I who made the earth, I who created man on earth, I who stretched out the heavens with my own hands, I who ordered all their host!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah a God of Freedom; His Organization Dwells in Climate of Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 3:17 </span><span class="font6">“Now Jehovah is the spirit; and where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 4:25, 26 </span><span class="font6">“Now this Hagar means Sinai, a mountain in Arabia, and she corresponds with the Jerusalem today, for she is in slavery with her children. But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man Made in God’s Image</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Granted Climate of Freedom, a Vast Field of Freewill Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 1:26, 28-30 “And </span><span class="font6">God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creep-eth upon the earth. ... and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food: and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for food: and it was so.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Perfect Man’s Original Freedom Relative. Restricted by Law for Man’s Good</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 2:16, 17 </span><span class="font6">“And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man Loses Original Freedom, Enters Slavery of Sin and Death. He Went Beyond the Bounds of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">His Safe Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 3:11, 12, 17-19 </span><span class="font6">“Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toll shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rom. 5:12 “Just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 8:21 </span><span class="font6">“The creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lev. 25:10 </span><span class="font6">“And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 49:8, 9 </span><span class="font6">“Thus saith Jehovah, In an acceptable time have I answered thee, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to make them inherit the desolate heritages; saying to them that are bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mosaic Law Foreshadows Redemption from Slavery by a Near Kinsman</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lev. 25:47, 48 </span><span class="font6">“And if a stranger or sojourner with thee be waxed rich, and thy brother be waxed poor beside him, and sell himself unto the stranger ... after that he is sold he may be redeemed; one of his brethren may redeem him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ Jesus, the “Son of Man”, Is Man's Kinsman, Redeemer, Liberator</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 1:14 </span><span class="font6">“So the Word became flesh and resided among us, and we had a view of his glory, a glory such as belongs to an only-begotten son from a father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 20:28 </span><span class="font6">“Just as the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Tim. 2:5, 6 </span><span class="font6">&quot;For there is one God. and one mediator between God and men, a man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all—this is what is to be witnessed to at its own particular times.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 8:36 </span><span class="font6">“If the Son sets you free, you will be actually free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rom. 5:18, 19 “As through one trespass the result to men of all kinds was condemnation, likewise also through one act of justification the result to men of all kinds is a declaring of them righteous for life. For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were constituted sinners, likewise also through the obedience of the one person many will be constituted righteous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Accepted Bible Truth as to Christ Leads to Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 8:31, 32 </span><span class="font6">“If you remain in my word, you are really my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:1 </span><span class="font6">“For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 6:18 </span><span class="font6">“Since you were set free from sin, you became slaves to righteousness.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 4:18 </span><span class="font6">“Jehovah’s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor, he sent me forth to preach a release to the captives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christians Now Set Free from Bondage of False Religion and</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Col. 1:13, 14 </span><span class="font6">“He delivered us from the authority of the darkness and transplanted us into the kingdom of the Son of his love, by means of whom we have our release by ransom, the forgiveness of our sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Beware of Those Falsely Offering Freedom and Endeavoring to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Destroy Our Christian Relative Freedom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 2:18-20 </span><span class="font6">“For they utter swelling expressions of no profit, and by the desires of the flesh and by loose habits they entice those who are just escaping from people who conduct themselves in error. While they are promising them freedom, they themselves are existing as slaves of corruption. For whoever is overcome by another is enslaved by this one. Certainly if, after having escaped from the defilements of the world by an accurate knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they get involved again with these very things and are overcome, the final conditions have become worse for them than the first.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 2:4 </span><span class="font6">“But because of the false brothers brought in quietly, who sneaked in to spy upon our freedom which we have in union with Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow the Kingly “Law of Freedom”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 1:25 </span><span class="font6">“He who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and who persists in it, this man, because he has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, will be happy in his doing it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 2:12, 13 </span><span class="font6">“Keep on speaking in such a way and keep on doing in such a way as those do who are going to be judged by the law of a free people. For the one that does not practice mercy will have his judgment without mercy. Mercy exults triumphantly over judgment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 2:8, 9 </span><span class="font6">“If, now, you practice carrying out the kingly law according to the Scriptures, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself,’ you are doing quite well. But if you continue showing favoritism, you are working a sin, for you are reproved by the law as transgressors.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Things to the New Christian System</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:22 </span><span class="font6">“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man publicly shown by God to you through powerful works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 4:11-16 </span><span class="font6">“And he gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as missionaries, some as shepherds and teachers, with a view to the training of the holy ones for ministerial work, for the building up of the body of the Christ, until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God, to a full-grown man, to the measure of growth that belongs to the fullness of the Christ; in order that we should no longer be babes, tossed about as by waves and carried hither and thither by every wind of teaching by means of the trickery of men, by means of craftiness in contriving error. But speaking the truth, let us by love grow up in all things into him who is the head, Christ. From him all the body, by being harmoniously joined together and being made to cooperate through every joint which gives what is needed, according to the functioning of each respective member in due measure, makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 14:21-25 “In </span><span class="font6">the law it is written: ‘With the tongues of foreigners and with the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and yet not even then will they give heed to me,’ says Jehovah. Consequently, tongues </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">for a sign, not to the believers, but to the unbelievers, whereas prophesying is, not for the unbelievers, but for the believers. Therefore, if the whole congregation conies together to one place and they all speak in tongues, but ordinary people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are mad? But if you are all prophesying and any unbeliever or ordinary person conies in, he is put right by them ail, he is closely examined by all, the secrets of his heart become manifest, so that he will prostrate himself and worship God, declaring, ‘God is really among you.’ ”</span></p>

But whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will be done away with. For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially; but when that which is complete arrives, that which is partial will be done away with. When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe. For at present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face to face. At present I know partially, but then I shall know accurately even as I am accurately known. Now, however, there remain faith, hope, love, these three, but the greatest of these is love.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 12:12-26 </span><span class="font6">“For just as the body is one thing but has many members, and all the members of that body, although being many, are one body, so also is the Christ.... For the body, indeed, is not one member, but is many. If the foot should say: ‘Because I am not </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> hand, I am no part of the body,’ it is not for this reason no part of the body. And if the ear should say: ‘Because I am not an eye, I am no part of the body,’ it is not for this reason no part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the smelling be? But now God has set the members in the body, each one of them, just as he pleased. If they were all one member, where would the body be? But now they are many members, yet one body. The eye cannot say to the hand: ‘I have no need of you’; or, again, the head cannot say to the feet: ‘I have no need of you.’ But much rather is it the case that the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary, and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we surround with more abundant honor, and so our unseemly parts have the more abundant comeliness, whereas our comely parts do not need anything. Nevertheless, God compounded the body, giving honor more abundant to the part which had a lack, so that there should be no division in the body, but that its members should have the same care for one another.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The restoration of the spiritually or physically sick ones to good health. A special gift of the holy spirit given by Jehovah God to certain ones before Christ and also in the early congregation that enabled the gifted one to perform miraculous cures of physical sickness and even raise the dead. It was used as a sign of God’s power usually performed on those outside the congregation. Like all special gifts of the spirit from and after Pentecost, A.D. 33, it was administered by Jesus Christ through the twelve apostles or in their presence. At the apostles’ death it was impossible to pass on this special gift to others, and it therefore ceased.</span></p>

He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?’ But Jesus, having discerned immediately by his spirit that they were reasoning that way in themselves, said to them: ‘Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven,” or to say, &quot;Get up and pick up your cot and walk”? But in order for you men to know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins upon the earth,’ —he said to the paralytic: ‘I say to you, Get up, pick up your cot, and go to your home.’ At that he did get up and immediately picked up his cot and walked out in front of them all, so that they were all simply carried away and they glorified God, saying: ‘We never saw the like of it.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ Disciples Also Had Special Gift to Forgive and Retain Sins, Which Modern “Divine Healing” Impostors Lack</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 20:21-23 </span><span class="font6">“Jesus, therefore, said to them again: ‘May you have peace. Just as the Father has sent me forth, I also am sending you.’ And after he said this he blew upon them and said to them: ‘Receive holy spirit. If you forgive the sins of any persons, they stand forgiven to them; if you retain those of any persons, they stand retained.' ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 9:17, 18 </span><span class="font6">“So Ananias went off and entered into the house, and he laid his hands upon him and said: ‘Saul, brother, the Lord, the Jesus that appeared to you on the road over which you were coming, has sent me forth in order that you may recover sight and be filled with holy spirit.’ And immediately there fell from his eyes what looked like scales, and he recovered sight.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 13:9-12 </span><span class="font6">“Saul, who is also Paul, becoming filled with holy spirit, looked at him intently and said: ‘... look! Jehovah’s hand is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sunlight for a period of time.’ Instantly a thick mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went around seeking men to lead him by the hand.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Also: </span><span class="font6">Acts 5:1-11; “Sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">James Speaks of Forgiveness of Sins Leading to Spiritual, Not Physical, Sickness—Otherwise All Sinners Would Be Seriously Sick Bodily</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jas. 5:13-16 “Is there anyone suffering evil among you? Let him carry on prayer. Is there anyone in good spirits? Let him sing psalms. Is there anyone sick among you? Let him call the older men of the congregation to him., and let them pray over him, rubbing him with oil in the name of Jehovah. And the prayer of faith will make the indisposed one well, and Jehovah will raise him up. Also if he has committed sins. it will be forgiven him. Therefore openly confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may get healed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Deut. 9:16-20 “And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against Jehovah your God; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which Jehovah had commanded you.... And I fell down before Jehovah, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.... But Jehovah hearkened unto me that time also.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rubbing with oil shows application of God’s healing word in correction</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 133:1, 2 </span><span class="font6">“Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard; that came down upon the skirt of his garment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 141:5 </span><span class="font6">“Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head; let not my head refuse it: for even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Example of Elijah’s prayer was occasion of spiritual sickness in Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jas. 5:16-18 “A righteous man's supplication when it is at work has much force. Elijah was a man with feelings like ours, and yet in prayer he prayed for it not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the land put forth its fruit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 Ki. 16:29-33; 17:1; 18:1, 36. 37, 45 “Ahab the son of Omri [began] to reign over Israel: . . . And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah . . . And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. And Ahab made the Ashe-rah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Jehovah, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.” “And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As Jehovah, the God of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.” “And it came to pass, after many days, that the word of Jehovah came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show thyself unto Ahab; and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">will send rain upon the earth. . . . Elijah the prophet came near, and said,.. . Hear me, O Jehovah, hear me, that this people may know that thou, Jehovah, art God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again. And it came to pass in a little while, that the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spiritual sickness is result of being misled from truth. Turning back saves from death</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 5:19, 20 </span><span class="font6">“My brothers, if anyone among you is misled from the truth and another turns him back, know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 18:15 </span><span class="font6">“Moreover, if your brother commits a sin, go lay bare his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Tim. 4:16 </span><span class="font6">“Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Stay by these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark237"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark238"></a>Healing Powers Were Given as a Sign to Outsiders</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 4:25-27 </span><span class="font6">“For instance, I tell you in truth, There &quot;were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, so that a great famine fell upon all the land, yet Elijah was sent to none of those women, but only to Zarephath in the land of Zidon to a widow. Also there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the man of Syria was.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Purpose of Healing Was Not to Cure Those Close to Gifted One</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 2:25-30 &quot;He </span><span class="font6">fell sick nearly to the point of death; but God had mercy on him, in fact, not only on him, but also on me, that I should not get grief upon grief.. .. On account of the Lord’s work he came quite near to death, exposing his soul to danger, that he might fully make up for your not being here to render private service to me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 4:20. “I </span><span class="font6">left Trophimus sick at Miletus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul’s One Exception Was to Free Himself from Blame Due to Accident</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 20:7-12 </span><span class="font6">“Paul began discoursing to them, as he was going to depart the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight. . . . Seated at the window, a certain young man named Eu-tychus fell into a deep sleep while Paul kept talking on, and, collapsing from sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. But Paul went downstairs, threw himself upon him and embraced him and said: ‘Stop raising a clamor, for his soul is in him.’ ... So they took the boy away alive and were comforted beyond measure.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark239"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark240"></a>Healing Powers Were Not Used by the Gifted One on Self</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 4:23, 24 </span><span class="font6">“At this he said to them: ‘No doubt you will apply this illustration to me, “Physician, cure yourself”; the things we heard as having happened in Capernaum do also here in your native territory.’ But he said: ‘Certainly I tell you that no prophet is accepted in his native territory.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark 6:30-33 </span><span class="font6">“And the apostles assembled before Jesus and reported to him all the things they had done and taught. And he said to them: ‘Come, you yourselves, privately into a lonely place and rest up a bit.’ For there were many coming and going, and it was not convenient even to eat a meal. So off they went In the boat for a lonely place to themselves. But people saw them going and many got to know it, and from all the cities they ran there together on foot and got ahead of them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Elisha had great healing powers, but died of sickness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2 Ki. 4:32-35 &quot;And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto Jehovah. And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon him: and the flesh of the child waxed warm.... and the child opened his eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Ki. 5:9, 10, 14 </span><span class="font6">“So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Ki. 13:14, 20, 21 </span><span class="font6">“Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paul’s gift of healing did not enable him to cure himself</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 12:7-9 </span><span class="font6">“Therefore, that I might not be overly exalted, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satan, to keep striking me, that I might not be overly exalted. In this behalf I three times entreated the Lord that it might depart from me; and yet he really said to me: ‘My undeserved kindness is sufficient for you; for my power is being made perfect in weakness.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Natural Means of Healing Were Used Even at Time Gift</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Receiving Pay or Taking a Money Collection Not Permitted Those Who Practiced Divine Healing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Ki. 5:15-27 </span><span class="font6">“And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him; and he said, Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant. But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.. .. But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold my master hath spared this Naaman the Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. So Gehazi followed after Naaman.... And Naaman said, Be pleased to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.... But he [Gehazi] went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him,... Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards and vineyards, and sheep and oxen, and men-servants and maid-servants? The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Divine Healing as the FifthRate Gift Not the Evidence of God’s True Organization Today, but Love and Gift of Preaching Are</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 14:1 </span><span class="font6">“Pursue love, yet keep striving after the spiritual gifts, but preferably that you may prophesy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:17, 18 “ </span><span class="font6">‘And in the last days,’ God says, ‘I shall pour some of my spirit out upon every kind of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams; and even upon my men slaves and upon my women slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.’ ”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark248"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark249"></a>Hell</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark250"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark251"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">False religion teaches that hell is a place where the wicked suffer a twofold punishment: the pain of loss, and the pain of sense. The pain of loss consists in the eternal separation of the sinner from God and the realization that the failure to reach heaven is due to his own fault. The pain of sense consists in the torment of unquenchable fire. It is claimed that the body by itself is incapable of pain; it is the soul that suffers. [See “Soul”.] This unreasonable doctrine contradicts the Bible, the truth of which has been confused by misrepresenting in translation the original meaning of three distinct Greek words and one Hebrew word. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Sheol,</span><span class="font6"> Hebrew, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hades, </span><span class="font6">Greek, were originally used by Bible writers to represent gravedom or the common grave of mankind. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Gehenna,</span><span class="font6"> Greek, was used as a symbol of annihilation or everlasting death in unconsciousness from which there was to be no awakening. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Tartaros,</span><span class="font6"> Greek, meant a degraded or debased condition only for rebellious spirit creatures during their conscious lifetime with the certainty of annihilation awaiting them at the time of their execution. These original words have been indiscriminately translated “hell”, “hell-fire,” “grave,” “pit” and “death”. The English word “hell” is taken from the Anglo-Saxon, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">helan,</span><span class="font6"> literally meaning “to conceal”. Hence the English word “hell”, to conform with the original expression of the condition for the dead and according to its own original meaning, Scripturally applies to gravedom, the common grave of all mankind, good and bad alike, in an unconscious state without suffering or pleasure. After Jesus introduced the truth about life and immortality, only the willfully wicked were spoken of as being in Gehenna, the expression </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Hades </span><span class="font6">[translated “hell” in English] being applied to the dead in God’s memory, those with opportunity or hope of a resurrection.</span></p>

Then Herod secretly summoned the astrologers and carefully ascertained from them the time of the star’s appearing, and, when sending them to Bethlehem, he said: ‘Go make a careful search for the young child, and when you have found it report back to me.’... and, look! the star they had seen when they were in the east went ahead of them, until it came to a stop above where the young child was. .. . However, because they were given divine warning in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew to their country by another route.. .. Then Herod, seeing he had been outwitted by the astrologers, fell into a great rage, and he sent out and had all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts killed, from two years of age and under, according to the time that he had carefully ascertained from the astrologers.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark267"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark268"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Speaking generally, it is the veneration, excessive love, worship or adoration of any made image, idol, representation or symbol of anything, whether the idol is material or fancied in the mind. According to the Scriptures idolatry is a snare of the Devil and its practice is demonism. It is considered an abomination in God’s sight. Idolatry is generally practiced toward a real or supposed higher power, whether it is believed to have animate existence (as a human or animal god or “saint”) or whether it is inanimate (as a force or object of nature or a government or any other organization). It usually involves some form, ceremony or ritual. It exacts devotion. However, idolatry can be self-worship, worship of one’s family or ancestry, or any other human or even an animal without any made representation. It is sometimes claimed that what is worshiped is not the image itself, but what is represented by the image. This is relative worship. All Idolatry, whether relative or actual, is </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">false worship.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Stubbornness and Rebellion Against God Is Self-Worship and Idolatry</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Sam. 15:22-24, 30 </span><span class="font6">“Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Practice of Idolatry Brought Punishment from God</span></p>

Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Jehovah was against them for evil, as Jehovah had spoken, and as Jehovah had sworn unto them.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Willful Rebellion and Stubbornness of Religious Leaders in Jesus’ Day Was Idolatry That</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Brought Such Desolation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 15:1-3, 7-9 </span><span class="font6">“Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying: ‘Why is it your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times?’... In reply he said to them: ‘Why is it you also overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition? You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you, when he said: “This people honors me with their lips, yet their hearts are far removed from me.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Idolatry Specifically Forbidden to Christians</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 10:7, 14 </span><span class="font6">“Neither become idolaters, as some of them did; just as it is written: ‘The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up to revel boisterously.’ Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Those Practicing Are a Reproach to God and Make Liars</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of Themselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:22, 23, 25 </span><span class="font6">“Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed creatures and creeping things. Even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Meat Sacrificed to Idols Could Be Eaten, After Its Dedicated Purpose Had Been Fulfilled; but</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">This Authority Must Not Be Abused</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 8:4, 7-10, 13 </span><span class="font6">“Now concerning the eating of foods offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is no God but one. Nevertheless, there is not this knowledge in all persons; but some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat food as something sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, as it is weak, becomes vile. But food will not commend us to God; if we do not eat, we do not fall short, and, if we eat, we have no credit to ourselves. But keep watching that this authority of yours does not somehow become a stumblingblock to those who are weak. For if anyone should see you with your knowledge reclining at a meal in an idol temple, will not the conscience of that one who is weak be emboldened to the point of eating foods offered to idols? Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never again eat flesh at all, that I may not make my brother stumble.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 10:25-29, 31, 32 </span><span class="font6">“Everything that is sold in a meat market keep eating, making no inquiry on account of your conscience, for ‘the earth belongs to Jehovah, and so does its fullness’. If anyone of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, proceed to eat everything that is set before you, making no inquiry on account of your conscience. But if anyone should say to you: ‘This is something offered to a god,’ do not eat on account of the one that disclosed it and on account of conscience. ‘Conscience,’ I say, not yours, but that of the other person... . Therefore, whether you are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory. Keep from becoming causes for stumbling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Tim. 4:4, 5 </span><span class="font6">“The reason for this is that every creation of God is right and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, for it is sanctified through God’s word and prayer over it.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Sam. 21:2-6 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(footnote)</span><span class="font6"> “And David said unto Ahimelech the priest,. . . Now therefore what is under thy hand? give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatsoever there is present. And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women. And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days; when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, [and it may be used as common bread; and especially since to-day it will be holy in respect of their vessels]. So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the showbread, that was taken from before Jehovah, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.”</span></p>

Wherefore at that time, certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews. They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king,. .. There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milconi the abomination of the Ammonites. And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and went not fully after Jehovah, as did David his father. Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.

For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said: ‘I shall reside among them and walk among them, and I shall be their God, and they will be my people.’ ‘Therefore get out from among them, and separate yourselves,’ says Jehovah, ‘and quit touching the unclean thing,’ ‘and I will take you in.’ ‘And I shall be a father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to me,’ says Jehovah the Almighty.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 19:13-20 </span><span class="font6">“But certain ones of the traveling Jews who practiced the casting out of demons also undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having the wicked spirits, saying: ‘I solemnly charge you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.’ Now there were seven sons of a certain Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, doing this. But in answer the wicked spirit said to them: ‘I know Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul; but who are you?’ With that the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped upon them, got the mastery of the two of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled naked and wounded out of that house. This became known to all, both the Jews and the Greeks that dwelt in Ephesus, and a fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus went on being magnified. And many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly. Indeed, quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody. And they calculated together the prices of them and found them worth fifty thousand pieces of silver. Thus in a mighty way the word of Jehovah kept growing and prevailing.”</span></p>

Not everyone saying to me, ‘Master, Master,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens will. Many will say to me in that day. ‘Master, Master, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many powerful works in your name?’ And yet then </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font6"> will confess to them: I never knew you at all.

Yet days will come when the bridegroom will indeed be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.’ Further he went on to give an illustration to them: ‘No one cuts a patch from a new outer garment and sews it onto an old outer garment; but if he does, then both the new patch tears away and the patch from the new garment does not match the old. Moreover, no one puts new wine Into old wineskins; but if he does, then the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled out and the wineskins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins. No one that has drunk old wine wants new; for he says, “The old is nice.” ’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 16:6-12 </span><span class="font6">“Jesus said to them: ‘Be on the alert and watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ So they began to reason among themselves, saying: ‘We did not take any loaves along.’ Knowing this, Jesus said: ‘Why are you doing this reasoning among yourselves, because you have no loaves, you with little faith? ... How is it you do not discern that I did not talk to you about loaves? But watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ Then they grasped that he said to watch out, not for the yeast of the loaves, but for the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:9, 10 </span><span class="font6">“A little yeast ferments the whole lump. I am confident about you who are in union with the Lord that you will not come to think otherwise; but the one who is disturbing you will bear his judgment, no matter who he may be.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 1:10-13 </span><span class="font6">“Now I exhort you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among you, but that you may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought. For the disclosure was made to me about you, my brothers, by those of the house of Chloe, that dissensions exist among you. What I mean is this, that each one of you says: ‘I belong to Paul,’ ‘But I to Apollos,’ ‘But I to Cephas,’ ‘But I to Christ.’ Does the Christ exist divided? Paul was not impaled for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?”</span></p>

And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness. So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.

<p><span class="font6">The Bible foretells a restoration of Israel. The </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">false representation </span><span class="font6">of such restoration prophecies is to the effect “that Israel [meaning natural Jews] will be restored to its own land in unbelief, and be afterward converted by the appearance of Christ on its behalf”. —See the magazine </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Current Opinion</span><span class="font6"> for February, 1918.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Bible itself</span><span class="font6"> shows the restoration prophecies had a literal fulfillment in a miniature way upon natural Israel in the sixth century B.C., which was to serve as an exact pattern of a final fulfillment of these same prophecies in the last days. The return of the fleshly nation of Israel to God’s favor is impossible, since Jesus uttered the irrevocable divorce decree of Jehovah God against the fleshly nation A.D. 33. Hence prophecies of restoration apply in the last days in a spiritual sense and refer to the “Israel of God” or the new nation of both individual Jews and Gentiles born of the spirit of God and therefore spiritual Israelites. The restoration of this nation is part of the composite sign pointing to the beginning of Christ’s reign and the end of Satan’s rule.</span></p>

Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have sworn, saying, Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall bear their shame. But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come. For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown; and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded. Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; I do not this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, whither ye went. And I will sanctify my great name, which hath been profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: For this, moreover, will I be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with men like a flock.

For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. Men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because they repented at what Jonah preached, but, look! something more than Jonah is here. The queen of the south will be raised up in the judgment with this generation and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, but, look! something more than Solomon is here.’ ”</span></p>

And tongues as if of fire became visible and were distributed to them, and one sat upon each one of them, and they all became filled with holy spirit.... But Peter stood up with the eleven and raised his voice and made this utterance to them: ‘Men of Judea and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give ear to my sayings.... this is what was said through the prophet Joel, “And in the last days,” God says, “I shall pour some of my spirit out upon every kind of flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy and your young men will see visions and your old men will dream dreams; and even upon my men slaves and upon my women slaves I will pour out some of my spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.” ... Men of Israel, heal-these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man publicly shown by God to you through powerful works and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, .. . This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear. ,.. Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you impaled. ... Repent, and let each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the free gift of the holy spirit.

Never may it occur that I should boast, except in the torture stake of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been impaled to me and I to the world.

<h3><a name="bookmark308"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark309"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Judgment Days are periods of time during which the Supreme Court in heaven sits to render judgment. The heavenly court is made up of the Supreme Judge, Jehovah God, and his associate Judge, Jesus Christ. (Isa. 33:22) Judgment means the act of determining what is conformable to law, or, Scripturally, God’s expressed will. Judgments with God are righteous and according to his own high standards of justice. Once pronounced they are never subject to reversal. They can be either judgments of divine favor or judgments of divine condemnation. The resulting favor or condemnation may extend individually or to an entire family, community or nation, depending on the nature of the offenses. In all judgment periods, past, present and future, the death sentence always means everlasting destruction with no hope of resurrection.</span></p>

Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice.... He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with his truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 26:9 </span><span class="font6">“With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee earnestly: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 11:33 </span><span class="font6">“Oh the depth of God’s riches and wisdom and knowledge! How unsearchable his judgments are and past tracing out his ways are!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Edenic Judgment Day (c.4025 B. C.) Brought Condemnation to Adam and Eve and Disabilities to Their Offspring</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 3:8-21 </span><span class="font6">“And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; ... for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 5:12, 16 </span><span class="font6">“That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned— . ..

[Jehovah determined:] ‘I will blot the men that I have created off the face of the ground, both men and animals, reptiles, and birds of the air; for I regret that I ever made them.’... Noah alone among his contemporaries was a pious and exceedingly good man; Noah walked with God.... ‘I have resolved on the extermination of all mortals; for the earth is full of wrong-doing through them; I am going to exterminate them from the earth. But with you I will make a covenant; you shall enter the ark, accompanied by your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives.’ ”</span></p>

But on the day that Lot came out of Sodom it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all. The same way it will be on that day when the Son of man is to be revealed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 19:24, 25, 29 </span><span class="font6">“Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven; and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the Inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 2:6-9 “And </span><span class="font6">by reducing the cities Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them, setting a pattern for ungodly persons of things to come, and he delivered righteous Lot. ...

I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative; just as I hear, I judge, and the judgment that I render is righteous, because I seek not my own will but the will of him that sent me.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark315"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark316"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Kingdom of God is a Sovereign-empowered theocratic government under an administration of divinely appointed Kings. Jehovah himself is the great Everlasting King. (1 Tim. 1:17; Rev. 15:3; Jer. 10:10) He has taken into association as co-regent his Son Christ Jesus. God has purposed the Kingdom as the capital or ruling part of his universal organization. It is comprised of the King Christ Jesus and 144,000 associate kings taken from among men. It is entirely heavenly, having no earthly part. All becoming members must be resurrected and given spirit bodies. At times the term “kingdom” Is applied to the one (in the Scriptures, Christ) who has the rank, quality, attributes and authority of a king. The term also is used to refer to the realm over which the Kingdom government exercises control. This Kingdom began operation in full power with the enthronement of Christ in the heavens, A.D. 1914.</span></p>

It is according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself for an administration at the full limit of the appointed times, namely, to gather all things together again in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 2:9-11 </span><span class="font6">“For this very reason also God exalted him to a superior position and kindly gave him the name that is above every other name, so that in the name of Jesus every knee should bend of those in heaven and those on earth and those under the ground, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 15:24, 25 </span><span class="font6">“Next, the accomplished end, when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father, when he has destroyed all government and all authority and power.

Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.”</span></p>

For if they did not escape who implored him not to give divine warning upon earth, much more shall we not if we turn away from him who speaks from the heavens. At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, saying: ‘Yet once more I will set not only the earth but also the heaven in commotion.' Now the expression ‘Yet once more’ signifies the removal of the things being shaken as things that have been made, in order that the things not being shaken may remain. Wherefore, seeing that we are to receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us continue to have undeserved kindness, through which we may acceptably render God sacred service with godly fear and awe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. </span><span class="font6">8:19 “For the eager expectation of the creation is waiting for the revealing of the sons of God.”</span></p>

However, this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, neither does corruption inherit incorruption. Look! I tell you a sacred secret: We shall not all fall asleep in death, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, during the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised up incorruptible, and we shall be changed.

<h2><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark321"></a>Law</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark322"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark323"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Law as generally used in the Bible refers to the Law covenant given by Jehovah God to the nation of Israel at the hands of Moses as mediator. For this reason it is sometimes called the Mosaic Law;, although no part of the law was made or given by Moses himself. False religion claims the law was divided into two parts: (1) God’s law, a moral law, written by Him, and (2) Moses’ law, a ceremonial law, written by him. It is unscripturally claimed that the ceremonial law was abolished, but not the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments. According to the Scriptures, the entire Law covenant, namely, the Ten Commandments as well as all sacrificial and ceremonial features pertaining to the law, was fulfilled by Jesus Christ and abolished by being nailed to Christ’s torture stake A.D. 33. Christians are therefore not under any part of the law, Including the Ten Commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Law Given Only to Nation of Israel, Thereby Separating Them</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ps. 147:19, 20 “He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his ordinances unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation; and as for his ordinances, they have not known them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Deut. 4:8 </span><span class="font6">“And what great nation is there, that hath statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ex. 31:16, 17 </span><span class="font6">“Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Moses Served as Mediator</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 1:17 </span><span class="font6">“Because the law was given through Moses, the undeserved kindness and the truth came to be through Jesus Christ.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Law to Serve Only Until Messiah</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Should Come</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 3:19, 24 </span><span class="font6">“Why, then, the Law? It was added to make transgressions manifest, until the seed should arrive to whom the promise had been made, and it was transmitted through angels by the hand of a mediator. Consequently, the Law has become our tutor leading to Christ, that we might be declared righteous due to faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Nailed Law to Jesus’ Torture Stake, Putting It</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Out of Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Col. 2:13, </span><span class="font6">14 “God made you alive together with him. He kindly forgave us all our trespasses and blotted out the handwritten document against us which consisted of decrees and which was in opposition to us, and He has taken it out of the way by nailing it to the torture stake.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul Showed Law Jehovah Abolished Was God’s Law (Including “Sabbath Sign”) Which Had</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Separated Jews from Gentiles</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 2:11-16 </span><span class="font6">“Therefore keep bearing in mind that formerly you were people of the nations as to flesh; ‘uncircumcision’ you were called by that which is called ‘circumcision’ made in the flesh with hands—that you were at that particular time without Christ, alienated from the state of Israel and strangers to the covenants of the promise, and you had no hope and were without God in the world. But now in union with Christ Jesus you who were once far off have come to be near by the blood of the Christ. For he is our peace, he who made the two parties one and destroyed the wall in between that fenced them off. By means of his flesh he abolished the hatred, the Law of commandments consisting in decrees, that he might create the two peoples in union with himself into one new man and make peace, and that he might fully reconcile both peoples in one body to God through the torture stake, because he had killed off the hatred by means of himself.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Did Not Destroy the Law but Kept It Perfectly, as Example to the Jews</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 4:4 </span><span class="font6">“But when the full limit of the time arrived, God sent forth his Son, who was produced out of a woman and who came to be under law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lev. 18:5 “Ye </span><span class="font6">shall therefore keep my statutes, and mine ordinances; which if a man do, he shall live in them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Matt. 5:17, 19, 20 “Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill. Whoever, therefore, breaks one of these least commandments and teaches mankind to that effect, he will be called ‘least’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. As for anyone who does them and teaches them, this one will be called ‘great’ in relation to the kingdom of the heavens. For I say to you that if your righteousness does not abound more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Demonstrated Pharisees Were Lawbreakers Through</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Their Traditions, Hence Would Be Excluded from Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Matt. 15:1-3, 6 “Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying; ‘Why is it your disciples overstep the tradition of the men of former times?’... In reply he said to them: ‘Why is it you also overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition? . .. And so you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Matt. 21:43, 45 “ ‘This is why I say to you, The kingdom of God will be taken from you and be given to a nation producing its fruits.’ Now when the chief priests and the Pharisees had heard his illustrations they took note that he was speaking about them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Fulfilled Law by Bringing in the Realities, Those Things</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Pictured by the Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 5:17, 18 </span><span class="font6">“Do not think I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I came, not to destroy, but to fulfill; for truly I say to you that sooner would heaven and earth pass away than for the smallest letter or one particle of a letter to pass away from the Law by any means and not all things take place.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Col. 2:16, 17 </span><span class="font6">“Therefore let no man judge you in eating and drinking or in respect of a feast day or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath, for those things are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to the Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:1, 2 </span><span class="font6">“For since the Law has a shadow of the good things to come, but not the very substance of the things, men can never with the same sacrifices from year to year which they offer continually make those who approach perfect. Otherwise, would the sacrifices not have stopped being offered?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Came as Perfect Sacrifice for Removal of Sin</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:8-10 </span><span class="font6">“After first saying, ‘You did not desire nor did you approve of sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt-offerings and sin offering’—sacrifices which are offered according to the Law—then he actually says, ‘Look! I am come to do your will.’ He does away with what is first that he may establish what is second. By the said ‘will’ we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.”</span></p>

Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 5:7 </span><span class="font6">“For, indeed, Christ our passover has been sacrificed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 1:19 </span><span class="font6">“But it was with precious blood, like that of an unblemished and spotless lamb, even Christ’s.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 5:12 </span><span class="font6">“The Lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 9:1-3, 9, 10, 24 </span><span class="font6">“For its part, then, the former covenant used to have ordinances of sacred service and its holy place upon this earth. For there was constructed a first tent compartment in which were the lampstand and also the table and the display of the loaves; and it is called ‘the Holy Place’. But behind the second curtain was the tent compartment called ‘the Most Holy’. This very tent is an illustration for the appointed time that is now here, and in keeping with it both gifts and sacrifices are offered. . . . They were legal requirements pertaining to the flesh and were imposed until the appointed time to set things straight. For Christ entered, not into a holy place made with hands which is a copy of the reality, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the person of God for us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Command to Keep the Sabbath Forever Did Not Mean Ten Commandments Would Apply for All Time to Come</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Lev. 6:18, 22 </span><span class="font6">“Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it, as his portion for ever </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">['o-lam']</span><span class="font6"> throughout your generations, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire:... And the anointed priest that shall be in his stead from among his sons shall offer it: by a statute for ever ['olam'] it shall be wholly burnt unto Jehovah.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Paul Shows Priesthood and Sacrifices Definitely Ended, Hence Ten Commandments Also</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 7:11, 12, 18, 19 </span><span class="font6">“If, then, perfection were really through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it as a feature the people were given the Law,) what further need would there be for another priest to arise . .. ? For since the priesthood is being changed, there comes to be of necessity a change also of the law. Certainly, then, there occurs a setting aside of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and ineffectiveness. For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in besides of a better hope did, through which we are drawing near to God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Law Covenant Replaced by New Covenant Mediated by Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Through His Sacrifice</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 3:5, 6, 12-14 </span><span class="font6">“Our being adequately qualified issues from God, who has indeed adequately qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, not of a written code, but of spirit; for the written code condemns to death, but the spirit makes alive. Therefore, as we have such a hope, we are using great freeness of speech, and not doing as when Moses would put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel might not gaze intently at the end of that which was to be done away with. But their mental perceptions were dulled. For to this present day the same veil remains unlifted at the reading of the old covenant, because it is done away with by means of Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 8:6, 13 </span><span class="font6">“But now Jesus has obtained a more excellent public service, so that he is also the mediator of a correspondingly better covenant, which has been legally established upon better promises. In his saying ‘a new covenant’ he has made the former one obsolete. Now that which is made obsolete and growing old is near to vanishing away.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christians Still Live by Principles Embodied in Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 5:21, 22 </span><span class="font6">“You heard that it was said to those of ancient times, ‘You must not murder.’ .. . However, I say to you that everyone who continues angry with his brother will be accountable to the court of justice; but whoever addresses his brother with an unspeakable word of contempt will be accountable to the Supreme Court; whereas whoever says, ‘You despicable fool!’ will be liable to the fiery Gehenna.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 5:27, 28 </span><span class="font6">“You heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone that keeps on looking at a woman so as to have a passion for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 5:43-47 </span><span class="font6">“You heard that it was said: ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to you: Continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you. . .. For if you love those loving you, what reward do you have? are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing? And if you greet your brothers only, what extraordinary thing are you doing? Are not also the people of the nations doing the same thing?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Force That Moves to Obedience Is Righteous Active Force of God; More Powerful than Sanctions of the Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 3:15-18 </span><span class="font6">“In fact, down till today whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their hearts. But when there is a turning to Jehovah, the veil is taken away. Now Jehovah is the spirit; and where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom. And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, exactly as done by Jehovah the spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Gal. 5:18, 22 “Furthermore, if you are being led by spirit, you are not under law. ... the fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control. Against such things there is no law.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 6:1-3 </span><span class="font6">“Children, be obedient to your parents in union with the Lord, for this is righteous: ‘Honor your father and mother’; which is the first command with a promise: ‘That it may go well with you and you may endure a long time on the earth.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Rom. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">13:8-10 </span><span class="font6">“Do not be owing anybody a single thing, except to love one another; for he that loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law. For the law code, ‘You must not commit adultery, You must not murder, You must not steal, You must not covet,’ and whatever other commandment there is, is summed up in this word, namely, ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’ Love does not work evil to one’s neighbor; therefore love is the law’s fulfillment.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Kindness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 6:14 </span><span class="font6">“For sin must not be master over you, seeing that you are not under law but under undeserved kindness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 2:8, 9 </span><span class="font6">“By this undeserved kindness, indeed, you have been saved through faith; and this not owing to you, it is God’s gift. No, it is not owing to works, in order that no man should have grounds for boasting.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark324"></a>Life</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark325"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark326"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic objects and dead organisms. The distinguishing manifestations of life are growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the power of adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the fullest Scriptural sense, as applied to intelligent persons, life is existence with the right thereto. It may be in heaven or on earth. Life is brought about by the “life principle” or “life force” (spirit) that originates with God, activating a physical or spiritual body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Divine: </span><span class="font6">Life of the highest order, like that of the Divine Being, Jehovah God himself. Reserved only for Christ Jesus and his 144,000 Kingdom ruling associates.—Acts 17:29; 1 John 3:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Immortality: </span><span class="font6">Deathlessness, that is, the life principle of the person possessing it cannot be taken away by anyone except the Almighty himself. Dependent only upon Jehovah, but not on any created thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Incorruptibility: </span><span class="font6">Referring to the organism that cannot deteriorate, or be hurt or injured by any except Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Incorruptibility and immortality </span><span class="font6">are inseparably linked with the Kingdom. No others besides the Kingdom members in heaven receive these qualities of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Everlasting life: </span><span class="font6">Life in a perfect organism, fleshly for humans who gain life on earth, spiritual for faithful angels who continue to live in heaven. No other creature can justly take such gift away. God through his organization protects the life of such individual for all eternity. Such a person, by his very creation, is dependent upon food, subject to God’s laws governing created things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah Has Immortal Life, Incorruptibility; Therefore Life</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 17:25, 26, 29 </span><span class="font6">“Neither is he attended to by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to all persons life and breath and all things. And he made out of one man every nation of men, to dwell upon the entire surface of the earth, and he decreed the appointed seasons and the set limits of the dwelling of men. Seeing, therefore, that we are the progeny of God, we ought not to imagine that the Divine Being is like gold or silver or stone, like something sculptured by the art and the contrivance of man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 104:29, 30 </span><span class="font6">“Thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:26, 27 </span><span class="font6">“For if we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment and there is a fiery jealousy that is going to consume those in opposition.”</span></p>

For he says to Moses: ‘I will have mercy upon whomever I do have mercy, and I will show compassion to whomever I do show compassion.’ So, then, it depends, not upon the one wishing nor upon the one running, but upon God, who has mercy. For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: ‘For this very purpose I have let you remain, that in connection with you I may demonstrate my power and that my name may be published throughout all the earth.’ So, then, upon whom he wishes he has mercy, but whom he wishes he hardens. You will therefore say to me: ‘Why does he yet find fault? For who has withstood his express will?’ O man, who, then, really are you to be answering back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him that molded it, ‘Why did you make me this way?’ What? Does not the potter have authority over the clay to make from the same lump one vessel for an honorable use, another for a dishonorable use? If, now’, God, although having the will to demonstrate his wrath and to make his power known, tolerated with much longsuffer-ing vessels of wrath made fit for destruction, in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,... what of it?”</span></p>

He that does not love has not come to know God, because God is love. And we ourselves have come to know and have believed the love God has in our case. God is love, and he that remains in love remains in union with God and God remains in union with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All-essential to Gaining Eternal Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 13:1-3 </span><span class="font6">“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding piece of brass or a clashing cymbal. And if I have the gift of prophesying and understand all the sacred secrets and all knowledge, and if I have all the faith so as to transplant mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my belongings to feed others, and if I hand over my body, that I may boast, but do not have love, I am not profited at all.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Love Is the Way to Overcome Fear</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 John 4:18 </span><span class="font6">“There is no fear in love, but perfect love throws fear outside, because fear exercises a restraint. Indeed, he that is under fear has not been made perfect in love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Love Is the “Surpassing Way” Far Greater than Miraculous Gifts</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 12:31 </span><span class="font6">“But keep striving after the greater gifts. And yet I show you a surpassing way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 13:8, 13 </span><span class="font6">“Love never fails. But whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will be done away with. Now, however, there remain faith, hope, love, these three, but the greatest of these is love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Love Is an Identification Mark of the Christian Congregation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 13:35 </span><span class="font6">“By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 John 4:20 </span><span class="font6">“If anyone makes the statement ‘I love God’ and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 4:16 </span><span class="font6">“From him all the body, by being harmoniously joined together and being made to cooperate through every joint which gives what is needed, according to the functioning of each respective member in due measure, makes for the growth of the body for the building up of itself in love.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Today, in Time of Maturity of Christian Congregation, Love Is the Foremost Quality</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 13:8-12 </span><span class="font6">“Love never fails. But whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will be done away with. For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially; but when that which is complete arrives, that which is partial will be done away with. When I was a babe I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man, I have done away with the traits of a babe. For at present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face to face. At present I know partially, but then I shall know accurately even as I am accurately known.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark339"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark340"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Marriage is a mutual agreement (contract) of a man and a woman to live together in the relation and under the duties of husband and wife, sharing each other’s lot or portion for good or bad until parted by death. Marriage imposes on the husband the general legal duty of supporting his wife and children, maintaining a home, teaching and training his children and protecting his wife and family from injury or insult. The wife owes to the husband the duty of living with him where he decides and seeking to promote his interests and happiness. She has the duty of performing domestic service in the home and caring for her children.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christian Grounds for Divorce</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 5:31, 32 </span><span class="font6">“I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife except on account of fornication makes her a subject for adultery, seeing that whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”</span></p>

Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation.... In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, ... let each one of you individually so love his wife as he does himself; on the other hand, the wife should have deep respect for her husband.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark347"></a>Mass</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark348"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark349"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">A doctrine of false religion. “The Mass is the unbloody renewal of the Sacrifice of Our Lord upon the Cross. In it the priest, as the representative of Christ, offers to God the bread and wine, which he changes into the Body and Blood of Our Lord </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">[transubstantiation].” (National Catholic Almanac</span><span class="font6"> of 1948, p. 244) It is further claimed, “Our divine Saviour said the first Mass, at the Last Supper, the night before He died.”—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A Catechism of Christian Doctrine,</span><span class="font6"> 1949 edition, Question 365.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The Scriptures clearly reveal that Jesus offered his own sacrifice once for all time and which never needs renewing. Jesus’ words “body” and “blood” symbolically represent that those eating and drinking are sharing in his congregational body and his death under the new covenant.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark350"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark351"></a>ORIGIN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The “unbloody sacrifice” had its origin in ancient Babylonish worship with evidences of its practice in Assyria, Cyprus and Phoenicia, and was adopted by apostate Christians during the fourth century. The thin round wafer of the “Mass” originated in Egypt as a symbol of the “sun” and “the Son&quot;. (Hislop’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">The Two Babylons')</span><span class="font6"> Although accepting money for masses began during the seventh or eighth century, it did not become universal until the twelfth century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 6:9, 10, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “Knowing that Christ, rising again from the dead, dieth now no more. Death shall no more have dominion over him. For in that he died to sin, he died once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.”</span></p>

Who needeth not daily (as the other priests) to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, in offering himself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Offered Often Makes Sacrifice No Better than Typical Sacrifices</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 10:1-4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things, by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect. For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer. But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year: for it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Renewing Sacrifice Would Also</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 8:2 “A </span><span class="font6">public servant of the holy place and of the true tent, which Jehovah set up, and not man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 13:4 </span><span class="font6">“It is God's minister to you for your good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Other Servants of God, Beginning with Abel, Were Ministers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 11:4, 32 </span><span class="font6">“By faith Abel offered God a sacrifice of greater worth than Cain, through which faith he had witness borne to him that he was righteous, God bearing witness respecting his gifts, . .. the time will fail me if I go on to relate about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David as well as Samuel and the other prophets.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Every Christian Must Be a Minister</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 10:10-15 </span><span class="font6">“For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.... For ‘anyone that calls upon the name of Jehovah will be saved’. However, how will they call upon him in whom they have not put faith? How, in turn, will they put faith in him of whom they have not heard? How, in turn, will they hear without someone to preach? How, in turn, will they preach unless they have been sent forth? Just as it is written: ‘How beautiful are the feet of those who declare good news of good things!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 21:15-17 </span><span class="font6">“When, now, they had breakfasted, Jesus said to Simon Peter: ‘Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?’ He said to him: ‘Yes, Master, you know I have affection for you.’ He said to him: ‘Feed my young lambs.’ Again he said to him, a second time: ‘Simon son of John, do you love me?’ He said to him: ‘Yes, Master, you know I have affection for you.’ He said to him: ‘Shepherd my little sheep.’ He said to him the third time: ‘Simon son of John, do you have affection for me?’ Peter became grieved that he said to him the third time: ‘Do you have affection for me?’ So he said to him: ‘Master, you know all things; you are aware that I have affection for you.’ Jesus said to him: ‘Feed my little sheep.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ordination Comes from God Through Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 61:1-3 </span><span class="font6">“The spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me; because Jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be glorified.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 12:18 </span><span class="font6">“But now God has set the members in the body, each one of them, just as he pleased.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 15:16 </span><span class="font6">“You did not choose me, but I chose you, and I appointed you to go on and keep bearing fruit and that your fruit should remain, in order that no matter what you ask the Father in my name he might give it to you.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 3:1-3 </span><span class="font6">“Do we, perhaps, like some men, need letters of recomsendation to you or from you? You yourselves are our letter, inscribed on our hearts and known and being read by all mankind.

But the latter tried to prevent him, saying: ‘I am the one needing to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?’ In reply Jesus said to him: ‘Let it be, this time, for in that way it is suitable for us to carryout all that is righteous.’ Then he quit preventing him. After being baptized Jesus immediately came up from the water; and. look! the heavens were opened up, and he saw descending like a dove God’s spirit coming upon him. Look! also, there was a voice from the heavens that said: ‘This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved.’ ”</span></p>

This is not perhaps the Christ, is it?’ They went out of the city and began coming to him. Now many of the Samaritans out of that city put faith in him on account of the word of the woman who said in witness: ‘He told me all the things I did.’ Therefore when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them: and he stayed there two days. Consequently many more believed on account of what he said, and they began to say to the woman: ‘We do not believe any longer on account of your talk; for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man is for a certainty the savior of the world.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Child Ministers</span></p>

Did you not know that I must be in the house of my Father?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:15 </span><span class="font6">“And that from infancy you have known the holy writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.”</span></p>

I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding. It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged that understand justice.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark368"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark369"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The Scripturally outlined course of conduct for true Christians especially in the time of the end. Not an effort at “character development”, it requires accurate knowledge of God’s basic principles and righteous requirements for those of his new world with an honest desire and earnest effort to live by them, coupled with a sincere love of God and neighbor. It recognizes the need for the operation of God’s active force in one’s life, since many righteous qualities are themselves actually fruits of the spirit. It means a completely changed thinking process from that of the former course in Satan’s system of things, a development of a new life pattern by daily strengthening of proper habits, leanings and mental attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God Foretold a New World Fashioned According to His</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Righteous Principles</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 65:17 </span><span class="font6">“For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 3:13 </span><span class="font6">“But there are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Those of New World Society Are Taught According to His</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Revealed Will</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 54:13 </span><span class="font6">“And all thy children shall be taught of Jehovah; and great shall be the peace of thy children.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 55:8, 9 </span><span class="font6">“For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith Jehovah. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Members of That Society Are Certain to Be Established</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 66:1, 22 </span><span class="font6">“Thus saith Jehovah, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: ... For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and your name remain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eve’s Mind Corrupted and Bent Away from True Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 11:3, 14 </span><span class="font6">“But I am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its craftiness, your minds might be corrupted away from the sincerity and the chastity that are due the Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Continued Evil Bent of Thinking Brought Flood</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 6:5, 13 “And Jehovah </span><span class="font6">saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fallen Man’s Mind Bent Toward Evil from Youth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 8:21 </span><span class="font6">“And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">273 </span><span class="font6">curse the ground any more for man’s sake, for that the imagination of man’s heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Continued Wrong Thinking Foreseen</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Deut. 31:21 </span><span class="font6">“And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I sware.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Further Evil Bent of Man’s Mind in Last Days Foretold</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Matt. 24:37 “For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 </span><span class="font6">Tim. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">3:1, 8 </span><span class="font6">“But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. Now in the way that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so these also go on resisting the truth, men completely corrupted in mind, disapproved as regards the faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:22, 28, 29 </span><span class="font6">“Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish. And just as they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting, filled as they were with all unrighteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan, God of This World, Is Responsible for Wrong Thinking</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 12:9 </span><span class="font6">“So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 4:4 </span><span class="font6">“Among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan Feeds Man’s Mind on Wrong Things According to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">His System of Things</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Col. 1:21 </span><span class="font6">“Indeed, you who were once alienated and enemies because your minds were on the works that were wicked, he now has again reconciled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 2:2, 3 </span><span class="font6">“You at one time walked according to the system of things of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience. Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, doing the things the flesh and the thoughts willed.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Harmony with God’s New World Arrangement Requires Completely Changed Course of Thinking</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 3:16-18 </span><span class="font6">“But when there is a turning to Jehovah, the veil is taken away. Now Jehovah is the spirit; and where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom. And all of us, while we with unveiled faces reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, exactly as done by Jehovah the spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 12:2 </span><span class="font6">“And quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Active Force of God Needed to Effect a Change in Thinking and Conduct</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Titus 3:3-6 “For even we were once senseless, disobedient, being misled, being slaves to various desires and pleasures, carrying on in maliciousness and envy, hateful, hating one another. However, when the kindness and the love for man on the part of our Savior, God, was manifested, owing to no activities in righteousness that we had performed, but according to his mercy he saved us through the bath that brought us to life and through the making of us new by holy spirit. This spirit he poured out richly upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font6">Cor. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2:10, 12 </span><span class="font6">“For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God. Now we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that have been kindly given us by God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Must Be in Sincerity of Heart</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 51:10, 11 </span><span class="font6">“Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Written Word Able to</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Search Out Man’s Inmost Thoughts and Direct His</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Course</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 119:9 </span><span class="font6">“Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy word.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 4:12, 13 </span><span class="font6">“For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of the soul and spirit, and of the joints and their marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">New World Living Means Becoming a New Personality</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. </span><span class="font6">4:22-24 “That you should put away the old personality which conforms to your former course of conduct and which is being corrupted according to his deceptive desires; but that you should be made new in the forth actuating your mind, and should put on the new' personality which was created according to God's will in true righteousness and loving-kindness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Law of Sin Through Adam Wars Against Law of This New Mind</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:16, 17 </span><span class="font6">“But I say, Keep walking by spirit and you will carry out no fleshly desire at all. For the flesh is against the spirit </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">its desire, and the spirit against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, so that the very things that you would like to do you do not do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 7:21-25 “I </span><span class="font6">find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me. I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I behold in my members another law warring against the law of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law that is in my members.... So, then, with my mind I myself am a slave to God’s law, but with my flesh to sin’s law.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Failure to Renew Mind Leads into Corrupted Mental State</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Tim. 6:3-5 </span><span class="font6">“If any man teaches other doctrine and does not assent to healthful words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor to the teaching that accords with godly devotion, he is puffed up with pride, not understanding anything, but being mentally diseased over questionings and debates about words. From these things spring envy, strife, abusive speeches, wicked suspicions, violent disputes about trifles on the part of men corrupted in mind and despoiled of the truth, thinking that godly devotion is a means of gain.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark370"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark371"></a>The End of Wrong Thinking Is Death</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 3:18, 19 </span><span class="font6">“For there are many, I used to mention them often but now I mention them also with weeping, who are walking as the enemies of the torture stake of the Christ, and their finish is destruction, and their god is their belly, and their glory consists in their shame, and they have their minds upon things on the earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mind Must Be Trained in Right Processes of Thinking</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 23:26 </span><span class="font6">“My son, give me thy heart; and let thine eyes delight in [or, “observe,” footnote] my ways.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 8:5-8 </span><span class="font6">“For those who are in accord with the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those in accord with the spirit on the things of the spirit. For the minding of the flesh means death, but the minding of the spirit means life and peace; because the minding of the flesh means enmity with God, for it is not under subjection to the law of God, nor, in fact, can it be. So those who are in harmony with the flesh cannot please God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Love of God Essential</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 22:37 “He </span><span class="font6">said to him: ‘You must love Jehovah your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole mind.’ ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Phil. 3:13-16 “Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead, I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize of the calling above and which God extends in Christ Jesus. Let us, then, as many of us as are mature, be of this mental attitude; and if you are mentally inclined otherwise in any respect, God will reveal the above attitude to you. At any rate, to what extent we have made progress, let us go on walking orderly in this same routine.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 8:5-8, 11, 13-15 “A </span><span class="font6">sower went out to sow his seed. Well, as he was sowing, some of it. . . landed upon the rock-mass, and, after sprouting, it dried up because of not having moisture. Some other fell among the thorns, and the thorns that grew up with it choked it off. Some other fell upon the good soil, and. after sprouting, it produced fruit a hundredfold. . . . Now the illustration means this: The seed is the word of God. Those upon the rock-mass are the ones who, when they hear it, receive the word with joy, but these have no root; they believe for a season, but in a season of testing they fall away. As for that which fell among the thorns, these are the ones that have heard, but, by being carried away by anxieties and wealth and pleasures of this life, they are completely choked and bring nothing to perfection. As for that on the right soil, these are the ones that, after hearing the word with a right and good heart, retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”</span></p>

The tongue is constituted a world of unrighteousness among our members, for it spots up all the body and sets the wheel of natural life aflame and it is set aflame by Gehenna. ... An unruly injurious thing, it is full of death-dealing poison. With it we bless Jehovah, even the Father, and yet with it we curse men who have come into existence ‘in the likeness of God’ ....

Whatever you are doing, work at it whole souled as to Jehovah, and not to men, for you know that it is from Jehovah you will receive the due reward of the inheritance.

Let fornication and uncleanness of every kind or greediness not even be mentioned among you, just as it befits holy people, neither shameful conduct nor foolish talking nor obscene jesting, things which are not becoming, but rather the giving of thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 Pet. 4:3-5 “For the time that has passed by is sufficient for you to have worked out the will of the nations when you proceeded in deeds of loose conduct, lusts, excesses with wine, revelries, drinking matches, and idolatries that are without legal restraint. Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you.

Hence lift up the hands that hang down and strengthen the enfeebled knees, and keep making straight paths for your feet, that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather that it may be healed. Pursue peace with all people, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord, carefully watching that no one may be deprived of the undeserved kindness of God; that no poisonous root may spring up and cause trouble and many be defiled by it; that there may be no fornicator nor anyone not appreciating sacred things, like Esau, who in exchange for one meal gave away his rights as firstborn. For you know that afterward also when he wanted to inherit the blessing he was rejected, for, although he earnestly sought a change of mind with tears, he found no place for it.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark376"></a>Prayer</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark377"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark378"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">True prayer is an earnest petition, offered to the right one, in the right manner, and on right matters. Prayers of the Christian are offered only to Jehovah God as the Right One, the Supreme One of the universe. Prayer is therefore offered reverently, with proper recognition of the supremacy of the one being addressed and the inferiority of the one praying. The right manner of approach is only through and in the name of Jesus Christ. Prayers are recognized only in request for those things that are right matters as authorized by Jehovah himself. Failure in any one of the three essentials will render the prayer unacceptable. Only prayers of the righteous are answered.</span></p>

The souls therein detained are helped by the suffrages of the faithful, but principally by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar.&quot; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(The Catholic Encyclopedia,</span><span class="font6"> Volume XIX) </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">A false doctrine.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark386"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark387"></a>ORIGIN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">“Whatever the views of some Church fathers on the subject, as a doctrine [purgatory] was unknown in the Christian Church for the first 600 years, and it does not appear to have been made an article of faith until the 10th century.... ‘Purgatory as a burning-away of sins,’ said Doellinger at the Bonn Conference of Old Catholics in 1875, ‘was an idea unknown in the East as well as the West till Gregory the Great [pope 595-604] introduced it. ... Gregory the Great added the idea of a tormenting fire.’ ” (McClintock and Strong’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclopaedia, </span><span class="font6">Volume VIII, 1879 edition) Nowhere in any Catholic Bible translation is “purgatory” named. No Scripture text makes mention of a soul in “purgatory”.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 15:1-9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “Then came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying: Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread. But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? ... Hypocrites, well hath Isalas prophesied of you, saying: This people honour-eth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 1:10-16, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God and wasted it. And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No Soul Is Conscious After Death to Be Tormented in “Purgatory”. Hence Prayers for the</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man’s Sins Must Be Forgiven When Alive, Because Whether</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dead in Christ or Asleep in Death, Sin Is Accounted Inactive</span></p>

For he that is dead is justified from sin.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">[NW:</span><span class="font6"> “Because we know that our old personality was impaled with him, that our sinful body might be made inactive, that we should no longer go on being slaves to sin. For he who has died has been acquitted from his sin.”]</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 13:38, 39, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “Through [Jesus] forgiveness of sins is preached to you: and from all the things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.

If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all iniquity.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">289 “Cleansing Fire” Used Symbolically to Show Testing of Faith and Integrity in Perfecting God’s Servants for Service, Not Just for the Sake of Their Own Forgiveness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 6:5-9, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “And I said: Woe is me, because I have held my peace; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts. And one of the Seraphims flew to me: and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar. And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed. And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I. Send me. And he said: Go.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mal. 3:1-3, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “The Lord whom you seek, and the angel of the testament whom you desire shall come to his temple. Behold he cometh, saith the Lord of hosts. And who shall be able to think of the day of his coming? and who shall stand to see him? for he is like a refining fire and like the fuller’s herb. And he shall sit refining and cleansing the silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi and shall refine them as gold and as silver: and they shall offer sacrifices to the Lord in justice.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 9:14, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">“Cleansing Fire” Is Shown to Test Man’s Works and Faith and Purify Him When Living, Not After Death. Some Scarcely Saved from “Fire</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of Destruction”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 3:11-15, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid: which is Christ Jesus. Now, if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble: every man’s work shall be manifest. For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire. And the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is. If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 1:7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dy</span><span class="font6"> “That the trial of your faith (much more precious than gold which is tried by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour at the appearing of Jesus Christ.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">NW:</span><span class="font6"> “In order that the tested quality of your faith, of much greater value than gold that perishes despite its being proved by fire, may be found a cause for praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”]</span></p>

On the contrary, go on rejoicing forasmuch as you are sharers in the sufferings of the Christ, that you may rejoice and be overjoyed also during the revelation of his glory.”]</span></p>

The genes were placed in the species [kinds] by the Creator at creation, together with a definite mechanism or orderly process by which they could at different times reveal their effects ... If there are, as is practically certain, multiple factors for color of skin in man, and if Adam and Eve were mulattos—a shade a mixture of black, white, red, and yellow—it is easy for geneticists to see how their color genes could become grouped and selected by climatic influences so as to form the various colors of the races.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">—After Its Kind,</span><span class="font6"> by Byron C.

<p><span class="font6">“In the human species [kind] there are variations in the skin, hair and eye colors, in the shape and distribution of hair, in the form of the head, nose and lips, in stature, in body proportions, in the chemical composition of the blood, in psychological traits, and so on. Each of these traits is influenced by several or by many genes. To be conservative, let us assume that the human species [kind] has only 1,000 genes and that each gene has only two variants. Even on this conservative basis, Mendelian segregation and recombination would be capable of producing 2“&quot;° different gene combinations in human beings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 1:1, 2 </span><span class="font6">“God, who long ago spoke on many occasions and in many ways to our forefathers by means of the prophets, has at the end of these days spoken to us by means of a Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the systems of things.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 42:6 </span><span class="font6">“I, Jehovah, have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christendom Began with Great Falling Away from True</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Thess. 2:6, 7 </span><span class="font6">“And so now you know the thing that acts as a restraint with a view to his being revealed in his own due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">True, the mystery of this lawlessness is already at work; but only till he who is right now acting as a restraint gets to be out of the way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 20:29, 30 </span><span class="font6">“I know that after my going away oppressive wolves will enter in among you and will not treat the flock with tenderness, and from among you yourselves men will rise and speak twisted things to draw away the disciples after themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 2:1 </span><span class="font6">“However, there also came to be false prophets among the people, as there will also be false teachers among you. These very ones will quietly bring in destructive sects and will disown even the owner that bought them, bringing speedy destruction upon themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christendom Practices False Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jer. 5:30, 31 “A </span><span class="font6">wonderful and horrible thing is come to pass in the land: the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jer. 25:29 </span><span class="font6">“Lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion Reaches Height of Corruption in Last Days</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:1-5 </span><span class="font6">“But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, selfassuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, without gratitude, with no loving-kindness, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with self-esteem, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 18:2 </span><span class="font6">“She has fallen! Babylon the great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling-place of demons and a lurking-place of every unclean exhalation and a lurking-place of every unclean and hated bird!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Followers of False Religion in Great Danger Today</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 18:4 </span><span class="font6">“And </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">heard another voice out of heaven say: ‘Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jer. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">51:6 </span><span class="font6">“Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; be not cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Jehovah's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompense.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 4:17, 18 </span><span class="font6">“For it is the appointed time for the judgment to start with the house of God. Now if it starts first with us, what will the complete end be of those who are not obedient to the good news of God? And if the righteous man is being saved with difficulty, where will the ungodly man and the sinner make a showing?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Only Safe Course Is to Forsake False Religion, Learn, Practice</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Zeph. 2:3 </span><span class="font6">“Seek ye Jehovah, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Prov. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">18:10 </span><span class="font6">“The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; the righteous runneth into it. and is safe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:15-21 </span><span class="font6">“Therefore, when you catch sight of the disgusting thing that causes desolation, as spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in a holy place, (let the reader use discernment,) then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains. Let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house; and let the man in the field not return to the house to pick up his outer garment. Woe to the pregnant women and those suckling a baby in those days! Keep praying that your flight may not occur in wintertime nor on the sabbath day; for then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 4:19 </span><span class="font6">“So, then, also let those who are suffering in harmony with the -will of God keep on commending their souls to a faithful Creator while they are doing good.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion, “Babylon,” Tries to Control World, Destroy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 17:3-6, 12-14 </span><span class="font6">“And I caught sight of a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored wild beast that was full of blasphemous names and that had seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and was adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls and had in her hand a golden cup that was full of disgusting things and the unclean things of her fornication. And upon her forehead was written a name, a mystery, ‘Babylon the Great, the mother of the harlots and of the disgusting things of the earth.’ And I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the holy ones and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. ‘And the ten horns that you saw mean ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they do receive authority as kings one hour with the wild beast, .. . These will battle with the Lamb, but, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, the Lamb will conquer them.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion’s Multitudinous Sects a Divided House</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 1:12, 13 </span><span class="font6">“Each one of you says: ‘I belong to Paul,’ ‘But I to Apollos,’ ‘But I to Cephas,’ ‘But I to Christ.’ Does the Christ exist divided? Paul was not impaled for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 3:3 </span><span class="font6">“You are yet fleshly. For whereas there are jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and are you not walking as men do?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion to Be Destroyed;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion Will Survive</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 11:17 </span><span class="font6">“Every kingdom divided against itself comes to desolation, and a house divided against itself falls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 17:1, 16 “Come, I will </span><span class="font6">show you the judgment upon the great harlot that sits on many waters,. .. the ten horns that you saw, and the wild beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her devastated and naked, and will eat up her fleshy parts and will completely burn her with fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jer. 25:34, 35 “Wail, ye shep</span><span class="font6">herds, and cry; and wallow in ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All Earth Will Again Have the One True Religion; Will Continue Throughout Eternity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 4:23, 24 </span><span class="font6">“The hour is coming, and it is now, when the genuine worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for such kind to worship him. God is a Spirit, and those worshiping him must worship with spirit and truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 21:3, 4 </span><span class="font6">“I heard a loud voice from the throne say: ‘Look! the tent of God is with humankind, and he will reside with them, and they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them. And he will wipe out</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">301 </span><span class="font6">every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dan. 2:44, 35 </span><span class="font6">“In the days of those kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed, nor shall the sovereignty thereof be left to another people; but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever... . And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Revealed Religion Brings Mankind Back to Glorious Status of Free Sons of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 8:21 </span><span class="font6">“The creation itself also will be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:1 </span><span class="font6">“For such freedom Christ set us free. Therefore stand fast, and do not let yourselves be confined again in a yoke of slavery.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 3:17 </span><span class="font6">&quot;Now Jehovah is the spirit; and where the spirit of Jehovah is, there is freedom.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion Is Revealed Religion from God Through His Son;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Natural Religion, a Study of Nature, Is Not Sufficient</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 2:9, 10 </span><span class="font6">“Just as it is written: ‘Eye has not seen and ear has not heard, neither have there been conceived in the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love him.’ For it is to us God has revealed them through his spirit, for the spirit searches into all things, even the deep things of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 16:25, 26 </span><span class="font6">“The preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the sacred secret which has been concealed for long-lasting times but has now been made manifest and has been made known through the prophetic scriptures among all the nations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dan. 2:22 </span><span class="font6">“He revealeth the deep and secret things; he know-eth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Amos 3:7 </span><span class="font6">“Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, except he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. </span><span class="font6">3:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font6">“You, when you read this, can realize the comprehension I have in the sacred secret of the Christ. In other generations this secret was not made known to the sons of men as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:17 </span><span class="font6">“God’s righteousness is being revealed by reason of faith and toward faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion Honors God and Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 2:17 </span><span class="font6">“Be in fear of God, have honor for the king.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 5:12, 13 </span><span class="font6">“The Lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive the power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. 7:12 “Amen! The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 19:1, 6 “ </span><span class="font6">‘Praise Jah, you people! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God.’ ‘Praise Jah, you people, because Jehovah our God, the Almighty, has begun to rule as king.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 150:6 </span><span class="font6">“Let everything that hath breath praise Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion Recognizes God’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Word as Supreme Authority</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 17:17 </span><span class="font6">“Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 8:20 </span><span class="font6">“To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 3:4 </span><span class="font6">“Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion Produces Fruits of the Spirit, Deepens Love</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Col. 1:5, 6, 9, 10 </span><span class="font6">“This hope you heard of before by the telling of the truth of that good news which has presented itself to you, even as it is bearing fruit and increasing In all the world just as it is doing also among you, from the day you heard and learned to know the undeserved kindness of God in truth. That is also why we, from the day we heard of it, have not ceased praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the accurate knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual discernment, in order to walk worthily of Jehovah to the end of fully pleasing him as you go on bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the accurate knowledge of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:22, 23 </span><span class="font6">“The fruitage of the spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith, mildness, self-control.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 1:8 </span><span class="font6">“If these things exist in you and overflow, they will prevent you from being either inactive or unfruitful regarding the accurate knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion Transforms Mind to God’s Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 12:2 </span><span class="font6">“Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and complete will of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 4:23, 24 </span><span class="font6">&quot;You should be made new in the forth actuating your mind, and should put on the new personality which was created according to God’s will in true righteousness and loving-kindness.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Jas. 1:25 “He who peers into the perfect law that belongs to freedom and who persists in it, this man, because he has become, not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, will be happy in his doing it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion Has No Part with This World</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 15:19 </span><span class="font6">“If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">No Compromise of True Religion with False Possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 6:14-17 </span><span class="font6">“Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what fellowship does light have with darkness? Further, what harmony is there between Christ and Belial? Or what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever? And what agreement does God’s temple have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said: ‘I shall reside among them and walk among them, and I shall be their God, and they will be my people.’ ‘ “Therefore get out from among them, and separate yourselves,” says Jehovah, “and quit touching the unclean thing.” ’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 10:21 </span><span class="font6">&quot;You cannot be drinking the cup of Jehovah and the cup of demons; you cannot be partaking of ‘the table of Jehovah’ and the table of demons.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark 2:21, 22 </span><span class="font6">“Nobody sews a patch of unshrunk cloth upon an old garment; if he does, its full strength pulls from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse. Also nobody puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is lost as well as the skins.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ the Perfect Exemplar of True Religious Worship</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 2:21 </span><span class="font6">“In fact, to this course you were called, because even Christ suffered for you, leaving you a model for you to follow his steps closely.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 7:26 </span><span class="font6">“For such a high priest as this was suitable for us, one of loving-kindness, guileless, undefiled, separated from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 2:5 </span><span class="font6">“Keep this mental attitude in you which was also in Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Description of True Christian Religion; It Means Action</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jas. 1:22, 26, 27 </span><span class="font6">“Become doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves with false reasoning. If any man seems to himself to be a formal worshiper and yet does not bridle his tongue, but goes on deceiving his own heart, this man’s form of worship is futile. The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">True Religion the Only Bond of Unity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 4:3, 4, 13 </span><span class="font6">“Earnestly endeavoring to observe the oneness of the spirit in the uniting bond of peace. One body there is, and one spirit,. .. until we all attain to the oneness in the faith and in the accurate knowledge of the Son of God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion Honors Men, Things</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 5:43 </span><span class="font6">“I have come in the name of my Father, but you do not receive me; if someone else arrived in his own name, you would receive that one.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. 11:4, 19, 20 </span><span class="font6">“For, as it is, if someone comes and preaches a Jesus other than the one we preached, or you receive a spirit other than what you received, or good news other than what you accepted, you easily put up with him. For you gladly put up with the unreasonable persons, seeing you are reasonable. In fact, you put up with whoever enslaves you. whoever devours what you have, whoever grabs what you have, whoever exalts himself over you, whoever strikes you in the face.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Worship Paid by False Religious Devotees Really Paid to Demons</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 10:20 </span><span class="font6">“The things which the nations sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Deut. 32:17 “They sacrificed unto demons, which were no God.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion Puts Traditions of Men First</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 15:3, 6-9 </span><span class="font6">“He said to them: ‘Why is it you also overstep the commandment of God because of your tradition? . . . you have made the word of God invalid because of your tradition. You hypocrites, Isaiah aptly prophesied about you, when he said: “This people honors me with their lips, yet their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep paying respect to me, because they teach commands of men as doctrines.” ’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion Produces Fruits of the Flesh, Deepens</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Selfishness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 5:19, 20 </span><span class="font6">“Now the works of the flesh are manifest, and they are fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, hatreds, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, divisions, sects.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 6:8 </span><span class="font6">“He who is sowing with a view to his flesh will reap corruption from his flesh, but he who is sowing with a view to the spirit will reap everlasting life from the spirit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion Degrades, Debases</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:21-32 </span><span class="font6">“They did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened. Although asserting they were wise, they became foolish and turned the glory of the incorruptible God into something like the image of corruptible man and of birds and fourfooted creatures and creeping things. Therefore God in keeping with the desires of their hearts gave them up to uncleanness, that their bodies might be dishonored among them, even those who exchanged the truth of God for the lie and venerated and rendered sacred service to the creation rather than the One who created, who is blessed forever. Amen. That is why God gave them up to disgraceful sexual appetites,... And just as they did not approve of holding God in accurate knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mental state, to do the things not fitting, filled as they were with all unrighteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 14:34 </span><span class="font6">“Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is a reproach to any people.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">False Religion Enslaves</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 6:24 </span><span class="font6">“No one can be a slave to two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot be slaves to God and to Riches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 6:16 </span><span class="font6">“Do you not know that if you keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, you are slaves of him because you obey him, either of sin with death in view or of obedience -with righteousness in view?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 2:19 </span><span class="font6">“While they are promising them freedom, they themselves are existing as slaves of corruption. For whoever is overcome by another is enslaved by this one.”</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark407"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark408"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Recognition and admission of a wrong condition or course of action, and a sincere sorrow with determination, motivated by a wholehearted desire to conform to right principles, to turn forever from such wrong course and take a course in harmony with God's will. Repentance that brings a right standing with God necessitates an accurate knowledge of God’s provisions and requirements and conforming oneself thereto by definite works of faith in harmony therewith. Sometimes repentance is used to mean a change from a favorable to an unfavorable action toward another.</span></p>

Which of the two did the will of his father?’ They said: ‘The latter.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Selfish Regret Is Not True Repentance, Brings No Favor from God</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark411"></a>Resurrection</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark412"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark413"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Resurrection is a restoration to life of the nonexistent dead. The Greek word, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">anastasis,</span><span class="font6"> means “a raising up”. It is an act of God dependent entirely upon God’s marvelous power through Christ and upon His memory of the dead. It is the reactivating of the life pattern of the creature, a transcription of which is on record with God, and is referred to as being in His memory. Resurrection does not involve the restoring of the original identical body of the creature. The life pattern is the personal life-long record of the creature built up by his thoughts and by the experiences in the life he has lived resulting from certain habits, leanings, mental abilities, memories and history. It is also a register of the individual’s intellectual growth and his characteristics, all of which make up one’s personality. Hence, according to God’s will for the creature, in a resurrection one is restored or re-created in either a human or a spirit body and yet retains his personal identity by the setting in motion again of the distinctive life pattern of that individual.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark414"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark415"></a>Hope of Resurrection Clearly Taught in Scriptures</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 25:8 “He </span><span class="font6">hath swallowed up death for ever; and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for Jehovah hath spoken it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 6:1, </span><span class="font6">2 “We have left the elementary doctrine ... not laying a foundation again, namely,., the resurrection of the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 11:17-19 </span><span class="font6">“By faith Abraham, when he was tested, as good as offered up Isaac, and the man that had gladly received the promises attempted to offer up his only-begotten son, although it had been said to him; “What will be called “your seed” will be through Isaac.’ But he reckoned that God was able to raise him up even from the dead; and from there he did receive him also in an illustrative way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 24:14, 15 </span><span class="font6">“In this manner I am rendering sacred service to the God of my forefathers, as I believe all the things set forth in the Law and written in the Prophets and I have hope toward God, which hope these men themselves also entertain, that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:14, 29, 34 </span><span class="font6">“But Peter stood up with the eleven and raised his voice and made this utterance to them: ‘Men of Judea and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give ear to my sayings. Brothers, it is allowable to speak with freeness of speech to you concerning the family head David, that he both deceased and was buried and his tomb is among us to this day. Actually David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, “Jehovah said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand.’ ” ’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 17:18-34 </span><span class="font6">“But certain ones of both the Epicurean and the Stoic philosophers took to conversing with him controversially, and some would say: ‘What is it this chatterer would like to tell?’ Others: ‘He seems to be a publisher of foreign deities.’ This was because he was declaring the good news of Jesus and the resurrection. So they laid hold of him and led him to the Areopagus, saying: ‘Can we get to know what this new teaching is which is spoken by you? For you are introducing some things that are strange to our ears.’ Paul . . . said: ‘...Because he has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has furnished a guarantee to all men in that he has resurrected him from the dead.’ Well, when they heard of a resurrection of the dead, some began to mock, while others said: ‘We will hear you about this even another time.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s Power of Resurrection Manifested in Resurrection Through Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 1:4 </span><span class="font6">“But who with power was declared God’s Son according to the spirit of holiness by means of resurrection from the dead—yes, Jesus Christ our Lord.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font6">Thess. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1:9, 10 </span><span class="font6">“You turned to God... to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised up from the dead, namely, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 11:25, 26 </span><span class="font6">“Jesus said to her: ‘I am the resurrection and the life. He that exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life, and everyone that is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 5:26 </span><span class="font6">“For just as the Father has in himself the gift of life, so he has granted to the Son to have also in himself the gift of life.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 15:20-22 </span><span class="font6">“However, now Christ has been raised up from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep in death. For since death is through a man, resurrection of the dead is also through a man. For just as in Adam all are dying, so also in the Christ all will be made alive.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 1:17, 18 “I </span><span class="font6">am the First and the Last, and the living one; and I became dead, but, look! I am living for ever and ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">More than 500 Witnesses of the Resurrected Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 15:6, 7 </span><span class="font6">“After that he appeared to upward of five hundred brothers at one time, the most of whom remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep in death.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:31, 32 </span><span class="font6">“He saw beforehand and spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he forsaken in Hades nor did his flesh see corruption.

Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bodies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 24:13-35 </span><span class="font6">“Now as they were conversing and discussing Jesus himself approached and began traveling with them; but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. .. . And commencing at Moses and all the Prophets he interpreted to them things pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures... . And as he was reclining with them at the meal he took the loaf, blessed it, broke it and began to hand it to them. At that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him; and he disappeared from them. And they said to each other: ‘Were not our hearts burning as he was speaking to us on the road, as he was fully opening up the Scriptures to us?’ . . . Now they themselves described the events on the road and how he became known to them by the breaking of the loaf.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 21:4-7 </span><span class="font6">“However, just as it was getting to be day, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not, of course, discern it was Jesus. ... He said to them: ‘Cast the net on the right side of the boat and you will find something.’ Then they cast it, but they were no longer able to draw it in because of the multitude of the fishes. Therefore that disciple whom Jesus used to love said to Peter: ‘It is the Master!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 20:14, 16 </span><span class="font6">“After saying these things, she turned back and viewed Jesus standing, but she did not discern it was Jesus.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus’ Resurrection Not of Same Body; He Merely Materialized Flesh and Blood to Be Seen and Believed</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 15:35-42, 45, 50 </span><span class="font6">“Nevertheless, someone will say: ‘How are the dead to be raised up? Yes, with what kind of body are they coming?' You unreasonable person! What you sow is not made alive unless first it dies; and as for what you sow, you sow, not the body that will develop, but a bare grain, it may be, of wheat or any one of the rest; but God gives it a body just as it has pleased him, and to each of the seeds its own body. Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish. And there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and that of the earthly bodies is a different kind. ... So also is the resurrection of the dead.... It is even so written: ‘The first man Adam became a living soul.’ The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. However, this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God’s kingdom, neither does corruption inherit incorruption.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 3:18 </span><span class="font6">“Why, even Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead you to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Col. 3:1 </span><span class="font6">“If, however, you were raised up with Christ, go on seeking the things above, where the Christ is seated at the right hand of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 6:11-13 </span><span class="font6">&quot;Likewise also you: reckon yourselves to be dead indeed with reference to sin but living with reference to God by Christ Jesus. Therefore do not let sin continue to rule as king in your mortal bodies that you should obey their desires. Neither go on presenting your members to sin as weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 2:3-6 </span><span class="font6">“Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, doing the things the flesh and the thoughts willed, and we were naturally children of wrath even as the rest. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us, made us alive together with the Christ, even when we were dead in trespasses —by undeserved kindness you have been saved—and he raised us up together and seated us together in the heavenly places in union with Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Those Faithful Men of Old Who Proved Integrity Before Jesus Will Be Raised to Life on Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 11:30-35 </span><span class="font6">“Rahab ... Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David as well as Samuel and the other prophets, . . . stopped the mouths of lions, stayed the force of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,. .. Women received their dead by resurrection; but other men were tortured because they would not accept release by some ransom, in order that they might attain a better resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 26:19 </span><span class="font6">&quot;Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hos. 13:14 </span><span class="font6">“I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death: O death, where are thy plagues? O Sheol, where is thy destruction?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 17:31 </span><span class="font6">“Because he has set a day in which he purposes to judge the inhabited earth in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and he has furnished a guarantee to all men in that he has resurrected him from the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Faithful Other Sheep Dying Now Have Hope of Resurrection on Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 10:16 </span><span class="font6">“And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring,,.. and they will become one flock, one shepherd.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 25:33, 34 </span><span class="font6">“And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. Then the king will say to those on his right: ‘Come, you who have my Father’s blessing, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the world’s foundation.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 37:9-11 </span><span class="font6">“For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait for Jehovah, they shall inherit the land. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">These Two Classes Likely to Be Raised Early After Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Job 14:13 </span><span class="font6">“That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 20:11, 12 </span><span class="font6">“And I saw a great white throne and the one seated on it. From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All Three Groups, Accounted Righteous, Have Resurrection of Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 5:25-29 </span><span class="font6">“Most truly </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">say to you, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who have given heed will live, and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All Others in God’s Memory, Reckoned Unrighteous, Raised for Judgment on Earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 23:40, 41, 43 “In </span><span class="font6">reply the other rebuked him and said: ‘Do you not fear God at all, now that you are in the same judgment? And we, indeed, justly so. for we are receiving in full what we deserve for things we did; but this man did nothing out of the way.’ And he [Jesus] said to him: ‘Truly I tell you today. You will be with me in Paradise.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 5:25-30 </span><span class="font6">“For just as the Father has In himself the gift of life, so he has granted to the Son to have also in himself the gift of life. And he has given him authority to do judging, because Son of man he is. .. . those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out,.. . those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment. .. . just as I hear, I judge, and the judgment that I render is righteous.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Awakening Must Wait Until Paradise Earth Established</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">After Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 23:42, 43 “And he went </span><span class="font6">on to say: ‘Jesus, remember me when you get into your kingdom.’ And he said to him: ‘Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. 20:11-13 “And I saw a great white throne and the one seated on it. From before him the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and scrolls were opened. But another scroll was opened; it is the scroll of life. And the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds. And the sea gave up those dead in it, and death and Hades gave up those dead in them, and they were judged individually according to their deeds.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All on Earth, Though Awakened Earlier, Do Not Have Guarantee of Life Until End of 1,000-Year</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Reign</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 20:5, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15 “The </span><span class="font6">rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. . . . Now as soon as the thousand years have been ended, Satan will be let loose out of his prison, and he will go out to mislead those nations in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war. The number of these is as the sand of the sea. And the Devil ■who was misleading them was hurled into the lake of fire and sulphur,... And death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire. Furthermore, whoever was not found written in the book of life was hurled into the lake of fire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Luke </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">20:35, 36 </span><span class="font6">“But those who have been counted worthy of gaining that system of things and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. In fact, neither can they die any more, for they are like the angels, and they are God’s children by being children of the resurrection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 15:57 </span><span class="font6">“But thanks to God, for he gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!”</span></p>

And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be any more. The former things have passed away.”</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark58"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark416"></a>Return of Christ</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark417"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark418"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jesus of Nazareth became the Christ of God, the Messiah, the Seed of God’s “woman” (organization), upon his baptism in the Jordan river A.D. 29 and thus his first official presence upon this earth as Jehovah's faithful witness continued for three and one half years. Before leaving the earth Christ promised to return again according to God’s purpose to establish his kingdom, to rule amidst his enemies, to judge the nations and to bring salvation and deliverance to faithful mankind. This second presence </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(par-ou-si'a)</span><span class="font6"> of Christ the Messiah was to be invisible and the unmistakable sign he gave shows conclusively that this return of Christ began in the year 1914. Since that time Christ has turned his attention toward earth's affairs and is dividing the peoples and educating the true Christians in preparation for their survival during the great storm of Armageddon, when all unfaithful mankind will be destroyed from the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Sign of Christ’s First Presence; Pictured by Jonah’s Preaching, His Being Swallowed Up 3 Days, and Restoration</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 11:29, 30 </span><span class="font6">“This generation is a wicked generation; it looks for a sign. But no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah. For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevltes, in the same way will the Son of man be also to this generation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jonah 3:2; 1:17; 2:10 </span><span class="font6">“Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.” “And Jehovah prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.” “And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Fulfilled in Jesus’ Preaching, His Being 3 Days in the Grave, and His Resurrection</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 12:40 </span><span class="font6">“For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 10:38-41 </span><span class="font6">“Jesus who was from Nazareth, how God anointed him with holy spirit and power, and he went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil, because God was with him. And we are witnesses of all the things he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; but they also did away with him by hanging him on a stake. God raised this One up on the third day and granted him to become visible, not to all the people, but to witnesses appointed beforehand by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Sign of Christ’s Second Presence the Coming in Clouds When Given Kingdom Rule</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Dan. 7:13, 14 </span><span class="font6">&quot;I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">At Jesus’ Trial, A. D. 33, High Priest Asks for This Sign of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ, but Jesus Testifies It</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Will Come in the Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 26:63, 64 </span><span class="font6">“So the high priest said to him: ‘By the living God I put you under oath to tell us whether you are the Christ the Son of God!’ Jesus said to him: ‘That was for you to say. Yet I say to you men, From henceforth you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Appearances of Jesus After His Resurrection Made in Different</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Materialized Bodies</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 20:14-16 </span><span class="font6">“After saying these things, she turned back and viewed Jesus standing, but she did not discern it was Jesus. Jesus said to her: ‘Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?’ She, imagining It was the gardener, said to him: ‘Sir, if you have carried him off, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.’ Jesus said to her: ‘Mary!’ Upon turning around, she said to him, in Hebrew: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">’Rabbonil’</span><span class="font6"> (which means ‘Teacher!’).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 24:15, 16, 30, 31 </span><span class="font6">“Now as they were conversing and discussing Jesus himself approached and began traveling with them; but their eyes were kept from recognizing him. And as he was reclining with them at the meal he took the loaf, blessed it, broke it and began to hand it to them. At that their eyes were fully opened and they recognized him; and he disappeared from them.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 15:4-8 </span><span class="font6">“And that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font6">was buried, yes, that he has been raised up the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that he appeared to upward of five hundred brothers at one time, the most of whom remain to the present, but some have fallen asleep in death. After that he appeared to James, then to all the apostles; but last of all he appeared also to me as if to one born prematurely.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Angels Testified at Jesus’ Ascension as a Spirit that Christ Would Return in Like Manner,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Quiet, Unobserved by the Public</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 1:9, 11 </span><span class="font6">“And after he had said these things, while they [only the disciples] were looking on, he was lifted up and a cloud caught him up from their vision. ... ‘Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into the sky? This Jesus who was received up from you into heaven will come thus in the same manner as you have beheld him going into heaven.’ ” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Disciples Asked for Evidence of</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:3 </span><span class="font6">“While he was sitting upon the mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: ‘Tell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the consummation of the system of things?’”</span></p>

All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ’s Return Invisible, as He Testified that Man Would Not See Him Again in Human Form</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 25:37-40 </span><span class="font6">“Then the righteous ones will answer him with the words: ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty, and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and receive you hospitably, or naked, and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to you?’ And in reply the king will say to them: 'Truly I say to you, To the extent that you did it to one of the least of these my brothers you did it to me.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ Also Invisible to His Ene</span><span class="font6">mies, the “Goats”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:23-26 </span><span class="font6">“Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look! here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There!’ do not believe it. For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will give great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the chosen ones. Look! I have forewarned you. Therefore, if people say to you, ‘Look! he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; ‘Look! he is in the inner chambers,’ do not believe it.”</span></p>

And she cries out in her pains and in her agony to give birth. And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was caught away to God and to his throne.

If you carefully keep yourselves from these things, you will prosper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 4:9-11 </span><span class="font6">“How is it that you are turning back again to the weak and inadequate elementary things and want to be slaves to them over again? You are scrupulously observing days and months and seasons and years.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Did Not Destroy Law by Breaking It, but Fulfilled and Completed It, for Moving It Out of the Way</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gal. 4:4, 5 </span><span class="font6">“God sent forth his Son, who was produced out of a woman and who came to be under law, that he might release by purchase those under law.”</span></p>

<h2><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark430"></a>Salvation</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark431"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark432"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Salvation is the deliverance from the destructive power of sin, a redemption from the ultimate end of sin which is everlasting death, annihilation. It means a restoration to divine favor and perfection after having sinned or missed God’s mark of perfection set for faithful mankind. Salvation as referred to in the Bible may either be (1) the preserving of one alive from trouble or an impending immediate disaster or (2) the opportunity to receive everlasting life in a state of peace, happiness and prosperity. Salvation is not an act of divine justice but rather an act of divine mercy. It is a justification or a being declared righteous granted by God the Superior to a handicapped inferior. As an act of mercy it is the withholding (1) of the consequences of disaster or (2) of the punishment of everlasting death</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">(annihilation) when either is justly due for failure to keep the divine law. Salvation that counts is not a self-salvation, a salvation by works, a salvation by law or a universal salvation, as these are all unclean religious fallacies.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark433"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark434"></a>Jehovah God a Savior from Disaster and Trouble</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Ex. 15:2 “Jehovah is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: this is my God, and I will praise him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Sam. 22:3 </span><span class="font6">“God, my rock, in him will I take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; my saviour, thou savest me from violence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jehovah God a Savior to Everlasting Life</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 Tim. 4:8, 10 “But godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come. For to this end we are working hard and exerting ourselves, because we have rested our hope on a living God, who is a Savior of all kinds of men, especially of faithful ones.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Also: Jude 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">A Merciful God, Jehovah Alone Justifies, Declares Righteous to Salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Deut. 4:31 </span><span class="font6">&quot;For Jehovah thy God is a merciful God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 8:33 </span><span class="font6">“God is the One who declares them righteous.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 1:3, 5 </span><span class="font6">“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for according to his great mercy he gave us a new birth to a living hope . .. who are being safeguarded by God’s power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last period of time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God Provides the Chief Agent of Life, the Savior Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Acts 5:30, 31 “The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, whom your hands had killed, hanging him upon a stake. God exalted this one as Chief Agent and Savior to his right hand, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Luke 1:68, 69 “Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, because he has turned his attention and performed deliverance toward his people. And he has raised up a mighty savior for us in the house of David his servant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">See also: Luke 2:11; Eph. 5:23; 2 Tim. 1:10; 2 Pet. 1:11; Heb. 2:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus Christ Becomes the Savior of the New World of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Righteousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 4:42 </span><span class="font6">“We do not believe any longer on account of your talk; for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man is for a certainty the savior of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 John 4:14 </span><span class="font6">“We ourselves have beheld and are bearing witness that the Father has sent forth his Son as Savior of the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">All Salvation Depends upon Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 4:10, 12 </span><span class="font6">“That in the name of Jesus Christ... there is no salvation in anyone else, for there is not another name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must get saved.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s “Means of Saving”, the Ransom Sacrifice of the Man</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus, Must Be Accepted</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Luke 2:27-30 “And as the parents brought the young child Jesus ... he | Simeon] himself received it into his arms and blessed God and said: ‘Now, Sovereign Lord, you are letting your slave go free in peace according to your declaration; because my eyes have seen your means of saving. ’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Luke 3:6 “All humanity will see the saving means of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 28:28 </span><span class="font6">“Therefore let it be known to you that this the means by which God saves has been sent out to the nations; they will certainly listen to it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mark 10:45 “For even the Son of man came, not to be ministered to, but to minister and to give his soul a ransom in exchange for many.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Salvation a Goal to Be Attained</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">—Not ‘Once Saved Always Saved’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 3:12-14 </span><span class="font6">“Not that I have already received it or am already made perfect, but I am pursuing to see if I may also lay hold on that for which I have also been laid hold on by Christ Jesus. Brothers, I do not yet consider myself as having laid hold on it; but there is one thing about it: Forgetting the things behind and stretching forward to the things ahead, I am pursuing down toward the goal for the prize of the calling above and which God extends in Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If ‘Once Saved Always Saved’, Why Did God Reject Israel</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Whom He Saved from Egypt?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jude 5 </span><span class="font6">“I desire to remind you, despite your knowing all things once for all time, that Jehovah, although he saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed those not showing faith.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 3:17 </span><span class="font6">“Moreover, with whom did God become disgusted for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Salvation to Life Involves Time and Is Not Completed When One Becomes a Christian</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 1:18 </span><span class="font6">“For the speech about the torture stake is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is God’s power.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 4:7, 8 “I </span><span class="font6">have fought </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">right fight, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">have run the course to the finish, I have observed the faith. From this time on there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me as a reward in that day, yet not only to me, but also to all those who have loved his manifestation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Follow in the “Way of Salvation”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 16:17 </span><span class="font6">“These men are slaves of the Most High God, who </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">publishing to you the way of salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Full faith in Jesus as Ransomer necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 1:8, 9 </span><span class="font6">“Though you never saw him, you love him f Christ Jesus], Though you are not looking upon him at present, yet you exercise faith in him and are greatly rejoicing with an unspeakable and glorified joy, as you receive the accomplished end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Growth to salvation necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Pet. 2:2 </span><span class="font6">“And, as newborn infants, form a longing for the unadulterated milk belonging to the word, that through it you may grow to salvation.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Soundness of mind and godly devotion necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Titus </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2:11-14 </span><span class="font6">“For the undeserved kindness of God which brings salvation to all kinds of men has been manifested, instructing us to repudiate ungodliness and worldly desires and to live with soundness of mind and righteousness and godly devotion amid this present system of things, while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of our Savior Christ Jesus, who gave himself for us that by a ransom he might release us from every kind of lawlessness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Endure tribulation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Cor. </span><span class="font6">1:6 “Whether we are in tribulation, it is for your comfort and salvation.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Embrace the good news as power for salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rom. 1:16 “For I am not ashamed of the good news; it is, in fact God’s power for salvation to everyone having faith, to the Jew first as well as to the Greek.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Share in making a public declaration of the good news</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rom. 10:10 “For with the heart one exercises faith for righteousness, but with the mouth one makes public declaration for salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pray for salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 1:19 </span><span class="font6">“For I know this will result in my salvation through your supplication.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 10:1 </span><span class="font6">“Brothers, the goodwill of my heart and my supplication to God for them are, indeed, for their salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Obedience to Christ necessary</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 5:9 </span><span class="font6">“He became responsible for everlasting salvation to all those obeying him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Repentance </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">necessary for mistakes made</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cor. 7:9, 10 </span><span class="font6">“Now I rejoice, not because you were just saddened, but because you were saddened into repenting, for you were saddened in a godly way, that you might suffer no damage in anything due to us. For sadness in a godly way makes for repentance to salvation which is not to be regretted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Awake as Salvation Nears</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 13:11 “Do </span><span class="font6">this, too, because you know the season, that it is already the hour for you to awake from sleep, for now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Keep Shielding the Mind with</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hope of Salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">1 Thess. 5:8 “But as for us who belong to the day, let us keep our senses and have on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 6:17 </span><span class="font6">“Also accept the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, that is, God's word.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Work Out Salvation with Fear and Trembling</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Phil. 2:12 </span><span class="font6">“My beloved ones. . . now much more readily during my absence, keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Study of Scriptures Necessary for Salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:15 </span><span class="font6">“From infancy you have known the holy writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through the faith in connection with Christ Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Self-Salvation or Self-Righteousness Impossible, a </span><span class="font6">Fallacy</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 16:15 </span><span class="font6">[Jesus speaking to the Pharisees] “He said to them: ‘You are those who declare yourselves righteous before men, but God knows your hearts; because what is lofty among men is a disgusting thing in God’s sight.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God Reproves Job for SelfRighteousness</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Job 32:1; 40:6, 8 </span><span class="font6">“So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.” “Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,... Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Salvation or Righteousness by Works of Character Development Impossible. This Is</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Hypocrisy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 23:27, 28 </span><span class="font6">“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you resemble whitewashed graves, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of every kind of uncleanness. In that way you also, outwardly indeed, appear righteous to men,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font6">Inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Salvation or Being Declared Righteous by the Law of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Moses Impossible</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 3:19, 20 </span><span class="font6">“Now we know that all the things the Law says it addresses to those under the Law, so that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become liable to God for punishment. Therefore by works of law no flesh will be declared righteous before him, for by law is the accurate knowledge of sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Universal Salvation Unscriptural, a Fallacy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">No salvation for the wicked</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Ps. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">119:155 </span><span class="font6">“Salvation is far from the wicked; for they seek not thy statutes.”</span></p>

For if by one man’s trespass many died, the undeserved kindness of God and his free gift with the undeserved kindness by the one man Jesus Christ abounded much more to many. So, then, as through one trespass the result to men of all kinds was condemnation, likewise also through one act of justification the result to men of all kinds is a declaring of them righteous for life.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The “last days” are the last days of Satan's rule over the earth and mankind. The sign is composed of happenings foretold as visible evidence that the consummation of Satan’s system of things has begun, that the uninterruptedness of Satan’s rule of earth has ended. It is visible evidence that Christ Jesus has been enthroned in heaven as King and that he has begun the destruction of Satan’s rule by ousting Satan and his demons from heaven and that he has turned his invisible presence toward the earth to gather out all persons of good will toward God. It constitutes evidence that the transition period between the rule of Satan and that of Christ has begun, and it precedes the complete destruction of Satan and his entire organization visible and Invisible in the accomplished end at Armageddon. Occurrence of one or even several happenings together is not sufficient to constitute evidence; all must occur concurrently upon one generation in the foretold series or sequences to make up the one composite sign. At least 39 happenings comprise the sign.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark481"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark482"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah God sets his own high standard of righteousness, the glory of God, as a mark of perfection that all his creatures are expected and required to maintain. Missing or failing to meet this mark is called sin. “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” (Rom. 3:23) So the Scriptures further say of sin, “Everyone who practices sin is also practicing lawlessness, and so sin is lawlessness.” “All unrighteousness is sin; and yet there is a sin that does not incur death.” (1 John 3:4; 5:17) Hence there are two kinds of sins, Scripturally speaking: 1. Inherited, which “does not incur death”, i.e., from which there is hope of being released; 2. Willful, which brings a sentence of everlasting destruction. The Greek word for sin originally meant to miss, as to miss one's road, and later came to mean to fail of doing, as to miss one’s point, to go wrong. The Hebrew word for sin also originally meant to miss, hence to fail; for example, Judges 20:16; Proverbs 8:36; </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">19:2, footnote.</span></p>

And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Gen. 3:6 “And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.”</span></p>

For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, because they are understood by the things made, even his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcusable; because, although they knew God, they did not glorify him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their unintelligent heart became darkened.”</span></p>

For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there resides nothing good; for ability to wish is present with me, but ability to work out what is right is not present. I find, then, this law in my case: that when I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me. I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within, but I behold in my members another law warring against the law<sup>7</sup> of my mind and leading me captive to sin’s law<sup>7</sup> that is in my members.” “The law of sin and of death.”</span></p>

And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin croucheth at the door; and unto thee shall be its desire; but do thou rule over it.”</span></p>

For the hearers of law are not the ones righteous before God, but the doers of law will be declared righteous.” “For above we have made the charge that Jews as well as Greeks are all under sin; just as it is written: ‘There is not a righteous man, not even one; there is not a one that understands, there is not a one that seeks for God. All men have deflected, all of them together have become worthless; there is not a one that does good, there is not so much as one.’ ”</span></p>

Really I would not have come to know-sin if it had not been for the Law, and, for example, I would not have known covetousness if the Law had not said, ‘You must not covet.’ But sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, worked out in me covetousness of every kind, for apart from law sin was dead. In fact, I was once alive apart from law; but when the commandment arrived, sin came to life again, but I died. And the commandment which was to life, this I found to be to death. For sin, receiving an inducement through the commandment, seduced me and killed me through it. Wherefore, on its part, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. Did, then, what is good become death to me? Never may that happen! But sin did, that it might be shown as sin working out death for me through that which is good; that sin might become far more sinful through the commandment.”</span></p>

He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins except one, God?’ But Jesus, having discerned immediately by his spirit that they were reasoning that way in themselves, said to them: ‘Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, “Your sins are forgiven,” or to say, “Get up and pick up your cot and walk”? But in order for you men to know that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins upon the earth,’—he said to the paralytic: ‘I say to you, Get up, pick up your cot, and go to your home.’ At that he did get up and immediately picked up his cot and walked out in front of them all. so that they were all simply carried away and they glorified God, saying: ‘We never saw the like of it.’ ”</span></p>

Both are drawn from root verbs meaning “to breathe” or “to blow”. “Spirit” as used in the Bible has at least seven different senses or applications of meaning to describe something windlike, viz., as applying to (1) Jehovah God, (2) Christ Jesus, (3) angels, (4) life force, (5) mental disposition, (6) inspired expression and (7) active force of God. This variety of applications is possible in that all are windlike, all are invisible to the human eye and yet all produce effects that are visible, as the elementary meaning of the original words indicates.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Tithes Paid by Israelites Under the Law</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 18:11-14 </span><span class="font6">“The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself: ‘O God, I thank you I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.

And thou shalt eat before Jehovah thy God, in the place which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, the tithe of thy grain, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd and of thy flock; that thou mayest learn to fear Jehovah thy God always. And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, because the place is too far from thee, which Jehovah thy God shall choose, to set his name there, when Jehovah thy God shall bless thee; then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in thy hand, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose: and thou shalt bestow the money for whatsoever thy soul desireth, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong-drink, or for whatsoever thy soul asketh of thee; and thou shalt eat there before Jehovah thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou and thy household.

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Manifestation of Active Force as a Special Gift, the Eighth in</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rating</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 12:4-11, 28 </span><span class="font6">“Now there are varieties of gifts, but there is the same spirit; .. . But the manifestation of the spirit is given to each one for a beneficial purpose. For example, to one there is given through the spirit speech of wisdom,... to another different tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues. But all these operations the one and the same spirit performs, making a distribution to each one respectively just as it wills. And God has set the respective ones in the congregation, first, apostles; second, prophets; third, teachers; then powerful works; then gifts of healings; helpful services, abilities to direct, different tongues.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 10:45, 46 </span><span class="font6">“The free gift of the holy spirit was being poured out also upon people of the nations. For they heard them speaking with tongues and glorifying God.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ability Through Spirit Came from Christ Jesus</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:1-6, 32, 33 </span><span class="font6">“Now while the day of the feast of Pentecost was in progress they were all together at the same place, and suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze, and it filled the whole house in which they were sitting. And tongues as if of fire became visible and were distributed to them, and one sat upon each one of them, and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance. As it was, there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, reverent men, from every nation of those under heaven.... each one heard them speaking in his own language. ‘This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear.’ ’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gifts Administered by Apostles or in Their Presence</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 19:1-7 </span><span class="font6">“In the course of events, while Apollos was in Corinth, Paul . . . found some disciples, and he said to them: ‘Did you receive holy spirit when you became believers?’ They said to him: ‘Why, we have never heard whether there is a holy spirit.' . . . And when Paul laid his hands upon them, the holy spirit came upon them, and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying. All together, there were about twelve men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 8:14-18 </span><span class="font6">“When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they dispatched Peter and John to them, and these went down and prayed for them to get holy spirit. For it had not yet fallen upon any one of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they went to laying their hands upon them, and they began to receive holy spirit. Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles the spirit was given, he offered them money.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Enabled Witnessing of Good News to Those of Another</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Language</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 2:7, 8, 11 </span><span class="font6">“Indeed, they were astonished and began to wonder and say: ‘See here, all these who are speaking are Galileans, are they not? And yet how is it we are listening each one of us to his own language in which we were born? ... we hear them speaking in our tongues about the magnificent things of God.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Not All in Early Congregation Had Gift</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 12:27, 28, 30, 31 “Now </span><span class="font6">you are Christ’s body, and members individually. And God has set the respective ones in the congregation,... Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all are translators, are they? But keep striving after the greater gifts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Understanding of Witness the Important Thing</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 14:5-9 </span><span class="font6">“Now I would like for all of you to speak in tongues, but I prefer that you prophesy. Indeed, he that prophesies is greater than he that speaks in tongues, unless, in fact, he translates, that the congregation may receive upbuilding. But at this time, brothers, if I should come speaking to you in tongues, what good would I do you unless I spoke to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching? ... In the same way also, unless you through the tongue utter speech easily understood, how will it be known what is being spoken? You will, in fact, be speaking into the air.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">If Tongue Was Unknown to Congregation, Translation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Was to Be Given Also</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 14:10-19 </span><span class="font6">“It may be that there are so many kinds of speech-sounds in the world, and yet no kind is without meaning. If, then, I do not understand the force of the speech-sound, I shall be a foreigner to the one speaking and the one speaking will be a foreigner to me.... Therefore let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may translate. For if I am praying in a tongue, it is my gift of the spirit that is praying, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is to be done, then? I will pray with the gift of the spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding. I will sing praise with the gift of the spirit, but I will also sing praise with my understanding. Otherwise, if you offei’ praise with a gift of the spirit, how will the man occupying the seat of the ordinary person say Amen to your giving of thanks, since he does not know what you are saying? True, you give thanks in a right way, but the other man is not being built up. I thank God, I speak in more tongues than all of you do. Nevertheless, in a congregation I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might also instruct others verbally, than ten thousand words in a tongue.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Intended to Operate as a Sign to Unbelievers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. </span><span class="font6">14:21-25 “In the Law it is written: ‘ “With the tongues of foreigners and with the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and yet not even then will they give heed to me,” says Jehovah.’ Consequently, tongues are for a sign, not to the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be</span><span class="font6">lievers, but to the unbelievers, whereas prophesying is, not for the unbelievers, but for the believers. Therefore, if the whole congregation comes together to one place and they all speak in tongues, but ordinary people or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are mad? But if you are all prophesying and any </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">unbeliever or ordinary person </span><span class="font6">comes in, he is put right by them all, he is closely examined by all, the secrets of his heart become manifest, so that he will prostrate himself and worship God, declaring, ‘God is really among you.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Was Given to Edify, Not to Exalt the Creature by a Display</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of Gift</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 14:26-28 </span><span class="font6">“What is to be done, then, brothers? When you come together, one has a psalm, another has a teaching, another has a revelation, another has a tongue, another has an interpretation. Let all things take place for upbuilding. And if someone speaks in a tongue, let it be limited to two or three at the most, and in turns, and let someone translate. But if there be no translator, let him keep silent in the congregation and speak to himself and to God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 13:1 </span><span class="font6">“If </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a sounding piece of brass or a clashing cymbal.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Was to Continue Only as Long as Congregation in Early</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Development</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 13:8, 11, 12 </span><span class="font6">“Whether there are tongues, they will cease: . . . When I was a babe, I used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe; but now that I have become a man. I have done away with the trails of a babe. For at present we see in hazy outline by means of a metal mirror, but then it will be face to face. At present I know partially, but then I shall know accurately even as I am accurately known.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Passed Away as Gift After Death of Apostles</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Cor. 13:8-10 </span><span class="font6">“Love never fails. But whether there are gifts of prophesying, they will be done away with; whether there are tongues, they will cease; . . . For we have partial knowledge and we prophesy partially; but when that which is complete arrives, that which is partial will be done away with.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Transmigration Would Make It Impossible for All Souls to Be Sinners Through One Man; Would Not Make a Son Subject to Inheritance of Good or Evil Tendencies from His Father or Suffer Because of His Father’s Sins</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rom. 5:12-19 </span><span class="font6">“Just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned —. ... by one man’s trespass many died,... by the trespass of the one man death ruled as king through that one,... through one trespass the result to men of all kinds was condemnation.”</span></p>

Note two things about this: (a) Actual combat against Satan and his demon horde in heaven. This began with Christ's enthronement, A. D. 1914, and was cut short A.D. 1918, to be resumed at Armageddon against Satan and his invisible and visible hosts, (b) In between, while this tribulation is cut short, there is a work of proclaiming the Kingdom and its day of vengeance, and of exposing Satan’s filthy organization, interfering with his hold upon mankind and wasting the pastures of false religion, and bringing confusion among the ranks of Satan’s earthly organization.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">(2) The anguish and sorrows brought upon the peoples of earth by reason of Satan’s desperate all-out attempt to crush all truth and righteousness out of the earth and to turn all men against God before Armageddon, with a view to a depopulated earth. By playing upon man’s sinfulness and selfishness, and by his oppressive demonic and visible organization, Satan has whipped up violence and great distress.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(la) Christ the King’s Action in Literal Warfare Against Satan’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">World A.D. 1914-1918</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 12:5-9 </span><span class="font6">&quot;And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is destined to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.... And war broke out In heaven: Michael and his angels battled with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels battled but it did not prevail, neither was a place found for them any longer in heaven. So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ps. 110:2 </span><span class="font6">“Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 10:18 </span><span class="font6">“At that he said to them: ‘I began to behold Satan already fallen like lightning from heaven.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. 18:2 “He cried out with a strong voice, saying: ‘She has fallen! Babylon the great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling-place of demons and a lurking-place of every unclean exhalation and a lurking-place of every unclean and hated bird!’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A time of rejoicing for all righteous creatures</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Rev. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">12:10-12 </span><span class="font6">“And I heard a loud voice in heaven say: ‘Now have come to pass the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brothers has been hurled down, who accuses them day and night before our God! ... On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them!’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Luke 21:28 “But as these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This action temporarily halted when Satan’s organization was completely cleaned out of heaven</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:7, 8, 21, 22, 14 </span><span class="font6">“For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress. For then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again. In fact, unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the chosen ones those days will be cut short. And this good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the Inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 12:26, 27 </span><span class="font6">“At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, saying: ‘Yet once more I will set not only the earth but also the heaven in commotion.’ Now the expression ‘Yet once more’ signifies the removal of the things being shaken as things that have been made, in order that the things not being shaken may remain.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark 13:20 </span><span class="font6">“Unless Jehovah had cut short the days, no flesh would be saved. But on account of the chosen ones that he has chosen he has cut short the days.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Allowing this interim is a great mercy of God</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Pet. 3:9, 15 </span><span class="font6">“Jehovah is not slow respecting his promise, as some people consider slowness, but he is patient with you because he does not desire any to be destroyed but desires all to attain to repentance. Furthermore, consider the patience of our Lord as salvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 14:6, 7 </span><span class="font6">“I saw another angel flying in midheaven and he had everlasting good news to declare as glad tidings to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying in a loud voice: ‘Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of the judgment by him has arrived.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isa. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1:9 </span><span class="font6">“Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Provides opportunity for remnant to be gathered and prove integrity</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 13:29 </span><span class="font6">“Furthermore, people will come from eastern parts and western, and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:45-47 </span><span class="font6">“Who really is the faithful and discreet slave whom his master appointed over his domestics to give them their food at the proper time? Happy is that slave if his master on arriving finds him doing so. Truly I say to you, He will appoint him over all his belongings.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 18:7, 8 </span><span class="font6">“Certainly, then, shall not God cause justice to be done to his chosen ones who cry aloud to him day and night, even though he is longsuffering toward them? I tell you, He will cause justice to be done to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man arrives, will he really find this faith on the earth?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mal. 3:1-3 </span><span class="font6">“The Lord, whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts. But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah offerings in righteousness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 12:1 </span><span class="font6">“And in that day thou shalt say, I will give thanks unto thee, O Jehovah; for though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isa. 6:5-8 “Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts. Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven. And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying. Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 52:11 </span><span class="font6">“Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; cleanse yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Matt. 24:16-18 “Then let those in Judea begin fleeing to the mountains. Let the man on the housetop not come down to take the goods out of his house; and let the man in the field not return to the house to pick up his outer garment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 45:1 and Rev. 3:7 </span><span class="font6">“Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut.” “And to the angel of the congregation in Philadelphia write: These are the things he says who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens so that no one will shut, and shuts so that no one opens.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Allows other sheep to hear and be saved</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 10:16 </span><span class="font6">“And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Matt. 25:31-33 “When the Son of man arrives in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit down on his glorious throne. And all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 22:17 </span><span class="font6">“And the spirit and the bride keep on saying, ‘Come!’ And let anyone hearing say, ‘Come!’ And let anyone thirsting come; let anyone that wishes take life’s water free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">War to be resumed and completed by Christ at Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Isa. 28:21 </span><span class="font6">“For Jehovah will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 6:2 </span><span class="font6">“And I saw, and, look! a white horse, and the one seated upon it had a bow, and a crown was given him, and he went forth conquering and to complete his conquest.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Pet. 3:7, 10 </span><span class="font6">“But by the same word the heavens and the earth that are now are stored up for fire and are being reserved to the day of judgment and of destruction of the ungodly men. Yet Jehovah’s day will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a hissing noise, but the elements being intensely hot will be dissolved, and earth and the works in it will be disclosed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">1 Thess. 5:3 </span><span class="font6">“Whenever it is that they are saying, ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:20, 21 </span><span class="font6">“Keep praying that your flight may not occur in wintertime nor on the sabbath day; for then there will be great tribulation such as has not occurred since the world’s beginning until now, no, nor will occur again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(lb) Distress Brought on Satan’s Organization Between 1918 and</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 21:25 </span><span class="font6">“Also there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 1:7 </span><span class="font6">“Look! he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those who pierced him; and all the tribes of the earth will beat themselves in grief because of him. Yes, Amen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 6:15-17 </span><span class="font6">“And the kings of the earth and the top-ranking ones and the military command</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">ers </span><span class="font6">and the rich and the strong ones and every slave and free person hid themselves in the dens and in the rock-masses of the mountains. And they keep saying to the mountains and to the rock-masses: ‘Fall over us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?'&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 16:21 </span><span class="font6">“And a great hail with every stone about the weight of a talent descended out of heaven upon the men, and yet the men blasphemed God due to the plague of hail, because the plague of it was unusually great.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 9:5, 6 </span><span class="font6">“And it was granted the locusts, not to kill them, but that these should be tormented five months, and the torment upon them was as torment by a scorpion when it strikes a man. And in those days the men will seek death but will by no means find it, and they will desire to die but death keeps fleeing from them.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God’s </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">servants have part in this proclamation work; no physical violence used</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Cor. 10:3-5 </span><span class="font6">“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not wage warfare according to what we are in the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but powerful by God for overturning strongly entrenched things. For we are overturning reasonings and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are bringing every thought into captivity to make it obedient to the Christ.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Eph. 6:12 </span><span class="font6">“Because we have a fight, not against blood and flesh, but against the governments, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the wicked spirit forces in the heavenly places.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">False religionists and oppressors of the people discomfited, bring opposition and persecution to God’s servants</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Jer.</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> 25:36 “A </span><span class="font6">voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for Jehovah layeth waste their pasture.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 13:28 </span><span class="font6">“There is where your weeping and the gnashing of your teeth will be, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves thrown outside.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Many will come forth to stand with God’s servants, to their salvation</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 7:9-17 </span><span class="font6">“After these things I saw, and, look! a great crowd, which no man was able to number, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, and there were palm branches in their hands. And they keep on crying with a loud voice, saying: ‘Salvation we owe to our God, who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb.’... ‘These are the ones that come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.... because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will shepherd them, and will guide them to fountains of waters of life.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mic. 4:1-3 </span><span class="font6">“But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of Jehovah’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it. And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem; and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into prunlng-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Zech. 8:22, 23 </span><span class="font6">“Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Jehovah. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jonah 3:5, 10 </span><span class="font6">“And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) Woes upon People, Wickedness, All Caused by Satan</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Isa. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">14:16, 17, 20 </span><span class="font6">“They that see thee shall gaze at thee, they shall consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms; that made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew the cities thereof; that let not loose his prisoners to their home? ... thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall not be named for ever.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Heb. 2:14, 15 </span><span class="font6">“Therefore, since the ‘young children’ are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly partook of the same things, that through his death he might destroy the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil, and might emancipate all those who for fear of death were subject to slavery all through their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">John 8:44 </span><span class="font6">“You are from your father the Devil and you wish to do the desires of your father. That one was a manslayer when he began, and he did not stand fast in the truth, because truth is not in him. When he speaks the lie, he speaks according to his own disposition, because he is a liar and the father of the lie.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 10:38 </span><span class="font6">“He went through the land doing good and healing all those oppressed by the Devil, because God was with him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Increased now because Satan knows Armageddon near</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 12:12 </span><span class="font6">“On this account be glad, you heavens and you who reside in them! Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 6:4-8 </span><span class="font6">“And another came forth, a fiery-colored horse, and to the one seated upon it there was granted to take peace away from the earth so that they should slaughter one another, and a great sword was given him. And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, ‘Come!’ And I saw. and, look! a black horse, and the one seated upon it had a pair of scales in his hand. And I heard a voice as if in the midst of the four living creatures say: ‘A quart of wheat for a day’s wage, and three quarts of barley for a day’s wage; and do not harm the olive oil and the wine.’ And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, ‘Come!’ And I saw, and, look! a pale horse, and the one seated upon it had the name Death. And Hades was closely following him. And authority was given them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with a long sword and with food shortage and with deadly plague and by the wild beasts of the earth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Persecution to break Jehovah’s witnesses Satan’s main effort</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 12:13, 17 </span><span class="font6">“Now when the dragon saw it was hurled down to the earth, it persecuted the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">woman</span><span class="font6"> that gave birth to the male child. And the dragon grew wrathful at the woman, and went off to wage war with the remaining ones of her seed, who observe the commandments of God and have the work of bearing witness to Jesus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">This permitted by Jehovah to test his servants and show Satan’s world worthy of destruction</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Rev. 2:10 </span><span class="font6">“Do not be afraid of the things you are destined to suffer. Look! the Devil will keep on throwing some of you into prison that you may be fully put to the test, and that you may have tribulation ten days. Prove yourself faithful even with the danger of death, and I will give you the crown of life.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Prov. 27:11 </span><span class="font6">“My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproach-eth me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Mark 13:9 </span><span class="font6">“As for you, look out for yourselves; people will deliver you up to local courts and you will be beaten in synagogues and be put on the stand before governors and kings for my sake for the purpose of a witness to them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ezek. 38:10-39:4 </span><span class="font6">“Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall come to pass in that day, that things shall come into thy mind, and thou shalt devise an evil device: and thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates; to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn thy hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and against the people that are gathered out of the nations, that have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the middle of the earth.... and thou shalt come up against my people Israel, as a cloud to cover the land: it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring thee against my land, that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.” “And I will turn thee about, and will lead thee on, and will cause thee to come up from the uttermost parts of the north; and I will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel; and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand. Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy hordes, and the peoples that are with thee: I will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Satan tries to thwart God’s purpose of gathering remnant of</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Christ’s body, and of having earthly other sheep survive</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Armageddon</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> Thess. 2:1 </span><span class="font6">“Brothers, respecting the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Rev. 16:14-16 “They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go forth to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. ‘Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his parts of shame.’ And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Har-Magedon.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Zech. 3:1, 2; 4:9 </span><span class="font6">“And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee,... is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?” “The hands of Zerub-babel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Distress will increase until Armageddon; no world conversion possible</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">2 Tim. 3:1-5, 13 </span><span class="font6">“But know this, that in the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, selfassuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, without gratitude, with no loving-kindness, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without selfcontrol, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with self-esteem, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God, having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away. . . . wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse, misleading and being misled.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:37 </span><span class="font6">“For just as the days of Noah were, so the presence of the Son of man will be.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Gen. 6:13 </span><span class="font6">“And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.” </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Such distresses are a sign of the last days</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Matt. 24:3-10, 33-35 </span><span class="font6">“While he was sitting upon the mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately, saying: ‘Tell us, When will these things be, and what will be the sign of your presence and of the consummation of the system of things?’... Jesus said... ‘For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be food shortages and earthquakes in one place after another. All these things are a beginning of pangs of distress. Then people will deliver you up to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of my name. Then, also, many will be stumbled and will betray one another and will hate one another... Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will by no means pass away.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Luke 21:25, 31 </span><span class="font6">“Also there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation....

<h2><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark539"></a>Worship of Mary</span></h2>
<h3><a name="bookmark540"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark541"></a>DEFINITION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The unscriptural practice based upon the false teachings (1) that Christ Jesus’ earthly mother, Mary, was born of ‘immaculate conception&quot;, that is to say, that, by the special grace of God, she was freed at the moment of conception from inheriting the “original sin” of Adam; (2) that she is the “mother of God”; (3) that she is “ever virgin”, never having borne any other children; (4) that she is the “woman” mentioned at Genesis 3:15 and will bruise the serpent’s head; (5) that she is the “spiritual mother” of the “church”; (6) that prayers addressed to her as an intercessor or mediatrix are heard and answered by God; (7) that she was “taken up body and soul into heaven” in an “assumption”; (8) and that honor and veneration are due her. A practice opposed to the Scriptures and that turns attention and worship away from Jehovah God and Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark542"></a><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark543"></a>ORIGIN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font6">The worship of Mary as an application of the false doctrine of the Communion of Saints is not contained even in the earlier forms of the Apostles’ Creed of apostate Christianity and was totally unknown to true Christians. Although Tertullian (A.D. 155-222) was claimed to be among the first to imply the view that “martyrs” could obtain graces and blessings for others </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Cath. Encycl.,</span><span class="font6"> Vol. XV, p. 459), “devotion to The Blessed Virgin” was not extensively taught until probably well after the sixth century and did not reach full development until the later Middle Ages. The pronouncement of the assumption of Mary as an infallible dogma of the Roman Catholic Church was not made until 1950. Such worship, especially of “mother and child”, finds its real origin in pagan Babylon with Semiramis (“queen of heaven”) and Nimrod her son.</span></p>

Wonder not that I said to thee: You must be born again. The spirit breath-eth where he will and thou hear-est his voice: but thou knowest not whence he cometh and whither he goeth. So is every one that is born of the Spirit.”</span></p>

If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written: The first man Adam was made into a living soul: the last Adam into a quickening spirit. Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly. Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly. Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess in-corruption.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">satisfactorily and “make sure of all things” for your hearer’s benefit. You will have to know your book, its themes, and its subjects for study to put it to good use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bible Studies: </span><span class="font6">Always carry </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things” </span><span class="font6">with you to your home Bible studies. These small group gatherings in private homes allow for full expression on the part of everyone present. Maybe you will need additional scriptures to help settle an idea in the mind of your student, or maybe his question is not fully answered in the paragraph of the publication you are studying. Or he may get off on a side issue that will need to be cleared up before you go on. This book may aid you to get the answer quickly, especially if you use the division of the book “Subjects for Study”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The Family Study: </span><span class="font6">Jehovah admonishes you to train your children in the right way. The family study leader, whether it be the father or the mother, can teach the children from this book as well as from any other publication of the Society. With the minds of the children so full of “whys”, doubtless this book will help the children to put their full confidence in the highest authority, Jehovah’s Word. Parents may have daily studies with their children in one of the Society’s publications, and this can also be done with this publication by taking page after page and reading and discussing the scriptures. Certainly if you train up a child in the way he should go he will never depart from it. Train your children to use their own Bible as you conduct your Bible study with </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”.</span><span class="font6"> Familiarity with the scriptures and their location in the Bible is very important to impress upon the minds of the children early in life, so they will know the importance of the Scriptures. Remember, your children are going to be ministers of God. Train them from their youth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Casual Witnessing: </span><span class="font6">Why not carry this handy book with you to work, when you go visiting, and on Bible studies? Have it with you in your everyday activities. When you start a conversation on almost any subject, you can quickly bring it around to something on the Bible. You can quickly start an acquaintance with someone while traveling by talking about present conditions, and then it will not be long before you are in a discussion. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font6"> is small and compact and always ready to help your memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Talks: </span><span class="font6">You never know when you will be called on to give a discourse. Scriptural material for the proof of your arguments can easily be gathered with this aid. The speaker can either use the arrangement as set forth in the book or rearrange the material to suit his argument and presentation. The “Subjects for Study” division, which appears as an appendix to the book, will certainly help speakers in gathering their material on almost any subject, even those not mentioned in the seventy themes. For example, “children,” “Christian,” “man,” “thousand years” are not among the themes, but are subjects of great importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Informal Group Gatherings: </span><span class="font6">Jehovah’s witnesses assemble together in informal groups from time to time, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font6"> will prove to be a basis for new-world conversation. Often questions arise and you just talk about them, but let </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font6"> get into the discussion with you. Or maybe as a helpful and instructive entertainment a general knowledge quiz can be carried on by having one of the brothers use the book while the others see how many scriptures they can give to questions based on the themes or the various subheadings. A very interesting evening can be spent this way and everyone will be taking in knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Service Meetings: </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">“Make Sure of All Things”</span><span class="font6"> will be a handy aid in preparing demonstrations, particularly in showing how interesting back-calls can be conducted. It can be shown how the book will help the publisher in his presentation and make it versatile. Demonstrations will help illustrate how it can be used on any of the above-mentioned subjects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All Christians need knowledge now. They must seek it. They need all the information they can get of Jehovah’s Word, so they may carry on true worship in holy array with all their fellow Christians. Jehovah’s witnesses will never stop taking in knowledge, for they know that Jesus said: “This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ.” (John 17:3) Having made sure of all things we will want to draw out this knowledge from within ourselves to teach it to others also. There is much work yet to be done in proclaiming this good news of Jehovah’s kingdom in all the world for a witness, because “many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem”.—Micah 4:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Subjects for Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This section is designed to help you to quickly find answers to many Bible questions and to “make sure of all things”. Become familiar with its use. The numbers listed refer to pages where Bible texts are quoted that deal with the topic. These subjects are added to the seventy principal themes that precede this section as an aid in your private Bible study, reference work and preparation of discourses. They will be of special help in connection with group Bible studies in the home.</span></p>
