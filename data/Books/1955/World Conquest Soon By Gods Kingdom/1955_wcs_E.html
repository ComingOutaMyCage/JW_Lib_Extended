<p><span class="font7">N</span><span class="font5">O ONE likes to be conquered, for that means subjection to an enemy. But you would like to see your enemies conquered by your friends, for that means freedom and relief to you. World conquest by our enemies is a thing we dread; it seems to be the greatest evil, for it appears to leave us with no hope of deliverance from any quarter. But world conquest could also be by those who love us and have our interests at heart. That would be a thing to be welcomed, for it would denote the overthrow and taking away of all our foes. It would mean a change of world for us, for our good. Which conquest do all of us face? Which conquest is unavoidable, bound to come?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since A.D. 1914 the movement of conditions and events in the earth indicates that sooner or later some form of centralized rule of our globe will come, yes, has to come. Men are divided on the question of whether they want such a rule or not Those who want such a world rule disagree as to what form it should have. There are ambitious men with certain strong persuasions who are determined to take over the rule of the earth. Other men are equally determined that a certain type of government should have no place on the earth. Because of this fears are stirred up in the hearts of men, divided fears, for the world is divided today, seemingly having but two choices to make. Those two leading choices are Western Democracy and so-called “godless” Communism. There are men who are trying to hold to a neutralism, an in-between position, but this is a very difficult and wobbly position, not free of some partiality, not free of fear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With nuclear weapons of terrifically destructive power in the hands now of both political blocs of nations, the science of war has reached a point where another world war means world suicide. People who want to live do not want that to occur. They realize that all peoples of whatever political and religious ideas must learn to get along together, to “coexist,” as they call it. Recently one newspaper correspondent of the democratic West said: “The scientists, who know most about these things, say that if we don’t learn how to coexist upon this earth, we shall cease to exist at all. Yet coexistence does not mean peace. ... It would be better to consider the present contest as ‘competitive coexistence.’ ”—New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> November 1,1954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the bottom of the present competitive coexistence lies fear. Whatever kind of coexistence there might be for a time in the future, the basis for it will be, not mutual love, but mutual fear. Fear, not love, of man holds this world in its embrace. Fear has a stranglehold on it and is killing it. Recently one visitor to Russia held that the Russian fears were worse than those of the West: “The Russians are more afraid of the atom bomb than are the free peoples of the West” He held out hope for a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">pax atomica,</span><span class="font5"> a peace in which atomic energy would be used for peaceful purposes, not for war machines. Though the Russians may now be in a state of fear, their leaders boast of their military strength; they claim it is superior to that of the West and that if the imperialistic West starts an atomic war with the Communist East it will lose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">’The West, dominated by Christendom, does not hide its own fears. It cautions itself against losing its fear and being fooled by the Communist peace offensive and dropping its guard and leaving itself open to a surprise enemy attack. The democratic nations know that the United Nations Disarmament Commission has failed in its conferences and accomplished nothing. They know that the leopard will not change its spots, the Ethiopian will not change his skin, and the Communist bloc will not change its design, which is “world domination,” world conquest, if not by trickery, infiltration and subversion, then by the appalling violence of atomic warfare. They are afraid that the present fears that may hold the Communists back will one day turn to confidence, yes, overconfidence, when they have attained to atomic equality with the West. Britain’s view of world matters is colored by the threat of hydrogen war. As its former prime minister said, in such a war England would be the Communists’ first “bull’s-eye.” The Communists, we are warned, are dedicated to “our destruction,” that is, the destruction of the West with its system of capitalism, free enterprise and other freedoms. The American secretary of state says that the United States’ foreign aid program must go on as the best collective defense against this unchanged design of the Soviet and Chinese Communists for “world domination.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In an address to the chamber of commerce of the United States the country’s president voiced the belief that </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font5"> Americans applied to the friendly independent nations the same principles in thinking, in co-operation, in respect for common values and in trade and commerce “that we have among ourselves, we are certain of defeating communism as we are that we are all in this hall this moment” Yet on another occasion he said the Communist menace may face the “free world&quot; for forty years. Impatiently the president of the American Federation of Labor charged the national government with a “do-nothing policy” during the country’s present “drift into defeatism” in world affairs, and that the national Administration was doing nothing to expose the dangers of a policy of “peaceful coexistence” with communism or to halt this policy from gaining converts both in the United States and abroad. One retired American lieutenant general urged the country to break diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and its satellites and refuse to trade with these Communists. To quote the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times:</span><span class="font5"> “Warning that it is ‘very late’—perhaps ‘too late’—to halt the Soviet drive toward WORLD CONQUEST, General Wedemeyer said the Free World could meet the challenge only if its leaders worked ‘realistically.’ ”—New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> June 11,1954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such expressions coming from the nation that dominates the democratic powers betrays the general fear of the entire West- concerning the openly expressed ultimate aim of the Russians, which is, not to coexist peacefully with “capitalism,” but to destroy “capitalism” and to create a Communist world directed from the Kremlin of Moscow as the seat of global government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fear of world conquest—this is what haunts both political blocs of today’s divided world. It is a fear by man of world conquest by man. Nineteen centuries ago a prophet whose predictions have thus far proved one hundred per cent true described this present state of world tension and fear accurately when he said that after international war there would be “on the earth anguish of nations, not knowing the way out because of the roaring of the sea and its agitation, while men become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth; for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.”* The fear here predicted and borne out by the present world state is the fear of what man can do and is inclined to do, no, rather, may be expected to do. This fear blinds the nations to what Almighty God can do. It keeps even Christendom with her hundreds of millions of copies of the Holy Bible from seeing that what all nations certainly face is world conquest by neither the West nor the East but by heaven above, world conquest by God’s kingdom, and that soon!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At first the announcement of this future certainty may not be welcomed by many people, because of their differing religious or political beliefs or racial and national likes and dislikes. The simple announcement may therefore fill them with misunderstanding and distaste. Anti-Jewish persons and organizations as well as Moslems holding to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">* Quoted from Luke 21:25, 26, New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the religion of Islam, which now claims one seventh of the world’s population, may fear that the world rule of God’s kingdom will mean the rise of the natural Jews, the Israelis, to the controlling position over the earth. But the Holy Scriptures written in the Hebrew tongue foretell that God’s kingdom in world power will mean no such thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Likewise people who are not Moslems may fear that God’s kingdom in control over the earth means a Moslem world. The non-Moslems know that Islam worships the one God Allah and that its holy book the Koran predicts that Islam will be the leading religion of the world. Non-Moslems do not forget that not many centuries ago the followers of Mohammed set out to gain world control by flame and sword in harmony with the Koran (Sura2:186-190,212,213; 8:12; 9:5,124; 47:4) and that the prediction of the Koran that Islam is to be “victorious over every other religion” is still accepted. (Sura 9:33) Will God’s kingdom as world conqueror mean such things? The “previous Scriptures” in the Bible, which the Koran is claimed to confirm and safeguard (Sura 5:50-52), answer with a quieting No.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A large number of the religionists in the non-Catholic part of Christendom fear world conquest by the Roman Catholic Hierarchy under the headship of the pope at Vatican City. Non-Catholics remember that Pope Boniface VIII (A.D. 12941303) issued the decree that still exists in the common law: “We declare, say, define, pronounce it necessary to salvation for every human creature to be subject to the Roman pontiff.” This papal viewpoint was upheld at St. Patrick’s Cathedral Sunday, January 16,1955, when mass was offered for Christian unity “of all peoples of the world” under the spiritual leadership of the pope. The priest preaching at this mass said: “Let us. ask God to show all people that the only way to secure an abiding peace within themselves and among all nations is in union with the mother of all churches under the one head, the Holy Father, the successor of the Apostle Peter, the Vicar of Christ on earth.” —New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> page 20, January 17,1955.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The violent effort to thrust this “salvation” on all mankind by forcing all to be “subject to the Roman pontiff” has led to cruel suffering for mankind. Non-Catholics recall how the Catholic Doctor Edmund S. Walsh of Georgetown University, before a capacity audience in Memorial Continental Hall, Washington, D.C., February 16, 1940, outlined the Nazi war aims. He said that he had heard Adolf Hitler say that the Holy Roman Empire, which was a Germanic empire, must be re-established. In full harmony with this the pope refused to excommunicate Hitler from the Roman Catholic Church but chose to use him as the sword of the church for re-establishing the Holy Roman Empire and extending it all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only this past May 1,1955, in an article entitled “What World War H Did—and Didn’t—Settle,” published in the New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font5"> Magazine, the noted English historian Arnold J. Toynbee stated his belief that “if there had been no World War n, Hitler would eventually have attained world dominion,” not leaving out even the Soviet Union, the British Commonwealth and the United States, and also dominion over his temporary allies Japan and Italy; that “if Hitler had retained his wartime Continental European conquests, this would have enabled him to move forward to world dominion.” The Roman Catholic Hierarchy realized this possibility and backed up its aggressive “son of the Church.” This twentieth-century world therefore came very near being conquered by a new Holy Roman Empire, which its founders hoped to make last a thousand years. Hitler failed to fulfill his dream, but the aim of the Hierarchy still remains the same, to conquer the world for its church by whatever agent comes to hand. Now does world conquest by God’s kingdom mean that? No! Let all non-Catholics understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the international conference at Bandung, Indonesia, by twenty-nine Asian and African nations during April of 1955 the delegates issued a communique in which they agreed “in declaring that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil which should speedily be brought to an end.” So now let those colored races who for centuries have writhed under the colonialism of the nations of Christendom understand that world conquest by God’s kingdom does not mean world rule by this Christendom with any manifestation of colonialism by her. Let the peoples of these colored races be glad that it means, rather, full liberation of men that live from her colonialism to the fullest extent, yes, and also freedom from all Communist imperialism and colonialism. It means conquest of this earth by no oppressors of mankind of any race, color or language, but conquest by true Lovers of mankind, namely, by God, who gave his most beloved, first-born Son for its rescue, and by this Son, who gave his own human life for mankind’s happy future in a new and perfect world pervaded with true brotherly love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY GOD’S KINGDOM MUST CONQUER</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is every good reason why God himself should conquer the world and rule the earth by his kingdom. He is the creator of the earth and the rightful owner of all of it. “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” Those are the opening words of the Holy Bible, the writing of which He inspired. Compared with the vast universe, a small part of which is brought to view by our most powerful telescopes, this earth is a tiny thing. Yet this earth is big enough for us who have to live here, and for ourselves we do not want nor do we need anything bigger. But in the estimation of the Creator himself this earth is a mere atom of matter; it is as nothing. Mindful of this comparison, men of this world smile in doubt at the thought that God is interested in this earth. Marvelous as it may seem, in spite of its microscopic littleness, our earth now claims the first attention of God. Why is that? Because now an issue of universal importance is under debate and calls for an early settlement. That issue is, Who rules the universe? Who is the sovereign of the universe? It is not the size of the earth that counts; it is the issue of universal sovereignty that is the thing, and our earth is especially tied up with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For almost six thousand years now the chief adversary of God has been the invisible ruler of this earth. He is Satan the Devil. His rule has been only by the permission of Almighty God, not to go on forever, but for the purpose of putting the issue to a thorough test. So the point to be settled is, May God’s chief adversary lay claim to even such an atom of matter as our earth and rule it indefinitely in defiance of God or is God the sovereign of even the smallest part of his universe? You are interested in the final settlement of this issue, because you live here. God is interested in you, because he put you here, creating your first father in His own image and likeness. What you think of this God your Creator is of importance to him. He will either kill you for it or keep you alive for it. It is necessary to your living forever that you recognize him as the Universal Sovereign, hi proof of that, the inspired psalmist Asaph long ago prayed concerning the opposers of God’s universal sovereignty: “Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek thy name, O Jehovah. Let them be put to shame and dismayed for ever; yea, let them be confounded and perish; that they may know that thou alone, whose name is Jehovah, art the Most High over all the earth.”—Psalm 83:16-18, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Creator, whose name is Jehovah, has a right to assert his sovereignty over this earth at any time he chooses to do so. By what means has he chosen to do so? It is by means of his kingdom. More than nineteen centuries ago his most beloved, first-born Son was down here on earth as the man Jesus Christ. God his heavenly Father anointed him with holy spirit to be the king of that coming kingdom. Accordingly the Son of God preached: “The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” He told his listeners: “I must declare the good news of the kingdom of God, because for this I was sent forth.” He told his disciples to seek that kingdom first. He taught them this prayer to God: “Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified. Let your kingdom come. Let your will come to pass, as in heaven, also upon earth.” (Matthew 4:17; Luke 4:43 and Matthew 6:9, 10, 33, iVW) Ever since then his true followers have offered that prayer and in faith have looked for the coming of the kingdom of their heavenly Father. God promises to answer prayers in harmony with his will. God’s kingdom is therefore under obligation to come; for God’s Son taught his disciples to pray for the Kingdom, his disciples have prayed these nineteen centuries for its coming, and God is bound to answer that prayer and bring in his kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God is bound to bring the Kingdom also in fulfillment of his inspired prophecies pronounced in his own name Jehovah. In Psalm 22, many verses of which were fulfilled in his Son Jesus Christ, it is prophesied: “All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto Jehovah; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee. For the kingdom is Jehovah’s; and he is the ruler over the nations.” (Psalm 22:27, 28, AS) Jehovah promised to have the Kingdom rest upon the shoulder of his Son Jesus Christ, born at Bethlehem-Judah in Palestine over nineteen centuries ago, in this prophecy: “Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.” (Isaiah 9:6, 7, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AS)</span><span class="font5"> We have already had the birth of the promised child, this Son of God. Just as surely there must come the birth of the government that rests</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">14 WORLD CONQUEST SOON—BY BOD'S KINGDOM </span><span class="font5">upon his shoulder. The heated zeal of Jehovah brings that kingdom to birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">His prophecy through Isaiah said that the government of the Son of God, the Prince of Peace, should be “upon the throne of David.” King David of ancient time was a forefather, a royal ancestor, of Jesus Christ, and reigned upon Mount Zion at Jerusalem. This does not mean, however, that Jesus Christ himself must reign on earth at Jerusalem and that he must be the King of the Jews, the Israelis of today in Palestine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jesus Christ of the conquering kingdom of God is hot the “King of the Jews.” He is King of the new world. When Governor Pontius Pilate was examining Jesus and asked him: “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus answered: “My kingdom is no part of this world. If my kingdom were part of this world, my attendants would have fought that I should not be delivered up to the Jews. But, as it is, my kingdom is not from this source.” (John 18:33-36, 2VW) Jesus will be king of all the people of the new world. Because he laid down his perfect human life as an atoning sacrifice for all men who gain the new world, these inhabitants of the coming new world were long ago foreshadowed or typified by the twelve tribes of Israel on their yearly day of atonement when sacrifices were offered by the high priest for the sins of the entire nation. For forty years King David ruled over those tribes of Israel or Jacob. It was only because all mankind were typified by those twelve tribes of Israel or Jacob that God’s angel Gabriel announced the coming birth of Jesus to his prospective mother, the virgin Jewess Mary, and then said: “This one will be great and will be called Son of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">the Most High, and Jehovah God will give him the throne of David his father, and he will be king over the house of Jacob forever, and there will be no end of his kingdom.” (Luke 1:26-33, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> The ancient typical David did reign only over the house of Israel or Jacob and over all the subjected peoples in the Promised Land. But the prophecies show it is not to be so with the King Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mark this fact: Jesus Christ is not only David’s Son but also his “Lord,” for in uttering Psalm 110 under divine inspiration King David called him “my Lord,” saying: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord.” When Jesus asked the Jewish Pharisees: “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” they said: “David’s.” He then asked them: “How, then, is it that David by inspiration calls him ‘Lord’, saying: ‘Jehovah said to my Lord’?” (Psalm 110:1, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">AS;</span><span class="font5"> Matthew 22:41-44, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> In being not only King David’s Son but also his Lord Jesus Christ is a higher King and his kingdom is therefore a greater kingdom. (Psalm 89:27) It is to be not just over faithful </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Christianized</span><span class="font5"> Jews but also over all families and nationalities of mankind who likewise accept this Son of David as King and as the Seed of Abraham by whom they can procure the blessing that Jehovah mentioned in his promise to his friend Abraham, the forefather of both King David and Jesus Christ.—Genesis 12:1-3; 22:15-18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Psalm 110, in which King David addressed his descendant Jesus Christ as “my Lord,” shows that he was to be higher than King David, yes, as high as one could get above King David. The psalm shows him seated, not on David’s material throne on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, but at the right hand of the Most High God. Psalm 110 opens with the words: “Jehovah saith unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. Jehovah will send forth the rod of thy strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” (Psalm 110:1,2, AS) Jesus Christ could not be seated at God’s right hand and at the same time be seated on the literal Mount Zion on earth, for the earth is God’s footstool. It is therefore on the spiritual Mount Zion, the heavenly seat of government, where he sits to rule at God’s command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How did Jesus Christ get there? How could he possibly get there since he died a martyr’s death more than nineteen centuries ago? It was by resurrecting him from the dead, not to be a human king on earth but to be a spiritual King at God’s right hand in the highest heavens. On the day of Pentecost, fifty days from Jesus’ resurrection, the apostle Peter explained it all, saying under the power of God’s holy spirit: “This Jesus God resurrected, of which fact we are all witnesses. Therefore because he was exalted to the right hand of God and received the promised holy spirit from the Father, he has poured out this which you see and hear. Actually David did not ascend to the heavens, but he himself says, ‘Jehovah said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.” ’ Therefore let all the house of Israel know for a certainty that God made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you impaled.” (Acts 2:32-36, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> So it is from heaven that Jehovah God at the due time sends out the scepter of Christ’s strength to rule amidst</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD CONQUEST SOON—BY GOD’S KINGDOM J? </span><span class="font5">his enemies. These enemies include all nations. Including Christendom, which takes the name of Christ? Yes! All these must be brought low like a throne stool on which to put his feet. How? Without our at once stating how Bible prophecies say it will be done, let us see how the world conditions and the line-up of the nations show that it has to be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">After the Holy Roman Empire was set up in 800 (A.D.) with Emperor Charlemagne as the “sword of the Church,” the Roman Catholic Hierarchy tried to carry out its ideas of God’s kingdom, to spread and maintain the religious empire by means of wars with carnal weapons, crusades and torturechamber inquisitions. Napoleon Bonaparte brought about the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire and put a stop to the Hierarchy’s violent efforts to conquer the world for the kingdom of the papal Caesars. Later, in World War I, the Hierarchy tried to use Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany as the “sword of the Church,” but with failure. Then the Nazi leader, a “son of the Church,” came to power and again the Hierarchy tried to use the sword of the state then in Hitler’s hands. But again the Hierarchy’s hopes were blasted, proving once more that God’s purpose to establish his kingdom under Christ will not be by means of the Hierarchy. The apostle Paul wrote that the weapons of Christian warfare are not carnal and that the true Christians should take in hand the “sword of the spirit, that is, the Word of God.” (2 Corinthians 10:3, 4; Ephesians 6:17, CB) But the Hierarchy has chosen to take the “sword of the state,” the sword of the Caesars of her religious empire. Christ told Caesar’s representative, Pon-this Pilate, that his kingdom was not of this world; but the Hierarchy has made herself a part of this world by trying to have on earth a religio-political kingdom. The Hierarchy claims to be the “bride of Christ,” but she has wedded herself to the political rulers of this world in a marriage of church and state. Thus she has violated her claimed engagement to Christ and not waited for him to come. The kingdom of God has never come by her,, and never will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Protestant wing of Christendom has claimed that God's kingdom will come by the peaceable conversion of this world, even the rulers of this world to be converted and become Christians and lead their subjects into Christianity. In all unchristian governments that which is opposed to God’s glory would thus be destroyed and the governments would, as it were, receive a Christian baptism and become Christian, yet all such governments staying unchanged in their political pattern, whether democracies, autocracies, kingdoms, duchies or dictatorships. The worldly governments could become Christian and yet preserve their characteristic forms of worldly rule. Christianity would pervade every political government and be the basis of every code of laws and be professed by every people supporting such governments. Under this idea the Protestant churches, which also claim to be engaged to Christ the Bridegroom, have made marriage unions with political rulers of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But has this Protestant idea of how God’s kingdom comes and conquers worked out? During the sixteen centuries since the Roman emperor Constantine became a Roman Catholic has this worked out? Or since the Protestant &quot;Reformation” of the sixteenth century? No! For three fourths of the world’s population does not yet profess Christianity. And as for the one fourth that does profess to be Christian, shall we say that God’s kingdom has come in its case? Let God’s Word, the Bible, now answer..</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At Romans 14:17 (OB) the Bible says: “The kingdom of God does not consist in food and drink, but in justice and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.” If the present Christendom is that much of God’s kingdom come to this earth, in what way is she an example of “justice” to the non-Christian peoples? How is she the refuge of peace when two world wars were started in Christendom and now she is the inventress of the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb for a third world war, with only an “atoms for peace” plan as a salve for the conscience and for good business reasons? Is Christendom joyful over her condition, filled with “joy in the Holy Spirit”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We can find that out by looking to see whether she has the fruitage of the holy spirit, for, said Jesus, “every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.” (Matthew 7:19, ■20, CB) Does Christendom have the fruit of the holy spirit, in either her Catholic or hex' Protestant part? What does the Bible say that fruit is? Listen: “The fruit of the Spirit is: charity [love], joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, modesty, continency. Against such things there is no law. And they who belong to Christ have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires.” Is Christendom producing a crop of this good fruit, that she may</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2Q WORLD CONQUEST SOON—BY GOD'S KINGDOM </span><span class="font5">not, like a bad tree, be cut down and thrown into the fire? Christendom’s newspapers, magazines, radio, television, court records, police station records, and other reflectors of the life and morality of the people of Christendom answer. We do not have to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Now in contrast with the “fruit of the Spirit” there are what the Bible calls the “works of the flesh.” What are these? “Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are immorality, uncleanness, licentiousness, idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, jealousies, anger, quarrels, factions, parties, envies, murders, drunkenness, carousings, and suchlike. And concerning these I warn you, as I have warned you, that they who do such things will not attain the kingdom of God.” (Galatians 5: 19-24, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">CB)</span><span class="font5"> “Do you not know that the unjust will not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor the evil-tongued, nor the greedy will possess the kingdom of God.” (1 Corinthians 6:9, 10, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">CB)</span><span class="font5"> If not producing the fruit of the spirit or crucifying the flesh with its passions and desires, is Christendom doing these described “works of the flesh”? Her record, especially since A.D. 1914, the year of World War I, answers. It is an open book that Christendom cannot keep the critical eyes of the non-Christian peoples from reading. Let the honest, unprejudiced people outside Christendom express their judgment. The so-called “heathen” know whether Christendom is full of the fruit of God’s spirit or full of the works of the flesh, for the teeming billions of heathen have suffered</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD CONQUEST SOON—BY GOD’S KINGDOM </span><span class="font5">21 shamefully because of the “works of the flesh” with which Christendom overflows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Carrying on such &quot;works of the flesh” and increasing them since A.D. 1914 Christendom will not attain the kingdom of God nor possess the kingdom of God. She is no part of God’s kingdom come. She is against the kingdom of God. Like a bad tree she has produced bad fruit and, by Jesus’ own words, she must be cut down and thrown into the fire. Especially this, because she has pretended to be the good tree of God’s kingdom from which the fruit of the spirit was to be expected, but she has done an injustice to God’s kingdom by putting it in a disgraceful light in the eyes of all heathendom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the same time that Christendom religiously stockpiles nuclear bombs for “hot” war against “atheistic communism” she tries to appear producing the peaceful fruitage of the spirit by making arrangements to keep this world at peace. But in this her hypocrisy is apparent to God, for she tries to keep the peace by the strength of carnal weapons of this world. Instead of letting God fight the battle his way, she would fight the battle for her life by this world’s way. It was Christendom herself that set up the League of Nations after World War I and called it the “political expression of the kingdom of God on earth.” This led to the impression, when Hitler knocked out the League of Nations in 1939, that God’s kingdom in its visible political expression had lost, not conquered. Since World War II she, yes, Christendom, has put forward the League’s successor, the United Nations, as the world’s best hope for peace. Which leads us to ask, Peace through</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">which nations? The nations only of Christendom? Or so-called “Christian nations” united with non-Christlan, “heathen” nations? Or also with Communist nations?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Is God’s kingdom to be linked with pagan, heathen nations? With atheistic Communist nations? Ask yourself whether the national make-up of the United Nations sponsored by Christendom shows obedience by Christendom to the Bible command. “Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font5"> Corinthians 6:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The United Nations cannot pass for the political expression of God’s kingdom on earth. It is against the real kingdom of God, and Christendom by sponsoring, promoting, recommending and maintaining this alliance of worldly nations, along with all the other political alliances within its framework, betrays herself as a worldly conspirator against God’s kingdom under Christ. She is the enemy, the chief opposer of God’s kingdom. She is against having the nations of this world hand over their sovereignty to God that he might be recognized as the Universal Sovereign, the Most High even over our pinpoint of an earth. She does not even hand over her own sovereignty, but prefers democracy to theocracy. She stands condemned of opposition to God’s universal sovereignty by her own mouth, by the August (1954) report of the Protestant World Council of Churches from Evanston, Illinois, that declared that “democratic humanism” had evolved into a “disregard or denial of God’s sovereignty over the world.” (New York </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font5"> June 15, 1954) Christendom as an enemy must also be put under the feet of Christ She also must be conquered with the rest of the enemy world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD CONQUEST HOW?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">How, then, must the world conquest by God’s kingdom be? Bible prophecy answers, Not by peaceful means, but by violent war, the battle of Armageddon, “the battle of that great day of God Almighty.” (Revelation 16:14-16) Psalm 110, already quoted from, prophesied that Jehovah God would send out the scepter of Christ’s strength with the command: “Rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.” His ruling amidst them will culminate in the battle of Armageddon and the destruction of all enemies, including traitorous Christendom; for Psalm 110:5, 6 goes on to show Christ in battle action, saying to him: “The Lord is at your right hand; he will shatter kings on the day of his wrath. He will execute judgment among the nations, filling them with corpses; he will shatter chiefs over the wide earth.”—</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">RS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">All the world and its friends must be conquered, for all the world is the enemy; which is why James 4:4 (NW) asks: “Do you not know that the friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever, therefore, wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God.” That it will be a world conquest and that all the nations would rage about it from 1914 onward the prophecy concerning the end of this world states in these words: “There were loud voices in heaven, saying, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.’ . . . ‘We give thanks to thee, Lord God almighty, who art and who wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and begun to reign. The nations raged, but thy wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, . . . and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.” (Revelation 11:15, 17, 18, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">RS)</span><span class="font5"> This kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ is a New World kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In further proof that God’s kingdom by his Christ has the task of world conquest and will take over rulership of the entire globe we have Daniel’s prophecy. This prophecy was fulfilled, not at Christ’s first coming when he came without clouds, but at his coming now into his kingdom. Seeing this long in advance, Daniel says: “I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto a son of man, and he came even to the ancient of days [Jehovah God], and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.”—Daniel 7:13-15, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The glorified Son of man in heaven will not take over all this dominion without a fight. Daniel’s prophecy makes that sure. It pictures the visible earthly organization of Satan the Devil as a ferocious beast, which comes to no peaceful end at God’s judgment time. Says Daniel, as if viewing the events just ahead of us: “I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.” That means a fierce fight with this beast, which fights with tooth and claw. The interpretation of this as given to Daniel himself is: “The judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.”—Daniel 7: 11, 26, 27, AS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There can be no peaceful coexistence between God’s kingdom and this ferocious, beastly system of things on this earth. It has been destroying or bringing to ruin this earth, and it itself must be brought to ruin. That will be, soon, at the battle of Armageddon. The Revelation pulls back the curtain that hides the invisible and lets us see that demons are leading all the kings of the entire inhabited earth to that field of battle. It is a world conflict that is shaping up. Read the description of that at Revelation 16:14-16, and then read the advanced description of the battle itself at Revelation 19:11-21 and see “the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war,” not against world communism, no, but against Jehovah’s Christ. See them also defeated, all of them, in the greatest war ever in God’s universe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The world conquest, however, is not ended at the destruction of Christendom and its international alliance, and all the rest of the symbolic beast or visible system of things. To be a world conquest the invisible part of this world, its wicked spiritual heavens, must also go, and go they will. Immediately following the vision of the battle with the visible beastly system of things on earth Revelation 20:1-3 unveils before us the invisible part of the conquest, the seizing and binding of the superhuman “ruler of this world,” Satan the Devil, together with all his hordes of demons. They will be cast into a prison abyss, not with freedom of movement there, but bound as with a “great chain,” with a sealed cover over the abyss to keep the most powerful part of this old world out of contact with the “new earth” of the new world. Their abyssing will be the crowning triumph of God’s kingdom at the battle of Armageddon. For the thousand years of Christ’s reign in heaven with his true bride of his saintly followers, Satan and his demons will be as dead to the universe. At the end of Christ’s thousand-year reign they will be let out of the abyss, but only for a short while, for a final test of the subjects of God’s kingdom. The test being over, they will then be wiped out with no trace left, as if they had never been.—Revelation 20:7-10,14,15; 21:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Therefore let all nations know that, not world conquest by atheistic communism, but world conquest by God’s kingdom is what they have to face. If, before Armageddon ended, the earth were conquered by communism or by any other radical or aggressive group, this in turn would finally be conquered by God’s kingdom. Nations in and outside Christendom err in leaving this ultimate, inevitable world conquest out of their deliberations. Nations outside the “iron curtain” are anxious to hear news from behind the “iron curtain” concerning the atomic arms build-up of the Communists, but they show no concern about God’s arsenal of destructive forces for Armageddon far worse than an international atomic world war. So at Armageddon they will be made to know the war potential of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But why do we say world conquest by God’s kingdom “soon”? We say “soon,” because the Bible says that the faithful students of God’s Word and observers of the fulfillments of its prophecy would be kept informed on God’s times and seasons. It says: “Whenever it is that [people] are saying, ‘Peace and security!’ then sudden destruction is to be instantly upon them just as the pang of distress upon a pregnant woman, and they will by no means escape. But you, brothers, you are not in darkness, so that that day should overtake you as it would thieves, for you are all sons of light and sons of day.” (1 Thessalonians 5:1-5, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW}</span><span class="font5"> Jehovah God is the greatest Timekeeper, and his time schedule in the Bible marks the year 1914 as the year for the bringing forth of his kingdom under Christ, as the time for God to send the scepter of his enthroned Son out of the heavenly Zion with the order: ‘Rule in the midst of your enemies!’ At Revelation 12:5-10 the description of the birth of the Kingdom shows that he must rule them with an iron rod, to dash all the nations to pieces as though a potter’s vessel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The fulfillment of Jesus’ prophecy on the evidences proving us to be in this world’s “time of the end” makes certain the date 1914. From that year on we have had, as he foretold, world war with other terrible afflictions, famines, pestilences, earthquakes, persecution of the true Christians, the abounding of iniquity or increasing of lawlessness, the love of the greater number cooling off, hate running riot, the League of Nations, its successor the United Nations, unrelievable “anguish of nations, not knowing the way out,” Christ’s judging of true Christians, and the separating of the peoples of all the nations over the issue of God’s kingdom by Christ. (Matthew 24:3 to 25:46; Mark 13:3-36; Luke 21:7-36, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> In less than fifty years since 1914 we have had all these things, except now Armageddon itself; and Jesus said of the generation that experiences .all these things, as we ourselves have: “Likewise also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near at the doors. Truly I say to you that this generation will by no means pass away until all these things occur.” (Matthew 24: 33, 34, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> To show that we should rejoice rather than give way to anguish and fear with the world, he said: “As these things start to occur, raise yourselves erect and lift your heads up, because your deliverance is getting near. . . . when you see these things occurring, know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I say to you, This generation will by no means pass away until all things occur.” (Luke 21:28, 31, 32, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW) </span><span class="font5">We have every reason, therefore, to say without hesitation, World conquest by God’s kingdom soon!</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As one of the most striking evidences that God’s kingdom was brought to birth in the heavens in 1914 and that soon it will meet all the foes at Armageddon and conquer, we have fulfilled already in 160 nations and territories Jesus’ prophecy concerning the “time of the end”: “This</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD CONQUEST SOON—BY GOD’S KINGDOM </span><span class="font5">29 good news of the kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for the purpose of a witness to all the nations, and then the accomplished end will come.” (Matthew 24:14, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> The published and well-known facts prove that it is Jehovah’s witnesses whom he is using thus to preach the newborn Kingdom to all nations for a witness, for which reason they are undeniably His witnesses. This fact proves they are “all sons of light and sons of day” and know for a certainty the “times and the seasons” and will not be overtaken suddenly with the doomed world by the day of Armageddon’s outbreak. Let all, friend or foe, who observe Jehovah’s witnesses fulfilling the prophecy regarding the Kingdom preaching, know that this, too, is one of the most telling evidences of the Kingdom’s presence and of its world conquest at Armageddon as being soon. Yes, “soon,” not to spare civilization from havoc by heading off a new world war with atomic weapons—for Armageddon will be far more terrible than atomic world war—but because it is God’s time, and the evidences do not lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What, then, will world conquest by God’s kingdom soon mean to you? Your sudden destruction? It will, if at Armageddon you are found on the side now being warned of coming destruction, this world, including Christendom. Or will it mean your deliverance? It will, if you are then found on the side of the world conquerors, Jehovah God and his reigning King Jesus Christ. That is where the New World society of Jehovah’s witnesses have taken their stand, determined to stay there faithfully till Armageddon, and not only till but also through Armageddon! “Through Armaged-</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">don”? Yes, for the deliverance that we see getting near for us means being eyewitnesses of the end of Armageddon with world conquest by God’s triumphant kingdom and thus surviving Armageddon into God’s new world. By taking your stand with his New World society now, you may survive Armageddon into God’s new world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But there is more to it than that. God’s kingdom will not halt its conquests with merely the destruction of the Devil’s old world. It will go on to further conquests by undoing all the evil effects of Satan the Devil’s wickedness practiced upon the human race. It will conquer the bad conditions of the earth upon which Armageddon survivors must live, one third of which earth lies desert today, with further ruin being caused by this world’s ruinous policies toward the earth. It will transform this entire earth into a perfect paradise for mankind’s eternal home and nourishment. It will wipe out from the minds, features and bodies of the obedient Armageddon survivors all the traces of the sin and its degradation that Satan introduced among us by our first parents Adam and Eve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Kingdom will stop at nothing, no, not at death itself. Death and the greedy grave must yield to the triumphant Kingdom. God’s Word guarantees it, with this prophecy concerning the King Jesus Christ: “He must rule as king until God has put all enemies under his feet. As the last enemy, death is to be destroyed. For God ‘subjected all things under his feet’.” (1 Corinthians 15: 25-27, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">NW)</span><span class="font5"> That means the resurrection of the dead. That means the wiping out of the graveyards by the returning to life of those whose names appear on the gravestones. It means the offering to these of the opportunities for the rescued race of mankind, under the blessed kingdom of God by Christ, to gain perfect human life evermore in the earthly paradise by unbreakable allegiance to that government of salvation. Yes, it means not merely the survival of Armageddon by the New World society, but that the “great crowd” of these now living may never die! By continued faithfulness and integrity to God and Christ the Armageddon survivors may survive forever on earth!—Revelation 21:1-4; John 11: 25, 26; 8:51.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is what “world conquest soon—by God’s kingdom” may mean to you. May your wise, God-directed course from now on let it mean that to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now you will want to know more. More about the coming world conquest, the soonness of it, the chance to survive it. Learn more about the new world of everlasting life that will follow the battle that sweeps this corrupt old world into oblivion. And it is vitally important for you now to learn more about the Bible’s good news of how you can decide to live forever under God’s conquering kingdom. Now is the time to decide, before divine anger flares up at Armageddon. As the Bible says: “Before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you.&quot; To delay decision is to invite destruction. This is the theme of a new book that contains much more Bible proof of world conquest soon by God’s kingdom. It points the only way for you to survive into God’s new world. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">You May Survive Armageddon into God’s New World</span><span class="font4"> is the book.
