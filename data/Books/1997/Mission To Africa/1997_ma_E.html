<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This pamphlet is printed and distributed by the Watchtower. However, many Jehovah's Witnesses have never seen this brochure. Please pay close attention to page 9. The 1998 Yearbook, pages 44-45, informs us of the following:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Many in the world recognize Jehovah’s Witnesses as lawabiding, family-oriented people who have high moral and ethical standards and who are actively preaching the message of God’s Word. However, there are also people who oppose our work and will stop at nothing to besmirch the reputation of Jehovah’s people and to hinder our efforts to let the light shine. They do this by providing government officials and the media with inaccurate, lying, and disparaging information about Jehovah’s Witnesses. In an effort to correct such misrepresentation, in February 1997 the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Governing Body approved the formation,</span><span class="font3"> under the oversight of the Writing Committee, of a Public Affairs Office. General information desks have been functioning in the Society’s branch offices.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Disaster Relief</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One way that we publicly demonstrate goodwill toward our neighbors is by our active involvement in relief efforts during times of disaster. For example, for people in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), a team, all of whom are Jehovah’s Witnesses, organized humanitarian aid in 1997. With the help of thousands of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Belgium, France, and Switzerland, refugees were supplied with tons of food, clothing, vitamin products, and medicine, as well as 18,500 pairs of shoes and 1,000 blankets, all of which </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">was airlifted to Africa.</span><span class="font3"> The value of the supplies provided totaled nearly $1 million (U.S.). These supplies were sent primarily as a gift to Jehovah’s Witnesses, but they were also shared with others.—Gal. 6:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The France branch was assisted in the preparation of a </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">brochure </span><span class="font3">containing details about this activity. </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">The brochure was distributed to government officials and members of the news media,</span><span class="font3"> acquainting them with examples of what Jehovah’s Witnesses were doing in a positive and practical way to provide assistance to people in need. A number of </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">officials </span><span class="font3">expressed sincere appreciation for this information. They were impressed especially by what was done to ensure that the supplies would be received by those in need and would be distributed in an equitable manner.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Television news cameras have brought into our living rooms pictures of the terrible aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The looks of hopelessness and despair on the faces of refugees have haunted us. In the pages of our newspapers, we read of the desperate pleas for help. Uvira, Bukavu, Kisangani, Kivu. These names had become synonymous with fear and death. Many may have felt helpless, believing that no individual efforts could alleviate such massive suffering. However, others believed differently.

<p><span class="font4">In the summer of 1994, Claude Hamel, a company owner from France in his fifties, and president of Aidafrique, a French humanitarian association, led a team of volunteers to set up well-organized camps and field hospitals for the Rwandan refugees in Zaire.*</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">By the end of their trip, more than 7,000 persons-three times the number of Jehovah' s Witnesses in Rwanda-benefited from the help of the relief. However, Zaire itself soon became a land of peril. So, from April 28 to May 12, 1997, Claude brought a relief team together once again. He and his wife, Joseline, Louis de Wit of Belgium, Pierre Baudry of France, and Dr. Anton Camprubi of Switzerland left their countries to help alleviate the suffering of the Zairian people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The team, all of whom are Jehovah' s Witnesses, wanted to supply humanitarian aid.

In Goma, we were taken aback by an impression of calm. Rubble, deformed and broken roads, testified however to the recent war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Goma, 95% of the inhabitants are unemployed. The few humanitarian organizations employ some Zairians as drivers or porters. In the hotels, some work without being paid in the hope of keeping their job when the money comes back. The people lack everything: clothing, shoes, medicine and especially food. Hunger follows the war, with ruined crops, food reserves looted, and the very high prices for the food still available.</span></p>

At best, the people eat one meal per day in the evening. All day long, children and adults drink just one or two cups of tea. The daily anxiety is to obtain some meager pittance.

<p><span class="font4">On May 12, we all met up in Kigali for a meeting of African (Rwandan and Zairian) relief committee members and the European (Belgium, French and Swiss) representatives. Together they assessed what had been done. They also drew useful conclusions from the inquiry conducted at the grass-roots level. Medicine needs to be imported. Apart from exceptional circumstances, there is a need to supply the population with food that they normally eat. The Butembo region produces rice and beans, and it is easier to get the necessary money to buy and deliver them, than to transport food from Europe. Medicine and clothing should be distributed to local institutions (orphanages or non-governmental organizations).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">On May 12, we all met up in Kigali for a meeting of African (ft wand an and Zairian | relief committee members and the European (Belgium, French and Swiss! representatives. Together they assessed what had been done. They also drew useful conclusions from the in quiry conducted at the grass-roots level. Medicine needs to be imported. Apart from exceptional circumstances, there is a need to supply the population with food that they normally eat. The Butembo region pro duces rice and beans, and it is easier to get the necessary money !o buy and deliver them, than to transport food from Europe. Medicine and clothing should be distributed to local institutions lorphanages or nongovernmental organizations).</span></p><img src="1997_ma_E_files/1997_ma_E-9.jpg" alt="" style="width:365pt;height:140pt;">
<p><span class="font4">The same principles apply to individuals. Cholera was rampant in Kalemie. A qualified nurse from Bukavu was without work. We invited him to join us. So, we decided to get the help of local unemployed medical personnel. To achieve this, local committees will seek out nurses without work at the congregations of Jehovah' s Witnesses and invite them to give their help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The appraisal of our humanitarian action would be incomplete without mentioning and assessing the specific needs of another &quot;front&quot; involving first aid. It is in a totally different context that Loic Domalain, a French Jehovah' s Witness doctor, has been working in the east of Africa since May 3. He has been visiting refugee camps established in Tanzania (a neighboring country of Zaire), for persons who fled from the war. Even in a 4x4, access was difficult. Tracks are bad and a storm is all it takes to make them unnavigable. To travel, transport medicine or use a stethoscope, many authorizations are needed. 44,000 persons, including 500 Jehovah' s Witnesses, their children and family, live in Nyarogoso. Each day, 15 people die in the camp. Lung and intestinal problems, dysentery and malaria favored by the rainy season and stagnant water affect the malnourished population. Loic gave 245 consultations in three days. In the second camp-Mutabira</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">there are 72 Rwandan Witnesses. Dysentery and amebiasis are common there. In Lugufu, there are 47,000 persons including 80 Witnesses. Amebic dysentery is rife. The doctor made up a list of the most destitute children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In each camp, he assessed the urgent needs. Some means to sterilize the water would be very useful. In each camp there is a pressing need for clothing, shoes and blankets.

<p><span class="font4">And what a reaction! No sooner had we got back, than the Jehovah' s Witnesses invited Claude and Joseline to the office of Jehovah' s witnesses at Louviers, to show them what they were sending to Zaire. Alerted by our initial messages, they had sounded out the call in local congregations in the Rhone valley, Normandy, and in part of the Paris area. Can you give clothing and shoes? Many seized this occasion to give with joy. Bagfuls poured into the Kingdom Halls. Their contents, folded or boxed, were transported to Louviers and off-loaded into the warehouse of the Association of Jehovah' s Witnesses. Four hundred volunteers decided to devote a part of their three-day Whitsun weekend to the &quot;Help Zaire&quot; operation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Volunteers of all ages positioned themselves behind very long parallel tables. On the other side of the tables, others-brought the boxes that were handed to them on trolleys. The boxes were emptied. Then women sorted them, folding the clothing into uniform boxes which were stacked thirty to a palette. Nine containers were filled which will be taken to Le Havre to be shipped and then directly transported into Zaire or via the surrounding countries-Zambia and Rwanda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">How much was prepared for shipment? A total of 90 tons, taking up 530 cubic meters, plus 20 tons of food consisting of 13 tons of rice and 7 tons of beans. There was no haste, no collisions or jostling. It was like a beehive. Joseline showed the volunteers photos taken in Zaire and hopes to show the Zairians the images of this large sorting and packaging center. A real link between the two continents could be felt-that of brotherhood and love. Something very touching happened. French children had thought about toys. Placed on a table were green, pink and blue fluffy toys, shiny cars, multi-colored spinning tops. A girl named Eloise, in a red dress and white collar, took teddy bears, dolls and a rag doll that flopped on top of the pile, out of a large bag.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Some of the toys will go to the Ndosho orphanage. We were told of this institution in Goma by an immigration officer. 85 children of varying ages, either abandoned, lost, or real orphans, live there. We visited the dilapidated buildings-work is being carried out to have better ones-but nevertheless very clean judging by the bunk beds. We liked the classroom. We saw children playing on the concrete courtyard floor. They sang lined up in front of us. We promised to supply their needs with 50 boxes of protein products, 100 blankets, 5 boxes of clothing and 20 packets containing 1,000 tablets of various medicines. We already had many of these necessary things. However, we did not have a football. The football that the young ones themselves had asked us for. We will buy one soon and will bring it to the children as soon as we return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We plan to return to Africa. Our destination will be the Democratic Republic of Congo. What changes await us? Uncertainty, yes, but speculations about the future, or lamenting over the past, are not the most important thing for us. What is important is that we can use the present to help and comfort the victims. We have the resources and the earnest desire to do so.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">The relief effort by Jehovah' s Witnesses in Europe in behalf of the Zairians is a small part of a larger work of community service that Witnesses have performed in the past century. Jehovah' s Witnesses are members of a worldwide Christian religion that has been active in Europe for about a century. Worldwide, they have helped many victims of natural disasters, hunger, famine, and war crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As television news cameras continue to highlight the plight of the refugees, and as newspaper articles continue to cover the events of the effects of the war in Zaire, we confidently prepare for a new mission, stimulated by the generosity of our European companions and by love for our African friends.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">A missionary writes: “Concerning our brothers who found themselves in refugee camps in Tete Province, an interesting observation was made by a representative of </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.) </span><span class="font3">He said that Jehovah’s Witnesses had organized their own camps, separate from other groups. ‘Their camp,’ he said, ‘was the only one that was properly run,’ adding, ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses are clean, organized, and educated.</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">’ He then offered to take me by plane across the bush to see for </span><span class="font3">myself.</span></p>
