<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark1"></a>END OF NAZISM</span></h1>
<p><span class="font4">ITS FALL IS CERTAIN READ THE PROOF HEREIN</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IN THESE PERILOUS TIMES when all democracy is under assault and all freedom of speech, of press, of assembly, and of worship is threatened with extinction by the forces of Nazism and its allies, it is vital to all liberty-lovers to read what is stated within these pages for your comfort, courage, and good hope.</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>END OF NAZISM</span></h2>
<p><span class="font6">C</span><span class="font3">ONSTITUTIONAL government of the people is rapidly vanishing from the earth. Harsh, scornful dictators are taking control. Great distress is upon the world, and millions are seeking a place of refuge. What is the remedy for such terrible conditions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Political and commercial men of high standing urge upon the nations “more religion” as a world remedy. In America those men say: “Unless we have more religion America is certain to perish.” The president of the United States in sending his personal ambassador to the Vatican said to the pope: ‘Your Holiness: It is well that we encourage a closer association between those in religion and those in government, who have a common purpose.’ If religion is the remedy, then all honest persons should lay hold upon that remedy. If the evidence does not support the claim that religion is the remedy, then an adequate remedy should be eagerly sought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Only by sober and sincere consideration of truthful evidence can the right conclusion be reached. Let all persons of good will give close attention to the statement of the facts. Those who love righteousness and peace will give a hearing ear. The lawless element will not give heed to anything of reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The terrible distress now upon the world was foretold centuries ago by the holy prophets of Almighty God and recorded in the Bible. It is reasonable that we go to the Divine Record, the Bible, and there seek to learn the cause of distress and what is the true remedy. The Bible contains the truth because it is the Word of Almighty God. It has ever been the guide of those persons who desire to see righteousness and lasting peace in the earth. It is written in God’s Word: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.”-Proverbs 29:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The universal mourning of the people now eloquently testifies that the wicked rule the present world. Because divine prophecy plainly foretold that dictators would gain control of Europe, attention was publicly called to this fact more than three years ago and the European nations warned of the present disaster that now exists there. Here it is pointed out what the prophecies show is certain to come to America and what part religion plays in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The American nation was founded by men who believed Almighty God and who believed that the Bible is His Word of truth. For centuries the people of America prospered and dwelt together in peace, exactly contrary to what we see now in the nation. I appeal to the reasonable people at this time to exercise full faith and confidence in the Almighty God and in the Bible, His Word, and let the burning</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">question of the hour be answered by the infallible testimony of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">From whence came the wicked rule of the world? The Bible answers, Satan the Devil is the invisible chief ruler of the world and is supported by a horde of wicked angels, all of whom are called “mighty ones” or “gods” and further supported on earth by multitudes of conscienceless men who revel in unrighteousness. In every form of religion that is practiced there are recognized by man higher invisible powers that dictate the course of men who follow tradition. Religion and Christianity are not the same thing. They are exactly opposed to each other. The Bible defines both, and that definition we should accept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Religion means the doing of anything that is contrary to the will of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christianity means joyfully doing that which is in full harmony with the will of Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah.”—Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the Devil introduced religion to man. Christ Jesus is the founder and head of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christianity is the fear of Almighty God, that is, fear to ever go contrary to God’s will. Religion is the fear of creatures. From the beginning religion denied Jehovah God as the almighty power and accepted creatures as equal to or greater than Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mark the Bible proof. Satan rebelled against Almighty God and then challenged God to put men on earth who would be faithful to the great Creator. That raised the issue of who is supreme. The Almighty God informed man that the death penalty would be inflicted upon man who willfully violated God’s law and that the eating of forbidden fruit would constitute a violation of God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan, in defiance of God, said to Eve: ‘If ye eat the fruit that is forbidden ye shall not surely die, for God doth know that the day ye eat thereof ye shall be as gods’; that is, as the angels, all of whom are creatures. Adam willfully took the course of disobedience of God’s law, accepted Satan as the higher authority; and in that manner Satan introduced man to religion. At all times since Satan’s chief means of fighting against God has been Religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Head of Christianity, Jesus, said to Jehovah God: ‘I delight to do thy will, 0 my God; thy law is written in my heart.’ (Psalm 40:8) Jesus is the great Christian, always doing the will of Jehovah God. Every person who knowingly and gladly does the will of God as Christ Jesus does is a Christian. To be a Christian one must gladly obey Almighty God without fear of man or other creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Approximately sixteen centuries after the creation of man Satan, by means of religion, had corrupted all the peoples of earth except Noah and his family. The great flood destroyed all humankind save Noah and his family, or eight persons. (Genesis 6:7) Noah was a righteous man and “a preacher of righteousness”, and therefore Almighty God saved him and his family. (2 Peter 2:5) Religion there brought destruction upon all mankind; only those who obeyed God survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You who are of good will toward God and who believe that the Bible is His Word, please now follow the Bible history of man, which briefly recounts the facts leading up to the present deplorable conditions prevailing on the earth. This is addressed to those of good will, with the hope of doing them good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan, the subtle foe, always tries to entrap men and destroy them. In this he, Satan, often appears as a creature of light; yet he is the most wicked of all. (2 Corinthians 11:14) A few centuries after the flood the descendants of Noah became religious, with Nimrod as their priest and ruler. Nimrod builded Nineveh and the nation of Babylon, and set himself up as an arbitrary dictator. He caused the people to hail him and bow before him as though he were a mighty god. Babylon and its king, Nimrod, were given over entirely to wickedness. (Genesis 10:8-11, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font3"> Following Nimrod other nations were organized, all of which adopted and practiced religion, yielding to Satan and the other demons, and all acting contrary to God’s will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Almighty God Jehovah purposed the vindication of His name and that He would have &quot;a people for his name” who would serve Him and bear testimony to His supremacy. He selected the descendants of Abraham and Jacob called “Israelites”. He led them out of the land of Egypt, the Devil-religion nation. Under the leadership of Moses God took the Israelites on a long journey to Palestine, the land of promise. Mark now the commandment God gave to the Israelites, warning them that demonism or religion would be a snare unto them. Concerning the practitioners of religion in Canaan Jehovah said to the Israelites: “For they will turn away [thee and thy sons] from following me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.” God then commanded His people to keep themselves entirely separate from those religious people dwelling in Palestine, and said: “Neither shalt thou serve their gods [demons]; for that will be a snare unto thee.” (Deuteronomy 7:4,16) Satan and his associate demons set about to ensnare the Israelites by means of religion. Although God had repeatedly warned the Israelites against such snare, Saul, Israel’s first king, fell to demonism, turning to the witch of Endor for aid and ignoring the Word of God. Religion did not bring salvation and prosperity to Israel, but, on the contrary, religion was the cause of Israel’s downfall, and concerning this it is written in the Bible: “And they served their idols; which were a snare unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto . devils, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.”—Psalm 106:36-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Israel’s rulers having turned to religion, to her last king Jehovah said: “And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, ... I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” (Ezekiel 21:25-27) “He . . . whose right it is,” mentioned in this prophecy, is Jesus Christ, the world’s rightful ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CHRISTIAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Christ” means the anointed and commissioned official of Almighty Jehovah God. Christ Jesus is the Head over all Christians. (Ephesians 5:22, 23) He is the chief witness of Jehovah and Head over all of His witnesses. Those who obey God’s law as Christ Jesus obeys are Christians. Many Christians have been associated with religious organizations because they did not know that religion is a snare. When these honest and sincere ones learn the truth, they flee from religion and flee to God and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Real Christians have no fight with any person because of his religious belief. Many Jews, Catholics, and so-called “Protestants” have been unwittingly ensnared by religion. It is the duty and privilege of every Christian to aid such to see the truth in order that they may devote themselves to God and His kingdom. The only purpose of calling attention to the difference between religion and Christianity is to aid men to see that God’s law is the only safe guide and obedience to God is man’s only protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Tradition” is that which is transmitted from father to son, from ancestor to posterity, without regard to God’s written law. Religion is taught by tradition, and not by the written law of God. Christianity is bottomed solely upon the written Word of Almighty God. The words of Jesus Christ constitute absolute authority because spoken at God’s commandment, and such should be entirely sufficient for everyone who desires to take the right course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Israelites, being God’s chosen people, were the custodians of God’s written Word. The priests were commanded to obey and to teach God’s law to the people, but instead they turned to tradition. They induced the people to practice religion in the place of Christianity. Choosing religion, they despised and rejected Christ Jesus, God’s anointed King. Instead they chose Caesar, the dictator, as king. To them Jesus Christ said: ‘Why do you transgress the commandments of God by your tradition? Thus have you made the commandments of God of none effect by your tradition. Well did God’s prophet say of you. These people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, but their heart is far removed from me.’ (Matthew 15:3-9) Furthermore Jesus said to those religious teachers: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ, was at one time a teacher of religion by tradition. When he became a Christian he wrote these words: ‘For ye have heard of my course in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it; and profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God ... to reveal his Son unto me, I conferred not with flesh and blood. The gospel which I announce came to me by revelation from Jesus Christ.’—Galatians 1:11-16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul fully recognized and declared that religion is demonism, introduced by and taught under the power and influence of the Devil. When Paul was at Athens and observed that people in their religious practices he said to them: “Athenians, I perceive that in all things you are extremely devoted to the worship of demons.” (Acts 17:22, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> Further testifying concerning religion as the invention of the demons, brought forth to deceive men and to reproach God’s name, Paul said to the Corinthians : ‘The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. ... Ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table and the table of demons.’—1 Corinthians 10:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That which is called “the Christian religion” is not Christian. It is a religious practice carried on under the name of Christ, but which is in defiance of the law of Almighty God, and which gives honor to creatures rather than to Almighty God, and which deceives millions of sincere persons. As a pointed example, note the words of the venerable Cardinal Gibbons, who after stating the doctrine of “Purgatory” then adds these words: “This interpretation is not mine. It is the unanimous voice of the fathers of Christendom”; that is, entirely traditional and not supported by the Word of God. (See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font3"> page 208.) After the days of the apostles a sincere body of men organized themselves as Christians. Thereafter subtly Satan, the chief of demons, induced men in that organization to advance and teach their views contrary to the Bible, and thereby they substituted religion for Christianity. Thereafter they taught the traditions of men. That has been dubbed the “Christian organization”, although entirely contrary to God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The indisputable proof is that religion finds no support in the Bible, but finds its support in tradition and is in defiance of the Bible. That being true, what can be said in support of religion as a remedy for the deplorable world conditions? All the evidence shows that religion has never saved any nation, but has been the downfall thus far of all nations that have fallen. The best way to answer the question as to religion being a remedy is to carefully consider the facts showing what result religion has had upon the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What has religion done for the nations of the world? The only great man ever on earth was Jesus of Nazareth, He who is the head of Christianity. Jesus plainly stated to the leaders of Israel that they had violated their covenant to do the will of God and had turned to religion. Because Jesus told them the truth the religious leaders persecuted Jesus to death. Religion, therefore, brought down upon the nation of Israel the wrath of God, and that nation was completely destroyed. That nation yielded to demonism or religion, and that nation perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostles of Jesus Christ were faithful to their covenant to do God’s will, and for that reason suffered great persecution at the hands of religious leaders. Thereafter the mighty system of religion falsely labeled “Christian religion” grew. Under that false title millions of sincere persons have been deceived. That organization is ruled by the “Hierarchy of Authority”, the seat of which is at Vatican City, Italy. For more than sixteen centuries that religious institution has carried on the most wicked persecution of human creatures that has ever blackened the pages of history. The Inquisition of Spain, Mexico, and other nations, conducted under the false cloak of the so-called “Christian religion”, is a record too terrible to find complete description in human words. That record is conclusive proof that the Papal system is not Christianity, but is carried on in defiance of God, hence religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “Hierarchy of Authority” has always favored and supported a totalitarian or corporate state. For a period of time that organization was retarded in its movement to control the world, but since the World War it has again become very aggressive, and, although claiming to serve God, the “Hierarchy of Authority” now stoops to all unholy means of conquering the world. The Hierarchy acts in full harmony and conjunction with the cruel dictators, including Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, and others of like political ambition. The head of that great religious organization is the adviser and close ally of Hitler, who has threatened to overrun all the democracies of the world. Religion has destroyed the freedom of nations in Europe and now has turned its vicious claws upon the republics of the Western world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Without prejudice and without malice, give calm consideration to the following facts, and do so before all your liberties are gone. Basing the conclusion solely upon the Bible, the nations of Europe were warned, in a public address at London, that the totalitarian, religious combine would overrun Europe and take away the liberties of the people. That is now accomplished. If you give heed to the following facts you can see what is in store for America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are honest and sincere men who have been priests of the Roman Catholic church, many of whom have recently separated themselves from that religious organization because of the Hierarchy’s political activities which are called “Catholic Action”. There are millions of sincere and honest Catholic people held in subjection to the Hierarchy because of fear of creatures. All such persons should calmly read the evidence here submitted; for the reason, that evidence shows that the mighty religious organization is acting with Nazi-Fascist dictators to destroy all the liberties of the people. I shall cite some evidence given by men who have come out from that religious organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Doctor Barrett, once an active priest, has published a book under the title “Rome Stoops to Conquer” and which contains facts vital to American liberty and to all persons who love righteousness. All sincere persons would do well to read that book. It is briefly quoted from as follows: “Pope Pius XI . . . has given the best of his singular ability to the supervision and direction of the Catholic campaign in America. . . . The conquest of America is the supreme objective at which he aims. . . . Pius is well aware that the Catholic Church can never hope again to dominate the civilized world until America kneels, beaten and penitent, at her feet. . . . Catholic Action partakes of politics, and is a political penetration, an infiltration into the political world of a new force and agency. . . . Pacelli [now pope] urged on the Knights [of Columbus] to . . . rally . . . Catholic manhood as necessary for the ‘practical solution of those problems of social and civil life.’...</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“A phase of present-day Catholic Action is the urging of Catholics to throw themselves into politics. . . . The church prefers to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">control legislators</span><span class="font3"> rather than parties, and to avoid the odium and expense of running a distinct organization. But the church wants </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">plenty of high offices</span><span class="font3"> for her children. . . . The most sensational use of political power to force a Church issue was that of Archbishop Curley when he threatened the present administration, and President Roosevelt in particular. . . . The police are first in favor with the Church . . . and that having them in their thousands in her tow she can all the more easily command politicians. . . . Never was the Catholic church </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">in any country</span><span class="font3"> in the world since Christendom began so rich, so highly organized, so influential, so </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">loyally soldiered</span><span class="font3"> by her subjects as she is today in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Honest and sincere Catholics should give the most sober consideration to this testimony of Doctor Barrett, who speaks with full knowledge because of his long association with the Catholic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The testimony of another priest, O'Brien, is of interest, and which testimony was published over his own signature in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L’Aurora.</span><span class="font3"> Amongst other things, he said concerning “Catholic Action”: “We want as cabinet members children of the holy mother church holding important positions in the entire structure of our government.” “We are ready prepared for 1940.” “All ... institutions ... must be wiped out or placed under the protection of our Hierarchy.” “All loyal children of the [Catholic] church [are] to assist our worthy President with all our strength to see that the individuals comprising the United States Supreme Court shall obey the President’s injunctions and if necessary we will change, amend or blot out the present Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nineteen-forty is here and the abundance of evidence is to the effect that “Catholic Action” is carrying out the threat of the priest, O’Brien.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Catholic-Fascist conspirators in Canada, led by Adrien Arcand and directed from the Vatican, intended to seize the Canadian government during 1940. Adrien and others have been arrested. Among the many documents seized by the Canadian officers the following has just been published. This communication was addressed to Adrien:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the Committee of Universal Action, Rome: For a long time we have been following the Fascist activity which you are furthering in your great and noble country, and a long conversation with the person for whom I am remitting to you the accompanying note, has permitted me to better know the object of your Holy Battle. We have also been able to learn that you are doing good Fascist work in Canada, Fascist work of a pure Mussolinian nature, that is to say, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman and Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following from Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After Adolph Hitler, I consider Adrien Arcand the one leader who stands out far above any others I have met as he has all the necessary flair, vim and originality which a real leader requires. A Catholic, of course, as are all French-Canadians, but he knows exactly how far he can use and trust the clerical element. At the first sign of a Jew-Bolshevik upheaval in Canada he is in a position to take over the government of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was in that same Bulawayo, Rhodesia, that the Hierarchy maliciously lied against certain non-Catholics and caused them great persecution. This they did to cover up their own nefarious acts of trying to seize control of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recently a number of conscientious Catholic priests have withdrawn from the Catholic Hierarchy organization and are attempting to enlighten the people by publishing a magazine entitled “The Converted Catholic”. Quoted from the editorial column, June, 1940, is the following: Hitler’s ambitions to conquer the world “were planned and desired long before Hitler or any of his Axis partners ever appeared on the scene”. Hitler’s “objectives are the same as those sought for four centuries by Jesuit-led Catholicism in its efforts to destroy the effects of the Reformation. Nazi-fascist dictators, all products of the Catholic Church, have supplied the means that are rapidly bringing these objectives to realization”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“In Germany and in Central Europe Hitler has undertaken to destroy entirely all freedom of the spirit, and his attack can be placed in the win column of the Catholic Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“Catholic Action in the United States is feverishly working for ‘the organization of a corporative movement and the creation of a corporative state’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Catholic priest, Curran, editor of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Tablet,</span><span class="font3"> published at Brooklyn, is an ardent supporter of the so-called “Christian Front”. In his support of lawbreakers he recently said: “It is about time we took over the newspapers of this country.” Many of the big newspapers today fear to publish the truth about “Catholic Action” because of the boycott methods constantly practiced by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nazi-Fascists are attempting to destroy entirely the freedom of all nations, and in this attack they are fully supported by the Hierarchy of Vatican City. When the Catholic people of Belgium were driven like wild beasts from their homes the following dispatch was sent out from Berlin and published throughout the world on June 6: “Berlin, June 6, 1940.—Special meetings of the Roman Catholic bishops throughout Germany have resulted in a decision to hold thanksgiving masses for the German victory in Belgium and Flanders, it was reported today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FLAGS AND CREATURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religious ceremonies performed toward creatures and things are another scheme of the Devil to reproach Jehovah God’s name and to cause men to violate their covenant with God. Compulsory flag-saluting and the heiling of Hitler were introduced in Germany by religionists to compel submission of the people to religious dictators and to reproach God. The secret police or Gestapo came into action at the same time, brutally using power against those who decline to indulge in the religious ceremony of saluting the swastika and heiling Hitler. The Hierarchy are the real movers of compulsory flag-saluting and honoring creatures. Because the Christians in Germany refused to yield to such religious ceremonies thousands of them have been incarcerated in prison and many of them killed. They preferred to suffer death rather than to violate their covenant to be obedient to Almighty God. In America compulsory saluting of the flag by school children was introduced at the instance of the Hierarchy. It appeared in the form of patriotism, but really is directed against those who worship God according to spirit and truth. The purpose has been to put fear into the minds of persons and to destroy individual conscience and devotion to Almighty God. No one for 150 years of American history ever thought of compelling anybody to salute the flag, and now only school children are compelled to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Supreme Court, in the Gobitis case, decided only that school boards might enforce rules compelling children to salute the flag, and that against their conscientious objection. The court made no attempt to decide that adults must salute the flag. No such issue was before the court. There is no law in America that compels adults to salute the flag. But the Hierarchy and allies, in order to browbeat the people, attempt to compel conscientious Christians, contrary to the law of the land, to violate God’s law. Whenever the issue by law is raised compelling adults to salute the flag, that issue will be properly met before the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The true followers of Christ Jesus do not salute any creature or tiling, for the reason that they conscientiously believe that by so doing they would violate their covenant with Almighty God and therefore would suffer destruction. They respect the country’s flag and obey every law for which that flag stands; and they do so because it is right. To indulge in a religious ceremony in violation of their conscience and their covenant with God, they decline to do. They render unto the state that which is due the state, and unto God what they owe to God. That is exactly what Jesus Christ commanded and what he always does.—Luke 20:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Conscientious Christians obey all the laws of the land that are not contrary to Jehovah’s law. All the law writers and the highest court of the land have for centuries recognized the right of individual conscience and that the state has no right to compel a man to violate his conscience. The compulsory flag-wavers are wholly inconsistent. They salute the flag and then straightway violate the law for which the flag stands, attempting to make themselves the law and to compel others to obey their unlawful whims. Christians are lawful citizens. The Hierarchy and their allies who attempt to compel citizens to salute the flag are willful violators of the law, denying them freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of worship, which rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and for which the flag stands. Such fanatical religionists are therefore the lawbreakers, and the righteous suffer at their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LEGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An organization known as “the American Legion” may have been organized for a laudable purpose. The organization doubtless contained some good, conscientious men. The acts and words of the present controlling officials of that organization belie a good purpose. Its present national commander is a Roman Catholic and is a Knight of Columbus, which organization takes orders from the Hierarchy at Vatican City. The Legion is against democratic form of government. Its former national commander Owsley publicly has said: </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Do not forget that the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States.’’</span><span class="font3"> The present national commander, in a speech recently made, openly denounces freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and has demanded the amendment of the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, in a speech a few months ago the same commander advocated a private army by the Legion. That army is already in existence and well armed, waiting for the command of the Hierarchy to move into action. The present national director of the Legion, Mr. Chaillaux, encourages and advocates mob violence against peaceable and law-abiding citizens, who conscientiously serve God and Christ. These facts show that the Legion is against freedom of speech, freedom of worship, and freedom of assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The present commander, Kelly, acting under orders of the Hierarchy issued on the tenth day of June, 1940, made a public statement in which he used this language: “In my belief the good of the whole nation compels summary action to be taken by our properly constituted federal, state, and local authorities to stamp out in their entirety the activities of these subverters, irrespective of what may happen to their fellowtravelers or innocent by-standers.” In other words, he advocates mob action against citizens without the right of trial and without the right of defense. Such a course is nothing short of anarchy and is violence inflicted contrary to the law of the nation and the law of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On that same tenth day of June Mussolini stabbed France in the back and' began war against England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On that same day Catholic priests, police officers, sheriffs, and county attorneys and other officials in various towns in Texas and other places, led mobs that viciously beat and imprisoned many non-Catholics. And for what? Merely because such Christians, acting under the command of God, were calling upon the people and handing them literature telling of God’s kingdom for the establishment of the great Theocratic Government of righteousness, for which government Jesus taught his disciples to continuously pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Texas towns as many as one hundred men, women and children were thrown into one prison and kept all night without food, drink or rest. The next day a mob of men, claiming to represent the American Legion, together with the sheriff and other officers, drove these innocent people through the heat and denied them the opportunity to have refreshments; under which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">summary</span><span class="font3"> punishment many fainted and fell. In another city a Catholic priest led a mob of Legionnaires, against Christians. In Florida old men were taken from their homes and beaten up by professed Legionnaires and Catholics. In Maine others were assaulted in the night, their houses broken into and burned to the ground. In Alabama the sheriff and other public officials kidnaped citizens, destroyed their property and drove them out of the state and delivered them over to Legionnaires in an adjoining state. In Richwood, West Virginia, American citizens, who were exercising their constitutional right of securing signatures to a petition, were violently assaulted by the American Legion, who destroyed the property of these American citizens. A Catholic priest then publicly abused those defenseless persons, during which a policeman viciously assaulted one of these Christians because he quoted Scripture. Nine of these Christians were tied together with ropes, like cattle. A doctor with a stomach pump forced castor oil down their throats. Roped together these witnesses were led from the town like wild animals, while the leaders of the American Legion denounced them in vile language, calling out against them: &quot;Hitler spies; fifth columnists!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here can be mentioned only a few of these instances, but a list is available of the public officials who have followed the advice of Mr. Kelly, the Roman Catholic Legionnaire commander, to inflict summary punishment against innocent American citizens for exercising their Constitutional rights. The Legionnaires and other ruffians under the command of the Hierarchy have made themselves vigilantes inflicting summary punishment upon innocent citizens. The law of the land requires that the vilest murderer must have a trial before a jury of his peers and be given proper counsel and defense. The Hierarchy and the Legion, posing as patriots, punish the innocent without even permitting them to be heard in their own defense. This is what religion has done for America. And yet public officials cry: “We must have more religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INQUISITION REVIVED</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such cruel and unlawful action by the Hierarchy and Legionnaires is but the revival of the old Roman Hierarchy and its cruel Inquisition. Hitler is a life-long Roman Catholic. Hitler has denounced God and declared his purpose to reestablish the “Holy Roman Empire” and to wipe out the Peace Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, which concluded a religious war of thirty years, and which treaty resulted in gaining rights for freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mussolini has become a Catholic and works in conjunction with the Hierarchy, taking his advice from the pope. Franco, a Catholic dictator, destroyed the Spanish republic and now has united the Catholic church and the state in Spain. France has ceased to be a republic and has become a Catholic totalitarian state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">England alone stands firm, battling against the religious-totalitarian combine and in her fight for the rights of a free people. England has been kind to conscientious Christians; and because of that kindness shown it may be expected that Almighty God will show some special favor to England in her hour of terrible distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Men who loved God and righteousness and who refused to yield to religious tyrants and to bow down to and worship creatures or things laid the foundation of the American republic. They caused to be written into the fundamental law that all men have the undeniable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. That original spirit of freedom that permeated the founders of America has perished, and today spineless politicians in authority, with fear and trembling, yield to the lawless, religious Hierarchy and her allies who are destroying freedom of speech and of assembly and freedom of worship. Such is the effect of religion in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God-fearing men, such as Wycliffe, Huss, Luther and Knox, all of whom were once priests in the Catholic church but who, because of the unrighteousness in that system, withdrew and waged a battle for freedom of worship, brought about the great reformation which has been a blessing to humankind. Protestants and politicians of America, have you forgotten that fight for reformation won by those noble-hearted men? Why are you now conniving at the destruction of the Reformation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religious influence has caused the nations of “Christendom” to forget God and to ally themselves with the wicked enemies of Almighty God. What shall be the final result to such nations? The Bible, at Psalm 9:17, answers: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” Let the people therefore take warning from God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Almighty God has commanded that his faithful servants must now tell the honest and sincere people of the world that religion is a snare of the Devil, and which is leading them into destruction, and that God’s Kingdom is their only hope. True Christians are fearlessly obeying that commandment. The great Christian, Christ Jesus, says to his true followers that they are not to fear men, whether they be Hierarchy, Legionnaires or hoodlums, who indulge in cruel persecution of Christians. The words of Jesus are: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matthew 10: 28) Faithful Christians will continue to serve God, regardless of persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why is there such great hatred and persecution of true Christians by the Hierarchy and their religious allies? Because such Christians are for the kingdom, The Theocracy, for the coming of which government Christ Jesus commanded all Christians to ever pray.—Matthew 6:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Demons, under the leadership of Satan, the chief of demons, have from the beginning been against God’s kingdom under Christ. The Roman-Hierarchy-Nazi-Fascists are against all who tell of The Theocracy under Christ. The religious leaders frequently attempted to kill Jesus because he announced himself as Jehovah’s Son and King. To those religious fanatics Jesus said: ‘Ye do the deeds of your father the Devil, who was a murderer from the beginning.’ (John 8:40-44) If religionists were for Christ and his kingdom they would not persecute persons who devote themselves solely to advertising that kingdom. That was true when Jesus was on the earth, and is true today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy take the lead in religion, and Protestants and Jews join with them in their religious activities. Government officials and politicians embrace religion and cry for more religion. From the beginning religion has been employed by the demons to deceive men and turn them away from God. Satan and his horde of demons now are making the last desperate attempt to rule the world by religious dictators in opposition to The Theocratic Government under Christ. Concerning the ruling powers of the world it is written: 'The whole world lies in wickedness.’ (1 John 5:19) All organizations that take their orders from the religious Hierarchy necessarily come under the control of demons. Religion is demonism. The demons control this wicked world, and for that reason the religionists hate The Theo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cratic Government under Christ. Answering the question as to what would be the condition on earth at the end of Satan’s world Jesus said to Christians: “Then ... ye shall he hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matthew 24:9) That is the Bible answer to this vital question. Today true Christians are hated because they are entirely devoted to the kingdom which bears the name of Christ. That is the only reason why they are persecuted and mobbed by religious fanatics; just as the Lord prophesied it would be at this time.—John 15:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the day of Abel until now there have been some witnesses of Almighty God on the earth; the proof of which is found in the Bible, at Hebrews the eleventh chapter. They are not of recent origin. Such are not a religious sect. They have no interest in religion, but they are commanded by the Lord to warn the people against religion. They are devoted solely to advertising The Theocratic Government under Christ because that government is the only hope of humankind. They are not dismayed by reason of persecution that comes upon them. Many of them have been foully killed by religionists; others may be killed. But you will bear this in mind: that God has declared that the blood of those slain shall be upon the heads of the religious agents of the Devil who perpetrate such crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God has chosen his servants as witnesses to his name. Such are therefore his “elect”. In this connection mark the words of Jesus concerning the persecution of God’s faithful servants by the religionists: '‘And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find [such] faith on the earth?”—Luke 18:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This vengeance Jehovah will execute upon the religionists and others at the battle of Armageddon, which is very near. How will he do it? Addressing himself to Christ Jesus, Jehovah says: “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.'<sup>1 </sup>—Psalm 2:9; see also Zephaniah 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Religion brought sin and death upon the human race. Religion brought about the destruction of the world by the flood. Religion caused the confusion of languages. Religion has drenched the earth with human blood. Religion brought the downfall of the nation of Israel. Religion and its wicked agents, under the leadership of demons, are destroying the people and will shortly bring down the wrath of God Almighty upon the whole world in the greatest tribulation ever known. (Matthew 24:21,22) Only those who seek the Lord and righteousness will survive that great war. Here only a few Scriptural citations can be given dealing with the matter. Read them carefully and you will see what is the only hope left for mankind. Religion is not a remedy for human ills. Nothing can be said in support of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the face of all these indisputable facts politicians in America cry: “Give us more religion </span><span class="font1">AND A THIRD TERM, ELSE WE PERISH.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A fearful, religious Congress has by law empowered the president at will to declare an emergency, seize control of all industries and commandeer everything in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">According to the Hierarchy the stage is set for 1940. There is now a rapidly rising tide in opposition to the third term. May it not be that, when it appears extremely doubtful that the Hierarchy politicians can put over the third term, then the would-be dictator will seize the government? If so, he will surely be backed up by the armed Hierarchy, the armed Knights of Columbus, and by the private army of the American Legion, which its commander, Kelly, has recently advocated. Then the religionists will cry: “We are at peace and safety.” Honest Americans do not believe that religion is a remedy for world distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The real and only remedy for human suffering and distress is The Theocratic Kingdom of God under Christ. That kingdom is here. Only by that kingdom shall the world be established. Therefore to his servants God gives this commandment, to wit: ‘Say among the nations, that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously. He shall judge the world in righteousness and the people with his truth.’ —Psalm 96:9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In this hour of great distress the Lord is dividing the obedient ones from the disobedient ones. To those who now hasten to put themselves on the side of the Lord the King he says: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matthew 25: 34) The worship of Jehovah God is the only true worship and is the only way to life, physically and spiritually. Understanding this truth you can see why conscientious Christians can not and will not bow down to creatures or things but they must and shall give their undivided devotion and service to the Almighty God and his Theocratic King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “great multitude” that shall survive Armageddon and fill the earth with a righteous race must now hasten to put themselves on the side of The Theocracy and its King. (Revelation 7:9-17) The rulers of the earth have now forgotten God and turned to religion and are certain to go down in a very short time. Only the “great multitude” will survive, and will live forever on the earth. Then shall the earth become a glorious and blessed place in which to live. Turn your faces and your heart devotion now to the Almighty God and to his King, Christ Jesus, and live.</span></p>
