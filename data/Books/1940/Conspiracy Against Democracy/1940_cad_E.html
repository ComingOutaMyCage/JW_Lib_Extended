<p><span class="font2">IN THESE PERILOUS TIMES when all democracy is under assault and all freedom of speech, of press, of assembly. and of worship is threatened with extinction, it is vital to all liberty-lovers to read what is stated within these pages by America’s most ardent and fearless fighter for this precious freedom, Judge Rutherford.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Because your secular and religious newspapers have refused to publish this information, and because of the millions of invitations recently distributed to attend the Theocratic Convention at Detroit, Mich., July 24-28, 1940, to hear the public address “RELIGION AS A WORLD REMEDY—The Evidence in Support Thereof”, and other addresses of instant importance, it is due you and all people of good will that the substance of those nation-wide addresses be here presented in your interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font11">S</span><span class="font5">ELF-GOVERNMENT of the people is rapidly vanishing from the earth. Harsh, scornful dictators are taking control. Great distress is upon the world, and millions are seeking a place of refuge. What is the remedy for such terrible conditions'?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Political and commercial men of high standing urge upon the nations “more religion” as a world remedy. In America those men say: “Unless we have more religion America is certain to perish.” The president of the United States in sending his personal ambassador to the Vatican said to the pope: 'Your Holiness: It is well that we encourage a closer association between those in religion and those in government, who have a common purpose.' If religion is the remedy, then all honest persons should lay hold upon that remedy. If the evidence does not support the claim that religion is the remedy, then an adequate remedy should be eagerly sought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Only by sober and sincere consideration of truthful evidence can the right conclusion be reached. I earnestly ask all persons of good will to give close attention to the statement of the facts. Those who love righteousness and peace will give a hearing ear. The lawless element will not give heed to anything of reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The terrible distress now upon the world was foretold centuries ago by the holy prophets of Almighty God and recorded in the Bible. It is reasonable that we go to the Divine Record, the Bible, and there seek to learn the cause of distress and what is the true remedy. The Bible contains the truth because it is the Word of Almighty God. It has ever been the guide of those persons who desire to see righteousness and lasting peace in the earth. It is written in God’s Word: “When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.”-Proverbs 29:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The universal mourning of the people now eloquently testifies that the wicked rule the present world. Because Jehovah’s prophecy plainly foretold that dictators would gain control of Europe, it was my privilege to publicly call attention to this fact more than three years ago and warn the European nations of the present disaster that now exists there. On this occasion I shall point out what the prophecies show is certain to come to America and what part religion plays in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The American nation was founded by men who believed Almighty God and who believed that the Bible is His Word of truth. For centuries the people of America prospered and dwelt together in peace, exactly contrary to what we see now in the nation. I appeal to the reasonable people at this time to exercise full faith and confidence in the Almighty God and in the Bible, His Word, and let the burning question of the hour be answered by the infallible testimony of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From whence came the wicked rule of the world? The Bible answers, Satan the Devil is the invisible chief ruler of the world and is supported by a horde of wicked angels, all of whom are called “mighty ones” or “gods” and further supported on earth by multitudes of conscienceless men who revel in unrighteousness. In every form of religion that is practiced there are recognized by man higher invisible powers that dictate the course of men who follow tradition. Religion and Christianity are not the same thing. They are exactly opposed to each other. The Bible defines both, and that definition we should accept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Religion means the doing of anything that is contrary to the will of Almighty God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Christianity means joyfully doing that which is in full harmony with the will of Almighty God, “whose name alone is Jehovah.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan the Devil introduced religion to man. Christ Jesus is the founder and head of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Christianity is the fear of Almighty God, that is, fear to ever go contrary to God’s will. Religion is the fear of creatures. From the beginning religion denied Jehovah God as the almighty power and accepted creatures as equal to or greater than Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mark the Bible proof. Satan rebelled against Almighty God and then challenged God to put men on earth who would be faithful to the great Creator. That raised the issue of who is supreme. The Almighty God informed man that the death penalty would be inflicted upon man who willfully violated God’s law and that the eating of forbidden fruit would constitute a violation of God’s law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan, in defiance of God, said to Eve: ‘If ye eat the fruit that is forbidden ye shall not surely die, for God doth know that the day ye eat thereof ye shall be as gods’; that is, as the angels, all of whom are creatures. Man willfully took the course of disobedience of God’s law, accepted Satan as the higher authority; and in that manner Satan introduced man to religion. At all times since Satan’s chief means of fighting against God has been Religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Head of Christianity, Jesus, said to Jehovah God: ‘I delight to do thy will, O my God; thy law is written in my heart.’ (Psalm 40: 8) Jesus is the great Christian, always doing the will of Jehovah God. Every person who knowingly and gladly does the will of God as Christ Jesus does is a Christian. To be a Christian one must gladly obey Almighty God without fear of man or other creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Approximately sixteen centuries after the creation of man Satan, by means of religion, had corrupted all the peoples of earth except Noah and his family. The great flood destroyed all humankind save Noah and his family, or eight persons. (Genesis 6: 7) Noah was a righteous man and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“a</span><span class="font5"> preacher of righteousness”, and therefore Almighty God saved him and his family. (2 Peter 2:5) Religion there brought destruction upon all mankind; only those who obeyed God survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">You who are of good will toward God and who believe that the Bible is His Word, please now follow the Bible history of man, which briefly recounts the facts leading up to the present deplorable conditions prevailing on the earth. I address my speech to those of good will, with the hope of doing them good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Satan, the subtle foe, always tries to entrap men and destroy them. In this he, Satan, often appears as a creature of light; yet he is the most wicked of all. (2 Corinthians 11:14) A few centuries after the flood the descendants of Noah became religious, with Nimrod as their priest and ruler. Nimrod builded Nineveh and the nation of Babylon, and set himself up as an arbitrary dictator. He caused the people to hail him and bow before him as though he were a mighty god. Babylon and its king, Nimrod, were given over entirely to wickedness. (Genesis 10:8-11, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin)</span><span class="font5"> Following Nimrod other nations were organized, all of which adopted and practiced religion, yielding to Satan and the other demons, and all acting contrary to God’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS NAME</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Almighty God Jehovah purposed the vindication of His name and that He would have “a people for his name” who would serve Him and bear testimony to His supremacy. He selected the descendants of Abraham and Jacob called “Israelites”. He led them out of the land of Egypt, the Devil-religion nation. Under the leadership of Moses God took the Israelites on a long journey to Palestine, the land of promise. Mark now the commandment God gave to the Israelites, warning them that demonism or religion would be a snare unto them. Concerning the practitioners of religion in Canaan Jehovah said to the Israelites: “For they will turn away [thee and thy sons] from following me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.” God then commanded His people to keep themselves entirely separate from those religious people dwelling in Palestine, and said: “Neither shalt thou serve their gods [demons]; for that will be a snare unto thee.” (Deuteronomy 7:4,16) Satan and his associate demons set about to ensnare the Israelites by means of religion. Although God had repeatedly warned the Israelites against such snare, Saul, Israel’s first king, fell to demonism, turning to the witch of Endor for aid and ignoring the Word of God. Religion did not bring salvation and prosperity to Israel, but, on the contrary, religion was the cause of Israel’s downfall, and concerning this it is written in the Bible: “And they served their idols; which were a snare unto them. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.”—Psalm 106: 36-38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Israel’s rulers having turned to religion, to her last king Jehovah said: “And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end, ... I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.” (Ezekiel 21:25-27) “He . . . whose right it is,” mentioned in this prophecy, is Jesus Christ, the world’s rightful ruler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CHRISTIAN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Christ” means the anointed and commissioned official of Almighty Jehovah God. Christ Jesus is the Head over all Christians. (Ephesians 5:22,23) He is the chief Jehovah’s witness and Head over all of Jehovah’s witnesses. Those who obey God’s law as Christ Jesus obeys are Christians. Many Christians have been associated with religious organizations because they did not know that religion is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font5"> snare. When these honest and sincere ones learn the truth, they flee from religion and flee to God and Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses have no fight with any person because of his religious belief. Many Jews, Catholics, and so-called “Protestants” have been unwittingly ensnared by religion. It is the duty and privilege of every Christian to aid such to see the truth in order that they may devote themselves to God and His kingdom. The only purpose of calling attention to the difference between religion and Christianity is to aid men to see that God’s law is the only safe guide and obedience to God is man’s only protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Tradition” is that which is transmitted from father to son, from ancestor to posterity, without regard to God’s written law. Religion is taught by tradition, and not by the written law of God. Christianity is bottomed solely upon the written Word of Almighty God. The words of Jesus Christ constitute absolute authority because spoken at God’s commandment, and such should be 'entirely sufficient for everyone who desires to take the right course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Israelites, being God’s chosen people, were the custodians of God’s written Word. The priests were commanded to obey and to teach God’s law to the people, but instead they turned to tradition. They induced the people to practice religion in the place of Christianity. Choosing religion, they despised and rejected Christ Jesus, God’s anointed King. Instead they chose Caesar, the dictator, as king. To them Jesus Christ said: W<sup>T</sup>hy do you transgress the commandments of God by your tradition ? Thus have you made the commandments of God of none effect by your tradition. Well did God’s prophet say of you, These people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, but their heart is far removed from me.’ (Matthew 15: 3-9) Furthermore Jesus said to those religious teachers: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a liar, and the father of it.”—John 8:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ, was at one time a teacher of religion by tradition. When he became a Christian he wrote these words: ‘For ye have heard of my course in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it; and profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. But when it pleased God ... to reveal his Son unto me, I conferred not with flesh and blood. The gospel which I announce came to me by revelation from Jesus Christ.’—Galatians 1:11-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul fully recognized and declared that religion is demonism, introduced by and taught under the power and influence of the Devil. When Paul was at Athens and observed that people in their religious practices he said to them: “Athenians, I perceive that in all things you are extremely devoted to the worship of demons.” (Acts 17:22, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott)</span><span class="font5"> Further testifying concerning religion as the invention of the demons, brought forth to deceive men and to reproach God’s name, Paul said to the Corinthians : ‘The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. ... Ye cannot be partakers of the Lord’s table and the table of demons.’—1 Corinthians 10:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That which is called “the Christian religion” is not Christian. It is a religious practice carried on under the name of Christ, but which is in defiance of the law of Almighty God, and which gives honor to creatures rather than to Almighty God, and which deceives millions of sincere persons. As a pointed example I cite the words of the venerable Cardinal Gibbons, who after stating the doctrine of “Purgatory” then adds these words: “This interpretation is not mine. It is the unanimous voice of the fathers of Christendom”; that is, entirely traditional and not supported by the Word of God. (See </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Faith of Our Fathers,</span><span class="font5"> page 208.) After the days of the apostles a sincere body of men organized themselves as Christians. Thereafter subtly Satan, the chief of demons, induced men in that organization to advance and teach their views contrary to the Bible, and thereby they substituted religion for Christianity. Thereafter they taught the traditions of men. That has been dubbed the “Christian organization”, although entirely contrary to God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The indisputable proof is that religion finds no support in the Bible, but finds its support in tradition and is in defiance of the Bible. That being true, what can be said in support of religion as a remedy for the deplorable world conditions? All the evidence shows that religion has never saved any nation, but has been the downfall thus far of all nations that have fallen. The best way to answer the question as to religion being a remedy is to carefully consider the facts showing what result religion has had upon the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RESULTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">What has religion done for the nations of the world? The only great man ever on earth was Jesus of Nazareth, He who is the head of Christianity. Jesus plainly stated to the leaders of Israel that they had violated their covenant to do the will of God and had turned to religion. Because Jesus told them the truth the religious leaders persecuted Jesus to death. Religion, therefore, brought down upon the nation of Israel the wrath of God, and that nation was completely destroyed. That nation yielded to demonism or religion, and that nation perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The apostles of Jesus Christ were faithful to their covenant to do God’s will, and for that reason suffered great persecution at the hands of religious leaders. Thereafter the mighty system of religion falsely labeled “Christian religion” grew. Under that false title millions of sincere persons have been deceived. That organization is ruled by the “Hierarchy of Authority”, the seat of which is at Vatican City, Italy. For more than sixteen centuries that religious institution has carried on the most wicked persecution of human creatures that has ever blackened the pages of history. The Inquisition of Spain, Mexico, and other nations, conducted under the false cloak of the so-called “Christian religion”, is a record too terrible to find complete description in human words. That record is conclusive proof that the Papal system is not Christianity, but is carried on in defiance of God, hence religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “Hierarchy of Authority” has always favored and supported a totalitarian or corporate state. For a period of time that organization was retarded in its movement to control the world, but since the World War it has again become very aggressive, and, although claiming to serve God, the “Hierarchy of Authority” now stoops to all unholy means of conquering the world. The Hierarchy acts in full harmony and conjunction with the cruel dictators, including Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, and others of like political ambition. The head of that great religious organization is the adviser and close ally of Hitler, who has threatened to overrun all the democracies of the world. Religion has destroyed the freedom of nations in Europe and now has turned its vicious claws upon the republics of the Western world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Without prejudice and without malice, and with a heart’s sincere desire to enlighten and do good to all people of good will, I appeal to the American people to give calm consideration to the following facts, and to do so before all of their liberties are gone. Basing my conclusion solely upon the Bible, I warned the nations of Europe, in a public address at London, that the totalitarian, religious combine would overrun Europe and take away the liberties of the people. That is now accomplished. If you give heed to the following facts you can see what is in store for America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There are honest and sincere men who have been priests of the Roman Catholic church, many of whom have recently separated themselves from that religious organization because of the Hierarchy’s political activities which are called “Catholic Action”. There are millions of sincere and honest Catholic people held in subjection to the Hierarchy because of fear of creatures. All such persons should calmly hear the evidence here submitted; for the reason, that evidence shows that the mighty religious organization is acting with Nazi-Fascist dictators to destroy all the liberties of the people. I shall cite some evidence given by men who have come out from that religious organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Doctor Barrett, once an active priest, has published a book under the title “Rome Stoops to Conquer” and which contains facts vital to American liberty and to all persons who love righteousness. AH sincere persons would do well to read that book. Briefly I quote from it as follows: “Pope Pius XI . . . has given the best of his singular ability to the supervision and direction of the Catholic campaign in America. . . . The conquest of America is the supreme objective at which he aims. . . . Pius is well aware that the Catholic Church can never hope again to dominate the civilized world until America kneels, beaten and penitent, at her feet. . . . Catholic Action partakes of politics, and is a political penetration, an infiltration into the political world of a new force and agency. . . . Pacelli [now pope] urged on the Knights [of Columbus] to ... rally ... Catholic manhood as necessary for the 'practical solution of those problems of social and civil life.’ . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“A phase of present-day Catholic Action is the urging of Catholics to throw themselves into politics. . . . The church prefers to </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">control legislators</span><span class="font5"> rather than parties, and to avoid the odium and expense of running a distinct organization. But the church wants </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">plenty of high offices</span><span class="font5"> for her children. . . . The most sensational use of political power to force a Church issue was that of Archbishop Curley when he threatened the present administration, and President Roosevelt in particular. . . . The police are first in favor with the Church . . . and that having them in their thousands in her tow she can all the more easily command politicians. . . . Never was the Catholic church </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">in any country</span><span class="font5"> in the world since Christendom began so rich, so highly organized, so influential, so </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">loyally soldiered</span><span class="font5"> by her subjects as she is today in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Honest and sincere Catholics should give the most sober consideration to this testimony of Doctor Barrett, who speaks with full knowledge because of his long association with the Catholic organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The testimony of another priest, O’Brien, is of interest, and which testimony was published over his own signature in </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">L’Aurora.</span><span class="font5"> Amongst other things, he said concerning “Catholic Action”: “We want as cabinet members children of the holy mother church holding important positions in the entire structure of our government.” “We are ready prepared for 1940.” “All . .. institutions . .. must be wiped out or placed under the protection of our Hierarchy.” “All loyal children of the [Catholic] church [are] to assist our worthy President with all our strength to see that the individuals comprising the United States Supreme Court shall obey the President’s injunctions and if necessary _wc will change, amend or blot out the present Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nineteen-forty is here and the abundance of evidence is to the effect that “Catholic Action” is carrying out the threat of the priest, O’Brien.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Catholic-Fascist conspirators in Canada, led by Adrien Arcand and directed from the Vatican, intended to seize the Canadian government during 1940. Adrien and others have been arrested. Among the many documents seized by the Canadian officers the following has just been published. This communication was addressed to Adrien: “From the Committee of Universal Action, Rome: For a long time we have been following the Fascist activity which you are furthering in your great and noble country, and a long conversation with the person for whom I am remitting to you the accompanying note, has permitted me to better know the object of your Holy Battle. We have also been able to learn that you are doing good Fascist work in Canada, Fascist work of a pure Mussolinian nature, that is to say, Roman and Catholic.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The following from Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia: “After Adolph Hitler, I consider Adrien Arcand the one leader who stands out far above any others I have met as he has all the necessary flair, vim and originality which a real leader requires. A Catholic, of course, as are all French-Canadians, but he knows exactly how far he can use and trust the clerical element. At the first sign of a Jew-Bolshevik upheaval in Canada he is in a position to take over the government of the country.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It was in that same Bulawayo, Rhodesia, that the Hierarchy maliciously lied against Jehovah’s witnesses and caused them great persecution. This they did to cover up their own nefarious acts of trying to seize control of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Recently a number of conscientious Catholic priests have withdrawn from the Catholic Hierarchy organization and are attempting to enlighten the people by publishing a magazine entitled “The Converted Catholic”. I quote from the editorial column, June, 1940, the following: Hitler’s ambitions to conquer the world “were planned and desired long before Hitler or any of his Axis partners ever appeared on the scene”. Hitler’s “objectives are the same as those sought for four centuries by Jesuit-led Catholicism in its efforts to destroy the effects of the Reformation. Nazi-fascist dictators, all products of the Catholic Church, have supplied the means that are rapidly bringing these objectives to realization”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“In Germany and in Central Europe Hitler has undertaken to destroy entirely all freedom of the spirit, and his attack can be placed in the win column of the Catholic Church.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Catholic Action in the United States is feverishly working for ‘the organization of a corporative movement and the creation of a corporative state’.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Catholic priest, Curran, editor of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">The Catholic Tablet,</span><span class="font5"> published at Brooklyn, is an ardent supporter of the so-called “Christian Front”. In his support of lawbreakers he recently said: “It is about time we took over the newspapers of this country.” Many of the big newspapers today fear to publish the truth about “Catholic Action” because of the boycott methods constantly practiced by the Hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nazi-Fascists are attempting to destroy entirely the freedom of all nations, and in this attack they are fully supported by the Hierarchy of Vatican City. When the Catholic people of Belgium were driven like wild beasts from their homes the following dispatch was sent out from Berlin and published throughout the world on June 6: “Berlin, June 6, 1940.—Special meetings of the Roman Catholic bishops throughout Germany have resulted in a decision to hold thanksgiving masses for the German victory in Belgium and Flanders, it was reported today.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FLAGS AND CREATURES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious ceremonies performed toward creatures and things are another scheme of the Devil to reproach Jehovah God's name and to cause men to violate their covenant with God. Compulsory flag-saluting and the heiling of Hitler were introduced in Germany by religionists to compel submission of the people to religious dictators and to reproach God. The secret police of Gestapo came into action at the same time, brutally using power against those who decline to indulge in the religious ceremony of saluting the swastika and heiling Hitler. The Hierarchy are the real movers of compulsory flag-saluting and honoring creatures. Because the Christians in Germany refused to yield to such religious ceremonies thousands of them have been incarcerated in prison and many of them killed. They preferred to suffer death rather than to violate their covenant to be obedient to Almighty God. In America compulsory saluting of the flag by school children was introduced at the instance of the Hierarchy. It appeared in the form of patriotism, but really is directed against those who worship God according to spirit and truth. The purpose has been to put fear into the minds of persons and to destroy individual conscience and devotion to Almighty God. No one for 150 years of American history ever thought of compelling anybody to salute the flag, and now only school children are compelled to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Supreme Court, in the Gobitis case, decided only that school boards might enforce rules compelling children to salute the flag, and that against their conscientious objection. The court made no attempt to decide that adults must salute the flag. No such issue was before the court. There is no law in America that compels adults to salute the flag. But the Hierarchy and allies, in order to browbeat the people, attempt to compel conscientious Christians, contrary to the law of the land, to violate God’s law. Whenever the issue by lavfis raised compelling adults to salute the flag, that issue will be properly met before the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The true followers of Christ Jesus, who are Jehovah’s witnesses, do not salute any creature or thing, for the reason that they conscientiously believe that by so doing they would violate their covenant with Almighty God and therefore would suffer destruction. Jehovah’s witnesses respect the American flag and obey every law for which that flag stands; and they do so because it is right. To indulge in a religious ceremony in violation of their conscience and their covenant with God, they decline to do. They render unto the state that which is due the state, and unto God what they owe to God. That is exactly what Jesus Christ commanded and what he always does.—Luke 20: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses obey all the laws of the land that are not contrary to Jehovah’s law. All the law writers and the highest court of this land have for centuries recognized the right of individual conscience and that the state has no right to compel a man to violate his conscience. The compulsory flag-wavers are wholly inconsistent. They salute the flag and then straightway violate the law for which the flag stands, attempting to make themselves the law and to compel others to obey their unlawful whims. Jehovah’s witnesses are lawful citizens. The Hierarchy and their allies who attempt to compel citizens to salute the flag are willful violators of the law, denying them freedom of conscience, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of worship, which rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and for which the flag stands. Such fanatical religionists are therefore the lawbreakers, and the righteous suffer at their hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">LEGION</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An organization known as “the American Legion” may have been organized for a laudable purpose. The organization doubtless contained some good, conscientious men. The acts and words of the present controlling officials of that organization belie a good purpose. Its present national commander is a Roman Catholic and is a Knight of Columbus, which organization takes orders from the Hierarchy at Vatican City. The Legion is against democratic form of government. Its former national commander Owsley publicly has said: </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Do not forget that the Fascisti are to Italy what the American Legion is to the United States.”</span><span class="font5"> The present national commander, in a speech recently made, openly denounces freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and has demanded the amendment of the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, in a speech a few days ago the same commander advocated a private army by the Legion. That army is already in existence and well armed, waiting for the command of the Hierarchy to move into action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present national director of the Legion, Mr. Chaillaux, encourages and advocates mob violence against peaceable and law-abiding citizens, who conscientiously serve God and Christ. These facts show that the Legion is against freedom of speech, freedom of worship, and freedom of assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The present commander, Kelly, acting under orders of the Hierarchy issued on the tenth day of June, 1940, made a public statement in which he used this language: “In my belief the good of the whole nation compels summary action to be taken by our properly constituted federal, state, and local authorities to stamp out in their entirety the activities of these subverters, irrespective of what may happen to their fellowtravelers or innocent by-standers.” In other words he advocates mob action against citizens without the right of trial and without the right of defense. Such a course is nothing short of anarchy and is violence inflicted contrary to the law of the nation and the law of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On that same tenth day of June Mussolini stabbed France in the back and began war against England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On that same day Catholic priests, police officers, sheriffs, and county attorneys and other officials in various towns in Texas and other places, led mobs that viciously beat and imprisoned many of Jehovah’s witnesses. And for what? Merely because Jehovah’s witnesses, acting under the command of God, were calling upon the people and handing them literature telling of God’s kingdom for the establishment of the great Theocratic Government of righteousness, for which government Jesus taught his disciples to continuously pray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Texas towns as many as one hundred men, women and children were thrown into one prison and kept all night without food, drink or rest. The next day a mob of men, claiming to represent the American Legion, together with the sheriff and other officers, drove these innocent people through the heat and denied them the opportunity to have refreshments; under which </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">summary</span><span class="font5"> punishment many fainted and fell. In another city a Catholic priest led a mob of Legionnaires, against Jehovah’s witnesses. In Florida old men were taken from their homes and beaten up by professed Legionnaires and Catholics. In Maine Jehovah’s witnesses were assaulted in the night, their houses broken into and burned to the ground. In Alabama the sheriff and other public officials kidnaped citizens, destroyed their property and drove them out of the state and delivered them over to Legionnaires in an adjoining state. In Richwood, West Virginia, American citizens, who were exercising their constitutional right of securing signatures to a petition, were violently assaulted by the American Legion, who destroyed the property of Jehovah’s witnesses. A Catholic priest then publicly abused those defenseless persons, during which a policeman viciously assaulted one of these Christians because he quoted scripture. Nine of these Christians were tied together with ropes, like cattle. A doctor with a stomach pump forced castor oil down their throats. Roped together these witnesses were led from the town like wild animals, while the leaders of the American Legion denounced them in vile language, calling out against these witnesses: “Hitler spies; fifth columnists!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I can here mention only a few of these instances, but I append a list of the public officials who have followed the advice of Mr. Kelly, the Roman Catholic Legionnaire commander, to inflict summary punishment against innocent American citizens for exercising their Constitutional rights. The Legionnaires and other ruffians under the command of the Hierarchy have made themselves vigilantes inflicting summary punishment upon innocent citizens. The law of the land requires that the vilest murderer must have a trial before a jury of his peers and be given proper counsel and defense. The Hierarchy and the Legion, posing as patriots, punish the innocent without even permitting them to be heard in their own defense. This is what religion has done for America. And yet public officials cry: “We must have more religion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">INQUISITION REVIVED</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Such cruel and unlawful action by the Hierarchy and Legionnaires is but the revival of the old Roman Hierarchy and its cruel Inquisition. Hitler is a life-long Roman Catholic. Hitler has denounced God and declared his purpose to reestablish the “Holy Roman Empire” and to wipe out the Peace Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, which concluded a religious war of thirty years, and which treaty resulted in gaining rights for freedom of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Mussolini has become a Catholic and works in conjunction with the Hierarchy, taking his advice from the pope. Franco, a Catholic dictator, destroyed the Spanish republic and now has united the Catholic church and the state in Spain. France has ceased to be a republic and has become a Catholic totalitarian state. Canada has yielded to the sinister religious influence of the Hierarchy and has debarred her citizens from freedom of assembly and freedom of worship of Almighty God and the study of his Word. Canada may soon learn that Jehovah’s witnesses are the most law-abiding people in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">England alone stands firm, battling against the religious-totalitarian combine and in her fight for the rights of a free people. England has been kind to Jehovah’s witnesses; and because of that kindness shown it may be expected that Almighty God will show some special favor to England in her hour of terrible distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Men who loved God and righteousness and who refused to yield to religious tyrants and to bow down to and worship creatures or things -laid the foundation of the American republic. They caused to be written into the fundamental law that all men have the undeniable right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience. That original spirit of freedom that permeated the founders of America has perished, and today spineless politicians in authority, with fear and trembling, yield to the lawless, religious Hierarchy and her allies who are destroying freedom of speech and of assembly and freedom of worship. Such is the effect of religion in America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God-fearing men, such as Wycliffe, Huss, Luther and Knox, all of whom were once priests in the Catholic church but who, because of the unrighteousness in that system, withdrew and waged a battle for freedom of worship, brought about the great reformation which has been a blessing to humankind. Protestants and politicians of America, have you forgotten that fight for reformation won by these noble-hearted men? Why are you now conniving at the destruction of the Reformation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">State officials invite Jehovah’s witnesses to meet in convention, and enter into a contract for such lawful assembly, and then, without just cause or excuse, yield to the subtle influence of the religious Hierarchy, repudiate their contracts and deny the privilege of lawful assembly for worship of God. When more than two million American citizens petitioned the governor of the State of Ohio to use his influence and power to insure freedom of assembly and worship at Columbus, that petition is denied, the only excuse given being that this body of Christian people will not violate their conscience and practice idolatry in disobedience to Almighty God’s law and thus jeopardize their eternal existence. The very things for which the American flag stands the governor and other public officials repudiate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religious influence has caused the nations of “Christendom” to forget God and to ally themselves with the wicked enemies of Almighty God. What shall be the final result to such nations? The Bible, at Psalm 9:17, answers: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” Let the people therefore take warning from God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Almighty God has commanded that his faithful servants must now tell the honest and sincere people of the world that religion is a snare of the Devil, and which is leading them into destruction, and that God’s Kingdom is their only hope. Jehovah’s witnesses are fearlessly obeying that commandment. The great Christian, Christ Jesus, says to his true followers that they are not to fear men, whether they be Hierarchy, Legionnaires or hoodlums, who indulge in cruel persecution of Christians. The words of Jesus are: “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.” (Matthew 10: 28) Jehovah’s witnesses will continue to serve God, regardless of persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">WHY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Why is there such great hatred and persecution of Jehovah’s witnesses by the Hierarchy and their religious allies? Because Jehovah’s witnesses are for the kingdom, The Theocracy, for the coming of which government Christ Jesus commanded all Christians to ever pray. —Matthew 6: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Demons, under the leadership of Satan, the chief of demons, have from the beginning been against God’s kingdom under Christ. The Roman-Hierarchy-Nazi-Fascists are against all who tell of The Theocracy under Christ. The religious leaders frequently attempted to kill Jesus because he announced himself as Jehovah’s Son and King. To those religious fanatics Jesus said: ‘Ye do the deeds of your father the Devil, who was a murderer from the beginning.’ (John 8:40-44) If religionists were for Christ and his kingdom they would not persecute persons who devote themselves solely to advertising that kingdom. That was true when Jesus was on the earth, and is true today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Roman Catholic Hierarchy take the lead in religion, and Protestants and Jews join with them in their religious activities. Government officials and politicians embrace religion and cry for more religion. From the beginning religion has been employed by the demons to deceive men and turn them away from God. Satan and his horde of demons now are making the last desperate attempt to rule the world by religious dictators in opposition to The Theocratic Government under Christ. Concerning the ruling powers of the world it is written: ‘The w’hole world lies in wickedness.’ (1 John 5:19) All organizations that take their orders from the religious Hierarchy necessarily come under the control of demons. Religion is demonism. The demons control this wicked world, and for that reason the religionists hate The Theocratic Government under Christ. Answering the question as to what would be the condition on earth at the end of Satan’s world Jesus said to Christians: '‘Then ... ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matthew 24:9) That is the Bible answer to this vital question. Today Jehovah’s witnesses, who are Christians, are hated because they are entirely devoted to the kingdom which bears the name of Christ. That is the only reason why they are persecuted and mobbed by religious fanatics; just as the Lord prophesied it would be at this time.— John 15:18-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jehovah’s witnesses are not a religious sect. They are not of recent origin. Since the day of Abel until now there have been some Jehovah’s witnesses on the earth; the proof of which is found in the Bible, at Hebrews the eleventh chapter. Jehovah’s witnesses have no interest in religion, but they are commanded by the Lord to warn the people against religion. They are devoted solely to advertising The Theocratic Government under Christ because that government is the only hope of humankind. They are not dismayed by reason of persecution that comes upon them. Many of them have been foully killed by religionists; others may be killed. But you will bear this in mind: that God has declared that the blood of those slain shall be upon the heads of the religious agents of the Devil who perpetrate such crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God has chosen his servants as witnesses to his name. Such are therefore his “elect”. In this connection mark the words of Jesus concerning the persecution of God’s faithful servants by the religionists: “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find [such] faith on the earth ?”■—Luke 18: 7, 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This vengeance Jehovah will execute upon the religionists and others at the battle of Armageddon, which is very near. How will he do it? Addressing himself to Christ Jesus, Jehovah says: “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” —Psalm 2:9; see also Zephaniah 3: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Religion brought sin and death upon the human race. Religion brought'about the destruction of the world by the flood. Religion caused the confusion of languages. Religion has drenched the earth with human blood. Religion brought the downfall of the nation of Israel. Religion and its wicked agents, under the leadership of demons, are destroying the people and will shortly bring down the wrath of God Almighty upon the whole world in the greatest tribulation ever known. (Matthew 24:21,22) Only those who seek the Lord and righteousness will survive that great war. Here I can give only a few Scriptural citations dealing with the matter. I hold in my hand a book, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Religion,</span><span class="font5"> this day released to all persons of good will who desire to know the truth. It cites the texts of the Bible, showing you where you can find the proof. Read it carefully and you will see what is the only hope left for mankind. Religion is not a remedy for human ills. Nothing can be said in support of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the face of all these indisputable facts politicians cry: “Give us more religion and a third </span><span class="font1">TERM, ELSE WE PERISH.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A fearful, religious Congress has by law empowered the president at will to declare an emergency, seize control of all industries and commandeer everything in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">According to the Hierarchy the stage is set for 1940. There is now a rapidly rising tide in opposition to the third term. May it not be that, when it appears extremely doubtful that the Hierarchy politicians can put over the third term, then the would-be dictator will seize the government? If so, he will surely be backed up by the armed Hierarchy, the armed Knights of Columbus, and by the private army of the American Legion, which its commander, Kelly, has recently advocated. Then the religionists will cry: “We are at peace and safety.” Honest Americans do not believe that religion is a remedy for world distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">remedy</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The real and only remedy for human suffering and distress is The Theocratic Kingdom of</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">God under Christ. That kingdom is here. Only by that kingdom shall the world be established. Therefore to his servants God gives this commandment, to wit: ‘Say among the nations, that the Lord reigneth; the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved; he shall judge the people righteously. He shall judge the world in righteousness and the people with his truth.’ —Psalm 96: 9-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In this hour of great distress the Lord is dividing the obedient ones from the disobedient ones. To those who' now hasten to put themselves on the side of the Lord the King he says: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matthew 25: 34) The worship of Jehovah God is the only true worship and is the only way to life, physically and spiritually. Understanding this truth you can see why Jehovah’s witnesses can not and will not bow down to creatures or things but they must and shall give their undivided devotion and service to the Almighty God and his Theocratic King, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The “great multitude” that shall survive Armageddon and fill the earth with a righteous race must now hasten to put themselves on the side of The Theocracy and its King. (Revelation 7:9-17) The rulers of the earth have now forgotten God and turned to religion and are certain to go down in a very short time. Only the “great multitude” will survive, and will live forever on the earth. .Then shall the earth become a glorious and blessed place in which to live. Turn your faces and your heart devotion now to the Almighty God and to his King, Christ Jesus, and live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Amid the thunderous burst of applause that immediately followed the above a former captain in the United States army, G. Y. McCormick, sprang to his feet and cried out: “Mr. Chairman! Mr. Chairman! I desire to present a Resolution to this great convention. Much has been said about the American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars and their attitude against this Christian convention. I was an officer in the World War and commanded a company at the front in France. I am a Christian now, and I ask you to have this Resolution read to the convention, and I ask the convention to unanimously adopt it and send it out as their message to the people.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To this the convention chairman responded: “Max Freschel, who was born a Jew, but who is a Christian by adoption and who has had much experience with the Nazis in Europe, will appreciate reading this statement to the convention. I call upon him to do so. ’ ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The statement as read follows:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark4"></a>STATEMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="font11">U</span><span class="font5">PWARD of forty thousand servants of the Most High God Jehovah now assembled in convention at Detroit, together with many other thousands assembled in seventeen other cities of the United States which are joined with this assembly by private telephone wires, do make this Statement of Facts for the benefit of the law-abiding, order-loving citizens of this nation who favor righteousness, freedom of assembly and freedom of worship guaranteed by the Constitution:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">First : On three different years, at the invitation of the good people of Columbus, Ohio, we </span><span class="font5">held our conventions in that city at the State Fair Grounds. Again, in 1940, Columbus officially expressed much pleasure concerning our former conventions and graciously invited us to meet there again this year. The invitation being accepted, the State Fair Grounds management entered into a contract with us for the use of the Fair Grounds for a period of five days for this convention. Great preparation was made and much advertisement of the city, together with our convention. Thousands of homes of the good people of that city were thrown open to us and our coming was welcomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Second: Then members of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that political-religious organization that is directed and ruled from Rome, brought to bear sufficient pressure upon the state officials controlling the Fair .Grounds to cause them to repudiate their contract and to deny us the use of the Fair Grounds and our meeting there. Although thousands of the citizens of Columbus, together with more than two million others, protested against that wrongful action, we were not permitted to hold our convention in Columbus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Third: Other places were sought, and only a few days prior to the date for our assembly a hall was engaged in the city of Detroit for this convention, the rent for which was paid in full, and preparations for coming here began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fourth: Then immediately members of the Catholic Hierarchy, together with the so-called “American Legion”, and Veterans of Foreign Wars (many of whom never saw a foreign shore), these, together with other lawless elements, bitterly opposed our meeting here and </span><span class="font5">have acted in an unlawful manner toward us since we have come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fifth : Private homes of Detroit were gladly opened to us, and upward of twenty thousand of our people have been housed in these private homes, and many others in hotels and boardinghouses. The merchants and thousands of other citizens of this great city have treated us with unusual kindness and consideration, for all of which we express our deep appreciation. They have strongly expressed their disapproval of the action of religious and political leaders in this city, and for this we are very grateful and express our gratitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sixth: Many of the newspapers of Detroit have been unfavorable to us, publishing many false statements. Public officials of the city, under the dominating influence of said religious leaders, have acted uncivilly, un-Americanly and very harshly against us. Although we have spent thousands of dollars here with Detroit’s merchants, and have operated a large cafeteria to feed the poor, and although we are a charitable organization operating without pecuniary profit, the city tax collector has pursued the unusual course of requiring us to pay a license tax for the privilege of feeding the needy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seventh: Most noticeable of all, however, has been the cruel and wicked treatment heaped upon many of our people by Catholic priests and other hoodlum, and lawless elements, acting under the influence of such priests. These Catholic clergymen have led mobs which have committed assaults upon women and children, as well as men. Catholic priests have violently assaulted and struck women in the back and torn </span><span class="font5">their clothes, and otherwise maltreated them. When complaint was made to public officers, with request that such priests be arrested for their unlawful conduct, the officers, influenced by the religious element, have pushed the complaint aside and refused to make any arrests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eighth : In other parts of the United States where conventions were being arranged in conjunction with this one, Catholic priests, sheriffs, chiefs of police, officers in the American Legion, acting together with other lawless elements, have led mobs and have driven our people like wild beasts from their homes and out of the community where they reside. Manifestly it was the intention of such lawless element to prevent our body of Christian people from holding any convention in any part of the United States. But in this they have failed and, by God’s grace, we have been permitted to come here. For all of these things we give thanks to God, well knowing that, according to His promise, all things shall work together for ultimate good for those who love Him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ninth: We recite these facts as further and corroborative proof that the Lord Jesus, the great King, true to His promise, is now present separating “his sheep” from “the goats”. The Lord declared that the lawless element, led by religionists and other lawbreakers, would commit deeds of violence against His servants, and such lawless, persecuting element He calls “goats”; that the people who treat His servants with kindness and consideration, and who are of good will toward God, are designated as “His sheep”. In this same prophetic utterance Jesus stated that the wicked deeds performed by the </span><span class="font5">goats against His servants He would count as though they had been done to Him in person; that all good deeds performed toward His servants He would count as done to Him personally. Thus He show’s that the goats will be fighting against the Lord, while “the sheep’’ will be for the Lord. Then to the goats, who are wicked, He says: “Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels”; and to those of good will He says: “Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matthew 25: 32-46) Thus it is seen that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, that rule and control millions of people, together with the lawless element of other organizations acting under the influence of that religious body, are in the “goat” class, and are doing exactly what the Lord foretold they would do; and that these facts should awaken the people to the importance of this hour. That Hierarchy and other unlawful elements are the real enemies of the American government, the enemies of all righteousness, and, above all, the enemy of God, and opposers of The Theocratic Government. There are millions of sincere and honest Catholic persons, many of whom are now fleeing from the dominating control of the Catholic Hierarchy and finding refuge in the Lord. To all such we send our greetings and bid you God’s blessing. The kingdom of God, the great Theocracy by Christ Jesus, is your only hope of salvation to life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tenth: To His servants the Lord said concerning the present time: “Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matthew’ 24:9) We delight to declare ourselves wholly and com</span><span class="font5">pletely devoted to the great Theocratic Government, the Kingdom of Jehovah God by His King, Christ Jesus, the world’s rightful ruler, and we welcome the opportunity of bearing the reproach that has been heaped upon the Lord and upon His holy name. We call upon all orderloving people throughout the land to take notice of the fact that the kingdom of heaven is at hand and that their only means of life is to flee from the dominating, wicked influence now being exercised by the lawless and flee to the Theocratic Rule of Christ Jesus. To all such order-loving people we extend our kindest wishes, be they Catholic, Protestant, Jew, bond or free. There is but one means of salvation, and that is by Jehovah God through Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With a deafening roar of “Aye! ” the above Statement was joyously adopted by the audience of 45,000 in Detroit, and by the tens of thousands simultaneously assembled in convention halls in seventeen other American cities which were tied in with Detroit and attended to all the proceedings there by direct telephone-line communication and public-address systems.</span></p>
<h1><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark6"></a>THE END</span></h1>
<p><span class="font11">J</span><span class="font3">EHOVAH GOD directed his prophet to write: “The end shall be at the time appointed.” (Daniel 11: 27) Necessarily that means that the end is definitely fixed and shall not be delayed. This and other prophecies were written long ago that God’s people now on the earth in this time of great world distress might have comfort and be strong in hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“The end,” as mentioned in this prophecy, means the final end which comes when the “strange work” of God is completed and the “strange act” begins. (Isaiah 28:21) It is the time when “this gospel of the kingdom” has been preached as a witness to the nations of earth and that preaching is completed. (Matthew 24:14) Since the year 1922 God’s covenant people have been busily engaged in the work of making known the kingdom of God. In this they have had much tribulation and far greater joy. Twelve years ago in this city a resolution was adopted by a convention of the people of the Lord, which was a “Declaration” of war against Satan’s wicked rule. It was a proclamation of allegiance to Jehovah God and against the unrighteous rule by demons and their agencies. Since then Jehovah has gradually unfolded to the vision of his people the meaning of many prophecies, which revelation has brought to them great comfort and joy. All the evidence now strongly points to the fact that Armageddon is very near and that soon we may witness Satan’s defeat and the complete vindication of Jehovah’s name. That will mean the beginning of endless joy, peace and life to all creation</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">that love righteousness and hate iniquity. In these days of darkness upon earthly rulers and gross darkness upon the credulous people that hold to demonism there is great light shining into the mind and heart ■ of each one of those who are fully devoted to God and to The Theocratic Government. This light of Jehovah shining in the face of the great King of The Theocracy, Christ Jesus, is reflected to the minds of those who are his true followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Looking down to this very time, the apostle Paul, inspired by the spirit of God, wrote for the benefit of faithful Christians now on the earth these words: ‘Of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you, because we are not in the darkness, but ye are the children of the light. Comfort yourselves together and edify one another.’—1 Thessalonians 5 : 1, 4, 5,11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the door of opportunity to participate in God’s “strange work” is rapidly closing and is closed in many parts of the earth, and while the persecution of faithful Christians increases in severity, God’s anointed people and their companions are in no wise dismayed. They have been forewarned from the revelation of the prophecies and they know that these things must come to pass, which are now made manifest. To Jehovah, the Almighty God, they now say in the language of the psalmist: “I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.” (Psalm 13:5) The Lord directed that text to be chosen to use for the year text of 1940 and for the comfort of his people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For years we have been within the limits of ‘times and seasons’. We have clearly seen and do see the presence of Christ Jesus at the temple of God. (Malachi 3.1-3) We have marked the unfolding of many prophecies showing that the kingdom is here. We have observed and still observe the Lord Jesus Christ the great Judge separating the nations. We have not been following any cunningly devised fable. We have been instructed by the Lord and know that we are in the right way. Not knowing, however, the day nor the hour when the final collapse of Satan’s rule shall come, we have with full confidence in The Theocratic Government pushed forward while waiting for the manifestation of “the sign”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ARMAGEDDON</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When shall “the battle of that great day of God Almighty” be fought? That time is fixed to a certainty, but no man knows at what hour it will begin. Before Armageddon all of the remnant must be bound together in full unity in Christ Jesus. All must have their hearts fixed upon The Theocracy, and all with singleness of purpose must be devoted entirely to God and to his King, Christ Jesus. That condition amongst the anointed does now exist; likewise their companions, the Lord’s “other sheep”, are in full unanimity with “the remnant”. All such know what God has revealed to them. They know that they are the children of God and are taught by him. They know that the day of Jehovah began in 1914 and that the day of Christ Jesus began in 1918 at the time of his coming to the temple of God, and there Jesus began the judgment of those who are in a covenant to do Jehovah’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The inspired words of the apostle Paul, addressed to Christians now on the earth and relating to conditions existent immediately preceding the beginning of Armageddon, are these: ‘When they shall say, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction shall come upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape.’ (1 Thessalonians 5:3) That is the “sign” for which the Lord’s faithful people have long been looking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who shall say “Peace and safety”? It will not be Christians who will say it. Those who thus speak are manifestly the ones described in the Scriptures as “the ambassadors of peace” who are due to “weep bitterly”. (Isaiah 33: 7) Such are the ones who are the leaders of the godless element of people on the earth. They are the ones who make propaganda that they may deceive and control the credulous public. The word “they” thus used by the apostle clearly means those men who because of their extreme selfishness desire to control and rule the whole world contrary to the will of God. These are the ones, therefore, who are set against The Theocracy, the great government of Jehovah with Christ Jesus as King, the rightful ruler of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Note again that “they” who say “Peace and safety” are the ones whose peace has been disturbed by reason of the publication of the truth of and concerning religion and the truth announcing the great Theocracy. Their religious susceptibilities have been greatly disturbed by reason of the proclamation of God’s prophecy concerning religion. Certainly they are not disturbed by reason of the number or fierceness of Jehovah’s witnesses, but are disturbed by the message which those witnesses boldly proclaim. Being disturbed and frightened, they endeavor to unite all forces of the world against The Theocratic Government and against those who proclaim the name of the great Theocrat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">THE CONTROVERSY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We do well to keep in mind the reason for and the conditions that bring about the occasion for saying of “Peace and safety”. The words clearly imply a contro-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">versy in which one party thereto thinks he must win at any cost. The controversy is Satan’s organization against The Theocracy, God’s kingdom. The Theocracy means a government of the world by the Almighty God. It is otherwise called “the kingdom of God”, with Christ Jesus as King. The Almighty Jehovah purposed from the beginning to have a government of the world wherein dwells righteousness and in which the will of God is done in all things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan, for the purpose of defaming and reproaching Jehovah God, has at all times tried to mimic the Most High and to build up something with an appearance like that of God’s government and in defiance of it. Therefore Satan has tried to govern the peoples of the earth by a dictator. He set up Nimrod and his government in defiance of Jehovah. All dictators are against Jehovah God and against His kingdom. All reproach Jehovah’s name by attempting to give praise and worship to creatures, and not to the Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah God appointed and commissioned Jesus to be King of the world. Satan immediately began to try to bring about the destruction of Jesus. For three and one-half years Satan and his emissaries bitterly opposed and persecuted the man Jesus, which persecution ended with the crucifixion of the Lord. God then raised Jesus out of death and made him Lord and Ruler over all creation, declaring His purpose to set that government in operation in His own due time. That due time has come and Jesus Christ has been enthroned as King, invisible to men, but he will soon have visible representatives or rulers called “princes” on the earth.—Psalm 45:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the Devil, knowing that his time is short until the final showdown, proceeds now to set up a totalitarian rule in the various nations of the earth, and this in defiance of the kingdom of God. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">name “Satan” means adversary of God, and his name “Serpent” means deceiver. His chief means of deceiving the people is the Papal religious system, and through this religious system he attempts to turn all the people to supporting dictators. Every dictator on earth is the representative of Satan, and they together with the Papal system are feverishly working to gain control of every nation of earth. Therefore Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini are all working for one purpose. All of them are in opposition to The Theocratic Government, and all are therefore bitterly opposed to every creature that magnifies the name of Jehovah and Christ Jesus and tells of The Theocracy. That is the reason why Jehovah’s witnesses are hated by the ruling powers. To his faithful followers and supporters of His kingdom Jesus says: “Ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.” (Matthew 24: 9) The physical facts fully prove the fulfillment of these words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A witness is one who bears testimony. Jehovah’s witnesses are those persons entirely devoted to Jehovah God and his King, aud who give testimony publicly to the name of Jehovah and to the kingdom of the Most High. For this reason they could not be a religious sect or cult, as they are wrongfully dubbed. Christ Jesus is the chief witness of Jehovah, and one of his titles is “The Faithful and True Witness”. (Revelation 1:5; 3:14) All of his faithful and anointed followers are likewise witnesses, and to them Jehovah says: “Ye are my witnesses ... that I am God.” (Isaiah 43: 10,12) Such witnesses of Jehovah testify not of themselves or any worldly organization, but of The Theocratic Government and its King. Christ Jesus. They are therefore Christian, and not in any manner religionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is to these faithful witnesses the apostle Paul wrote these words: “Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.” (1 Thessalonians 5:5) “God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.” (1 John 1: 5) His children are the children of light and walk in the light and therefore have partnership with Christ Jesus in proclaiming God’s kingdom. They have an understanding of God’s purpose and from Him learn His purpose to bless all of those who obey God by and through His kingdom, The Theocracy. They are ambassadors of peace, or the messengers of good, and delight to tell the people of their prospective blessings through The Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As Paul states, the opposers of The Theocracy are in darkness. In darkness as to what? They are in darkness concerning the truth that Jehovah God is the great unselfish God who causes all things to work together for good to those that love and obey him; and of his purpose to bless all obedient families of the earth through Christ the King. The opposers of The Theocracy have the spirit of the Devil and his associate demons and are therefore in darkness concerning righteousness and Jehovah’s gracious purpose toward the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When God destroyed the world in the deluge he cast all the demons into darkness; as it is written in Jude six: “And those angels who kept not their own principality, but left their own habitation, he has kept in perpetual chains, under thick darkness, for the judgment of the great day.”—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Diaglott.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The apostle Peter corroborates this statement, in 2 Peter 2:4. God degraded those spirit creatures, casting them into darkness, making it impossible for them to ever appreciate his loving-kindness. Since then the Devil and all other demons have been in darkness as to Jehovah’s purpose. All their ways are darkness and wickedness. They have used religion to deceive and to hold the people of earth in darkness. All religionists are opposed to The Theocracy, and therefore all religious leaders are in darkness as to God’s gracious purpose. The dictatorial rulers are children of darkness; therefore says Jehovah concerning this time of great distress: ‘Darkness covers the earthly rulers, and gross darkness the people, who are under the dictators.’ (Isaiah 60: 2) Many persons are held in darkness concerning the purpose and goodness of Almighty God because they are misled and deceived by their leaders. Their only way of escape is to learn the truth of God’s Word and then to straightway put themselves entirely under Christ the King and learn and obey His law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord now sends forth his witnesses to tell all persons who are of good will toward him of the purpose of the Most High to put in operation The Theocratic Government through which boundless blessings will be administered to the obedient people. That truth is good news, or “gospel” ; hence the present Lord commands his witnesses in these words: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations: and then shall the end come. When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,- (whoso readeth, let him understand;) then let them which be in Judsea flee into the mountains.” (Matthew 24: 14-16) All his obedient servants, therefore, must preach the good news concerning the Kingdom. Otherwise they would be disobedient. The totalitarian combine, political and ecclesiastical, now claim the right to rule the world instead of Christ, and hence constitute the desolating abomination. All persons of good will must flee now to the Kingdom if they would live.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1918 Christ Jesus began the testing of those who had made a covenant to do God’s will. All who met that test and proved their devotion to The Theocratic Government the Lord approved and anointed and has sent them forth to bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and to the name of Christ the King. These faithful servants of the Lord in the past twenty years have been diligent in bearing testimony concerning The Theocracy and its King. The proclamation of that message has greatly disturbed and angered the religious leaders and the dictators, and hence, as the work of Jehovah progresses in having this testimony concerning his name and kingdom declared, the opposers have increased in their hatred of Jehovah and in bitter persecution of his witnesses on the earth. Now are truly fulfilled the words of the apostle that the whole world lies in darkness, and all the nations are going totalitarian and all are against The Theocracy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The leaders and rulers of this world, religious, political, commercial, and their allies all unite in their opposition and persecution of those who bear testimony to the name of Jehovah and his King. When Jehovah’s witnesses make known publicly that it is the purpose of God, in the near future, at the battle of Armageddon, to destroy all opposers of his kingdom, that message greatly disturbs and angers the dictators and their religious allies. Therefore they all set about to stop Jehovah’s witnesses and put them to complete silence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">CONSPIRACY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The “world” is composed of the invisible and visible parts of creation called “heaven” and “earth”. At this time Satan and his associate demons, invisible to human eyes, are in control of the nations of the earth, and the ruling powers of the earth are under the influence and control of demons. All hate Jesus because he is the King of The Theocracy. They likewise all hate every one who supports the King and his Theocratic Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The slogan of the World War was: “We will make the world safe for Democracy.” That false slogan originated with the Devil for the very purpose of deceiving the people and causing them to trust men, while those men selfishly built up great totalitarian ruling powers. Shortly after the World War the totalitarians began to organize, and immediately set about to destroy all democracies, and particularly to oppose The Theocratic Government under Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God foretold of that conspiracy through his prophet, who speaks these words, to wit: “For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance. For they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee.”— Psalm 83:2-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Who has taken the lead in this conspiracy? The Roman Catholic Hierarchy, operating from Vatican City. That institution has induced the political and commercial elements to believe that Jehovah’s witnesses are subversive and enemies of all governments and must be destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The religionists and totalitarians not only have conspired against The Theocracy and its servants but have at the present time committed many overt acts against God’s servants. This they have done within the period known as “the times and the seasons”, that is, from the time of the enthronement of Christ Jesus in 1914 until the present hour. They have openly demonstrated their opposition to Almighty God and his King. The conspirators have repeatedly provoked Jehovah, and now there is rapidly approaching the climax of their wickedness and the day of final reckoning. They have suppressed the Kingdom message in most parts of the earth, and it appears that within a very short time they will have completely suppressed the witness work. That will mean that Jehovah’s “strange work” is completed according to his will. It will also show that the conspirators have deliberately and with malice aforethought performed their wicked part against Jehovah and his King and his witnesses. The closing of the witness work will certainly be the occasion when the religionists and their allies will boastfully say: “We have put them to complete silence.” About two years ago the Hierarchy issued this statement, which originated in Vatican City: “Something must be done to silence those Jehovah’s witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">OVERT ACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For several years past there has been an organized effort to stop the witness work concerning the Kingdom. Towns and cities were induced to pass ordinances which are unconstitutional. Under them many arrests and imprisonments have been made requiring a great deal of battle in the courts by Jehovah’s witnesses, in defense of themselves. Efforts to stop the witness work in every known and possible manner have been used. Jehovah’s witnesses are charged with all manner of crimes, of which they are wholly innocent. No one is more fully acquainted with this than the faithful servants in the field, who have been doing the work and suffered persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Practically all the European countries have made it impossible to carry on, and in every instance this persecution has been at the instance of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy. Although the highest court in the land has held that Jehovah’s witnesses are wholly within their rights in going from place to place to bear testimony to the Kingdom, public officials have ignored the rulings of the court. The Hierarchy, not being able in a legal manner to stop the work, have encouraged mobs, and they and their allies have resorted frequently to mob violence against those who are striving to serve God. Public officials, sworn to uphold the law, make themselves a law, and they, together with the Catholic priests, brazenly declare to Jehovah’s witnesses: “We are the law; get out of town and stay out.” They have abused men and women and children for no offense whatsoever save that of telling the people about God’s gracious provision for their blessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Why such fanatical persecution? It is for the purpose of carrying out the conspiracy on the part of the Hierarchy and allies to put to silence all persons who advocate The Theocratic Government. Such wrongful persecution will continue until the Hierarchy and allies believe that they have put down for ever all persons who favor God and his kingdom under Christ. When they conclude that they have silenced all the witnesses, then the religious leaders in particular will say: ‘We are at peace, and we are safe.’ The religionists could not well proclaim peace and safety unless they had the co-operation of the political and other official elements of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“THE SIGN”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord’s people have been looking for Armageddon because God’s Word declares it is certain to come, and they have looked forward to the time of their complete deliverance. How may they know when Armageddon js about to begin? The Scriptures make it clear that the Lord will give his people “the sign”. What is the sign? The scripture answers: “When they shall say, Peace and safety.” That means that persecution and opposition must and will continue until the Hierarchy and allies think that they have put a complete stop to all the witness work. They will say, according to another rendering of this text: “All is well, and all is safe.” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Moffatt)</span><span class="font3"> That will be the occasion for a celebration amongst them, because they will conclude that they have accomplished that which they unlawfully conspired to accomplish. They will conclude that now the arbitrary totalitarian rule is upon the world; that they are a part of it; and they will say: “We are in control and are safe and free from any disturbance.” They will be felicitating one another. Their drunken feasting was pictured by the occasion of the Philistines tormenting and reproaching God’s servant Samson while they held him in the temple of Dagon. The Lord, foreknowing what would be done at this time, caused that prophecy to be written to inform the people as to what is coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The inspired words of the apostle dealing with this matter now tell God’s people what to expect. When that reveling is in progress and the worldlings are celebrating and saying, “We are at peace; God is on our side, and we are safe,” then sudden destruction comes upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">HE ACTS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Does God take notice of the persecution of His people? Does Jesus count the persecution of His faithful followers as done unto himself? God does take notice and Jesus does count the ill-treatment of the servants of the Lord as though done to Him. Will Jehovah God avenge His elect servants? Jesus gave answer to that question in these words: “And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?”—Luke 18:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The words of this text clearly imply that only a comparatively small number of persons on earth will believe that destruction is coming upon the opposers of The Theocratic Government. Only those who are entirely devoted to God will believe or have such faith as Jesus here mentions. There are some persons now hearing this speech who do not believe it and will deride and mock because of what is said that is coming at Armageddon. The Roman Catholic Hierarchy do not believe what the Lord Jesus here says. They say to themselves and to their allies: “No evil shall befall us, because we know that the gates of hell shall not prevail against us.” Thus, by their saying, they show they are in darkness concerning Jehovah’s purpose. They scorn the message concerning God’s kingdom under Christ and that Armageddon will destroy everything contrary thereto, and boastingly say: “We will now rule the world according to our pleasure. God is on our side and will not disturb us.” To all such the Almighty God speaks through his prophet these words: 'Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye scornful men, that rule the people. Because ye have said, We have a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves. Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my King! he will execute judgment. And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.’ (Isaiah 28:14-18) Let all those who have a desire to obey God and live give heed to His Word and be not further deceived by the words of scornful men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GOATS</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who now persecute Jehovah’s witnesses, in opposition to The Theocratic Government under Christ, the Lord designates as “goats”. If they were for the Lord and His kingdom they would be obedient to the Lord and would now be telling the people that God’s kingdom is the only hope of mankind. Instead they are doing violence to the people who do proclaim the Lord and His kingdom, and hence do violence to the Lord himself. To those disobedient ones called “goats” the Lord says that ‘the ill-treatment you have heaped upon my servants, I count it as unto myself; therefore depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels’.—Matthew 25: 40, 41.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This language of the Lord Jesus shows that those goats are entirely on the Devil’s side and prompted by the Devil to oppose the kingdom under Christ. The great King, Christ Jesus, will execute them, because all power has been committed into His hand and he is commanded to execute judgment.—John 5: 22-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Scriptures clearly show that Armageddon will begin with the sudden downfall of the Hierarchy and their closer allies. It has been stated, at Revelation 17:16,17, that God will put i£ into the minds of the political, worldly elements to see and appreciate that the religionists are their real enemies. Manifestly God will cause the political, radical element to realize that they have been woefully deceived by the clergy, and therefore they will suddenly turn against the religious leaders and smite them. A clear picture of this is given in the prophecy recorded at 2 Chronicles, the twentieth chapter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FRET NOT</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is difficult for any creature to remain calm when wickedly persecuted because he does right. Such persecution, however, affords opportunity to the Christian to prove his integrity toward God and to manifest his full faith in the precious promises of the Lord. God has given His promise that He will deliver His faithful servants in due time. He that has promised is faithful to perform; therefore Jehovah now says to His people: “Fret not thyself because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity: for they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb. . . . Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.”— Psalm 37:1-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord fully assures his people that the end of the wicked opposers of His kingdom shall be in God’s due time. The signs of the times seem now to clearly show that God’s due time to smite the enemy is very near. To those who now are troubled because of the wicked persecution against them the apostle in this same connection says: “And to you who are troubled, rest with us; when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power; when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.”—2 Thessalonians 1: 7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fate of God’s enemies will be the same as that which he visited upon the firstborn of Egypt. (Hebrews 11:28) The battle of Armageddon will mark the final end of all of God’s enemies; as it is written: “Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.”— Psalm 21:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NO ESCAPE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Furthermore the apostle says that, when Armageddon begins, then ‘none shall escape’. Another rendering of the text is: ‘By no means shall they escape.’ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Diaglott)</span><span class="font3"> Armageddon will be a complete clean-up of all who oppose the kingdom of God under Christ. Concerning this it is written by the hand of the Almighty God: “And the slain of the Lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.”—Jeremiah 25: 33, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are many scriptures fully corroborating this text, that everything in opposition to The Theocratic Government of Jehovah under Christ Jesus shall perish from the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REJOICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Not one of Jehovah’s faithful witnesses will become weak and faint because of the wicked opposition leveled against them. If the present distress, opposition and persecution had not come we would have concluded that we have been improperly reading the prophecies during the past ten years. We know that Jehovah by His prophets foretold the very things which Jehovah’s witnesses and their companions are now experiencing. You would have been greatly disappointed had the present-day events been otherwise. The enemy tried to keep you away from this convention ; but you came. The enemy tried to bluff and discourage you; but you are not discouraged. The enemy has tried to break down your patience; but in patience and steadfastness you go forward! We are weak in ourselves, but “strong in the Lord and in the power of his might”. We trusted God, and our hearts shall rejoice in His salvation, which we know is certain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There is a wide distinction between happiness and joy in the Lord. We could not be happy under the present distressing circumstances, when there is so much wickedness about, so much unrighteousness and cruel persecution, but we can be joyful in the Lord, well knowing that He is permitting these things to come to pass for our good, because we love God and are called according to His purpose. “Patience” means to steadfastly move forward in the performance of duty, trusting wholly in the Lord God and in His King. “Courage” means that we know that we are backed up by everlasting power; hence we are confident that our victory through the Lord is certain and we trust in the Lord. We well know that in due time Christ Jesus shall be victorious and we shall share with Him in His victory. Therefore today be very courageous, and, as Jesus commanded, ‘In patience possess ye your souls.’ Rejoice always, because all the evidence points to the fact that the day of deliverance is near at hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DUTY</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jehovah has committed to His people the obligation and duty of declaring His name in order that all persons of good will toward God may hear the truth and learn the way of escape to salvation. That duty every faithful servant of God desires to faithfully perform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has laid upon His people the obligation to warn all who will hear of His purpose to destroy hypocrisy and the practice of demonism, which for long has reproached God’s holy name. He has commanded His servants to tell publicly that all wickedness practiced in His name shall cease. He has commissioned Jehovah’s witnesses to do and perform this work, and their failure to do so would mean their own undoing. The commission which God has laid upon Jehovah’s witnesses they have a sincere desire to perform, and will perform it, by His grace, regardless of opposition. As Ehud thrust his dagger into the guts of Eglon, exposing the dirt, so the Lord’s people, whom Ehud pictured, have during the past twenty years thrust the sword of the spirit into the inwards of demon practitioners and thus have exposed their filthy and dirty work. (Judges 3:12-26) This has greatly angered all who are in sympathy with wrongdoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God has commanded His people to hold high the banner of His kingdom to the end that all persons of good will toward Him and who desire salvation may hear the truth and may escape to His “city of refuge”. You as His witnesses have been faithfully doing that very work, and today you are boldly and sincerely and honestly proclaiming that Word and the sincere and honest persons are fleeing from the Catholic, Protestant, and other religious organizations and finding safety under the Lord Jesus Christ. These sincere, honest persons are coming from every nation, kindred and tongue. These are they who will form the “great multitude”, the “other sheep” of the Lord, and who, proving their integrity, shall be hidden from the wrath of God during the battle of Armageddon and taken safely through that great tribulation, and then have the blessed privilege of fulfilling the divine command to “multiply and fill the earth” with a righteous and perfect race of people. (Revelation 7:9-17; John 10:16; Zephaniah 2:3; Genesis 1:28; 9:1) Let the “other sheep” of the Lord, who will form the “great multitude”, join earnestly with “the remnant” to boldly declare the name of Jehovah God, His Theocratic Government, and the name of Christ Jesus, the King thereof. Regardless of opposition, with calmness, sobriety, full faith and confidence in the Lord, go forward in the work until God permits it to be ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Paul, the apostle of Jesus Christ, having been raised from the dead, is now with Christ Jesus. His words, written under inspiration of the Lord more than eighteen centuries ago and for this day, “the day of Jehovah,” are even more appropriate now than ever before. Those words are: “But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.”— 1 Thessalonians 5: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Be not at all disturbed or dismayed by opposition and persecution. Do not permit your equilibrium to be shaken. You are in the light and therefore children of the day. See to it that you are strong in faith and wholly devoted to unselfish service of the King. Hold fast to the knowledge you have, and let your hope of salvation be strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We know that the day of God’s wrath is about to • break upon the world, and we know that we shall have full protection; as it is written: “For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.”—1 Thessalonians 5: 9-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whether we die in the full performance of duty or remain alive during Armageddon, we have the full assurance of life everlasting together with Christ Jesus : “Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.”—1 Thessalonians 5:11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Lord has graciously provided another instrument for the use of His people in this final campaign. He has made it clear to those who love Him that demonism and Christianity are exactly opposite one from the other. The demon religion proceeds from the Devil; Christianity, by and through Christ Jesus. Millions of people of good will now on the earth desire to learn of this difference and to take the right course. This book entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> contains the full information. Obtain your copy and read it quickly and then get it to others quickly that they may learn God’s provision for their salvation and the salvation of all who love and serve him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At all times be on the alert, be watchful. Watch for the sign for the beginning of Armageddon and put your confidence wholly in the Lord. That sign is certain to be made manifest soon, and the sign clearly is and will be, ‘When they say, Peace and safety, destruction shall at once begin.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When the sign for the beginning of Armageddon clearly appears, may it be that then this promise of Jehovah to His people will be fulfilled, to wit: “Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.”—Isaiah 26:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To all who now trust Jehovah He says: ‘Blessed are all the people that put their trust in him.’-Psalm 2:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If this be the last convention to be held on earth by God’s faithful people prior to Armageddon, then we will look forward with unabated joy to that great and glorious convention that shall never end. Therefore, in the language of the apostle, ‘Rejoice forevermore,’ and give praise to Jehovah God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The speaker then read and offered for adoption the following, with the recommendation that millions of copies thereof be printed and circulated:</span></p>
<h2><a name="bookmark7"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark8"></a>MESSAGE OF HOPE</span></h2>
<p><span class="font3">To </span><span class="font1">ALL PERSONS OF GOOD WILL TOWARD ALMIGHTY </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">God Jehovah, who love righteousness and who desire and pray that the will of God be done on the earth as in heaven, this message of hope is sent by Jehovah’s witnesses and servants now in convention assembled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The sole authority for this message is the Bible, which is God’s Word of truth and man’s only true guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil and his associated unclean demons, acting by and through cruel dictators and religious giants now on the earth, all of whom practice religion, have</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">gathered the nations to battle against The Theocracy, the kingdom of God under Christ Jesus, the purpose being to destroy those who serve the Lord. That “battle of that great day of God Almighty” is about to begin, and will be the greatest tribulation ever known. (Revelation 16:13-16; Matthew 24:21; Jeremiah 25:33) For this reason we now see that ‘the wicked rule and the people mourn’.—Proverbs 29:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">All nations, and particularly those nations once called “Christian”, have forgotten Jehovah God and have yielded to demons or false gods, and concerning all such God says: “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” — Psalm 9:17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some will escape that terrible time of trouble by which the wrath of Almighty God will be expressed against all wickedness. But how?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the present time Christ Jesus is gathering unto himself his “other sheep” (John 10:16), which gathered ones will form the “great multitude”. (Revelation 7: 9-15) Only persons of good will toward Jehovah God and His King will be thus gathered unto the Lord, none of whom are desired by Satan’s representatives. Therefore to all such persons of good will toward Him Jehovah God says: “Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, 0 nation not desired; . . . before the day of the Lord’s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek [teachable] of the earth . . . ; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord’s anger.” —Zephaniah 2:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If you would find the way of escape to safety and to life everlasting you must act quickly by declaring yourself for The Theocracy and Christ Jesus, its King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The book called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font3"> now released to the public will enable you to readily locate in the Bible the Scripture - proof texts showing you every step you must take to find the way to safety. Make haste before Armageddon breaks. Inform yourselves and find the way of escape to life and endless joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those of the “great multitude” have the promise that they shall pass through Armageddon and be delivered, even as Noah and his family were saved from the flood; that after Armageddon the “great mulu-tude” will be granted the unspeakable privilege of carrying out the divine mandate to multiply and fill the earth with a perfect race of people. Such is your hope by and through Christ Jesus, and by the grace of Almighty God, “whose name alone is JEHOVAH.” —Psalm 83:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This ‘‘ Message of Hope ’ ’ was unanimously adopted&quot; by a rising vote by the mighty throng assembled, which forthwith broke into enthusiastic applause and vocal expressions of joy and gratitude.</span></p>
