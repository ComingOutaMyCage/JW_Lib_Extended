<p><span class="font2">HOPE, the fondest ever entertained by righteous men, is about to be fulfilled. Today, in the time of war and calamity, the vain hopes of selfish men are being blasted, but the true hope built upon an immovable foundation stands unshaken and sure now of early realization. It is an anchor to the soul, both sure and steadfast, during these wild days of swiftly-shifting conditions, and those having knowledge thereof are rejoicing in hope, though the world mourns.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That lovers of righteousness may learn the true hope and need not sorrow as others who have no hope, this booklet is sent forth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">BLACK-OUT </span><span class="font3">in London! But there was light behind the heavily-covered windows of the modest little home of Mrs. Lovejoy. Conditions being forbidding out of doors, she sat reading a small booklet. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Comfort All That Mourn</span><span class="font3"> it was called. Ah, that was what she needed, comfort! Possibly this message would fill her with some hope for her beloved son, Jonathan. That last air raid of the Nazis got him. He had not sought shelter, but amid the falling, shrieking bombs he valiantly worked to control the fire of a near neighbor's house. Then a jagged bomb-splinter struck him. Mrs. Lovejoy's heart swelled as she thought how unselfishly and courageously he died; but oh so young, just nineteen! At least she still had Deborah, and she lifted her eyes from her reading to gaze at the young lass seated in the rocker near the fireplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deborah too was reading. Mrs. Lovejoy had gotten her started on that book she got from the young man who called at the door the other Sunday. Its name in gold letters, &quot;Children,&quot; stood out against a sky-blue cover, and Mrs. Lovejoy eagerly took it, especially with Deborah's instruction and training in mind. She remembered the wise old proverb: &quot;Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.&quot; (Proverbs 22: 6) How she did hope that Deborah might be spared the destruction of the terrible war for world domination and live to see peace and security established in the earth! The young man had said that the book showed how such a hope might be realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Her thoughts were interrupted. Rex, the terrier lying on the floor alongside Deborah's rocker, suddenly pricked up his ears, straightened up, gave a sharp woof, and ran to the door. He sniffed at the crack of the threshold. The doorbell rang!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Your father's late coming home tonight, but Rex doesn't act like that for father. Go see who it is, Deborah.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The young lass obeyed her mother and cautiously opened the door. &quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Mother, it's the gentleman who brought the books.&quot; Mrs. Lovejoy welcomed him in. &quot;Why, Mr. Hopewell, I hardly expected you tonight, with no moonlight to guide you through the blackout,&quot; she said. Mr. Hopewell replied: &quot;Oh, we don't let anything like that stop us. In these perilous times the suffering people need comfort, and we must bring it to them, and we trust in the protection of the great God of all comfort. I'm so glad, to see you both have been reading the books.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Well, I see we're having company tonight,&quot; said a voice from behind. The door had opened again during the excitement of the surprise visit and Mr. Lovejoy himself quietly stepped in. After an introduction to the young man, Mr. Lovejoy said to his wife: &quot;Sorry I'm late tonight. We were delayed in our work, and then, besides, I had to make quite a few detours on the road home on account of those new bomb-craters. From the size, they must have been extra-big bombs. They simply blasted all things around to HELL!&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mrs. Lovejoy's face showed embarrassment. &quot;Oh, Joseph dear, I do wish you'd be careful of your language, especially with company here.&quot; But the &quot;company'' smiled: &quot;Mr. Lovejoy's expression was a perfectly proper one to me. Really, Mrs. Lovejoy, if you know the facts, his use of that word 'hell' is more correct than it is profane or the expression of the man of the street.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Hear, hear!&quot; cried Mr. Lovejoy. &quot;I'm glad you're not one of those sanctimonious, religious goody-goodies. And while here, if you're studied up on these things, I wish you would enlighten us about that matter of hell. Especially because of my boy Jonathan. At the funeral the preacher said that because of the way he got killed he went straight to heaven. But I wonder. You see, Jonathan didn't have any use for religion and didn't belong to any religious denomination. He always said he had too much respect for God to believe the things religion taught about Him. He was like me in that respect, and I don't believe he's gone to be with the angels; and I can't imagine either that he's gone to the other place, to be tormented, because of being honest</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">with himself.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Oh,&quot; pleaded Mrs. Lovejoy to young Hopewell, &quot;if you could only show us something from God's Holy Bible itself to assure us that all is well for our boy and that there is some hope of our seeing him again alive and happy! We'd be so grateful.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;That's just the purpose of my back-call,&quot; he returned, &quot;to bring comfort and understanding of God's good purpose and his merciful provision as stated in his Word. If you each get your Bible you can read the Scripture proof-texts I'll point out to you.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deborah scurried around and saw that each one was supplied. Out of his carrying bag Mr. Hopewell got a Catholic Douay Version Bible and also the Authorised Version of King James, Then as they four sat about the parlor table this is what he said:</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>SOURCE OF THE TRUTH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">You can be sure of getting the truth on these vital questions only by going to the Bible and getting God's own statement on the matter. True, the Bible was written by men; but they were not the authors of what they wrote down. We know this because a number of Bible writers tell us that they themselves did not understand that which they were moved to set down. They were merely the scribes or amanuenses of God, who is The Author and the one and only Author of all sixty-six books of the Bible. He made them write down his thoughts and purpose and brought the vital facts of essential history to their attention to be recorded, all this by the exercise of his holy spirit or invisible power upon them. Hence those men were inspired. God used them because they were fully devoted to him and the kingdom of righteousness which God promised to set up in his due time for the deliverance and blessing of all men who seek truth and righteousness. Those men were holy because completely devoted to righteousness. They were interested only in the truth, and in order to faithfully live the truth and tell it out to others they suffered all manner of persecution and finally laid down their lives. Hence, because of their inspiration and their purity of motive and honesty we may fully rely on what those holy men wrote as being the truth and God's word. On this the inspired apostle said - but, Deborah, you read what he said, at 2 Peter 1: 20, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deborah read: &quot;Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy [spirit].&quot; Also 1 Peter 1:10,12: &quot;Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you; unto whom it was revealed, that NOT UNTO THEMSELVES, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy [spirit] sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.&quot; Also Daniel 12: 8, 9: &quot;And I heard, but I understood not; then said I, O my Lord, what shall be the end of these things? And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. Hopewell continued: The visible fulfillments of Bible prophecy prove we are at that &quot;time of the end&quot;; and that accounts for the fact that the great Author of the Bible and its wonderful secrets has made his written Word understandable to those who devote themselves to him and his kingdom or THEOCRACY, and who then act as his faithful witnesses. That doesn't mean to become religious. Just the opposite. Upon careful examination you will find that the doctrines and traditions of all religions differ entirely from the Bible, and in no instance more sharply than on these questions of &quot;hell&quot; and where are the dead and what is their condition and hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Whose word, then, shall we take, religion's or God's? I'll take the position of the Son of God on that issue. In his prayer to his Father he said: &quot;Thy word is truth.&quot; (John 17:17) And to the teachers of religion he said: &quot;Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? . . . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Ye hypocrites! well did Esaias [Isaiah] prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.&quot; (Matthew 15:1-9) And the psalmist David, who was a prophetic type of Christ Jesus, said: &quot;For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.&quot; -Psalm 33:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bible and the &quot;signs of the times&quot; indicate that shortly now, and you may live to see it, those faithful and holy men of old who wrote the Bible will return from the grave, such men as Daniel, and Isaiah, and also Abraham and Isaac and Jacob (don't look surprised: you can read that at Matthew 8:11 and Luke 13: 28-30); and they can directly explain to us about the death state. But there is today no man alive on earth that has died and returned from death to tell us about it, and hence we must turn to the Bible. God, who sentenced Adam the first man to death, knows what death is and the whereabouts and condition of the dead. We can accept only his Word, and not the unsupported and fiendish, devilish doctrines of religion, which are the doctrines and precepts of demonized men. Concerning God's perfect allknowledge, which applies also as to the dead and hell, Hebrews 4:13 reads: &quot;Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.&quot; And Job says: &quot;Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.&quot; (Job 26: 6) Certainly God knows, too, who are in heaven.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>HEAVEN</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">That preacher of religion said your son Jonathan had gone to heaven. Such would mean that he was changed from human nature to the invisible spirit condition and that he is not dead but is alive and conscious. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Heaven </span><span class="font3">means the things which are higher than man on earth and invisible to him. Religion teaches that man was meant to be only a short-time inhabitant of this earth, and that it was God's purpose that man should eventually cease to exist on this earth and that thereafter God would take him to live the rest of eternity in heaven; that is, unless man went wrong, and then he must go to a place of punishment in literal flames of fire and brimstone. The apostle plainly says: &quot;Man is of the earth, earthy.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:47) Therefore Jehovah God made the earth for man and man for the earth. This literal earth abides for ever, like the sun and the moon, and God's unchangeable purpose is that its surface shall be perfected and be the ever-abiding home of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Heaven is the habitation of the Great Spirit, Jehovah God, and of all spirit creatures. Said Jesus: &quot;That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit.&quot; (John 3:6) To serve God's purpose for the vindication of His name, Jesus became a man, being &quot;made of a woman [hence flesh], made under the law&quot;. Reaching his majority under that law, he consecrated himself to God and signified it by water baptism. Thereupon God's spirit or unseen power came upon him, and Jesus was begotten and anointed of God's spirit, and was then the spiritual Son of God. None before him had ever been begotten of the spirit to eventually attain to life in the spirit in heaven. Jesus was the first one thus begotten, and no man before him ever went or could go to heaven. Hence Jesus said: &quot;No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man.&quot; (John 3:13) At his being awakened out of death Christ Jesus must have a spiritual resurrection, that is, to life in the spirit or as a spirit; and so the apostle says: &quot;Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive IN THE SPIRIT.&quot; (1 Peter 3:18, American Revised Version) As for his body of flesh which was nailed to the tree, Jesus said: &quot;The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.&quot; (John 6: 51) What he gave he did not take back, and he did not take that fleshly body to heaven. The apostle Paul says so: &quot;Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.&quot; -1 Corinthians 15: 50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now as to your son Jonathan, he did not follow in Jesus' steps and consecrate himself to God and receive the begetting of the spirit of God and thereafter set his affections on things above and not on things on the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;That's right!&quot; interrupted Mr. Lovejoy. &quot;He never had any desire or expectation of going to heaven. He was like me. This earth is a good-enough place for me, if only it were rid of those totalitarian fanatics and other religious disturbers and destroyers of the peace</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and beauty of our earth.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With a broad smile Mr. Hopewell commented: The approaching battle of Armageddon, which God Almighty and his glorified Son Christ Jesus will fight against the entire Devil's crowd visible and invisible, will fully take care of that, Mr. Lovejoy. No, Jonathan, because not spirit-begotten, could not become heir to the heavenly inheritance with Christ Jesus, and hence did not at his death have a change from human to spirit and go to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; cried Deborah with concern, &quot;you don't mean my brother went to that bad place of torment and is now burning?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Absolutely not! replied Mr. Hopewell. Religion says there are just two places, heaven and hell, and that these are opposites of each other and if you don't go to one you go to the other. In this, religion is wrong and completely unscriptural. Earth is the opposite of heaven. &quot;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.&quot; (Genesis 1:1) &quot;The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD'S : but the earth hath he given to the children of men.&quot; (Psalm 115:16) Life in heaven is the opposite of life on earth, just as spirit is the opposite of flesh; and on earth is where perfect and regenerated man shall live in joy and peace forever.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>WHAT IS HELL?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The word &quot;hell&quot; is found in the English translation of the Bible, in the Catholic Douay Version Bible, and also in the Protestant King James Version Bible. There is, therefore, a &quot;hell&quot; such as the Bible describes; but it is completely different from the &quot;hell&quot; described by religion. Where did religion get its idea of &quot;hell&quot;? Not from the Bible. Concerning the latter days following the death of the apostles the Great Spirit Jehovah speaks and tells us: &quot;In the latter times some shall depart from the faith [the Bible], giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; speaking lies in hypocrisy.&quot; (1 Timothy 4:1, 2) A lie is the opposite of the Bible, which is the truth; and such lie is told to misrepresent Jehovah God and thereby bring reproach upon His name. Men who claim to represent and speak for God and who then ignore God's Word and teach religion's &quot;hell of torment&quot; speak &quot;lies in hypocrisy&quot;. By such lies they hold the people in fear and so in subjection to the clergy and their religious organization and thus are able to relieve the people of their hard-earned money without protest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;A racket, that's what I call it!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Lovejoy with disgust. &quot;But excuse me, Mr. Hopewell, go on.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I have relatives who are Catholics, and apparently in all sincerity they insist that there is a compartment in hell called &quot;purgatory&quot; and that it is midway between heaven and the pit of eternal torment. They tell me their Catechism teaches that those who die members of the Roman Catholic church and who are sinners and who in this earthly life have not satisfied the justice of God as to the punishment of their sins must at death go to this &quot;purgatory&quot; to be purged of their sins by fire; that their suffering in &quot;purgatory&quot; fires is only temporary, and their purgatorial sufferings can be shortened and their release from &quot;purgatory&quot; be speeded up by the offering by a Catholic priest of masses and prayers or suffrages. My Catholic relatives have already contributed much money for the saying of such masses and suffrages, but they have never yet been able to get a mass for the dead said for nothing. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Catholic Encyclopedia</span><span class="font3"> itself admits that very rarely are masses offered free; and so whether those contributions of money for such masses are forced, and in effect EXTORTED, I leave you to judge; but the priests who take the cash insist that the deliveries of the money to them are &quot;alms&quot;. Of course, my Catholic relatives are entitled to their religious ideas, and I would never persecute them for holding such beliefs. But that you may know that I am not misrepresenting the Catholic position on &quot;purgatory&quot;, Mrs. Lovejoy, will you please read this which I have copied from that eminent Catholic authority, the late Cardinal Gibbons, of Baltimore, Maryland, in his book entitled &quot;Faith of Our Fathers&quot;, page 205:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mrs. Lovejoy then read these words:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Catholic church teaches that besides a place of eternal torment for the wicked, and the everlasting rest for the righteous, there exists in the next life a middle state of temporary punishment allotted for those who have died in venial sin, or who have not satisfied the justice of God for sins already forgiven. She also teaches us that although the souls consigned to this intermediate state, commonly called purgatory, cannot help themselves, they may be aidedby the suffrages of the faithful on earth. The existence of purgatory naturally implies the correlative dogma - the utility of praying for the dead - for the souls consigned to this middle state have not reached the term of their journey. They are still exiles from heaven and fit subjects for divine clemency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The cardinal says the Catholic church teaches that; but does the Bible? Not even in the Catholic Version Bible, including the Apocrypha, does the word &quot;purgatory&quot; occur once. It was not taught by Jesus nor by his apostles, nor by the other &quot;holy men of God&quot; who were moved by his holy spirit to write the truth and facts. Hence &quot;purgatory&quot; is purely an invention of religious men who were moved, not by God's holy spirit or power, but by the opposite spirit, the spirit or power of the demons who oppose and contradict the truth of God's Word. History shows that this false doctrine of devils or demons was invented in the &quot;latter times&quot; after the death of the apostles. Then self-seeking ambitious men in the congregation departed from the simple Bible faith and turned to religion and thus gave heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. (1 Timothy 4:1) The so-called &quot;Gregory the Great&quot; was pope of the Roman Catholic sect from 595 to 604. He was subject to epileptic fits and went into trances, being bound by the demons' power. In one of such trances the demons poured into his mind frightful visions of a &quot;purgatory&quot; of fire and torments. This pope, over 500 years after Jesus and the apostles died, was the one who made the fiery &quot;purgatory&quot; a part of the doctrine of Roman Catholic religion. The judgment of the nations is now on, and men must now choose whether they will accept the Word of God or hold on to the word of the demons. The traditions of the so-called &quot;fathers of Christendom&quot; are of no weight; they are rather a discredit, because Jesus said that by such traditions of men the religionists transgress God's commandment and make his commandment and word of none effect. -Matthew 15:1-9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Purgatory&quot; is one of the many falsehoods that make necessary the vindication of Jehovah's name. That doctrine has brought great reproach upon God's name; for certainly it would be most unjust and fiendish for God, as Rome teaches, to create such fiery purgatory and then to authorize and empower a few religious priests to accept billions of pounds and dollars from the grieving bereaved people for prayers and masses to shorten the time of torment of their loved ones in the purgatorial prison. It reduces the matter of salvation to a money-making scheme to enrich the few priests and at the expense of the hardworking parishioners. Such is wholly out of harmony with the One of whom the Bible says, &quot;God is love,&quot; which means He is the perfect expression of unselfishness. Further, such is altogether contrary to the example of the apostle Peter, who, when offered money for spiritual favors, said: &quot;Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.&quot; (Acts 8:20,21) The entire &quot;purgatory&quot; scheme, with its system of high and low masses at corresponding money rates, is a base fraud, as will more fully appear in the course of this discussion. It is obtaining money under false pretenses, which crime is a blasphemy against God. Why, then, is it not punished by the law! Because it is committed under the hypocritical cloak of religion, the priestly perpetrators of the crime claiming they are beyond the power of secular courts and amenable only to the court of God. Very well, then; they are on judgment before that court, and at Armageddon God's sentence of destruction against them shall be fully executed and they shall find no sly subterfuge or way to escape. -Jeremiah 25: 34, 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When those called &quot;Protestants&quot; broke away from the Roman Catholic organization they rejected the &quot;purgatory&quot; doctrine, but held on to many others of its false doctrines, including a &quot;hell of torment in fire and brimstone&quot;. The &quot;Protestants&quot; teach that at death of the wicked, those not church members, the soul leaves the body and is immediately judged by God and then consigned to such religious &quot;hell&quot;, to suffer there eternally, without escape. When told that such would be a gross injustice to the creature, those religionists quote the words of one of Job's three tormentors: &quot;Shall mortal man be more just than God?&quot; (Job 4:17) Imperfect men would condemn and prosecute any man who would torment a dog in the fire for half an hour; and originally man was made in the image and likeness of God. Jehovah is a God of perfect justice, and therefore he does not subscribe to any such doctrine or arrangement of conscious torment of creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such demoniacal idea is far from the very thoughts of God. The Israelites became unfaithful and fell away from Jehovah's worship to religion and burned their children alive to the idol-god Molech in the valley of Hinnom. Jehovah God called this an abomination unto him and said: &quot;They have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, NEITHER CAME IT INTO MY HEART.&quot; &quot;They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake it, NEITHER CAME IT INTO MY MIND.&quot; -Jeremiah 7: 31; 19: 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Satan the Devil and the demons, religion says, are in hell to there add to the tortures of the unfortunate souls. The Bible teaches that Satan has never been in hell, neither his demons, but shall eventually go there when God by his Executioner Christ Jesus destroys the Devil's entire organization. To Satan, who, as Lucifer, rebelled against God, due to the ambition to be like the Most High, Jehovah God says: &quot;Yet thou SHALT be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee.&quot; (Isaiah 14:15, 9) The Scriptures show that at the establishment of the Kingdom of God under his Son Christ Jesus war in heaven began and the Devil and his demons were defeated and cast out of heaven and down to this earth. Now the Devil and his demons bring all these woes upon the people, thereby to make the people curse God and bring about their utter destruction at Armageddon. (Revelation 12: 7-13, 17) Religion, with its doctrines of demons, is demonism and has laid all humankind exposed to the assaults of the demons. Those wicked unseen hordes are demonizing more and more people of the world and driving them to fiendish deeds of violence, just as in the days of Noah. -Matthew 24: 37-39; Genesis 6: 4-13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;I surely did think pandemonium, all the demons, had broken loose when those Nazi bombers came over and left my boy dead in the street,&quot; interjected Mr. Lovejoy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To protect ourselves against the power of the demons one thing we must understand correctly is the Bible teaching of hell. If you are honest and a lover of truth when revealed, that will be easy to do. A correct understanding fills us with peace of heart, comfort of mind, and a blessed hope for our loved ones whom Christ Jesus redeems by his precious blood. The truth is honoring to God and clears his besmirched name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The word &quot;hell&quot; occurs 53 times in the Authorized or King James Version of the Bible; but more times in the Catholic Douay Version, and only 12 times in the American Revised Version. In the well-known Rotherham's </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Emphasised Bible </span><span class="font3">translation &quot;hell&quot; is not found at all. A comparison of the readings of the same Bible verses by these several translations will convincingly show us what the real hell is. Mr. and Mrs. Lovejoy and Deborah, will you each read the same verses I will cite you, out of the different versions?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. Lovejoy reads out of the Catholic Douay Version: &quot;And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son into HELL, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping.&quot; -Genesis 37: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Who will grant me this, that thou mayst protect me in HELL, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me ?&quot; -Job 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mrs. Lovejoy reads out of the Authorized King James Version: &quot;And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the GRAVE unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.&quot; -Gen. 37: 35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;O that thou wouldest hide me in the GRAVE, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me&quot; -Job 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deborah reads in the American Revised Version: &quot;And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to SHEOL to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.&quot; -Genesis 37:35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Oh that thou wouldest hide me in SHEOL, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!&quot; -Job 14:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The footnote in the Catholic Bible at Genesis 37:35 says that the patriarch Jacob, mourning for his supposedly dead son Joseph and expecting to go to &quot;hell&quot;, went to a place called &quot;limbo&quot;, which they say is a compartment of &quot;hell&quot;. However, &quot;limbo&quot; occurs nowhere in any Bible version, and, like &quot;purgatory&quot;, it is purely a demonized human invention contrary to the truth of God's Word. Jacob maintained his integrity toward God and received God's promise concerning the Seed in whom all the nations should be blessed. Certainly Jacob did not believe that his faithful son Joseph was in fire-and-brimstone torments, nor did Jacob expect to join him in such a place. Likewise patient and upright Job, who also held fast his integrity toward God, did not pray God to send him to a place of devilish eternal torment. Job was then being tormented by the Devil, to test his strength of integrity; and besides being bereft of his ten children and reduced to poverty and also covered from head to foot with corroding boils, Job was being falsely accused and tormented by three so-called &quot;friends&quot;, but who were religionists without comfort for those in distress and who blame God instead of the Devil for the sufferings of those who faithfully serve Jehovah God. Job was not praying for a change from one state of torment to another, but for RELIEF from pain and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">You note that the American Revised Version names the place &quot;Sheol&quot;. That is the word in the original Hebrew text of the Bible, and the King James Version translates it &quot;grave&quot;. &quot;Sheol&quot; occurs 65 times in the original Hebrew, and the King James Version renders it three different ways: 31 times &quot;hell&quot;; 31 times &quot;grave&quot;; and 3 times &quot;pit&quot;; thus more times &quot;grave&quot; and &quot;pit&quot; than &quot;hell&quot;. This simple fact of itself proves that &quot;hell&quot; is the grave, and this agrees with the fact that &quot;Sheol&quot; is derived from the Hebrew verb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">shaw-al</span><span class="font3">, meaning to dig or hollow out, as a hole or pit in which to bury a dead person, or even potatoes for the winter. You have heard old English farmers speaking of HELL-ing their potatoes, not meaning to roast them, but to cover them over in the pit or hole of darkness. This helps us to understand the words of Amos 9:1, 2: &quot;He that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. Though they dig into hell [(Hebrew) sheol], thence shall mine hand take them.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;In other words,&quot; Mr. Lovejoy observed, &quot;if the enemies of God went down into their underground air-raid shelters Jehovah God would reach down and get them there. The papers report that the pope has such an air-raid shelter.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Right! Clearly, men who were trying to escape and shield themselves from God's wrath would not dig themselves down into a place of fiery eternal torment. That would be jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. But God by his prophet Amos is warning that at the battle of Armageddon the religionists who have brought reproach upon Jehovah's name shall not be able to escape execution at his hand of power, though they take to the air or underground or submarine. They shall have to answer fully for misrepresenting God and thereby destroying men's faith and turning them away from God and keeping them in ignorance of the only hope for humankind who would live in peace and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The religionists imagine they have a nonaggression pact or agreement with hell and death so as not to be touched by them at Armageddon. The clergy say: &quot;We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves.&quot; But to such religionists, who by means of religious lies and falsehoods count on surviving and not going down into death and the grave, Jehovah God says: &quot;Your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.&quot; (Isaiah 28: 15,18) They are blind and lead other blind ones, and all shall go down into the ditch together. Therefore persons of goodwill toward God must at once abandon religion and turn to God's Word and obey it if they would avoid a like fate as religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Now, under demon rule, &quot;hell,&quot; or the grave, is never satisfied, but always greedy for more victims, and this present war for world domination is multiplying them by the millions. (Proverbs 27: 20) According to the vision of the four horsemen, at Revelation 6:1-8, and which applies since the World War of 1914, Death and Hell are riding through the earth now: &quot;And I looked, and behold a pale horse; and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death [plague; pestilence] , and with the beasts of the earth.&quot; (Revelation 6: 8) A vivid description of how hell or the grave opens up in the wake of this death-dealing conflict for millions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To feel torment there must be conscious life; but God's Word associates destruction, not life in torment, with hell. &quot;Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.&quot; (Job 26:6) &quot;Hell and destruction are before the LORD ; how much more then the hearts of the children of men!&quot; (Proverbs 15:11) &quot;Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.&quot; (Proverbs 27:20) &quot;And death and hell delivered up the DEAD which were in them; and they were judged every man according to their works.&quot; (Revelation 20:13) There is no life in &quot;hell&quot;, but only death and destruction. Death, not conscious living torment, is the opposite of life, and God has set before man the opportunity to choose his own destiny of either life or death. &quot;See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.&quot; &quot;I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.&quot; (Deuteronomy 30:15,19) &quot;The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot; -Romans 6: 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In an effort to support their &quot;torment&quot; doctrine the clergy appeal to the &quot;New Testament&quot;, which was originally written in Greek. Does &quot;hell&quot; mean anything different there than in the Hebrew! Mr. Lovejoy and Deborah, please read these citations:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr. Lovejoy reads out of the Catholic Douay Version: &quot;Because thou wilt not leave my soul in HELL, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.&quot; -Acts 2:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;And fear ye not them that kill the body, and are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him that can destroy both soul and body in HELL.&quot; -Matthew 10: 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them, drawn down by infernal ropes to the LOWER HELL, unto torments, to be reserved unto judgment.&quot; -2 Peter 2: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Deborah reads out of the American Revised Version: &quot;Because thou wilt not leave my soul unto HADES, neither wilt thou give thy Holy One to see corruption.&quot; -Acts 2:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in GEHENNA.&quot; -Matthew 10: 28, marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;For if God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to TARTARUS, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.&quot; -2 Peter 2: 4, marginal reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Out of 22 times' occurrence in the King James Version of the &quot;New Testament&quot;, &quot;hell&quot; is 10 times translated from the Greek word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hades;</span><span class="font3"> 11 times from the Greek word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gehenna;</span><span class="font3"> and once from the Greek word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tartarus</span><span class="font3"> (or &quot;tartaro'o&quot;). These three Greek words having different meanings and applications should never have been translated by the one word &quot;hell&quot;.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>HADES</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">You have already proved that sheol is the grave, and the word &quot;hades&quot; is simply the Greek translation or equivalent for &quot;sheol&quot;. That plainly appears from the text of Acts 2: 27 just read by Deborah, and which contains the word &quot;hades&quot;. Acts 2: 27 is a word-for-word quotation from Psalm 16:10. Please read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deborah reads from the American Revised Version: &quot;For thou wilt not leave my soul to SHEOL; neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.&quot; -Psalm 16:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This proves that hades means the grave, from which a resurrection of the dead is possible. The apostle Peter applied those words at Psalm 16:10 to the Lord Jesus Christ, who was buried in a grave for three days and was raised to life the third day. In fact, hades is once translated &quot;grave&quot;, at 1 Corinthians 15:55: &quot;O death, where is thy sting? O GRAVE, where is thy victory?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The &quot;gates of hell [or Hades]&quot; had admitted Christ Jesus at his death on Calvary, but they were burst asunder by Jehovah God's power to raise his dead Son on the third day. So too those &quot;gates of Hades&quot; shall not forever hold within their deathly embrace his consecrated followers who like him are faithful unto death. Referring to Himself as the Rock or Foundation, Christ Jesus said: &quot;Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&quot; (Matthew 16:18) As a further guarantee of the deliverance of the members of &quot;the church, which is his body&quot;, from hell, Christ Jesus after his own release from</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Hades&quot;, or hell, said: &quot;I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.&quot; (Revelation 1:18, Am. Rev. Ver.) It is sheer blasphemy and presumptuousness, therefore, for any head of a religious organization on earth to claim the possession and control and use of the keys of heaven, &quot;purgatory&quot; and hell.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>GEHENNA</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Gehenna is translated &quot;hell&quot; but literally means &quot;valley of Hinnom&quot;, as named at Jeremiah 7: 31 and 19: 5, 6, quoted above (page 18). It was originally a valley outside Jerusalem's southwest wall and where the Israelites, falling into the snare of religion, set up an image of the demon-god Molech and sacrificed their children alive in the fire to the Devil. Therefore faithful King Josiah destroyed that religious system of torment and defiled the valley of Hinnom, &quot;that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through fire to Molech.&quot; (2 Kings 23:10) Thereafter the valley of Hinnom, or Gehenna, became Jerusalem's dump or incinerator, where the city's refuse was dumped and destroyed by burning. To increase the destructive power of the flames of fire the Jews added brimstone or sulphur. Occasionally the dead bodies of criminals, who were considered too vile to have any hope of resurrection, were not buried in a grave but were cast into the fire of Gehenna to be burnt to ashes. If any carcases failed to reach the fire and were left to corrupt, then the worms which bred rapidly in the heat consumed the body and did not die until they had thus disposed of it. Hence the valley of Hinnom, or Gehenna, became a symbol, not of eternal torment, but of the place or condition of everlasting condemnation (&quot;damnation&quot;), and the flames of Gehenna symbolized the everlasting destruction, from which there can be no recovery or resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The fire-lit valley of Hinnom, or &quot;Gehenna of fire&quot;, is otherwise spoken of as &quot;a lake of fire burning with brimstone&quot;, into which the demonized opposers of Jehovah's THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT by Christ Jesus are cast and destroyed. (Revelation 19:20) Whereas &quot;hell&quot; represents the condition of death from which a resurrection is possible, Gehenna represents the death from which there is never a release and hence is also called &quot;the second death&quot;, or the other death; not meaning, however, that a creature has to die twice in order to go into that death in &quot;Gehenna&quot;. &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: WHICH IS THE SECOND DEATH.&quot; &quot;And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. THIS IS THE SECOND DEATH. And whosoever was not found written in the book of LIFE was cast into the lake of fire,&quot; because there is no life or living there. -Revelation 21:8; 20:14,15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus understood, we can appreciate the warnings of destruction which Jesus uttered: &quot;If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire [(Greek) the Gehenna of the fire]: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.&quot; (Mark 9: 47) Better is it to deprive yourself of that which is as dear as an eye or hand or foot if such causes you to commit unpardonable sin than to retain such and suffer destruction everlasting in gehenna, &quot;the second death.&quot; Such everlasting cutting off from life is &quot;everlasting punishment&quot;. (Matthew 25:46) &quot;Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell [(Greek) gehenna].&quot; (Matthew 10:28) Note that Jesus here associates Gehenna with destruction, and not conscious torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To the religious clergy who sinned against the light or holy spirit of God and who finally murdered Christ Jesus, the Lord said: &quot;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers! how can ye escape the damnation of hell [(Greek) gehenna]?&quot; (Matthew 23:33) This same warning applies to the clergy of &quot;Christendom&quot; today who sin against the spirit or light of the truth and oppose the message of God's kingdom under Christ and who therefore persecute the brethren of Christ Jesus, the witnesses of Jehovah, who proclaim that THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT as the only hope of humankind. Those religious opposers of the truth and of THE THEOCRACY prove themselves &quot;goats&quot;. Therefore Christ Jesus, the Judge upon his throne, sentences them to destruction in the &quot;everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels&quot;. At Armageddon the last of those &quot;goats&quot; shall go down into that &quot;everlasting punishment&quot; of &quot;the second death&quot;, gehenna. There they share the same fate as all other like malicious religionists who willfully opposed and persecuted God's consecrated servants and witnesses who worship Him in spirit and in truth from Abel's time and onward.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>TARTARUS</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Tartarus&quot; occurs at 2 Peter 2: 4, which reads: &quot;God spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to TARTARUS, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.&quot; (Am. Rev. Ver., margin) &quot;Cast . . . down to Tartarus&quot; means to abase to the lowest degree and put under surveillance or observation of all movements. There are no human dead in &quot;Tartarus&quot;, but this applies to spirit creatures, angels, who were once holy as God's creation, but who joined Satan in his rebellion and thereby sinned willfully against Jehovah God and his Theocratic rule. God sentenced them and Satan, their chief, to death, but did not at once execute the sentence. (Exodus 9:16) He cast them out of his holy organization and its light and exalted privileges, and abased them to the condition of condemned ones, in complete darkness as to the understanding of God's glorious purpose through his THEOCRACY. Hence God does not take them into his confidence and lofty service, but places a limitation upon their movements, and he holds them in custody, reserving them for his execution</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of the judgment of destruction upon them at Armageddon, the 'everlasting fire reserved for the Devil and his angels'. -Matthew 25:41.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>CONDITION OF THE DEAD</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;A question!&quot; interposed Mrs. Lovejoy. &quot;Does not Jesus' description of the rich man in hell and the poor man in Abraham's bosom show that the dead are conscious in hell and that there is fire of torment there?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Absolutely not; for such would be entirely contrary to the Bible's plain statement concerning &quot;hell&quot; and the state of the dead. Jesus' words at Luke 16:19-31 are a parable, and a parable is a word picture in which things are used symbolically to picture other like things. To interpret the words of this parable literally would reduce its meaning to absurdity. For example, to say that Abraham is in heaven (which the Scriptures plainly state that he is not) and that he is there holding a grown-up beggar in his lap; also, that the selfish wicked ones like the rich man are down in the depths of a fiery place of torment and yet can from there peer up into heaven and see glorified beggars there; and that such tormented ones ask that just a drop of water on the tip of the finger be extended through those super-heated flames to touch the lips of those tormented ones; all such is unreasonable, ridiculous!</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When examined in the light of the Bible symbolisms and of the facts this parable becomes reasonable, clear in meaning, and harmonious with all known facts. It is a prophecy which is undergoing fulfillment since the year 1918, and it applies to two classes in existence on earth today, namely, the selfish religious class, now alienated from God and tormented by the truth proclaimed; and the other class, of persons of good-will like yourselves and who forsake religion and come into the favor of God and are comforted by His Word of truth. The gulf between these two classes is not crossable, due to the fixed judgment of God by Christ Jesus his Judge. Time does not permit to go into a detailed discussion of this parable, but you will find a complete Scriptural explanation thereof in this booklet entitled &quot;Refugees&quot;. Read it at your first opportunity. It will give you consolation and good hope.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>THE SOUL</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Religion's doctrine of temporary or eternal torment after man's death is based upon a fundamental lie, and hence can not be true. No support can be found in the Bible for the religious teaching that man has a soul which is immortal and that at death it leaves the fleshly body and is immediately judged by God and that the soul of the wicked man is sent to a place of conscious suffering, wrongfully called &quot;hell&quot;. If now your examination of the Scriptures and established facts proves that the human soul does not continue alive and conscious after death, then that knocks the key prop out from under the &quot;eternal torment&quot; idea, and it falls because without a pillar to stand upon. Now let us proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What is a soul? Religion's idea thereof is the heathen's idea, and hence issues forth from the demons. Therefore we must at the outset discard what religion teaches. The correct definition of soul is written in God's Word, and that definition is by the great Creator of souls himself and who should know: &quot;in whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.&quot; (Job 12:10) On earth a &quot;living soul&quot; is a creature that lives and breathes and has sense perceptions, that is, has intelligence and the faculties of sight, smell, taste, hearing and feeling. A creature IS a soul. He does not have a soul within him that is separable and distinct from his body and hence that can live a separate existence after the death of his body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Oh, Mr. Hopewell,&quot; chirped up attentive Deborah, &quot;according to that definition, why, even our dog Rex is a soul, although the preachers say dogs, cats and other animals don't have souls.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Your pet Rex is a soul. The Bible plainly teaches that before God created the first human soul on earth he created animal souls to inhabit the land and sky and waters of the sea. The original Hebrew text of the Genesis account of creation so states, at chapter one, verses 20, 21, 24, 29, and chapter two, verse 19; also at Numbers 31: 28. Rotherham's Emphasised Bible translation plainly renders those verses strictly according to the Hebrew and says the lower animals are souls as man is. All human observation shows that those animal souls die and there is nothing to prove they are immortal. But is the human soul immortal? That question can be easily determined when you see how the first human soul was made. Let us read God's authoritative record, at Genesis 2: 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Mr. Lovejoy reads out of the Catholic Douay Version: &quot;And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a LIVING SOUL.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Deborah reads out of the American Revised Version: &quot;And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a LIVING SOUL.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That human soul first came into existence here on earth. It had not existed before in the spiritual world, nor did God take it out of heaven and implant it in the body which he had formed from the elements of the earth. Nor was that living human soul a part of God's own self, as religion argues, and hence immortal like God and unable to die or be destroyed by even the Creator himself. All that God breathed into that bodily organism of man was the &quot;breath of life&quot;, and not a conscious, intelligent soul with life independent of the body. No; but God's own account declares that the result of his combining or uniting that breath of life which is the air we breathe or animating force with the inanimate body was a living soul called &quot;man&quot;: &quot;man BECAME a living soul.&quot; The inspired apostle confirms this, at 1 Corinthians 15: 45, saying: &quot;And so it is written, The first man Adam &quot;WAS MADE a living soul.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The breath of life which animates the body is invisible, and hence the Bible speaks of it also as &quot;the spirit&quot;, because &quot;spirit&quot; means invisible power. &quot;For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.&quot; (James 2:26) The Bible makes a distinction between &quot;soul&quot; and &quot;spirit&quot;: &quot;For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of SOUL and SPIRIT [or the animated body and the breath of life].&quot; (Hebrews 4:12) The entire breathing creature man is a soul. However, the Bible also speaks of the creature's conscious life or existence as &quot;soul&quot;. For example : The widow who befriended the prophet Elijah had a child and it died. &quot;His sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.&quot; Elijah was summoned, and he took her dead boy and laid him upon his own bed. &quot;And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, 0 LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.&quot; (1 Kings 17:17, 21, 22) When &quot;there was no breath left in him&quot;, there was no conscious life or existence in the child; but when God caused the child to breathe again, the child &quot;became a living soul&quot; again, and thus his &quot;soul&quot;, or conscious, breathing life, came into him again. It does not mean or say that the soul existed separate and independent of the body while the boy was dead. If the boy had gone to heaven, as religion-claims, then it would have been a heartless, selfish thing to bring him down from the company of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">God and the angels to live again in a sickly, imperfect body amid heathen sinners.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>SOUL DEATH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">What becomes of the soul at death! Can it detach itself from the fleshly body and continue to exist in a spirit world! In answer to this the Bible is absolutely opposed to the heathenish &quot;immortal soul&quot; doctrine, upon which the teachings of &quot;purgatory&quot; and &quot;eternal torment&quot; rest. You must now determine whether you will accept and follow clear through to its reasonable conclusion what God's Word says: &quot;Behold all souls are mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, the same shall die. And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doeth judgment, and justice: he shall save his soul alive.&quot; (Ezechiel 18: 4, 27, Catholic Douay Version) At the pouring out of God's wrath, it is written prophetically, &quot;every living soul died in the sea.&quot; (Revelation 16: 3) &quot;He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence.&quot; (Psalm 78:50) &quot;None can keep alive his own soul.&quot; (Psalm 22:29) When Samson was about to pull down the temple of religion upon the Philistines, he did not pray to God to take his soul to heaven; the record at Judges 16:30 reads: &quot;And Samson said, Let MY SOUL DIE with the Philistines!&quot; (Marginal reading; also Rotherham's translation) In the Garden of Gethsemane, shortly before his betrayal by Judas, Jesus said to his disciples: &quot;My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.&quot; (Matthew 26:38) The prophet Isaiah foretold Jesus' death between two thieves, saying: &quot;He hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.&quot; -Isaiah 53:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Further supporting the truth that the human soul is subject to death, Psalm 33:19 reads: &quot;To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.&quot; Also Psalm 56:13: &quot;For thou hast delivered my soul from death; wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living!&quot; Psalm 66: 9 speaks of God: &quot;Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.&quot; Psalm 116: 8: &quot;For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.&quot; That the human soul dies unless sustained by God's provision is further proved, at Psalm 119:175: &quot;Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.&quot; Isaiah 55:3: &quot;Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live.&quot; Jeremiah 38:16,17: &quot;As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, ... If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That the human soul can be destroyed is proved in the record at Joshua 10: 28-39: &quot;The king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; . . . and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining.&quot; Psalms 40:14 and 63: 9: &quot;Seek after my soul to destroy it.&quot; Concerning Jehovah's great Prophet Christ Jesus, the apostle Peter says: &quot;And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.&quot; (Acts 3: 23) That it is an insult to Jehovah God for religionists to say that Almighty God, with whom &quot;nothing shall be impossible&quot;, cannot destroy and annihilate the human soul, is proved by Jesus' authoritative words, at Matthew 10: 28: &quot;And be not afraid of them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.&quot; (Am. Rev. Ver., margin) Men may kill the body of God's faithful servants and stop their present activities in the flesh, but such wicked men cannot destroy the right of such servants to eternal life through Christ Jesus nor their entrance into such life by a resurrection from the dead. But God can both kill the present life in the body and also cancel the right to future life and therefore withhold from the unfaithful and wicked any resurrection from the dead for all time.

<p><span class="font3">Where, then, are the dead? and what is their condition? Religion has blinded the dupes of the demons so that they cannot see the plain and simple answers to these questions and which the all-wise God gives in his Word. Prior to the Lord Jesus' return and establishment of his</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Kingdom, no Christians have gone to heaven; also none of the dead have been in a &quot;purgatory&quot; or &quot;inferno of eternal torment&quot;, for such places do not exist. At death the wicked go into destruction, symbolized by &quot;Gehenna&quot;, as explained above. &quot;The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.&quot; (Psalm 145:20) The memory of such wicked perishes, so that God will never again remember them to raise them to life. &quot;The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.&quot; (Proverbs 10:7) Certainly, then, he does not torment them forever. What good would that do, or how glorify him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As for those of mankind who come within the purview or coverage of the ransom sacrifice of Christ, such at death go into the grave, or &quot;hell&quot;, whither Jesus himself went at death. Those there are dead, so that there is no consciousness in &quot;hell&quot;. At death the human soul dies, and the dead are really dead, and hence they are unconscious, inactive, and existing nowhere except in the memory of God, who has power to raise the dead. Note God's inspired description of the dead: &quot;Death and hell delivered up the DEAD which were in them.&quot; (Revelation 20:13) &quot;For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?&quot; (Psalm 6:5) &quot;The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.&quot; (Psalm 115:17) &quot;Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.&quot; (Psalm 146: 3,4) &quot;Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away. His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.&quot; (Job 14: 20, 21) &quot;For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, . . . Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.&quot; -Ecclesiastes 9: 5,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Since the dead are dead and out of existence, there could be no future life for them except by a resurrection from the dead. All future life of the redeemed dead is based, not upon so-called &quot;immortality of the human soul&quot; as taught by heathen philosophers and religionists, but solely upon the ransom sacrifice of Christ Jesus and his kingdom and the resurrection. Jesus so states, and also shows the location of those dead up until his return and kingdom. &quot;Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are IN THE TOMBS [the graves] shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.&quot; (John 5:28,29, Am. Rev. Ver.) The phrase &quot;in the tombs [or graves]&quot; does not include the wicked who are in &quot;Gehenna&quot;. The word &quot;tombs&quot; or &quot;graves&quot; here translates the Greek word meaning &quot;memorial&quot;, and therefore refers to those who come under the redemptive power of Christ's sacrifice and whom God therefore retains in his memory. Because such dead are unconscious in the graves but are in line for an awakening from death during Christ's reign, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Bible speaks of them as &quot;asleep&quot;. This is further strong evidence that the dead are dead and not experiencing either pain or pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Showing God's knowledge and memory of those sleeping in &quot;hell&quot; or the death state, David, who typified Christ Jesus, said: &quot;If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.&quot; (Psalm 139:8) God's power by Christ Jesus reaches down to those in &quot;hell&quot; to raise them in due time to life. When Jesus went to raise the daughter of Jairus who had died, he said to the mourners round about the house: &quot;Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.&quot; (Mark 5:22-43) He raised to life the son of the widow of Nain as the remains were being carried to the place of burial. (Luke 7:11-15) Following the mortal sickness of his friend Lazarus, Jesus said to his disciples: &quot;Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.&quot; &quot;Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.&quot; (John 11:11-14) In the foregoing three cases those persons knew or felt nothing in death. On being restored to life they gave no account of having been in heaven or &quot;purgatory&quot; or &quot;limbo&quot; or an &quot;inferno of torment&quot;. Such was true also of Jesus himself in death. &quot;But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that SLEPT.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:20) Were it not that Christ has been resurrected to life immortal, says the apostle, &quot;then they also which are</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FALLEN ASLEEP in Christ are perished.&quot; -Verses 16-18.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>IMMORTALITY</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Speaking of Jehovah's love for the &quot;world to come&quot;, the &quot;new world&quot;, which shall be &quot;without end&quot; and &quot;wherein dwelleth righteousness&quot;, Jesus said: &quot;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot; (John 3:16) It was not wicked sinners that Jehovah God loved, nor does the redemption of humankind through the ransom sacrifice of his Son automatically include such wicked sinners. &quot;For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright. The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked, and him that loveth violence, his soul HATETH.&quot; (Psalm 11:7,5; also Psalm 34:16,21) &quot;This present evil world,&quot; which is under Satan, its invisible overlord, is not that which Jehovah loved, but He has doomed it to destruction at Armageddon. Jehovah gave his Son to be King and righteous invisible overlord of the &quot;world to come&quot;, which shall be completely holy and righteous. The Lord God also gave his Son to be the ransom sacrifice in behalf of all those who believe in him as God's provision for salvation and who then obey his commandments and who shall gain life in that new and righteous world. Those not believing on and obeying Christ Jesus the Son of God must perish. That is a direct contradiction of the heathenish doctrine of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;immortality of all souls&quot;, including the chief of the demons, Satan the Devil, himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That doctrine of immortality of all souls was the first lie of religion told to man, and it was told by the 'father of lies', the Devil. (John 8: 44) Without such a false doctrine it would be impossible to put across religion's gross falsehood that human souls after death are able to exist in torture eternally. To deceive the first woman Eve, the Devil used the subtle serpent and contradicted God's word and said: &quot;Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall be as gods [angels], knowing good and evil.&quot; (Genesis 3:4,5) Because heeding the Devil, Adam and Eve did die. Hence the demons next used religion to teach that it was only the body that died but that the soul was immortal and could continue to live separate and unfettered from the body. Thereafter, to keep up this lie, the demons impersonated the dead and invented spiritism, thereby deceiving the religionists into thinking that they were communicating with their dead loved ones by means of so-called &quot;spirit mediums&quot;. After the war of 1914-1918, and because millions of bereaved ones were yearning for hope and comfort, a great wave of practice of spiritism swept over the earth and made multitudes the victims of obsession by the demons. God's law warns against and condemns spiritism. (Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Leviticus 19:31; 20:27) If religion taught the truth about the condition and whereabouts of the dead and the Scriptural hope for such, the people in this time of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">World War would now be foolproof against this deadly sin of spiritism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">&quot;Immortality&quot; means &quot;deathlessness; indestructibility ; incorruptibility; the quality of being unable to die or be destroyed&quot;. Religion often uses the expression &quot;immortal soul&quot;, but the expression occurs not once in the Bible. Religion glibly speaks of immortality as a universal and common thing, but in God's Word the term &quot;immortal&quot; occurs just once and &quot;immortality&quot; occurs just five times. (King James Version) An examination of these few instances shows that immortality is restricted to a limited number.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>WHO IS IMMORTAL?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Necessarily the great Author and Giver of immortality would be immortal; and he is Jehovah God, concerning whom it is written: &quot;From everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.&quot; (Psalm 90:2) &quot;Now to the king of ages, immortal [incorruptible] , invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.&quot; (1 Timothy 1:17, Douay) He is called the &quot;everlasting King&quot;, or, &quot;King of eternity.&quot; (Jeremiah 10:10, marginal reading) The apostle Paul, writing, of course, prior to the return of Christ Jesus and the setting up of the Kingdom, says of God: &quot;Who ONLY HATH IMMORTALITY, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.&quot; (1 Timothy 6:16) Had Jesus been immortal when he came to earth he could not have died as a ransom for humankind; but now since his resurrection from the dead, at which time God clothed him upon with immortality, the foregoing text (1 Timothy 6: 16) also applies to Christ Jesus as the only immortal creature of God. Hence he says: &quot;I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen.&quot; -Revelation 1:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Devil is not immortal. When the supreme issue of universal domination is decided at the battle of Armageddon Jehovah by Christ Jesus will put the Devil to death. -Hebrews 2:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the time that Satan the Devil turned Adam and Eve into the way of rebellion and death Jehovah God sentenced the Devil to extinction and -foretold that he would suffer destruction at the hands of God's Executioner, His Seed, whom He would bring forth from his &quot;woman&quot;, or organization. (Genesis 3:15) But God did not there at Eden execute the sentence against the Devil. He permitted that wicked one to remain in existence in order that God might first produce his witnesses on the earth and that these might declare his name throughout all the earth for a witness to Jehovah and warning the opposers of their impending destruction, and that thereafter Almighty God might show his supreme power over the Devil and all his hosts by annihilating them. This purpose God stated to the Devil's representative, at Exodus 9:16, saying: &quot;For this cause have I allowed thee to remain, in order to show thee my power; and in order that they may proclaim my name throughout all the earth.&quot; (Leeser) Meantime, in his wicked endeavor to be like the Most High, the Devil claims to be immortal and he so teaches by religion. On the other hand, Christ Jesus, by taking his stand on Jehovah's side of the issue of universal domination and there maintaining his integrity under opposition by Satan and proving faithful even unto the death, was made God's heir and rewarded with the prize of immortality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Christ's faithful followers whom God justifies by reason of their faith and consecration and obedience to him, God also begets by his spirit or power. He makes them thereby the spiritual sons of God. If they are faithful, God's spirit or power bears witness to them, that they are &quot;heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ&quot;. To them is held out the hope of gaining immortality. They must seek to attain to this gift of God by likewise holding fast their integrity toward God under test: &quot;to them who, by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory and honour and immortality.&quot; (Romans 2:7) If such Christians already possessed an immortal soul they would not be seeking immortality. Long before the birth of Jesus the demonized heathen were teaching the &quot;inherent immortality of the human soul&quot;; but the Bible declares that Christ is the first one God used to bring to light the opportunity of creatures to attain to immortality. &quot;According to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began; but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality [incorruptibility] to light through the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">gospel.&quot; -2 Timothy 1:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The faithful and approved Christians, dying, sleep in death awaiting the setting up of the Kingdom or THEOCRACY and the Lord's coming to the temple for judgment. Then those faithful sleeping saints, or holy ones, are resurrected, and first then they receive the prize. Speaking of the resurrection of &quot;the body of Christ&quot;, or &quot;the church&quot;, the apostle says: &quot;The dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible [body of Christ] must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:52-54) Being planted in the likeness of Christ's death, they are thus raised &quot;in the likeness of his resurrection&quot; to immortality and incorruption. (Romans 6:5) They thus &quot;know him, and the power of his resurrection&quot;. (Philippians 3:10) Theirs is a spiritual resurrection; hence invisible to human eyes. (1 Corinthians 15:44) They are &quot;changed&quot; from human to spirit, and so are the only ones from among men that go to heaven, and they shall be associated with Christ Jesus in the Kingdom, which shall vindicate Jehovah's name and destroy all the enemies and bless those creatures who believe and obey. -Revelation 20:4,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who shall form the &quot;body of Christ&quot; and who shall be rewarded with this miraculous change from earthly to heavenly are limited to 144,000, who hold fast their integrity and keep covenant with God and prove faithful unto death. (Revelation 7:4-8; 14:1, 2) These, however, are not the only ones that are saved to life on the basis of Christ's ransom sacrifice; but all others of the saved ones shall receive everlasting life on the earth as perfect human creatures.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>CAUSE OF MAN'S DEATH</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">In the beginning Jehovah God created the earth and prepared it for human habitation and then placed Adam upon it. Then he made Eve. As created, they were perfect. In the divine purpose to fill the earth with a race of perfect creatures, God gave to Adam and Eve the divine mandate: &quot;Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it.&quot; (Genesis 1:28, Roth.) Though not being immortal, those two perfect living human souls, Adam and Eve, could have lived for ever in full health, peace, plenty and happiness, because God made full provision for them whereby their bodies and lives could be sustained in perfection for ever. Their living everlastingly was conditioned on only one thing: they must be perfectly obedient to God. To test their integrity toward him and their worthiness of everlasting life on earth, God forbad them to partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and warned them of the penalty of disobedience : &quot;For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.&quot; (Genesis 2:17) This proves that the human soul is not immortal and also that the penalty for sin is not eternal torment, but death. However, it also proves that the mortal human soul can live on earth for ever under conditions of obedience to and harmony with God, who provides the perfect means to sustain obedient creatures alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yielding to religion, which was introduced by the Devil and which is disobedience to God's will, Adam and Eve broke God's law and thereby sinned. God pronounced sentence upon them and drove them from the garden of Eden, lest they &quot;take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever&quot;. (Genesis 3: 22, 23) From then on, the sentenced pair began to die, having lost all right to life. They were deprived of the privilege of fulfilling the divine mandate to fill the earth with a righteous race in God's image and likeness, but God permitted them to reproduce their kind and bring children into the earth. Adam and Eve, being sinners, imperfect, and condemned to death, could not bequeath innocence, perfection and the right to life upon their children. Therefore the apostle writes: &quot;By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.&quot; (Romans 5:12) By birth or nature they are imperfect and sinners, and hence God cannot approve them and they are condemned and not worthy of everlasting life. Dying, they must all perish, unless God in his mercy and loving-kindness made provision for redemption of men who exercise faith and obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Out of love, and for the vindication of his name, Jehovah God did make such provision. Be it observed that Adam and Eve sinned willfully and at death entered the condition symbolized by &quot;Gehenna&quot;, because God's sentence against the willful sinners and rebels can never be recalled, and they are beyond redemption. Adam by his rebellion forfeited perfect life and all right to eternal life, but Jehovah God could make provision that another perfect one should become a man and maintain his integrity toward God under test, and then lay down his earthly human life and thereafter pay over to God the value of that perfect life. Thereby such one could redeem or buy back the liferight and all its attendant blessings and privileges which Adam had forfeited for his offspring. So doing, that one becomes the redeemer or ransomer of those who receive the benefits of his sacrifice. This loving arrangement Jehovah God carried out through his Son, Christ Jesus. &quot;In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.&quot; (1 John 4:9) Christ Jesus laid aside his heavenly glory and his life was transferred to the womb of the virgin and in God's due time the Son of God was born as a man-child. Come to maturity, Jesus consecrated himself to his Father, Jehovah God, to do His will, and God took Jesus into the covenant of sacrifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">When Jesus symbolized his consecration by being immersed by John the Baptist in Jordan, Jehovah God begot Jesus of the spirit and also anointed him of the spirit and thereby commissioned him to be his Chief Witness to declare Jehovah's name and to bear</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">testimony to the promised THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, to which Christ Jesus was anointed as King. (Matthew 3:13-17) The Devil forthwith sought to bring about the destruction of Christ Jesus and also stirred up the religionists to a wicked opposition to and persecution of Christ Jesus, but under this crucial test Christ Jesus held fast his integrity as Jehovah's servant and witness on earth. Still in his innocence and blamelessness, Christ Jesus was put to death by the Devil's dupes and agents, the religionists, and was buried. But concerning him the prophecy had declared: &quot;Thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.&quot; (Psalm 16:10) On the third day Jehovah God fulfilled this prophecy toward his Son and raised him out of the death state in the grave. Being now &quot;made alive in the spirit&quot;, Christ Jesus in due time ascended to heaven and appeared in God's presence and paid over the ransom price in behalf of human creatures that should believe on him and obey him. Concerning this it is written: &quot;Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him.&quot; (Hebrews 5:8,9) &quot;For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with [human] hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.... once in the end</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of the world hath he appeared, to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.... So Christ was once offered to</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, without sin unto salvation.&quot; -Hebrews 9:24-28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Salvation, therefore, proceeds from Jehovah and through Christ Jesus. &quot;Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah.&quot; (Psalm 3:8, Am. Rev. Ver.) &quot;The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot; (Romans 6:23) The benefits of the ransom sacrifice are not for the rebellious wicked, nor did Christ Jesus die for such, because Jehovah God destroys all the wicked. (Psalm 145:20) Christ Jesus tasted death and gave himself a ransom only for all such as believe God and accept his provision for redemption through his beloved Son, and who then devote themselves to God to do his will and who then obey him. Said Christ Jesus: &quot;The Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.&quot; (Matthew 20:28) How many? All those that exercise faith and obey. To this effect it is written: &quot;The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.&quot; (John 3:35,36) &quot;He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.&quot; (1 John 5:12) The unbelievers never come out from under the condemnation, and hence the wrath of God, under which they were born from Adam, continues upon them and they do not get into the way of life. &quot;He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&quot; -John 3:18.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>RESURRECTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Religion, by its teaching of and concerning the immortality of all souls, denies that there are any dead and therefore denies the resurrection of the dead. The Bible differs from religion in that it is the only Book in the world teaching the resurrection hope. On the witness stand the apostle said: &quot;So worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets; and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.&quot; (Acts 24:14,15) Concerning this Jesus said: &quot;The hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.&quot; -John 5:28,29, Am. Rev. Ver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Resurrection, being God's act by Christ Jesus, means a causing to stand up again, that is, unto life. This proves that the human soul dies and the dead are dead; otherwise there could not be a resurrection of the dead, there being no dead ones to raise to life. The dead ones whom Jesus designates as 'those that have done good' and that come forth from the tomb &quot;unto the resurrection of life&quot; are, first, the Christians who are members of &quot;the body of Christ&quot;, and who proved faithful unto death and who are resurrected to life in the spirit, as afore described. They participate with Christ Jesus in the &quot;first resurrection&quot;, that is, &quot;first&quot; in time and importance, Christ Jesus himself being &quot;the firstfruits of them that slept&quot;. &quot;Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first-begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.&quot; (Revelation 1:5) &quot;Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death [or other death, not inherited from the sinner Adam] hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.&quot; (Revelation 20:6) The apostle of the Lord also said that at the Lord's coming to the temple for judgment &quot;the dead in Christ shall rise first&quot;. (1 Thessalonians 4:16) Those who share in the first resurrection participate with Christ Jesus the King in the heavenly THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>&quot;BETTER RESURRECTION&quot;</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The faithful patriarchs, prophets and witnesses who died before Christ's death, resurrection, ascension to heaven and appearance in the presence of God are also included in 'those that have done good' and that come forth &quot;unto the resurrection of life&quot;. They did &quot;good&quot;, because they devoted themselves to and did the will of God, which is right and good. Those men of old believed God's covenant promise to set up in his appointed time the THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT by his Messiah, and they devoted themselves unreservedly to Jehovah God and served as his faithful witnesses and kept themselves unspotted from religion and from the Devil's world organization. They endured all manner of persecution therefor, and kept their integrity toward God, faithful unto death, and thus remained on Jehovah's side of the great controversy over UNIVERSAL DOMINATION. Thereby they gained God's approval and the right to a share in the ransom benefits of Christ Jesus. God promises to further reward them with an official position on earth in the service of the heavenly THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. Hebrews chapter eleven cites the record of those men of old, from Abel down to and including John the Baptist; and at verse thirty-five he says that they shall have a &quot;better resurrection&quot; than those of humankind who come forth in the general resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those faithful witnesses of old did not at death go to heaven. King David was one such, and concerning him the apostle Peter, on the day of Pentecost when the holy spirit was poured out, said by inspiration of that spirit: &quot;David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thy foes thy footstool.&quot; (Acts 2: 34,35) Those faithful men of old will not go to heaven, never having been begotten of God's spirit to life in the spirit. Therefore those faithful Christians who enter into the kingdom of heaven or THEOCRACY are higher and greater than those men of old ever will be. Concerning this Jesus said: &quot;Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.&quot; (Matthew 11:11) Therefore the Christian spiritual class, to whom it is their Father's good pleasure to give the Kingdom, receive a &quot;better thing&quot; than John the Baptist and the other prophets who preceded him: &quot;God having provided some better thing for us [spirit-begotten Christians], that they without us should not be made perfect.&quot; -Hebrews 11:40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In what manner, then, do those faithful men preceding the time of Jesus obtain a &quot;better resurrection&quot;? In this, that, having undergone the test of their integrity faithfully and thus passed a favorable judgment from God, they shall come forth from the graves &quot;unto life&quot; as perfect men, and to be the visible representatives unto mankind of the heavenly THEOCRACY. Under that righteous Government they shall be the princes or governors on the earth. Having been witnesses and prophets before Christ's birth, they were &quot;fathers&quot; respecting him; but being raised from the dead by their Ransomer Christ Jesus, they receive life through him and become his children. Therefore the psalmist addresses Christ Jesus the Theocratic King, saying: &quot;Instead of thy fathers [they] shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.&quot; (Psalm 45:16) THE THEOCRACY being now established and the King being on his throne, those long-dead men of old may appear among men any day now and shall be seen and recognized by men of faith and good-will, who shall receive instruction through those &quot;princes&quot; among them. (Luke 13:28,29) There are a number of scriptures which strongly indicate that the &quot;princes&quot; shall be restored to life immediately before Armageddon and shall witness the destruction of Satan's invisible and visible organization about which they prophesied.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>GENERAL RESURRECTION</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning those who &quot;have done evil&quot; and who shall come forth &quot;unto the resurrection of judgment&quot;, such are &quot;the unjust&quot;, in that they have not done the will of God nor passed the test of integrity toward God nor been justified by faith, receiving God's approval. Hence to gain the right to everlasting life on earth these must come forth from the grave and undergo a period of judgment on earth under The THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. They must maintain their integrity under test, particularly the test at the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ, when Satan the Devil is loosed out of his restraint for just a little season, that therein he might deceive all those whose heart is not right, after which both he and they shall be destroyed everlastingly as by fire. (Revelation 20:7-10) By the time this general resurrection of the unjust begins the earth's surface will have been brought to a condition of Paradise, the garden of the Lord, through the operation of the Kingdom. Concerning this Jesus spoke to the thief who uttered kind words to him while nailed to the tree and then asked</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Jesus to remember him when Jesus should come into his Kingdom. Jesus assured the dying thief that He would remember him and that then in Paradise on earth the thief would be put on judgment and under a test of his integrity to determine whether he would be &quot;with me&quot;, that is, in favor of and immovably on the side of the King Christ Jesus. Only by maintaining this position would the once thief gain everlasting life through the King and Redeemer. -Luke 23:42,43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That kingdom time is the period of regeneration, mentioned by Jesus at Matthew 19:28. During that time those who devote themselves to Jehovah and his King and who obey the Theocratic rule of righteousness shall be regenerated unto life. Continuing faithful, they shall by the King be granted the right to everlasting life on earth under the heavenly THEOCrACY, the &quot;new heavens&quot;.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>DIVINE MANDATE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">The general resurrection of those in the graves is not for the purpose of filling the earth, which earth shall have its population greatly reduced by the destruction of all the wicked, the &quot;goats&quot;, at the battle of Armageddon. Concerning that world-wide slaughter by Jehovah's Executioner the prophecy says: &quot;And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.&quot; (Jeremiah 25:33) That great time of tribulation was foreshadowed by the flood of Noah's day, and concerning it Jesus said: &quot;Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.&quot; (Matthew 24:21,22,37-39) This present conflict between the prophesied &quot;king of the north&quot; and &quot;the king of the south&quot; over world domination is not Armageddon nor any part of it; but Armageddon shall first begin after these &quot;kings&quot; shall have filled up the measure of their iniquity in opposition to THE THEOCRACY and begin to cry &quot;Peace and safety!&quot; Then the sudden destruction of Armageddon shall come forth upon them, and none of the enemies of Jehovah's THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT shall escape execution. Read Daniel 11:40 and 1 Thessalonians 5:1-3; also Jeremiah 25:34,35.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The general resurrection not being God's way to have the divine mandate carried out, the general resurrection of humankind will not take place until after the fulfillment of that mandate to &quot;be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth&quot;. Those having part in the general resurrection of the dead shall neither marry nor be given in marriage, and hence could not be fruitful and reproduce their kind and bring forth children in righteousness and fill the earth with a righteous race. Who, then, shall fulfill that mandate in righteousness and under the righteous &quot;new heavens&quot; and new invisible Overlord, Christ Jesus? It will be the earthly survivors of Armageddon, the Lord's &quot;other sheep&quot;, pictured in the parable as the &quot;sheep&quot; who do good unto the brethren of Christ who are witnesses for Jehovah and his Kingdom. (John 10:16; Matthew 25: 31-46) The &quot;goats&quot; the Judge Christ Jesus condemns and causes them to depart into the &quot;everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels&quot;; but the &quot;sheep&quot; the Lord puts upon his right hand of favor and to them he says: &quot;Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom [blessings] prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&quot; Such shall form the &quot;great multitude&quot; that lives and glorifies God and his King on earth for ever. -Revelation 7:9-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Those who become the Lord's &quot;other sheep&quot; must now flee from religion and Satan's organization and must hasten unto the mountains of The THEOCRATIC GOVERNMENT for refuge ere Armageddon breaks forth in fury to destroy the wicked. (Matthew 24:15,16) Such &quot;meek&quot; or teachable ones must now seek Jehovah and must seek righteousness and meekness, by studying God's will and purpose, as we are doing here in this study; and they must set themselves to do His will and commandments by giving themselves in full consecration to Him and faithfully witnessing to his name and Kingdom under Christ. To such God's promise is that, so doing, &quot;it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD'S anger.&quot; (Zephaniah 2:3) Noah's family with him in the ark during the Flood were a type of such Armageddon survivors. When they came out of the ark after that destruction of &quot;the world of the ungodly&quot;, then God restated to Noah and his family the divine mandate. (Genesis 9:1,7; 2 Peter 2:5) That was a prophetic pattern of how after the destruction of &quot;this present evil world&quot; of Satan at Armageddon Jehovah by his King will restate the divine mandate to those &quot;other sheep&quot; who shall have maintained their integrity under the great test at this end of the world and who shall be protected in God's Ark or organization and preserved by Almighty God's power through Armageddon and into the &quot;new world&quot; with its &quot;new earth&quot; under the &quot;new heavens&quot;. Those faithful men of old whom Jehovah's King shall make &quot;princes in all the earth&quot; will constitute the new visible ruling organization, that is, the &quot;new earth&quot;. Christ Jesus and all the THEOCRACY are the &quot;new heavens&quot;. Concerning this the apostle wrote: &quot;We, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.&quot; -2 Peter 3:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Coming forth from their hiding place of God's power, those &quot;other sheep&quot; who shall form the great multitude of Armageddon survivors shall henceforth enjoy the blessings of the &quot;new earth&quot;. Receiving life from the King-Father, they become the children of the King, Christ Jesus, whose &quot;name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father&quot;. (Isaiah 9:6,7) Under their Father's guidance and under supervision of the &quot;princes in all the earth&quot; they shall marry and bring forth children in righteousness. Thus in obedience to the divine mandate restated to them after Armageddon's storm is past they shall fulfill that blessed commission and shall joyfully fill the earth with their righteous offspring, whom they shall bring up &quot;in the nurture and admonition of the Lord&quot;. (Ephesians 6:4) &quot;The earth abideth for ever&quot; (Ecclesiastes 1:4), and they shall occupy the earth in trust for their great King-Father, and shall subdue it and beautify it and glorify it like the garden of Eden, the garden of the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Concerning that righteous world Jesus, &quot;the Prince of Life,&quot; said: &quot;Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.&quot; (John 11:26) &quot;If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.&quot; (John 8:51) Continuing faithful, such blessed ones shall never die, but shall serve and praise Jehovah God and Christ Jesus his King for ever, &quot;world without end.&quot; -John 11:25,26; Revelation 21:4; Isaiah 25:6-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Such is your glorious hope, Mr. and Mrs. Lovejoy and Deborah, and the joyful hope of all persons of good-will toward Jehovah God and his THEOCRACY by Christ Jesus, and who now seek righteousness and meekness. You may read more fully about it in that book called</span></p>
