<p><span class="font6">WHEN the &quot;four horsemen&quot; began their ride through the world in 1914, the nations and peoples painfully felt the steel-shod hoofs of the fire-red horse. Its mad gallop was foretold in the Apocalypse in these words: &quot;And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another&quot;: and there was given unto him a great sword.&quot; (Revelation 6:4) That ride, bringing the bloody World War, seemed to come to an end in 1918, and the sword was sheathed in peace. A permanent peace it was hoped it would be. Now it can be seen that the peace was only a truce, a prolonged armistice. The fiery horse again charges furiously through the earth, and peace is taken away by a total war which dwarfs the World War in magnitude and destructiveness. The fond dreams of lasting peace have been shattered with a rude awakening. Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Men of affairs speak of this as a war for world domination. It is a violent clash between the parties to two sets of ideas, which ideas cannot for ever operate side by side on this earth. They are irreconcilable, and hence create a divided house of humankind. In view of what</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">is coming upon the world, it does no one any good to hide from ourselves the truth with the thought that by smothering the truth the way can be laid for getting together in peace. The great cry of the nations fighting totalitarian aggression is for </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">freedom.</span><span class="font6"> Said the great &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;: &quot;The truth shall make you free.&quot; Let us for freedom's sake not fear to face the truth. The candid truth then, is, that religion is at the root of the world's trouble. That fact stands out clearly to all who desire to see the truth and to order their course aright. Not only freedom, but life, is involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Careful students of history agree that since the so-called &quot;Reformation movement&quot; of four centuries ago the condition was set up and has existed that must at last break forth in an all-out war for world domination. As a result of that Reformation the religious organization in England, up till then bound to papal Rome, was nationalized and Britain became a nation religiously independent of the Vatican. Then followed the setting up and spread of the British Empire to the ends of the earth. It has been a Protestant empire, and against it the Catholic empires of Spain and France have enviously dashed in vain. Added to that, in 1776 the American nation was born, a revolutionary democracy establishing a separation of religion and state, and hence it was a non-Catholic republic. Its ties with the British Empire have been natural, and, in spite of some disagreements, those ties have grown stronger with time</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">and world developments. Thus the civilization that the earth has known for the past three hundred years has been held together and dominated by two Protestant and non-Catholic world powers of democratic ideals. For this reason democracy has been associated with Protestantism and the clergy have stirred up great prejudice against it in Catholic lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Down till the Reformation the Catholic civilization alone dominated, which method of life and rule was marked by absolute, autocratic governments backed and blessed by the clergy of a totalitarian Hierarchy. That totalitarian religious system demanded unquestioning obedience and submission to the will of the Hierarchy, and it allowed for no democracy and freedom of worship according to the written Word of God. This explains the action of the Vatican's head in 1849 when he called in the armies of the French to overturn the republic which freedom-loving Italians set up in Rome that year. It explains the undercover dealings of the Vatican through its nuncio to Germany, now pope, whereby the Nazi chieftain, a baptized Catholic, was maneuvered into power as dictator in Germany and a concordat with the Vatican was made and the German Republic was destroyed. It explains also why the Vatican and its Hierarchy in Spain and in America approved the rising up of a rebel to overthrow the Spanish Republic with the aid of the Nazi and Fascist dictators having concordat relations with Vatican City. It explains further why, after the Japanese began their assault, in 1937, for the conquest of the Chinese Republic, the Vatican sent out instructions to its missionaries in China to persuade the Chinese to submit to Japanese control. It explains why the French Republic was sold out, in 1940, and a devout member of the religious organization was made chief of state, abolishing &quot;Brotherhood, Equality and Liberty&quot; and erecting a Fascist state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Moreover, it explains why religious influence was back of the Civil War of 1861 and the Vatican made overtures with the head of the Confederacy, reaching a shocking climax in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, who belonged to no religious organization but stood solidly by the Holy Bible. It explains, finally, the reason for the outbreak of religious intolerance in America in 1940, Hitler's great year, and the mob violence incited by the said religionists against Jehovah's witnesses, who believe in the righteous principles of this Republic's Constitution and who expose the schemes and efforts of the religious-totalitarian combine for world domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is vital to the carrying on of democracy, therefore, for the rulers of the nations to have in mind the foregoing truths when they listen to the words of an outstanding archbishop of America who speaks for Vatican City. Speaking at Columbus, Ohio, in February, 1942, on the subject &quot;How Can Peace Come to the World?&quot; this Hierarchy spokesman said: &quot;The enemy most feared by the dictators of nations and by all totalitarian governments is the Catholic Church. The democracies of the world have no reason to fear the church. History gives them no justification for suspicion . . . With the prophetic Pope Leo XIII let us say: 'Christ our Lord must be reinstated as the ruler of human society.'&quot; (Cincinnati </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times-Star,</span><span class="font6"> February 24, 1942) The sacred Scriptures and the facts of history prove that Christ Jesus has never yet been the &quot;ruler of human society&quot;. Therefore the proposed 'reinstatement' means really the restoration of world domination of the religious head at Vatican City who claims to be the &quot;vicegerent of Christ&quot;. The unchanging policy and purpose of that most powerful religious organization, the very heart of it, is, </span><span class="font4">WORLD DOMINATION </span><span class="font6">by it as being necessary to world salvation, because it claims itself to be the visible representative of Christ's kingdom. The violent, unChristian means used by that religious organization to gain its position of world domination &quot;have never let this earth enjoy an enduring peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The inspired prophecy of Daniel, chapter eleven, foretold this present conflict as a war between the totalitarian &quot;king of the north &quot;&nbsp;and the democratic &quot;king of the south&quot;. It points out the totalitarian world power as the aggressor in the grab for world control in the &quot;time of the end&quot;. Since 1914 the world has been in its &quot;time of the end&quot;, with the </span><span class="font4">FINAL END </span><span class="font6">yet ahead. Exactly how long the raging total war would continue the Scriptures do not seem to show. By some religionists this war has been named &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Others, observing the theater of the battle getting near to Megiddo in Palestine, ask: &quot;Are we facing Armageddon?&quot; The Scriptures are plain that the final battle of Armageddon is one far more stupendous than a fight between &quot;the king of the north&quot; and &quot;the king of the south&quot;; it is a universal war, a fight between worlds. In it the entire present evil world will be destroyed and the new world of righteousness which Almighty God establishes by Christ Jesus will bring peace, prosperity and life to this war-racked earth. Hence this international war is not the &quot;battle of that great day of God Almighty&quot;. —Revelation 16:14-16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Before Armageddon comes, the Scriptures show, a peace must come. Hence it is proper that the problems of such peace be now considered. War problems at present engross the nations, and no true Christian will get in the way of those concerned therewith. But the war precedes a peace; and in a radio address at Philadelphia, broadcast around the world, concerning postwar leadership, the attorney general of the United States said (July 3, 1942): &quot;It seems to me a wholesome thing that men are thinking in 1942 of ways to win a peace, and acting on their thoughts—yes, even now, while the war is yet to be won. It means that at last the realization has come to us that world war and world peace cannot be dissociated as parts of the same great upheaval. The problems of peace and of war are interdependent.&quot; (New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> July 4, 1942) Shortly thereafter the ex-president of the nation said in a broadcast from San Francisco: &quot;Whatever the modifying views of our associates in war may be, Americans should have formulated the kind of peace that </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">they</span><span class="font6"> want. They must make up their minds </span><span class="font4">BEFORE </span><span class="font6">the war ends; otherwise others will make the peace, and not us.&quot; (New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> July 13, 1942) And in his recent book, on &quot;The Problems of Lasting Peace&quot;, it is written: &quot;The purpose of this war, the most terrible of three centuries, is to make a lasting Peace. We must first win the war. But we will not win lasting peace unless we prepare for it. And we can prepare only by full and free public discussion, by the cold surgery of analysis.&quot; In May it was revealed that thirty-five government agencies were then engaged in postwar planning. (Stated by T. E. D., May 9, 1942) International discussions, and likewise public forums, are being held on postwar problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Therefore the question is a timely and urgent one, &quot;Peace—Can It Last?&quot; The answer depends upon how the peace problems are solved. The greatest religious head in &quot;Christendom&quot; claims it his right to hold the world domination, and he is moving to exercise his power and influence in the peace conference, even offering the Vatican in which to hold it. By reason of his concordat with the Fascist dictator of Borne in 1929 he is now a temporal ruler as well as a religious one. The Hierarchy and the religious population which he rules as god declare that the Peace Treaty of 1919 failed because the pope was not in on it. He now appears in a peace role, pluming himself for a suitable place or voice in the coming Peace Conference. If he gains it, and if the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 is followed as to primacy of diplomatic representatives, then he or his official representative should preside as the &quot;dean&quot; of all the conferees. Says one of his American archbishops: &quot;The only enduring peace that will restore the world to sanity and to a sense of the dignity of human personality is the peace of Pope Pius XII.&quot; And a monsignor in a radiocast from Washington, D.C., says: &quot;He [that is, Pacelli] whose name is rooted in peace will be the one who will restore peace to the world; for when peace does come it will come, not in the way the world expects or plans it, but in an utterly unsuspected way.&quot;—Mgr. F. J. S., February 8, 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A United Press dispatch of July 15, from Vichy, France, was therefore of peculiar interest to Americans who believe only in peace by victory, and no negotiated peace with a gangster, and which dispatch reads: &quot;Diplomatic circles said tonight that the Vatican was preparing a peace encyclical, to be published in mid-August, defining Pope Pius XII's ideas of a basis for a negotiated peace and postwar world planning.&quot; &quot;An earlier United Press dispatch from Vichy, which apparently had some bearing on this report, was completely censored out except for the statement that 'there was a noticeable rapprochement of the Vatican and non-Catholic powers' recently.&quot; (New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font6"> July 16,1942) Whom these &quot;non-Catholic powers&quot; include can be surmised, when this fact is remembered, that despite the break between Italy and the United States the secretary of the personal envoy of the president is meantime acting as the representative of this country to the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The political statesmen of the world are also looking ahead to the peace, anxiously. Some fear the peace worse than they do the war, fearing for a great postwar slump, unemployment, dislocation of industry, communications' breakdown, international debt tangle, anarchy and revolutions in various places, famine and pestilence, and other evils. They hope that the mistakes and blunders of 1919 and following years will not be repeated. A great struggle is foreseen to &quot;lift the living standards from one end of this planet to the other&quot;. The Nazi dictator has led his hordes on in world aggression with the promise of, to quote him, &quot;a social state which must and shall be a model of perfection in every sphere of life&quot;; and the pope has published to the world a five-point program for world peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those of a democratic mind hope for a United States of the world, a &quot;family of nations&quot;, a &quot;world association&quot; based on the United Nations, including a &quot;world legion&quot;. Says one spokesman: &quot;An international constitution and government will be a postwar necessity.&quot; Others argue for a &quot;World Bill of Eights&quot;. Others say the evidence shows that the hopes of the world are for the League of Nations again; and one college official says that the World Court for international arbitration must be made the key in a revived League. One of the president's own cabinet members says: 'A world organization, with the United Nations as its base, will determine the peace, and the postwar world will be policed by the allied powers.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The vice-president declares: &quot;The century . . . which will come out of this war can and must be the century of the common man&quot;; and another cabinet member forecasts &quot;the people's century&quot;. A professor of economy says that the new world which men hope to build will be &quot;the world of the common man&quot;. Of like mind are those who speak of a &quot;democratic revolution&quot; throughout the world. Others warn of great difficulties in the way of &quot;any attempt to force personal liberty and representative governments upon nations&quot;. The indisputable facts speak loudly to agree that the great obstacle to world domination by the democratic way of life is the totalitarian religious system with its headquarters at Vatican City. All in all, the trend of the nations is plainly toward the federation of all into a world government that will be stronger than any of its parts, with power to enforce international law and to guarantee peace and security everywhere by an international police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Those rulers and representatives of the people charged with the task of arranging the postwar conditions have a tremendous responsibility, not only before the people, but also before the great Universal Ruler, Jehovah God. The destiny of the nations and of the peoples is linked up therewith. Rightly the people are interested and deeply concerned; they do not want to be disappointed in the peace that will be made. Having fought and endured the hardships and privations of the war, they are entitled to know what to expect. It stands admitted that lasting peace and a &quot;guarantee of permanent safety after the war&quot; are promised and honestly desired and planned for by sincere men in authority. But who can give unfailing assurance that the peace made by imperfect men will work and lead to realizing all the fond hopes held forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">There is only one authoritative answer to this vital question. It is Jehovah God's own infallible answer. His answer is recorded in the sacred Bible, the Book which is being overlooked and not consulted by the men of the world in all their proposals and plans for peace. Concerning this course the scripture says: &quot;The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.&quot; (Psalm 9:17) And, &quot;There is a way that seemeth right unto a man; but the end thereof are the ways of death.&quot; —Proverbs 16: 25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">By the spirit of the Lord God his answer is made clear for explanation at this end of the world, in order that men of good-will may be guided into true peace without end and may avoid the snares of destruction. Nothing could be more pressing upon us than to consider God's answer now, before it is too late. The apostle calls Jehovah the &quot;God of peace&quot;. (Romans 16:20) Through the Beloved Son, whose &quot;name shall be called . . . The Prince of Peace&quot;, Jehovah God gives a direct answer in the last book of the Bible, which book the Giver says shows &quot;things which must shortly come to pass&quot;. (Revelation 1:1) It shows the great obstacle to lasting peace, and who shall establish the desired peace by removing the centuries-old hindrance thereto. Concerning God's dominantpart in the building of peace the Almighty One declares, at Isaiah 45: 7: &quot;I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil [calamity]; I am Jehovah, that doeth all these things. &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">(Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> There can be no enduring peace except that which is made and approved by Him. It has been and will again be the mistake of short-sighted, self-conceited men to 'cry Peace'; &quot;when there is no peace.&quot; —Jeremiah 8:11 .</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The great issue, which rises above all others in importance, is that of </span><span class="font4">UNIVERSAL DOMINATION. </span><span class="font6">That is to say, Who is supreme in the universe and who shall rule it? Who is the Most High and Almighty God? That issue was raised by the great rebel and adversary of Jehovah and who is therefore called &quot;Satan the Devil&quot;. The question for determination was raised by him in the days of Eden and in connection with perfect man on earth. Now, since 1914, by the casting of Satan and his demon organization out of their heavenly position and down to the earth, the issue has been forced for a slowdown and is being pressed for a settlement right here at the earth. Hence at the earth the great battle of Armageddon will be fought. Therefore that battle is mightier than a mere total war between nations, and the destiny of the nations will be determined for all time by where or on whose side they stand in that universal conflict. This &quot;battle of that great day of God Almighty&quot; will put an end to all dispute over who shall rule the earth, Jehovah God or Satan the Devil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The flood of Noah's day was a display of what God can do at the battle of Armageddon, and the Son of God said that 'as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man'. (Matthew 24:37-39) The Flood made a clean sweep of all the wicked on earth. Why, then, did not the earth remain righteous? Because the Devil and his demon hosts were permitted to remain; and this God permitted in order to test the integrity of men toward Him. Hence, when the race began to multiply, the Devil caused rebellion to break out among men in defiance of the Theocratic law of man's Creator. The leading organization in that breakaway from submission to the law of God was religious Babylon, which was a totalitarian organization founded by Nimrod its king. The Babylonians hailed and idolized him as mightier than Jehovah. The native meaning of the name &quot;Babylon&quot;, or &quot;Bab-il&quot;, is &quot;The gate of god&quot;, thereby referring to Satan the Devil as the contender against Jehovah's universal domination. But Jehovah God called the organization &quot;Ba-bel&quot;, which means &quot;confusion&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">From the start Babylon was organized for Satan, &quot;the prince of this world,&quot; and was the enemy of the Most High God, Jehovah. Hence Babylon was and is used in the Bible as a symbol of the entire organization of Satan, who is the unfaithful Lucifer. Against the invisible ruler of that wicked organization Jehovah's prophet Isaiah was inspired to say: &quot;Thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, . . . How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be like the Most High.&quot;—Isaiah 14:4,12-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The foundation for ancient Babylon on earth was religion, and religion was made most prominent therein, as its mighty temples showed. Its ruler was a devout practicer of demonism, and united in himself religion and state. Therefore Babylon was also used as a symbol of that which is the chief link or binding tie between the invisible demons and men on earth, namely, organized religion, which is demonism. The famous British cardinal Newman, in his </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on Development,</span><span class="font6"> frankly states that his religious organization undertook to &quot;transmute the very instruments and appendages of </span><span class="font4">DEMON</span><span class="font6">worship to an evangelical use&quot; and that religion's many formalisms and knickknacks not mentioned in the Bible &quot;are all of pagan origin, and sanctified by their adoption into the [Roman Catholic] Church&quot;. The Protestant systems of Western Europe and America recognize that religious organization as their &quot;mother&quot;, and so speak. In Scripture Babylon is symbolized as an unclean woman, and therefore the same symbol applies to &quot;organized religion&quot;. The aim of ancient Babylon was world domination, and found its greatest fulfillment in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty practicer and patron of religion. What powerful religious organization is it today that has as its declared aim the world's domination and commands all men to be subject to its religious head for their salvation? There is only one answer, and that is, The one which is still the mightiest religious organization in &quot;Christendom&quot; and in all the earth. Therefore &quot;organized religion&quot; of &quot;Christendom&quot;, both the mother system and the daughters thereof, seeks to occupy the position foretold at Revelation 17:18,15, which reads: &quot;And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth &nbsp;The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Note now the Scriptural answer to our question concerning peace as given by the great Revealer of secrets in Revelation, chapter seventeen. The World War was stopped in 1918. The implement that was then prescribed and provided to maintain the peace was the League of Nations with its World Court, which, eventually, was joined by fifty-seven nations of the world! The United States did not join the League, but did become a member of the World Court and also signed the Kellogg Peace Pact of 1928 renouncing war as a means of settlement of controversies. This League was hailed by the Protestant federal council of religious organizations of America as &quot;the political expression of the Kingdom of God on earth&quot;, but it was not so styled by the religious ruler at Vatican City. By the London Treaty of 1915 between Italy and Britain he was shut out of the peace conference and had no direct part in the creation of the League of Nations. It was therefore never popular with the chief religious organization on earth, because she could not ride it. Her past history shows, however, that anything which she can use, even be it the very things of demonism, she will sanctify to her use. Will she yet sanctify the League?</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The League of Nations, with world power and authority and fifty-seven members, was a scarlet-colored political creature, new and unusual but imaging in respects the seven world powers of human history. It combined also the living relics of all seven of them. It is there-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">fore an added world power, the &quot;eighth&quot; one. In the prophecy of Daniel a political governing creature or organization is symbolized by a beast. In harmony therewith, the League of Nations is symbolized, in Revelation 17:3, as a &quot;scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns&quot;. No crowns or diadems are mentioned as on its heads or horns, because separate national sovereignties are given up in the interest of world unity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As for its names of blasphemy, &quot;blasphemy&quot; here means the ascribing to men that which belongs to God or which Almighty God alone can do. In connection with this association of nations, it is noted that its creators and backers make for it promises that it will do what God'-s Word plainly declares only his Theocratic Government or Kingdom by Christ Jesus will do. Thereby these false political and religious prophets paste tie beastly creature with &quot;names of blasphemy&quot;. Thereby they cause it to &quot;stand in the holy place&quot;, &quot;where it ought not.&quot; (Matthew 24:15; Mark 13:14) This desolates men's faith in God and in his ability to fulfill His promises. It makes men forget God and fills them with a contempt for His Word and power. In their glorifying of self-help and in their selfconceited effort to run ahead of God and to capture the glory for themselves, they trample on His Word and put themselves in opposition to God and his kingdom and are guilty of creature-worship. Rejecting the Word of the Lord, what wisdom is in them? (Jeremiah 8: 9) They have no vision of Jehovah's Righteous Government by Christ, and the result is disas-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">trous to the people. &quot;Where there is no vision, the people perish,&quot; says the proverb.—Prov-erbs 29:18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The League of Nations was a composite or collective creature, a descendant of and a summing up of the previous seven world powers. Concerning it God's Word says: &quot;And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.&quot; (Revelation 17:11) It can now be said that the League &quot;was, and is not&quot;. What is the reason therefor? The League, as it was, operated under the domination of the seventh world power, the British Empire, which is a democratic and Protestant world power such as the world had never seen before. That was the wrong management to please the mighty religious organization hungering for world dominance. Immediately after the League's establishment Catholic Action was organized world-wide, but particularly in the United States, which was independent of the League. Then Fascism and Nazism were organized and maneuvered into power, and seized control in Italy and Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Seven years after putting the liberal government to the side, the Fascist dictator signed a concordat with the Vatican, and Vatican City was made a political state, demanding political recognition by all nations of earth. Four years later, with the help of Catholic Action, the Nazi leader abolished the German Republic and signed a concordat with the head of his church. This was followed by acts of contempt of the League, sabotaging it. Japan began her aggressions against China, a League member. The Nazi dictator treated the Versailles Peace Treaty like a scrap of paper, and resigned from the League. The Fascist dictator committed his assault upon Ethiopia, a League member, and, because peeved at the League's treatment, he resigned therefrom. Japan also resigned from it. Russia was dropped from the League. Then the Nazi dictator assaulted other League members, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and others, including the League's main pillar, the island stronghold of Britain. On November 20,1940, at Vienna, the Axis Powers and Japan and Hungary signed a &quot;new League of Nations&quot;, and four days later the Vatican broadcast a mass and a prayer for a religious peace and for a new order of things. With Switzerland like a tiny island in the midst of countries weltering in total war, and with invasion and partition of Switzerland being threatened, the League palace at Geneva was obliged to shut up. Though forty members still profess to adhere to the League, the League is in effect in a state of suspended animation, and needs to be revived if it is ever to live again. It has gone into the abyss of inaction and ineffectiveness. It &quot;is not&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Will the League remain in the pit ? Again the Word of God gives answer: &quot;The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition. And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, they whose name hath not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast, how that he was, and is not, and shall be present.&quot; (Revelation 17:8, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.,</span><span class="font6"> margin) The association of worldly nations will rise again. The fight between &quot;the king of the north&quot; and &quot;the king of the south&quot;, being for </span><span class="font4">WORLD </span><span class="font6">domination, makes such an outcome of this total war unavoidable. The necessities of meeting the totalitarian aggressions and stopping them are forcing the nations to that final confederation of nations for the new order, whatever its form. A prominent New York clergyman recently said (July 19, 1942): &quot;It is a world family now or else collective suicide. Something in the very nature of things is forcing us to that; something greater than ourselves is after us. Turn anywhere one will, one sees this.&quot; (New York </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Times)</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But mark this: The prophecy shows that when the &quot;beast&quot; comes out of the abyss at the end of this total war it comes out with the woman &quot;Babylon&quot; on its back, or she climbs upon its back as soon as it gets out. That means that &quot;organized religion&quot;, and this time the religious organization with headquarters at Vatican City, will ride and exercise guiding influence over the League beast. To this day the Vatican has not canceled its concordats with the Nazi and Fascist dictators, and in May of this year it opened diplomatic relations with the sneak attackers of Pearl Harbor and has ignored the several protests of the United States Department of State thereat. The pope's five-point program calls for the Vatican's free action without interference as one of the requirements of his &quot;new order founded on moral principles&quot;. Likewise the United Nations opposing the totalitarian powers voice their pledge of freedom of religion as one of the four freedoms to be secured when peace comes. The repeated cries and demands of politicians and religionists for &quot;More religion!&quot; make certain that religion will ride the peace beast. The personal envoy sent by the president of the nation to the Vatican to work together with the religious chief for peace is another forerunner of the courtesy and deference that will be paid to the &quot;woman&quot; named Babylon when the total war ends. Her intercourse then with the rulers of the world will satisfy her worldly desires, and she will pronounce the peace arrangement a &quot;peace of Christianity&quot;, another one of those &quot;names of blasphemy&quot; tacked on the &quot;beast&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The question now comes up for answer, Will religion guarantee that the man-made peace will last? When &quot;organized religion&quot; climbs upon the back of the beast, then she is guilty of her last act of spiritual fornication with the world, and then her final judgment begins. Concerning this the prophetic record says: &quot;Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, . . . And I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&quot; (Revelation 17:1,2,3,5) Whatever peace the religious woman enforces between the nations, the vital question is, Will she lead the rulers and nations into the peace with God? Let no one be deceived by the claims and boasts of &quot;organized religion&quot;; for God's Word answers, No. She will lead in a peacetime WAR against the Lamb of God, Christ Jesus the King, and the &quot;peace&quot; beast will charge where she drives it. Under her influence the rulers, or the ten horns of the beast, do not give their power to the Lamb. The prophetic record reads: &quot;And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet [because not yet &quot;blessed&quot; by the woman Babylon]; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.&quot; Then what? &quot;These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.&quot;— Revelation 17:11-14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Outstanding statesmen of the world have frequently referred in public to the battle of Armageddon and to the nations' being gathered there, but have failed to mention that the record at Revelation 16:14-16 says it is the wicked </span><span class="font4">DEMONS </span><span class="font6">that are the powers doing the gathering. With such information available to them, the nations should have put themselves on guard against all demonism, which is religion. But they have not done so. They have fallen for and now demand &quot;More religion&quot;, and religion is demonism and against Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government. What has religion done to stop the march of the nations to Armageddon? Nothing; absolutely nothing! It has marched right along with the nations and blessed them in their course. The superhuman demons are not leading the nations to peace, but to war and destruction. With demons influencing the course of the nations there can never be a permanent peace. Before the flood of Noah's day the earth was filled with violence, which was due to the demons, and then suddenly the end of that old world came. Is the greater violence now the sure sign of the </span><span class="font4">FINAL END </span><span class="font6">at hand? In the light of the Scriptures, Yes! and it is time for the nations to take note that religion's ambition, under the lead of the Vatican's Hierarchy, to dominate the earth is but the demons' idea and purpose to tighten control of this earth and its people and thereby hold control of all in opposition to Jehovah God and in denial of His universal domination!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;War with the Lamb&quot; means that under the guidance and influence of &quot;organized religion&quot; the nations will forget Jehovah God and his Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus. They will choose to rule themselves under the sanction and blessing of the &quot;woman&quot; Babylon. That is an abomination to Almighty God, because it is in opposition to Him. How will such an &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; make war with the Lamb? By continuing their present hatred and persecution upon those who are with him, that is, on his side, namely, the &quot;called, and chosen, and faithful&quot;. (Acts 5:38,39) That means, while guaranteeing religion they will oppose true Christianity. They will continue to take action against Jehovah's witnesses and their companions who announced Jehovah's kingdom under Christ and who refuse to get on the 'peace beast' and to ride along with religion. Incensed at the persistent proclamation of God's kingdom, and because it shows up the false, hypocritical position of the religious &quot;New World order&quot;, the beast with all its heads and horns, and with the &quot;woman&quot; Babylon spurring it on, will make a desperate try at goring and trampling to death the Kingdom proclamation. By force it will succeed in stopping the preaching thereof. But Christ Jesus warned that when this witness work is finished, and when Almighty God permits it to be stopped by the &quot;woman&quot; and the beast, &quot;then shall the end come&quot; for them.— Matthew 24:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With Jehovah's witnesses put under complete restraint for disturbing the sensibilities of religionists and totalitarian statesmen, the &quot;new order&quot; rulers will cry &quot;Peace&quot;; 'but there will be no peace,' that is, none with Jehovah God and his Lamb, &quot;the King of kings.&quot; God's Word warns: &quot;When they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.&quot; (1 Thessalonians 5:3) Once again we ask the leading question, &quot;PEACE—Can It Last?&quot; and God's definite answer is, No! Manmade peace under religion's &quot;blessing&quot; will be very short-lived, and political kings and rulers will not long enjoy it. The record says they &quot;receive power as kings </span><span class="font4">ONE HOUR </span><span class="font6">with the beast&quot;. &quot;One hour,&quot; with God, denotes a very brief time; and suddenly those ten horns and the beast will go into perdition, not peacefully, but violently, at the battle of Armageddon. This time the beast and its heads and horns will go, not into the &quot;bottomless pit&quot;, but into the &quot;lake of fire and brimstone&quot;, to be utterly consumed and de-stroyed.—Revelation 19: 20; 20:10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But what shall befall the &quot;woman Babylon&quot;, &quot;organized religion,&quot; riding the beast? At the end of that &quot;one hour&quot; of the rulers with the beast, they will be forced to see the hypocrisy of religion and that it deceived them with false hopes and led them into a hopeless position with destruction as the only outcome. The prophetic Word reads: &quot;And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her utterly with fire. For God did put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.&quot; (Revelation 17:16,17, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> Will the religionists and all other persecutors of Jehovah's witnesses take note, please, that it is not Jehovah's faithful witnesses that will thus violently break up &quot;organized religion&quot; ? The world powers will do it, the very ones with whom religion is committing spiritual fornication by making common cause with them against Jehovah's Theocracy and those who bear witness to it.—Ezekiel 16:28-43; 23:17-31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Organized religion,&quot; called &quot;Christendom&quot;, has professed to be the city called by God's name and has thus deceived the rulers and their subjects. What shall happen to the nations and their association for world peace when the Lord God by Christ Jesus suddenly begins the Armageddon fight and divides the forces of his enemies and then the &quot;ten horns &quot;&nbsp;overthrow &quot;organized religion&quot; ? The &quot;horns&quot; will not thus act out of love for Christianity or for The. Theocracy. Jehovah God thereby executes his judgment upon &quot;organized religion&quot;, and to her destroyers he holds out the cup of destruction and says: &quot;Ye shall certainly drink. For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lOrd</span><span class="font6"> of hosts. Thus saith the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lOrd</span><span class="font6"> of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. And the slain of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lOrd</span><span class="font6"> [Jehovah] shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth.&quot;—Jeremiah 25: 28, 29, 32, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Thus once and for all time the primary issue will be settled, Shall the earth be included in Jehovah's universal domination or shall it continue under &quot;Babylon&quot;, which is Satan's organization? Satan and all his organization, visible and invisible, will be destroyed at Armageddon, and the issue will be closed in eternal vindication of Jehovah's name. Before going down into destruction the nations shall be made to know that He is Jehovah.—Ezekiel 38: 23; Zephaniah 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With the early fate of the &quot;woman&quot; Babylon, or &quot;organized religion&quot;, set forth so clearly in God's sure word of prophecy, the warning cry is sent out to the people who seek life and endless peace and who desire to be God's people: &quot;Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.... Come out of her, my peo</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">ple, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.&quot; (Revelation 18:2,4,5) This is no time to be deceived. Religion's domination in the coming peace of the so-called &quot;new order&quot; will cause the majority of earth's dwellers to wonder in admiration of the &quot;beast&quot; of world organization for peace. The fate of such for refusing God's truth and warning is stated in these words: &quot;And they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.&quot;—Revelation 17: 8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The faithful witnesses of Jehovah God will not wonder and be deceived. They will plow right on through the persecution and opposition, keeping on preaching His Theocracy by Christ Jesus and the new world of righteousness and peace which it shall bring in, until the witness work is finished and the final end comes. The people of good-will who now heed the Kingdom message of the Good Shepherd will likewise not be deceived and wonder at and admire the &quot;abomination of desolation&quot; as it stands deceptively in the &quot;holy place&quot; of God's Righteous Government. In the choice between the &quot;beast&quot; ridden by the &quot;woman&quot; Babylon and &quot;The Lamb&quot;, they choose Jehovah's &quot;Lamb&quot;, who is &quot;King of kings, and Lord of lords&quot;. They come out from Babylon, leaving her and the &quot;beast&quot; and its &quot;horns &quot;&nbsp;to their destiny at God Almighty's hands. They without delay heed the warning and instruction of the King, who foretold the appearing of the counterfeit makeshift for peace and said: &quot;When ye, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:) then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains: for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.&quot;—Matthew 24:15,16, 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only those who flee to the &quot;mountains&quot; designated by the King will survive that greatest of all tribulations, Armageddon, and enter into the righteous new world of peace without end. Only such will have their names written in the book of life from the foundation of the new world. To them, the &quot;other sheep&quot;, the Good Shepherd and King will say: &quot;Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom [blessings] prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&quot; (Matthew 25:34) The only &quot;mountains&quot; to which to escape for protection and for survival unto life everlasting are Jehovah God, the great &quot;Rock of ages&quot;, and Christ Jesus, the 'express image of the Father's person'. (Isaiah 26:4, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.,</span><span class="font6"> margin; Hebrews 1:3) Jehovah's prophecy by Daniel likens His Theocratic Government by Christ Jesus to a &quot;great mountain&quot; that &quot;filled the whole earth&quot;. But first that heavenly Government breaks in pieces and removes for ever the great obstacle to lasting peace on earth, namely, Satan's mighty organization and its religion. Instead, Jehovah's Government shall &quot;stand for ever&quot;.—Daniel 2: 35,44,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Concerning the King of Jehovah's Theocratic Rule it is written: &quot;And the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, .. . The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.&quot; (Isaiah 9:6,7, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Rev. Ver.)</span><span class="font6"> Concerning the peacefulness of his reign world-wide it is further written: &quot;The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.&quot; (Psalm 72:3,7,8) Concerning the freedom from war, freedom from want, and freedom from fear on the part of those who survive Armageddon and enter the new world under The Theocracy it is written: &quot;Nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">lOrd</span><span class="font6"> [Jehovah] of hosts hath spoken it.&quot;—Micah 4: 3, 4.</span></p>
