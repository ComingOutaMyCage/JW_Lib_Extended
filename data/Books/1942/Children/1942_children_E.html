<p><span class="font4">PROFITABLE STUDY</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">TN </span><span class="font4">THIS blackest time of all human history it is most important, if you want to enjoy life and peace on earth, to study the Bible. To those who do so with honest hearts and teachable minds the great Teacher and Author of the Bible gives light and understanding today such as men in all past ages have never had.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Education of the people in the truths of God’s Word is the purpose for which the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc., was organized and exists. It acts as the servant and publisher for those faithful Christians Scripturally known as Jehovah’s witnesses. The actual proof shows that the most effective way to study God’s Word and arrive at the truth is with the help of the books published by this Society. They provide you a systematic course of study and assist you to clearly see and appreciate the key facts in the Bible for your guidance and comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the latest of such publications is the book </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font4"> It is of vital benefit to study it, because it opens to you the meaning of our day and the wonderful things in store and which you have an excellent opportunity to live to see by being guided by this information. Since its</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">publication, in more and more communities study groups are being formed for Bible investigation with the use of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font4"> It is the privilege of any number of interested persons in a neighborhood to gather in any private home offered and to hold such a study class. Jehovah’s witnesses, as representatives of the Society, freely devote their time and attention to establishing and conducting such studies in the homes. This follows the example set by the Lord and his apostles and has his blessing. The purpose is not to gain or build up membership in any man-made organization, but it is done to aid you and others to walk in the way of life and to escape the destruction shortly coming on the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children</span><span class="font4"> study should be conducted regularly, once each week if possible, on a set day and at a fixed time of day. It should be an hour in length. Due to its very purpose, the study should be opened with prayer by someone competent. An effort should be made to cover ten pages of the book at each study. Hence beforehand all those attending should read the assigned number of pages and look up the Scriptures therein cited. At the meeting itself the conductor of the study will submit the questions on the lesson. The study should progress, discussing one paragraph at a time. First the conductor will ask the question on the paragraph. Then any desiring to answer should so indicate by raising the hand and, when called, should answer in their own words. This will enable them to develop the ability to express their thoughts concerning what they have read and learned and thereby to become a witness for the Lord God. The Bible texts not quoted but cited in the paragraph should be assigned various ones to read, with any brief comment thereon they care to make showing its relation to the subject. The study conductor will also call for other appropriate scriptures to be read that corroborate the matter further. Finally the question should be summed up completely by the reading of the paragraph in </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Children.</span><span class="font4"> At each study one who reads well should be appointed to do the reading of the paragraphs. Then the question on the next paragraph should be offered and discussion thereon follow; and so on through the hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the above behalf the booklet entitled </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Children</span><span class="font4"> Study Questions” has been provided, and all students will find it most valuable and helpful. The scriptures after each question are corroborative and should be read and commented upon in connection with the discussion of the question. In view of the perilous times and the misleading schemes of imperfect men now put forth, it is wisdom for you to seek the highest authority on world conditions, which is the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Faithfully and diligently following out the above-outlined course of Bible study, you are certain to realize blessings which will be a joy and strength to your heart in these trying days, and you can aid your fellow man. Invite such also to the study with you. Be assured of our good wishes and help in this most profitable study, looking to your gaining the knowledge and understanding that lead to life.</span></p>
