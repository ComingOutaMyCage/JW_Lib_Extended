<p><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>FIRE ON THE HIGH SEAS</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">I</span><span class="font14">T WAS a cool, balmy night as the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yarmouth Castle</span><span class="font14"> cut through the waters of the Atlantic Ocean on November 13, 1965. The cruise ship, with 550 passengers and crew members, aboard, was on its regular run from Miami to Nassau in the Bahamas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Suddenly, what had been a vacation dream come true to the relaxed passengers turned into a nightmare of terror, for fire broke out. The thirty-eight-year-old vessel, largely of wooden construction, was soon ablaze. Within minutes the fire raged out of control. Panic ensued, “I ran onto the deck,” said one passenger. &quot;The heat was so intense my feet were burning on the surface of the deck. I jumped overboard.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Other witnesses later declared that the utter confusion among crew and passengers added to the subsequent death toll. A board of inquiry found that there was poor performance on the part of the ship’s master and some of the crew; that absence of safety features and inadequate crewtraining produced the fatal atmosphere of alarm that prevailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The immediate outcome was tragic. Ninety persons perished in the flames or drowned in the deep Atlantic waters. Within hours of the outbreak the Panamanian-registered vessel went to the bottom. The survivors, many of them suffering from shock and burns, eventually reached shore with a horrible experience deeply etched on their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On April 8, 1966, another vessel, this time the Norwegian-registered ship </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Viking Princess,</span><span class="font14"> caught fire in the Caribbean. Of her complement of 496 passengers and crew members, only three persons died— and these were victims of heart attack. In this instance survivors had nothing but praise for the cool-headed bravery of the captain and crew. There had been faithful &lt;&nbsp;stewardship of lives committed to their care.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark13"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark14"></a>Disasters May Bring Stiff Regulations</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">These two sea disasters—both due to fire—were sure to spark official investigations. At Washington, D.C., a House committee reviewing the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yarmouth Castle </span><span class="font14">case called for a stricter code of safety regulations for passenger ships of foreign registry. It urged that vessels failing to measure up to legal American standards be banned from taking on passengers in United States ports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The committee’s report had twentyeight pages of recommendations. Several members of Congress spoke out and demanded that United States representatives to a forthcoming London meeting insist on improved international regulations covering passenger ships. An international convention requiring all future passenger vessels to be built of fire-resistant, fireretardant materials was proposed. Said one member of the committee: “We feel that ' foreign vessels should meet this requirement.” American ships have been under such a requirement for thirty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Also recommended was the institution of bilateral agreements with other countries until a uniform set of regulations can be formulated. Meanwhile the committee urged that measures be taken to ensure that ail foreign-flag passenger ships using American ports conform to the safety standards observed by all United States ships of the same class.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>“Yarmouth Castle” Study</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After reviewing all the facts in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yarmouth Castle</span><span class="font14"> tragedy, the committee of inquiry expressed the belief that the vessel, had it been under United States law, would have been long since retired from service. And what caused the high death toll ? The committee reported: “There is little evidence that the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Yarmouth Castle</span><span class="font14"> was efficiently manned and operated when it met with disaster.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The following major weaknesses contributing to the disaster were listed: (1) Lack of supervision by the master and ship’s officers; (2) the general alarm was not sounded; (3) the emergency squad did not muster; (4) only six out of thirteen lifeboats on hand were launched; (5) the swimming pool valve from the fire pump was open, causing inadequate pressure at the hose nozzles; (6) the public-address system was not utilized; (7) the master was among the first to leave the ship in the first lifeboat away, and (8) there was failure to radio for assistance.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>What Should Be Done?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Two major recommendations came from the committee; (1) All old ships should have biweekly fire and boat drills for their crews; and (2) all foreign-flag passenger ships should provide at least two radio operators and maintain continuous radio watch. Many other specific recommendations were also made as to the construction and furnishing of such vessels, with fire prevention being the overriding consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">One seaman expressed something that goes right to the root of the matter when he said: “Things just go along and you assume nothing will ever happen. When it does, it proves how much care should be taken with human lives. We must protect passengers. In this case it was shown that an ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is certainly evident that, if shipowners were just as concerned about the safety of lives entrusted to their care as they are about the profit angle, there would be a decided decrease in the danger from fire on the high seas. Freed from apprehension born of avoidable disasters, vacationers could, with confidence, go on enjoying the exhilaration of holiday cruises.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WORLD WAR I WAS DIFFERENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Unlike all the wars that mankind had fought before 1914, World War I involved practically every race and people on earth. Regarding this, </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font13"> magazine of May 8, 1964, observed that World War I &quot;embroiled almost every race and people on earth —Canadians, South Africans, Sikhs, Gurkhas, Siberian Tartars, Turks, Japanese, Moroccans, Australians, New Zealanders, Senegalese, Bantu tribesmen. By 1918 over 65 million soldiers had been dragged into the struggle.&quot; It was one of the evidences foretold by Jesus Christ as marking the beginning of the conclusion of the present wicked system of things,—Matt. 24:3-8.</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">r</span><span class="font14">SNS of thousands of millions of dollars are spent yearly on buildings of various kinds throughout the world. In the United States alone, a survey showed, a minimum expenditure of $5,000,000,000 is expected on college housing over the next ten years. Planned water projects in the state of California will cost in the vicinity of $2,000,000,000. Unique snowsheds in mountain areas of other states, superhighways webbing key industrial cities, lavish religious dwellings and mammoth business centers, factories, offices and homes are sprouting up. All of this underscores this as an era of unprecedented building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As useful and necessary as this material construction may be to the happiness of man, yet a wise builder recognizes that an office building, or a college, or a bridge, or a house of a certain style is not the principal factor in human happiness. For what lasting worth are multiple-storied structures if men in them are tom with strife and discontentment? Of what great comfort are lovely, spacious homes if families that live in them are not happy?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is obvious that, in addition to the physical dwellings, there must also be a spiritual building by man. For happiness and contentment are rooted, not in material accomplishments, but in the human mind and heart. And these qualities are kept alive and healthy by the refreshing</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">What I* worthwhile building? How can you build with a view to the future?</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">truths that flow freely from the Word of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus Christ pointed out this fact to his followers in the conclusion to his Sermon on the Mount. There he said: &quot;Everyone that hears these sayings of mine and does them will be likened to a discreet man, who built his house upon the rock-mass. And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and lashed against that house, but it did not cave in, for it had been founded upon the rockmass. Furthermore, everyone hearing these sayings of mine and not doing them will be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand. And the rain poured down and the floods came and the winds blew and struck against that house and it caved in, and its collapse was great.”—Matt. 7:24-27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The illustration is apt. A man builds his personality and way of life as he would a house. Such a comparison must have been doubly appealing to Jesus. For he may have been a builder; as a carpenter’s son and a carpenter in his early years he likely worked on houses. And every thought in man is like a piece of timber in his &quot;house” of life, every habit like a beam, every imagination like a window, well placed or badly placed; and they all gather into some kind of shape, forming something beautiful or grotesque. Of the two builders, one is a thoughtful man who deliberately plans his house with an. eye to the future; the other is not necessarily a bad man, but he is thoughtless, and casually begins to build in the easiest way, the way of least resistance. The one is earnest, farsighted, conscientious; the other is carefree, leading a careless and unexamined life. (1 Cor. 15:32) The latter may be unaware that his course is an unprincipled, foolish one until it is too late, and he is face to face with disaster.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>The Right Use of Financial Resources</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But how to build with lasting benefit to ourselves and those whom we love is a big question, even today. Jesus answers this question in his Sermon on the Mount, showing how we might identify ourselves as wise or as foolish builders in the things we do with our finances, the manner in which we regard values. For example, regarding finances, Jesus says: &quot;Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”—Matt. 6:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Imagine the time people spend today doing precisely what Jesus states not to do! Worldlings declare, ‘Store up treasures upon the earth.’ Christ says, ‘Stop storing up such treasures? Ignoring this counsel of Christ has not resulted in happiness on earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A choice confronts every builder, indicated Jesus. A person can use his life to gather treasure on earth or he can gather treasure for himself in heaven. Treasure on earth is beset by risks. Wealth in Christ’s day was registered partly in fabrics—in rugs, garments and hangings. Moths threatened the stored treasure, and thieves could break in and steal it. Rust would eat away those precious items made of metal. If Jesus were on earth today, he would remind the old and the young that you can’t take it with you. (Luke 12:20, 21) One of the richest men in the world today, J. Paul Getty, now in the twilight of life, has also been referred to as ‘one of the loneliest,’ which proves that money in itself is not everything. The Dallas oil tycoon H. L. Hunt has amassed a fortune estimated to be “somewhere between two and three billion dollars [$3,000,000,000] His daily income is “nearly a quarter of a million dollars.” But it is true of these men as it is of others that “even when a person has an abundance his life does not result from the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15) And without life what true value is there in wealth stored up on earth? —Matt. 16:26.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But there is another kind of wealth— it is spiritual wealth—a life devoted to the interests of God’s kingdom. Jesus encourages us to pursue this life—a life of dedication to God—a life devoted to truth, faith, hope and love. This builds credit with God in heaven. (Luke 12:33) Neither vermin nor thieves can touch this treasure, this credit that we accumulate with our heavenly Father. The reward of this kind of building is everlasting life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Every person, therefore, is a builder with a choice. He can strive to build storehouses of wealth on earth, with total loss eventually, or labor to increase his credit with God, with the hope of gaining life everlasting. This choice, worthily made, does not necessarily mean that all one’s money must be spent in the direct preaching of God’s kingdom. (Matt. 24:14) No, some financial .resources must be used to care properly for one’s personal needs and the needs of one’s family. Not to provide for those who are our own, and especially for those who are members of our household, is the same as disowning the Christian faith. (1 Tim. 5:8) Using our financial resources in this godly way is to build wisely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Because Christians have chosen to store up for themselves treasures in heaven, which is a decision to serve God and not Riches, Jesus said: “On this account I say to you; Stop being anxious about your souls as to what you will eat or what you will drink, or about your bodies as to what you will wear. . , . why are you anxious? ... For your heavenly Father knows you need all these things. Keep on, then, seeking first the kingdom and his righteousness, and all these other things will be added to you.” (Matt. 6:25-34) It is the will of God that Christian builders seek first the interests of his kingdom, that they live lives free from anxiety. If they do this, they can consider themselves wise builders indeed!</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>&quot;Stop Judging” Others</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Building calls for cordial relationships between all the workers involved. Quality suffers where friction exists, and few things inflame frictions as much as undue criticism. Jesus strikes to the heart of many modern-day heartaches when he says: “Stop judging that you may not be judged; for with what judgment you are judging, you will be judged; and with the measure that you are measuring out, they will measure out to you. Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the rafter in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to extract the straw from your eye’; when, look! a rafter is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First extract the rafter from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to extract the straw from your brother’s eye.” (Matt. 7:1-5) To work on the other person’s faults while ignoring one’s own truly does not make sense. What it really does is label the critical person as a hypocrite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jesus does not rule out all judging. Each day by word or deed we judge or evaluate ideas or organizations, and form opinions' of neighbors and friends. It is inevitable that we do, because the mind is made to judge, to discriminate between good and bad. We cannot rightly remain silent in the face of flagrant wrong. The honest mind and heart must judge. So we must be clear in our thinking about the meaning of the word Jesus is using when he says: “Stop judging.” Jesus is warning against a mind that is given over to quick, harsh, unjustified criticism. Thus he draws a line between honest appraisal with loving counsel and sharp-tongued criticism. He counsels us not to be quick to criticize or condemn others while ignoring our own shortcomings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">James the brother of Jesus gives us some sound advice along this line, saying: &quot;Quit speaking against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother speaks against law and judges law. Now if you judge law, you are, not a doer of law, but a judge. One there is that is lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But you, who are you to be judging your neighbor?”—Jas. 4:11, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Being overly and unnecessarily critical of others is not upbuilding to them or to ourselves, because life has a way of giving back what we put into it. (Matt. 7:2; Eccl. 11:1) If we allow a critical, judging spirit to take root in the heart, evil and not good will sprout. For condemnation brings condemnation. The plea of Christ is that we put up with one another in love and forgiveness. “Even as Jehovah freely forgave you, so do you also.”—Col. 3:12-14; Matt. 6:14.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Rule for Behavior</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Every builder of worth needs a rule to follow. Jesus, the Architect of our salvation, gave us this behavior rule: “All, things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must likewise do to them; this, i#i fact, is what the Law and the Prophets mean.&quot; (Matt. 7:12) This rule, sometimes called &quot;the golden rule,” cannot he kept unless the builder has the love of God. This rule instructs us how to live with our neighbor. Men often excel in mechanics but bungle in human relationships. A survey of 4,400 people who had lost their jobs showed they failed, not because of lack of skill, but because of not knowing how to be friendly, neighborly. We need the rule Christ gave us, that we may know how to build to God’s glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While the rule is simple in terminology, it is not easy to apply. The rule is positive. Jesus taught that the essence of righteousness is the constructive doing of good. The illustration of the good Samaritan is a good example of Jesus’ emphasis on doing good deeds, even to strangers.—Luke 10: 25-37.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is noteworthy that the disciple Luke places Jesus’ rule as an introduction to sayings that command Christians to love their enemies. Luke quotes Jesus as saying: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them. And if you love those loving you, of what credit is it to you? For even the sinners love those loving them. And if you do good to those doing good to you, really of what credit is it to you? Even the sinners do the same. . . . To the contrary, continue to love your enemies and to do good and to lend without interest, not hoping for anything back; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind toward the unthankful and wicked. Continue becoming merciful, just as your Father is merciful.” (Luke 6:31-36) Here Christians are called on to show extraordinary love. They are called on to imitate Jehovah in his kind, loving and merciful way. When was the last time you applied this behavior rule? When was the last time that you showed love to your enemies, that you did good to those who did not favor you first, that you lent money to a needy person without hoping for anything back? This rule not only determines the quality of your work, but it also reveals your inner motive and the depth of your sincerity in the service of God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While there are many construction programs in progress, there are only two kinds of builders—the wise and the foolish. In Luke’s account Jesus speaks of two builders, one who built on the ground without a foundation, the other who built upon the deep-underlying rock. Wise builders, Jesus said, are those who come to him, hear his words and do them. The foolish are those who hear Jesus’ words but who do not do them; they build on present superficial values without a view to the future.—Luke 6:47-49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Every building must be tested, however. Seasons change. When spring and fall rains come, a river may flood its banks and become a raging torrent. It is the same with man; even before the end of this system of things at Armageddon, temptations, trials, sorrows and testings do come. Whose house will stand? Those who build on sand or on the ground without a foundation have in store disappointment. Jesus assures us of that fact. But wise builders will provide a refuge in the time of storm, because they heed Jesus’ words and they dig into God’s Word of truth to make sure of all things; they will be rewarded for their efforts. When the Armageddon storm strikes, their house will stand. (Rev. 16:16) So bear the future in mind as you build today, for the future will determine whether you are a wise or a foolish builder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">S</span><span class="font14">UMMER is at hand again, and for many persons that means preparing for a convention. In the</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">Many organizations are realizing that successful conventions contribute to an organization’s growth and internal strength. For this reason conventions have received increased attention in recent years. Every effort is made to see that they function smoothly and efficiently. Commenting on this, a popular United States magazine last year noted:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“One of the reasons why conventions are so successful these days is that they are carefully planned ... In fact, most of them run so smoothly that the average member isn’t aware of the long behind-the-scenes planning, even down to the minute details.”</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Experienced Conventioners</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah’s witnesses are perhaps in the best position to know what is involved in setting up and operating a convention. Since 1941, when many thousands of persons assembled for the final day of their eight-day convention in St. Louis, Missouri, they have held numerous assembly sessions with more than 100,000 in attendance. Observed the New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Times Magazine</span><span class="font14"> concerning their international assembly in 1958:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“The biggest convention ever held was the recent convocation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Yankee Stadium and the Polo Grounds. It brought 142,668 people to New York in the last week of July,. .. According to the records of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, 61,621 stayed in 438 hotels while the other 81,047 bunked jn private homes, motels, trailers or rooming houses.” Thousands of other Witnesses commuted from their own nearby residences, and on the final day tens of thousands of visitors turned out to swell the assembly’s attendance to over 250,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">No other convention could compare with it! Its magnitude was almost beyond belief. The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">1959 Arena Auditorium Stadium Guide</span><span class="font14"> commented: &quot;New York City, blase, not easily impressed, thought it had seen everything in the way of a gathering. ... Then came Jehovah’s Witnesses.’ Quiet, orderly, extremely well-mannered, they came by ship, bus, train, plane until more than one hundred and fifty thousand of them were on hand. By sheer numbers they impressed the big town as no other convention had ever done.” The 1958 convention remains the largest ever held, principally because there are no facilities to handle more of Jehovah’s witnesses comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Since that large international assembly, Jehovah’s witnesses have concentrated on holding a series of smaller conventions each year, sometimes called district assemblies. These annual meetings are in addition to the yet smaller circuit conventions, where eighteen to twenty congregations in an assigned area assemble every six months for a weekend of Bible instruction. Every weekend of the year, on the average, about sixty of these circuit conventions are in session somewhere in the world, with anywhere from a few hundred up to several thousand persons in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The officials of cities that entertain assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses are generally impressed by the smooth way in which preparations for these conventions are carried out. Last year, for instance, a member of the Corpus Christi, Texas, Chamber of Commerce offered to be helpful. After making suggestions on &quot;accommodating all these people” coming to the district assembly, &quot;signing them in,” “seating them,” and “catering,” he said: &quot;You people don’t seem to need much help. You have everything organized. Most people enter my office, flop down, stare at me helplessly, and blurt out, ‘We are going to have a convention. What shall we do?’ ”</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Motivation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What makes Jehovah’s witnesses different? It is not only experience in handling conventions. It is also the quality of love— love for one another, for fellow Christians. (John 13:34, 35) Jehovah’s witnesses consider one another brothers and sisters, all part of one family of God. And just as a human family cares for the interests of one another, so do Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In a large family thefe are many chores to perform—cooking, cleaning, washing, and helping in other ways—so at a convention there are similar duties to care for. In fact, at large gatherings of Jehovah’s witnesses there are as many as twenty-eight different departments of work, such as Attendants, Volunteer Service, Refreshments, Cafeteria, Installation, Check Room and Lost and Found, Information, Cleaning, Trucking and Equipment, Travel, Music, Rooming, Signs, and so forth. It is because Jehovah’s witnesses lovingly volunteer to assist in these many departments that their conventions operate so smoothly.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>First Requirement</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But, first, people must have a desire to attend. For a convention to be successful something appealing must be offered. One trade association official explained: “The big thing is program. You’ve got to offer a compact, appealing and meaningful program geared to the needs of your audience.” Jehovah’s witnesses do this. They feature God’s Word the Bible, showing how it offers practical solutions to the very problems facing mankind. It is this faith-strengthening program of Bible instruction that often draws over 100,000 persons to assembly sessions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Watchtower Society provides the basic outlines for the subject material to be presented. This is done only after carefully determining the current spiritual needs of the organization. Then qualified, experienced ministers with public-speaking ability are assigned to prepare and deliver the talks and oversee the demonstrations. These ministers spend many hours in preparation and practice. They appreciate that their brothers often make great efforts to attend, and that they deserve the best in spiritual food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For many months now preparations have been in progress for the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies, which commence June 22-26 in Toronto, Canada. This series of conventions then sweeps across Canada, southward into the United States—visiting Dallas, San Francisco, Baltimore, Miami Beach and Mobile—and, later in the year and early 1967, moves on into Mexico and many Central and South American countries. In Britain and other parts of the world the same assembly program will also be presented.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Early Preparation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It was back in December 1964, or about a year and a half ago, that negotiations first began in connection with holding the assembly this month at the Toronto Exhibition Grounds. Shortly afterward negotiations began for use of Candlestick Stadium, San Francisco, August 3-7; the Memorial Stadium, Baltimore, August 17-21; Convention Hall, Miami Beach, August 24-28, and other United States and Canadian assembly sites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This past December and January, N. H. Knorr, the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, visited more than a dozen Central and South American countries to negotiate contracts and make travel arrangements for conventions In those places. These assemblies will not get under way for another six months or so. But obtaining a suitable meeting place is only the initial preparatory step in connection with a convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Contacting hotels to see what space is available and what the prices will be is often the next step. For the Baltimore assembly this August these contacts began last fall. Then, about six to ten weeks before the convention begins, Jehovah’s witnesses start an organized house-to-house search for rooming accommodations in private homes. In Toronto this work commenced April 24 and is still in progress.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Arranging for Accommodations</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When a householder agrees to list rooms with a representative of the rooming committee a description of the accommodation is filed with the rooming office. Then, when a request for rooms is received, that accommodation request is matched with a listed accommodation in the file that fits the request. The person requesting the accommodation is then notified at whose home he will be staying, and is advised to let the party know at what time he will arrive in the assembly city and other pertinent information. The person listing the accommodation is also written, being advised who has been assigned to his home, and that he will be writing soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As can be appreciated, all of this takes a lot of work. For the international assembly in New York city in 1958, more than 236,000 hours were spent in the house-to-house search for rooming accommodations. In addition, an office staff of over 100 persons worked for more than two months prior to the assembly, processing requests and accommodations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Generally the community is very hospitable in welcoming assembly delegates into the local homes. At times the mayor of the city takes the lead by opening up his home to visiting Witnesses. For example, last year the mayor of Minneapolis agreed to accommodate a family of nine during the convention in his city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As a result of their conduct, Jehovah’s witnesses have obtained a good reputation. People know that they can be trusted. Following the convention at Yankee Stadium last summer one person wrote, as published in the New York </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Daily News</span><span class="font14"> of September 4: &quot;Regardless of what people may feel about the beliefs of Jehovah’s Witnesses, it must be admitted that they've proved one thing—that the Bible sure works when applied to the field of human relations. What with racial tensions being as they are it’s a pleasure to see that some people can live together as just one race, the human race. We all can learn a lesson from that,&quot;</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Volunteer Service</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Jehovah’s witnesses also work well together at their conventions. All service performed is voluntary. No one receives pay. To coordinate the workers, a Volunteer Service department begins functioning months in advance of an assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The files of this department contain an extensive list of the key workers at previous assemblies, their qualifications, and what assembly departments they have worked in. A couple of months before a convention begins, the Volunteer Service department starts writing letters,to confirm whether these keymen will be able to serve again. In the letter, certain brothers are often encouraged to line up helpers in their own congregation or circuit to work with them in their convention assignment. Many of such crews have worked together at assemblies many times before. At large assemblies, when these groups of workers are merged together, they form a nucleus around which the convention organization is built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So Volunteer Service is principally a processing department, lining up and assigning personnel to where they are needed. It has been found in the past that, for an assembly to operate smoothly, usually one volunteer worker is required for every six persons in attendance. At the huge international convention in 1958 when 253,922 attended on the final day, there was a total of 45,980 persons who volunteered their services to work in one of the many departments sometime during the eightday convention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, not all of Jehovah’s witnesses who go to conventions are in position to volunteer. Last year, for instance, one person, in answer to an invitation to work in connection with the Yankee Stadium convention, wrote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“I am very sorry to have to refuse your invitation to serve with you as a captain in the Volunteer Service Department, but my wife has recently undergone surgery twice and is pregnant, so such an assignment would be out of the question for me at this time. I am very thankful for the invitation and would otherwise try my best to fulfill the responsibility involved. I would appreciate it if Brother----, or</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">whoever is in charge, would keep me on this list for such assignment for the future, because I have enjoyed assisting in that department in the past and would again. With you in the desire of an assembly to Jehovah's praise.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">This letter expresses the attitude of tens of thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses, and explains how their assemblies can operate so smoothly. Even infirm and handicapped persons often volunteer, and their services are used well in certain departments.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Other Preparations and Work</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Weeks in advance of a large assembly an organizational meeting is held. Here arrangements are discussed for setting up a workshop and obtaining the necessary equipment. Observed S. H. Plumhoff, the Trucking and Equipment servant, in his report on the Yankee Stadium convention last year:</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“It is a tremendous task to get the needed equipment and trucks to supply the needs of the 28 departments which are set up to handle such a convention, but through letters and personal contact the response was indeed gratifying. Equipment was called in from 49 circuits in the northeastern part of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">“The response of business concerns in making courtesy Ioans of valuable equipment was very helpful and greatly appreciated. . . . Smith Corona loaned 12 secretarial model typewriters. Underwood loaned 2 office typewriters and an electric calculator for our use. Hobart loaned a 5 HP meat grinder, 2 mixer choppers, 4 slicing machines, 2 potato peelers and a 5 HP mixer, grinder pattie-making machine. . . . When business concerns make such loans it helps one to appreciate the good name and respect that Jehovah’s witnesses have been able to establish.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When the time for the convention arrives, setting up the stage and many convention departments is a tremendous job. At times there are only two or three days, or less, to do this. So, as has occurred at Yankee Stadium, scores of loaded trucks and hundreds of volunteer workers stand poised to swing into operation as soon as the last batter is out and the fans leave the ball park. During the convention itself, the trucks operate throughout the night bringing in the necessary supplies, particularly food. This is prepared and served at the assembly’s cafeteria and refreshment stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Last fall the New York city bulletin, </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Inside Health,</span><span class="font14"> reported relative to the tremendous feeding task performed by the cafeteria: “At least one-half million meals were served to about 50,000 persons at the Jehovah’s Witnesses Convention, Aug. 2429 at Yankee Stadium—and not a single case of food poisoning occurred. , . . Consumed daily—among other things—were 25 tons of beef, eight tons of potatoes, 4000 dozen eggs, 600 gallons of coffee and a trailer truck load of milk.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Close cooperation is required to prepare food rapidly in such quantities. How Jehovah’s witnesses work together to accomplish the task is illustrated by the sandwich-making operation, described by E. V- Singer, in charge of Refreshments: “Rye bread was used. One sister would spread mustard on the first slice, the other would put on the premeasured cup of pastrami, the next would place the mustard pickle chips on the pastrami, the last one would place a slice of bread on top and move it along to those who would wrap the sandwiches in dry wax paper.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Yes, there is a great deal of work in connection with assemblies of Jehovah’s witnesses. The cooperation and Christian love shown contribute to their unusual success. EVen in the matter of neatness they take pride, as the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">1959 Arena Auditorium Stadium Guide</span><span class="font14"> noted: “Not so much as a match stick or discarded candy wrapper could be found in the stadiums and other areas they had rented. Thousands of their members, men, women and children made up a committee to leave every square foot of area as clean or cleaner, than they had found it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The next time you attend a convention, think about the preparations involved. Accept our invitation to attend one of the “God’s Sons of Liberty” District Assemblies this year.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font20">H</span><span class="font14">AVE you ever noticed a person operating the keys on a machine in televised courtroom dramas, United Nations hearings and Presidential news conferences? He takes down everything that is said, easily keeping up with the speakers. The deVice he uses is a remarkable machine known as a stenograph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The keyboard was developed about fifty years ago by a shorthand reporter named Ward Stone Ireland. Weighing only about four pounds, the machine is easily carried about and is operated without wires and electricity. What it writes on a length of paper tape may appear to be meaningless to the untrained eye, but actually the writing is not as difficult to read as it appears. Instead of strange symbols, Roman letters are used. By looking carefully, you would be able to pick out portions of recognizable words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">You would also see some words that are written out in their entirety.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>How a Stenograph Works</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19651108_files/g_E_19651108-6.png" alt="" style="width:73pt;height:76pt;">

<div style="border-top:solid;"><img src="g_E_19651108_files/g_E_19651108-7.png" alt="" style="width:143pt;height:68pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">The keyboard of the machine contains 23 keys, with 21 keys representing 16 letters of the alphabet (a few letters are duplicated). There is also an asterisk and a space key. Operation of the machine is much like playing a piano. The keys are pressed lightly by the fingers, either singly or in groups. When a key is pressed, a letter is printed upon a strip of paper that is prefolded so that when it comes out of the machine it drops neatly into a tray at the back of the machine. Each time the keys are pressed, the machine automatically moves the tape up for the next word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A stenograph can be used for recording almost any language. This is due to the fact that the writing is done phonetically and the correct spelling of a word is not necessary. For example, the word “tough” is written on a stenograph as TUF, the word “your” as UR and “laugh” as LAF. One stroke on the machine can represent a syllable, word or phrase. From one to all ten fingers can be used in a single stroke.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>Division of the Keyboard</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The keyboard is theoretically divided into three basic units: the beginning of words, the vowels and the endings. The initial consonants of a word, such as T in TAB, are written with the fingers of the left hand and they appear on the left side of the tape. The vowels, such as A in BAT, are written with the thumbs and appear in the middle of the tape. Final consonants, such as R in TAR, are written with the right hand and always appear on the right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Each finger handles two keys on the machine, the exception being the small finger on the right hand, which presses two extra keys, but never at the same time. One-syllable words are written in one stroke instead of pressing each letter individually as on a typewriter. The word “start,” for example, requires five strokes on a typewriter, .but on a stenograph it requires only one stroke. All five keys are pressed at the same time and appear on one line on the tape. Here is another illustration: &quot;The star was out.” This sentence requires only four strokes on a stenograph but sixteen on a typewriter, apart from closing punctuation. Note the illustration of how this sentence is written on the tape. You read across from left to right for each word and then shift your eyes down for the next one. Since words are written phonetically on a stenograph and few strokes are required, as many as 250 words per min</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">ute can be recorded by a highly skUled stenotypist.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>The Basic Theory</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">With the keyboard containing only 21 letters, it is necessary to combine'two or more existing letters to substitute or represent the missing ones. For example, there are only four vowels on the keyboard. There is no I. The letters EU are used to represent this missing vowel when they are struck together, using the right thumb. Thus the word &quot;pit” is written on the tape as PEUT. After a while a trained operator mentally seep the vowel 1 whenever he sees EU.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For ending words with the letter D there is a D on the right side of the machine, but there is none on the left side for beginning words with D, such as DAD. When confronted with such a word, the operator uses the two letters TK to represent the beginning D. Some other substitutions are: TP for F; PW for B; HR for L; TPH for N and TKPW for G. After learning these various combinations, it is not difficult to learn the rest of the theory. This shorthand method is simple and not nearly as complicated as it might at first seem.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">T H E ST A R</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">W A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">U T</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Speed is the objective in stenotypy, and to achieve it abbreviations are essential. Here are some examples: The letter U stands for the word “you,” K for the word “can,” T for the word &quot;it,” UR for “your” and WH for “whether.” Some abbreviations for words of two or more syllables can be written with only one stroke. For example, POS for the word “possible,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">SUF for “sufficient,” SERT for “certain,” PRAPS for “perhaps” and TERT for “territory” can each be written with only one stroke on the machine, thus saving time. Because a stenotypist can use as many fingers as are necessary at one time, he seems to an observer to be able to keep pace with the person speaking and even, at times, to be waiting for him to finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As with anything else that humans do, errors are certain to occur. To correct them the stenograph operator uses the asterisk key (*) in the middle of the keyboard. After this, the correct letters are pressed. The transcriber knows when he sees the asterisk that the word immediately preceding the asterisk is incorrect but the one following is the correct word. To indicate a new paragraph, this key is pressed twice in succession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On the average, each stroke represents a word. A word of two or more syllables that is not abbreviated is written as a succession of sounds, and that requires more than one stroke on the machine. For example, the word “hotel” is written with two strokes. The syllable HO goes on one line and the syllable TEL on the next line. The same is true when an unimportant or unaccented vowel occurs in the middle of a word or in the last syllable. For example, the word &quot;article&quot; would be </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">written in only</span><span class="font14"> two strokes, first the syllable ART and then KL. Each stroke is on a separate line.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>Numbers and Punctuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Numbers are written by pressing the numeral bar that runs across the upper part of the machine, while pressing certain keys. To write numerals 1 to 4 and 6 to 9, the numeral bar is struck in conjunction with the keys in the top row. The bar raises the keys and enables them to strike numbers instead of letters.</span></p>
<div style="border:solid;">
<p><a href="#bookmark53"><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">H</span></a></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Because the numbers always appear in the same position on the tape, certain numbers have to be written with more than one stroke to avoid the wrong figure. For example, the number 23 requires only one stroke, pressing the two keys together. However, if the figure were 32, the 3 would have to be pressed first and then the 2, which throws the two numbers on separate lines. Since the lines are read from the top to bottom, the first line would have the 3 and the second the 2, giving the figure 32. The number 16 can be written with one stroke, putting both digits on the same line, but the number 61 requires two separate strokes, and hence separate lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For punctuation marks combinations of letters are used. The period is written by pressing all four fingers of the right hand on the four upper keys FPLT. The comma is formed by using the same fingers but by pressing the bottom four keys REGS. Similar combinations are used for other punctuation'marks. Although a number of letters are involved in these marks, it should be remembered that it takes the same amount of time to press three keys at the same time as it does to press one. When reading the tape, these combinations of letters are easily distinguished from single letters, helping the eye to pick out the punctuation marks when transcribing the material. Note the illustration of the sentence, “He said, we hope to see you at the hotel.” See how the letters </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">RBGS and FPLT, that indicate</span><span class="font14"> the punctuation marks, stand out from the other letters. Notice also the two-syllable word &quot;hotel” and how it is split between two lines because two strokes were required to write it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Once the combination of letters is memorized and the theory learned, speed becomes a vital factor toward success in operating a stenograph. It takes practice and more practice to become a good operator. Only after many hours of practice does a student begin to develop the skill he needs to write rapidly with this machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As the folded tape comes out of the stenograph it represents a permanent record that can be stored away and read decades later. An important feature of this system of shorthand is the fact that one stenotypist can read and transcribe the notes </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">of another, which is rarely possible </span><span class="font14">in other methods. The stenograph has proved itself invaluable for long and tedious dictation in courtrooms, conventions, congressional proceedings, and so on. It is not as tiring as other methods of shorthand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The rising growth rate of industry has created a large demand for accurate reporters, and since a certified stenotypist is regarded as a “dictation specialist,” this is a field with employment opportunities.</span></p>
<h4><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font19" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Mighty Parana on the Rampage</span></h4>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">By &quot;A wok* I” camtpendanl In Arj anting</span></p>
<p><span class="font20">W</span><span class="font14">HILE in other parts of the world drought has been producing acute water shortages, a large section of South America was suffering from too much water during the past several months. The entire Parana River region, all the way from Argentina’s northern province of Mi-siones to Buenos Aires in the south, was widely inundated by the surging, rain-swollen waters of this second-longest river of the southern continent The result has been a major disaster, the cost of which in lives and damage can only now begin to be computed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">When in mid-January the heavy rains came in the north, they were accepted at first as the usual harbingers of Argentina’s hot, humid summer season. Little did the people realize that those rains would bring about conditions of national emergency. The downpour was evidently heavier, more widespread, and of longer duration than anything experienced during the previous sixty years. The land could take only so much-water, and then the surplus began to drain off rapidly. Yet Still it rained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To comprehend the devastation that was to follow, we should understand that the Parana River traverses a course of three thousand miles, as it waters huge areas of Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina. The continuous runoff began to affect the river level at the point where Brazil’s Iguazu River pours its tributary waters into the Parana. Some 350 miles farther down, the Paraguay River also dumps its tremendous volume into the main stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Soon the river level was climbing swiftly. By the 18th of January hundreds were abandoning their homes and thousands more were threatened. A few days later the northern province of Misiones was declared a disaster area, and this status was then extended to the neighboring province of Corrientes. By this time the Parana had risen to a record level of fifteen feet above normal. The overflowing waters, like grasping fingers, were reaching out into the low-lying areas bordering the river.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Hazards of the Raffing Torrent</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Within a few days 90,000 persons were rendered homeless, and to add to the hardships and worries, the waters were hindering, and in places completely cutting off, compaunications, mail and transport services. Highways were menaced by the encroaching river; sections were washed out entirely, while others were submerged for long stretches. Anxiety about friends and relatives could not be allayed. Thousands of families were reduced to living in makeshift shelters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The swirling waters brought other hazards too. Giant “camelotes,” floating islands formed of tangled vegetation, swept down the river in such masses that they blocked the swollen river in places and caused its waters to spread into wide areas that might otherwise have escaped the devastation. At times these “camelotes” were large and buoyant enough to carry the weight of animals. In fact, it was reported that pumas had been carried downriver on them. Demolition crews now had to be called in as these floating masses piled up at bridges, obstructed navigation and threatened to block the intake channels of powerhouses and lines taking drinking water to the downriver cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Snakes and huge spiders from the tropical jungles also came down the river on those islands. One snake, thirty feet long and with a head as large as a good-sized dog’s, was shot by police. In the province of Formosa an unprecedented invasion of reptiles was experienced. Increasing numbers of snakebites were being reported. Snakebite serum, as many as 115,240 doses, was rushed in by the Public Health Department. One newspaper published a plea for cooperation in rounding up and shipping snakes to an institution in Buenos Aires where their venom could be “milked” and used in the preparation of additional supplies of the serum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Outbreaks of malaria, diphtheria and typhoid were feared. The putrefying carcasses of drowned cattle and other animals introduced worry about possible epidemics. The Health Department hurriedly distributed, in addition to snakebite serum, 29,900,000 units of antitetanus serum and 397,070 units of serum to combat malaria. In the province of Misiones yellow fever broke out, but though there were thirteen fatalities from this disease by March 9, the authorities managed to keep the situation well in hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Week after week the swelling waters of the Parana continued to reach ever farther beyond its banks, making fresh inroads into areas of agriculture and population. Fears also now arose for the safety of the area around Buenos Aires where the river empties into the Rio de la Plata. If the onrushing floodwaters reached seawater at a time when the southeast wind was blowing strong from the ocean, then a considerable portion of the city’s river districts might well be enveloped in the muddy waters. To some extent this fear was justified by the event, for six or seven thousand persons were forced to abandon their homes in that area. The delta islands were obliterated by the rising water level.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Relief with Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Relief measures were mobilized on a large scale. Food, clothing and cash contributions pourdd in from far and near. The army lent a hand, too, in rescue operations and in the delivery of relief supplies. In fact, the presence of the troops proved to be a necessary protection, for unprincipled persons had begun to loot. Large areas had to be declared a military zone in order to cope with an outbreak of organized and individual thievery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There were others besides robbers who were ready to take advantage of the confused conditions resulting from the flood. Smuggling of contraband material from Paraguay is ordinarily controlled quite effectively by patrols that cover the normal river and highway approaches to Argentina. Now, due to the widening of the river artery it became virtually impossible for the customs officials to maintain full control. Smugglers doubtless conducted an intensified campaign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The influx of relief supplies for flood victims appears to have brought to some unscrupulous officials a temptation they found hard to resist. Certain it is that fears were expressed by some citizens that urgently needed supplies were being stored for release at some future date—a date, they charged, that would fall around time for reelection, when votes might readily be purchased by means of gifts that cost the politician nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Generous gifts from other lands were gladly welcomed. From abroad came large donations, especially of medical supplies, and considerable help was also given in the matter of providing means for the evacuation of endangered flood victims.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>Witnesses Extend Help</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">There were refreshing incidents, too, that offered proof of the genuine concern of Christian ministers over the plight of the flood refugees. At Resistencia in the province of Chaco, where the Parana began its real rampage, and at nearby Bar-ranqueras, a large number of people had suffered temporary loss of home. Across the river on the higher elevation around the city of Corrientes, Jehovah’s witnesses broadcast their readiness to shelter and aid their homeless Christian brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The branch supervisor for Jehovah’s witnesses in Argentina made a special trip to the disaster zone to ascertain how best the Witnesses affected by the flood might be assisted. It was truly inspiring to find that, even where Kingdom Halls had been rendered unusable; the Witnesses had not left off meeting together regularly. Smaller meetings in private homes substituted for the larger gatherings and the vital spiritual welfare of the congregations was maintained. A number of Witnesses had lost all their possessions, and in several cases their homes had been un. able to withstand the ravages of the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Thirty congregations in the Greater Buenos Aires area were informed of the plight of their<sup>1</sup> brothers. Within a short time six tons of food and clothing were on their way. As quickly as blocked and washed-out highways could be restored, private transport arrangements sped relief to the needy. Even the expense of transportation was defrayed by generous cash contributions for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>And Now What?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A general survey of the flood zone was taken toward the close of March, and some tragic statistics were disclosed. In the province of Formosa over four million acres were under water, including some 94,000 acres bearing crops of cotton, sunflower and com. In the province of Chaco damages were estimated at about $16,000,000. Fifty percent of the cotton crop of this province, as well as 60 percent of the sunflower crop, was ruined. Loss of cattle by drowning was prodigious—135,000 head. And 60 percent of the province’s paved roads would now require costly repair or replacement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Though reports thus far on loss of life have not been issued officially, it is known that great numbers, including children and aged persons, were found dead when the waters receded. Many had delayed flight until too late, finding it hard to believe that such an unheard-of disaster could overtake them. In one case observers noted from some distance a woman, two children and a dog marooned on the roof of a submerged dwelling. On closer approach it was discovered they were all dead. What they had succumbed to, whether starvation or fright, could not be determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Argentina now has, in this huge devastated region, a gigantic job of rehabilitation on its hands. It is said that it will take at least three years before things can get back to normal. Metintime, amid the trying conditions of the flood’s recession, Jehovah’s witnesses continue to bear to the people a message of comfort and hope. They have good news for the people —news to the effect that in the New Order beyond Armageddon no such disaster will bring want and sorrow upon the inhabitants. Under the jurisdiction of a heavenly government, the elements of wind and water will be controlled so that neither hurt nor ruin will come upon the obedient earthly subjects of Christ, the invisible King.—Isa. 11:9,</span></p>

<p><span class="font20">P</span><span class="font14">ICTURE in your mind a garden in which each plant has its own chemical-producing system that keeps the soil in its vicinity permeated with weed killer. Would it not seem advantageous to cultivate such plants for the purpose of extracting the weed-killing chemical to use against weeds elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">These thoughts ran through the minds of some men more than twenty-five years ago. Although they were not gardeners, these men had a most unusual “garden.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">They were growing molds similar to that which grows on stale bread. In small containers they had specially prepared “soil.” The “weeds” with which they were working were minute plantlike organisms, bacteria that cause such diseases as diphtheria and pneumonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In their work they made a startling discovery. They found that the molds had a built-in defense system that released a chemical fatal to the bacteria responsible for the diseases just named. Later, this chemical was isolated and presented to the medical world as “Penicillin.” Thus, about 1941, began the age of antibiotics, chemical warfare against mankind’s most diminutive foes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">, The selective destructive action of penicillin against some of the most dangerous disease-causing organisms and its relative harmlessness to most patients are of particular importance. Countless human lives that otherwise would have been ended by the ravages of disease bacteria have been prolonged. However, it was later recognized that there are dangers connected</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">The field of antibiotics causes q to arise in the minds of many per</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">What kinds of antibiotics are there? Ho are they to be used? On what principle do they work? What limitations and dangers do they have? What precautions . should be taken? Indeed, just what are bacteria and infection?</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Bacteria and Infection</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Bacteria, frequently referred to as germs or microbes, are one-cell organisms that multiply simply by dividing in two. They are distributed everywhere and perform vital functions in .creation. Many perform useful functions in the soil. Mi]-lions are normally found in the human intestines, where they play an essential part in digestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, certain bacteria capable of infiltrating the human system produce injurious effects, causing infection. Drinking water may contain the bacteria of typhoid fever, and these can attach themselves to your intestines. The bacteria of tuberculosis are spread by an already infected person, generally by coughing or spitting, and these germs can implant themselves in your lungs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">with the use of penicillin and other anti-</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some bacteria are opportunists. They</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">live on the skin, in the throat, lungs and intestines, and are harmless if they do not penetrate living tissues. As long as you remain healthy your resistance to infection by them is strong. If, however, you are exposed to inclement weather or become exhausted or suffer from malnutrition, then your body may not be able to stop these opportunists from becoming aggressive. Through a small injury or by other routes they might penetrate the first line of defense—either the skin, throat or other tissues. Normally the white blood cells of your body will fight the infiltrators fiercely. Inflammation and fever are signs that the invaders have already established themselves. Your body has become a battlefield, and there are times when reinforcements may be imperative if you are to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By means of antiseptics medical men have prevented the growth of bacteria outside the body. But about forty years of effort failed to discover an antiseptic that would act on infective bacteria within the body without at the same time causing damage to body tissues or to the blood.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark71"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark72"></a>The Sulfonamides</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, in 1935, the investigation in Germany of a red dye and related chemicals known as the sulfonamides proved these to be drugs that could combat such life-threatening infections as meningitis and pneumonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Sulfonamides are usually taken orally and are absorbed into the blood, thus diffusing freely info every part of the body. The drug must be correctly matched against the causative organism. Success in treating a sudden infection depends much on dealing a decisive blow in the first twenty-four hours. A high starting dose is given, followed by regular and frequent administration in order to keep up high blood levels of the drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Observers have described the procedure that takes place as chemical war strategy. This is what happens: One of the substances normally present within the human body and which is essential for the growth and reproduction of certain bacteria is paramino-benzoid acid. The sulfonamides are of a similar chemical structure. The harmful bacteria mistakenly absorb the sulfonamide, with disastrous results. They cease to function normally. At this point the defense mechanisms of the body take over, complete the destruction of the ihvaders, and recovery of the patient is usually rapid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">However, the frequency of adverse side effects and serious reactions to this form of treatment imposes limitations on the use of sulfonamides and necessitates close supervision. Stoppage of urine due to crystallization in the kidneys of certain of the less soluble sulfonamides is only one danger. Tb avoid this, a generous supply of fluids must be given throughout the treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The course of life-threatening infections in countless men and women has been dramatically reversed as the result of treatment with sulfonamides. Nevertheless, with even the present improved sulfonamides in use, you should know that such treatment should never be used for conditions that do not justify the risk, and then only under supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While sulfonamides remain the drugs of choice for certain conditions of infection, this form of treatment has now been largely taken over by the antibiotics.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark73"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark74"></a>Discovery of Penicillin</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The cool, damp British summer of 1928 was conducive to the growth of molds. These are carried in every direction by air currents and grow on bread, cheese, vegetables or wherever they can find nourishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In that year scientist Alexander Fleming was doing research on disease-causing germs in his laboratory, growing them in round, shallow trays. It so happened that a few of these trays were put to one side for a few days and exposed to the air. Molds started to grow on them alongside his bacteria, not unusual in the circumstances. But, on just one of these plates the mold was acting peculiarly. It was destroying the colonies of harmful bacteria!</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By further experimenting Fleming showed that his mold produced a powerful chemical that interfered with the growth of the bacteria that cause pneumonia, diphtheria, gonorrhea and other conditions. Thus the discovery of one of the most remarkable drugs in history was an observation following a pure accident—a speck of mold just descended out of the London sky and drifted in through an open window! &quot;All the same,” Fleming later said, “the spores didn’t just stand up on the agar and say ‘I produce an antibiotic, you know.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Fleming prepared a paper on his discovery and read it to the Medical Research Club, but his listeners were bored. Though the paper was published in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">British Journal of Experimental Pathology,</span><span class="font14"> the scientific world was unexcited. For some ten years Fleming vainly tried to enlist the aid of leading doctors in Britain. With the outbreak of World War n, interest in antibacterial remedies became the center of interest and penicillin was rediscovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some of the most life-threatening and common germs present in all sorts of invasions, from pneumonia and scarlet fever to infected wounds and boils, succumb to the destructive effects of penicillin. But a number of other bacteria are quite indifferent to it. Also, while penicillin seems to be harmless to most persons, others have an exceptional susceptibility toward it, sometimes violently so. This may take the form of skin eruptions, rash and itching. Certain other more severe reactions are possible, even death to those extremely sensitive to it. If you have had adverse reactions with penicillin, by all means your doctor should be told of this before any more is administered. Tests may determine whether a person is allergic to the drug. Also, adequate laboratory control of the administration of antibiotics, especially in hospitals, is a necessary precaution against serious and uncontrollable infections arising from the emergence of strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>' Streptomycin</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font14"> second important antibiotic, streptomycin, discovered in 1944, was obtained from bacteria found in the soil. It is one of the most useful chemicals yet discovered in the war against the world scourge of tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">By itself streptomycin does not cure the disease, nor does it kill the bacteria. It merely arrests their progress. By bed rest and diet it is hoped to build up the patient’s natural defenses to the point at which the control, if not the eradication, of the infection can be brought about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Resistance to injections of streptomycin develop among the tubercle bacilli in a few weeks, but this problem is overcome by the patient’s taking orally another drug at the same time, either sodium aminosalicylate or isoniazid. Though much less powerful than the antibiotic, the germs resistant to streptomycin respond to one <sup>1</sup> of these other drugs. Usually treatment over a long period, perhaps two years, is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Some persons are allergic to streptomycin. A more serious problem is that prolonged administration may cause disturbance of the nervous system, sometimes leading to balancing difficulties or even deafness. If the patient wants to be cured, it may be that the severity of the disease is such that no other treatment is available. Patient and doctor should carefully consider the risks involved before proceeding with the treatment. Though there is the risk, in many countries its use has helped keep under control the dreaded tuberculosis, once a merciless killer.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">Thousands of soil samples obtained from all over the world have been screened for bacteria capable of producing antibiotics. Tetracycline was introduced in 1952 and is active against a much wider range of bacteria than either penicillin or streptomycin. It is now widely used and has saved many lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While tetracycline is relatively non-poisonous, gastrointestinal disturbances are possible. This risk can be reduced by taking the drug with or directly after food. Dryness of the mouth may occur and occasionally more serious side effects are noted due to the antibiotic’s destroying the normal, useful bacteria of the intestine, leaving the field clear for resistant bacteria to flourish. Pregnant women are advised not to take tetracycline because there is a tendency for the baby’s teeth to be discolored. It is also suggested that young children should avoid tetracycline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin) is another antibiotic, isolated from a bacteria found in a soil sample from Venezuela. It is both highly effective and dangerous. Medical men are advised that its use is justified only in the treatment of life-endangering infections such as typhoid fever when no other effective antibiotic is available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">A few other useful antibiotics are also available, but, again, most require caution in their use.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark79"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark80"></a>Has Its Place</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The use of antibiotics has its place in the practice of medicine. But too many people, having heard of the dramatic efficiency of antibiotics, expect immediate relief when a cold, raised temperature or skin eruption sends them to a doctor. The experienced medical man will not administer antibiotics and risk destroying numerous friendly bacteria and possibly introducing other complications just to get rid of germs about the presence of which he is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">While sometimes the patient’s condition does not allow delay and testing, the ideal arrangement is for the doctor first to identify accurately the invading organism, and then ascertain the safest, fastest and most effective drug to use against it. Laboratory tests to do this can be performed in a day or so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Although there is the danger of adverse reaction, it can be kept to a minimum by testing and matching the proper drug against the invading germ. And when the patient is given intelligent care and his defense mechanism is efficient, the response is usually rapid. As a result of such treatment, gone are the days of hopeless despair with numerous cases of pneumonia, scarlet fever, tuberculosis and meningitis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">So the discovery of antibiotics has made possible the combating of harmful bacteria with relatively little adverse effect on the patient.

<p><span class="font20">T</span><span class="font14">HIS unusual transportation system follows the route of the fabled Inside Passage, the marine highway by which gold from the Klondike and Alaska diggings moved years ago to the United States. Threading through the spectacular mountain wilderness of the Alexander Archipelago, the new Marine Highway offers passengers the opportunity to glimpse a frontier being transformed into a twentieth-century civilization and to meet people who have the resourcefulness to live in a challenging wilderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">For making this trip to Alaska, there is now at one’s disposal an elite fleet of three new four-and-a-half-million-dollar ferries. When the huge ferry Malaspina slid from the docks into Puget Sound late in 1962, it displaced 3,585 tons of water, A few minutes later tugs left her to her</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font14">tances involved are much greater than most ferry systems serve, designing engineers gave exceptional attention to comfort. Features of the ships were borrowed from trains, airplanes, bus and train terminals and assorted other public conveniences. The result is not just another ferry to haul vehicles and passengers from one point to another; it is something of an all-purpose luxury ferry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The ship’s staterooms and entire boat deck have been designed for comfort and appeal. The lounges and saloon are decorated in totemic motif, reminiscent of the Indians (not Eskimos) who originally settled this part of Alaska. The top deck has been reserved for the bridge, pilothouse and officers’ quarters up forward. It also contains the lone incongruity. Designers had styled the top deck the “Sun Deck.” Southeasterners, of course, have not attempted to sun themselves in the 100 to 150 inches of rain it sheds each year. But designers never changed it, engineers had no reason to notice it, and shipbuilders overlooked it. Now Alaskans' own a sun deck in southeastern Alaska, a misnomer and an amusing topic of conversation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Shortly after the trial runs, the Malaspina was licensed by the United States to carry 500 passengers in inside waters, and she headed north to her home amidst the hundreds of islands that make up the Alexander Archipelago. She was joined later</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">by the Matanuska and Taku, named, as she was, after prominent Alaskan glaciers. These ferries each carry 108 autos and 500 passengers.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark83"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark84"></a>Route of the Marine Highway</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">As the big ferry eases away from the slip at Prince Rupert, Canada, we are on a direct trip of about 31 hours of leisure and 490 statute miles of travel-folder beauty to the northern terminus at Skagway, Alaska. All together, the ship stops at seven ports of call. As colorful as the origin of their names, Ketchikan, Sitka and Skagway are derived from Indian words; Petersburg was named for a Norwegian fisherman; Wrangell, one of Alaska’s oldest towns, for a Russian baron who founded it a? a fur trading post in 1834; and Joe Juneau was a gold prospector who struck it rich where the present capital of Alaska now stands. Whereas Juneau, Skagway and Haines are backed by huge mountains and glaciers, Petersburg, Wrangell, Ketchikan and Sitka are among lie 1,100 islands in the Alexander Archipelago made up of tops of submerged mountains, with irregular coastlines and deep channels between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At Ketchikan, southern gateway to Alaska, we enjoy the contrast of cultures so common along the way. Because ferry service is provided six days out of seven and travelers may board any one at their convenience, stops at ports of call are brief, and before long we are back aboard in time for supper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the night the ferry stops briefly at two fishing and sawmill communities: Wrangell, which grew up under three flags (Russian, British and American) and served as a supply center during three separate gold rushes; and Petersburg, custodian of the world’s record 1261-pound salmon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">During the night one can observe sonie fascinating navigation, as we enter Wrangell Narrows. This narrow channel is also crooked, shallow and marked with buoys, flashers and beacons. Men, women and children and even crew members chart each light as it approaches. Passenger participation scarcely relaxes long enough for a blink until we reach the northern end of Petersburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">On alternate runs, the ferry puts in at Sitka, the former capital of Russian America, where the United States’ purchase of Alaska from Russia was formalized in 1867, for two cents an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Nestled at the base of an immense pair of mountains, Juneau, the capital city, is truly picturesque—a dot of civilization on the edge of a massive expanse of ice, snow, rock and glaciers. Modem office buildings, narrow streets and shopping district ate all crowded onto the limited level space of the downtown area. They are extended up the base of the mountain until the terrain becomes too steep to walk or drive. From here it is just a few minutes’ ride by car to a beautiful sight for which Alaska is famous: beautiful Mendenhall Glacier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The six-hour voyage up Lynn Canal affords some of the most breathtaking scenery along the Highway and takes us to our last two ports of call, Haines and Skagway. Of the seven ports of call, only Haines has road access, a 159-mile road that links the ferry system to the rest of Alaska. The end of the line is Skagway, gateway to the Yukon. It is a town of about 750 population, with wooden sidewalks, and some of the false-front buildings that served its peak population of 20,000 during the Gold Rush days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The Alaska Marine Highway System was conceived as a transportation link to the continental United States and Canada through a largely unknown and extremely beautiful section of Alaska. It was designed to provide a more economical means of transportation for southeastern Alaskans and also to accommodate a limited amount of freight. The Highway is proving popular, the ferries carrying 187,000 passengers during the first two years of service. Since the ferries connect Canadian Highway 16 on the south and the Haines Highway on the north, they save a motorist driving to central Alaska about 650 miles of gravel-road travel. The ferries run the year round and are making the Inside Passage a popular marine throughway to the north.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">A full-time minister in the United States had occasion to relate this experience:</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">‘‘A woman had been to a Billy Graham crusade meeting where she was 'saved.' Some of those 'saved' sincerely wanted to know what they should do next. At the crusade gathering they were told simply to go to the church of their choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot;The woman had conscientiously accepted Christ as her savior. Now what? Since she did not know what church God wanted her to attend, she prayed to him. She earnestly told God that she would go wherever he would send her, even if it were to a little old broken-down church with few members but where she would be needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot;Continually she prayed to God to show her the right church, to give her some sign. One day. after praying she was out driving and looked up to see a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah’s Witnesses. ‘But, Lord, there must be some mistake,’ she prayed. ‘You don’t mean that one. They don’t even believe in Christ!' On going home she said, ‘Lord, you'll just have to give me a sign. I really am anxious to get started doing what is right.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot;The next day one of Jehovah’s witnesses called at her door. She accepted copies of </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">The Watchtower</span><span class="font13"> and </span><span class="font13" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font13"> and made an appointment for him to return the following Saturday at 2 p.m. As he left, she prayed again, saying, 'Lord, this is the second time. But surely this can’t be the sign, because they don’t believe in Jesus.’ All the week she worried about the appointment and prayed. She finally decided to be out when the Witness called at 2 p.m. By Saturday she was quite anxious as she prepared to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot;As it happened, though, the Witness who had made the appointment became ill, so he asked a fellow minister to stop by and tell the woman why he could not be there. The Witness had other persons to call on in the area, so she stopped ,by the person’s house at 1 p.m. At that time the woman had not yet left and was shocked when she answered the door and the caller introduced herself as one of Jehovah’s witnesses. The woman who had been praying for a sign opened the door and in a shocked state motioned for the Witness to enter. After explaining why the original minister who called was unable to come, the Witness proceeded to offer the householder a booklet to aid her in the study of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&quot;Silently the woman prayed, ‘Lord, this is the third time!’ She openly told the Witness that she had intended to be absent when the minister came, but since this was three out of three times she had better get the matter straightened out. 'Do you believe in Christ?’ she asked. The answer was, 'Why, of course.* Then the Witness showed her Scriptural references to support the statement. The woman said, ‘This must be it. God must be sending me to this organization. Now what do I do?’ The Witness replied, ‘Study.’ And that she is doing, having a home Bible study, despite bitter opposition from her relatives.&quot;</span></p><img src="g_E_19651108_files/g_E_19651108-14.png" alt="" style="width:199pt;height:119pt;">
<p><span class="font14">□&quot;THREE times in the Bible book of Reve-</span><span class="font14" style="text-decoration:underline;">I</span><span class="font14"> lation the expression “Alpha and the Omega” occurs as a title. These are Greek words for the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. Due to the manner in which the title appears in the book, differences of opinion have arisen as regards to whom the title applies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It first appears at Revelation 1:8, and to some persons reading the Authorized Version of the Bible of 1611 C.E., it seems to apply to Jesus Christ. This is the way it reads in that translation: “I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.” Because Jesus Christ is mentioned in the verses preceding this one, these persons conclude that he is the one speaking here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The opening verse of chapter one of this Bible book shows that the Revelation was given first to Jesus Christ by God, and then Jesus gave it to John through an angel. The angel, therefore, speaks at times as representing God, the primary Giver of the Revelation, and at other times as representing Jesus Christ. For whom, then, is the angel speaking in this text?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">It is interesting to note the words of Albert Barnes in </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Barnes’ Notes on the New Testament.</span><span class="font14"> He observes: “It cannot be absolutely certain that the writer meant to refer to the Lord Jesus specifically here. . . . There is no real incongruity in supposing, also, that the writer hei'e meant to refer to God as such.” So, does the ambiguous word “Lord” in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Authorised Version</span><span class="font14"> apply, in this text, to the supreme God who created man or to Jesus Christ his Son?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">Many modern and more accurate translations of the Bible such as the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Standard Version, New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</span><span class="font14"> and </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">An American Translation</span><span class="font14"> reveal that, not Jesus, but “the Lord God” is the One who is speaking. For example, the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Revised Standard Version </span><span class="font14">puts the text this way: “ T am the Alpha and the Omega^’ says the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.” The </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">New World Translation </span><span class="font14">makes it even clearer by stating: “ ‘I am the Alpha and the Omega,’ says Jehovah God.” The use of the expression “Alpha and Omega” in the eleventh verse of this first chapter in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Authorised Version</span><span class="font14"> is without satisfactory support from Greek language Bible manuscripts. Such very old manuscripts as the Alexandrine, Sinaitic and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus do not contain this title in that verse. Since John did not include it, but it was added centuries later by an uninspired copyist, the aforementioned modern translations leave it out. For this reason verse eleven in the </span><span class="font14" style="font-style:italic;">Authorised Version</span><span class="font14"> cannot be used as proof that the title refers to Jesus Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">After Revelation 1:8, the title does not appear again in these modern Bible translations until Revelation 21:6, which says: “He said to me: ‘They have come to pass! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.’ ” Who is speaking here? Verse seven gives the answer by saying: “Anyone conquering will inherit these things, and I shall be his God and he will be my son.” Those who are chosen to be spiritual sons of God are referred to by Jesus at Matthew 25:40, not as ‘my sons, but as “my brothers.” Because they are brothers of Jesus Christ, the One of whom they become sons in Revelation 21; 6 would have to be Jesus’ heavenly Father, Jehovah God. Thus the title “Alpha and the Omega” as used there refers to Jehovah rather than to Jesus Christ.—Compare Hebrews 2:10-12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">But what about the expression &quot;the First and the Last,” used at Revelation 1:17 and 2:8 by the angel while speaking for Jesus Christ? Because the title is associated with Jesus’ resurrection in each instance, it is used with definite limitations. He was first to be raised from the dead to eternal life and the last to be raised directly by God. When his followers receive a resurrection, he is used by God as an instrument in raising them. Thus with respect to his manner of being resurrected, he was the first and the last. Revelation 1:18 reveals Jesus to be God’s instrument in raising others from the dead by stating that he has “the keys of death and of Hades.” Hades is the Greek word for the common grave of dead mankind. So the expression &quot;the First and the Last,” when applied to Jesus Christ by the Bible, is limited in its meaning by being associated with his resurrection. But when the angel uses this expression while speaking representatively for Jehovah God at Revelation 22:13, its meaning is without limitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The title “the Alpha and the Omega” carries the same thought as first and last, and it is appropriately applied to Jehovah God by the Bible in an unlimited way. Jehovah is the first of all things, their Beginner, and because of his Almighty power he is capable of bringing all things to an end. Thus in an unlimited sense he is &quot;the first and the last,” &quot;the Alpha and the Omega.” The prophet Isaiah speaks of him in this manner at Isaiah 44:6: “This is what Jehovah has said, the King of Israel and the Repurchaser of him, Jehovah of armies, ’I am the first and I am the last, and besides me there is no God.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">At Revelation 22:13 the title &quot;the Alpha and the Omega” appears for the third and last time in the Bible. “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.” Due to confusion over the surrounding verses, some persons think that Jesus Christ is speaking here, but is this so? In verses eight and nine, it is made clear that an angel is the spokesman, and he is the one who speaks representatively in verse twelve, saying: “Look! I am coming quickly, and the reward I give is with me, to render to each one as his work is.” This statement immediately precedes the verse that' identifies the Speaker as “the Alpha and the Omega.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">The expression “I am coming&quot; cannot be confined to Jesus Christ, who promised to return. In this text it is Jehovah God who promises to come to execute judgment upon mankind. This is similar to what was foretold by the prophet Isaiah: “For, look! Jehovah is coming forth from his place to call to account the error of the inhabitant of the land against him.” (Isa. 26:21) Thus it is proper for Jehovah God, “the Alpha and the Omega,” to say &quot;I am coming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">In Revelation 22:15 the angel finishes his message as God’s spokesman, and in verse sixteen he begins speaking as Jesus’ spokesman in order to conclude the Revelation to John. This ties the conclusion in with the opening chapter, where Jesus Christ is shown as the one who gave to John the Revelation. With these facts in mind, it can be seen that the title “the Alpha and the Omega” is used in the Bible for Jehovah God alone.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Church Separation Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">$■ On April 17 Wladyslaw Go-nulka, Polish Communist eader, denounced Stefan Car-llnal Wyszynski, Primate of ?oland. The two most powerful men in Poland staged im-josing shows of strength in ’oznan, appealing to the jeople to hear them. Gomulka ■barged that the Roman Cath-jlic Church was intending to play a political role in Poland. Polish newspapers had accused the cardinal of not hav-' tag recognized the separation of Church and State. Gomulka castigated the bishops of Poland for having Invited the German bishops to the climax of the celebration marking 1,000 years of Catholicism in Poland on May 3. He said that these bishops were the same persons who, in 1939, sounded the victory bells over Poland. Cardinal Wyszynski declared that the Catholic church has a legitimate concern with the economic, social and .political life of Poland. “The<sup>1</sup> church has a mandate to talk about those problems,&quot; he said. &quot;It got that mandate from the Ecumenical Council” in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Ig Man Dead ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">$ Dr. Erich Fromm, addressing 2,500 social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists at the 43d annual meeting of the American Orthopsychiatric Association In San Francisco, declared: “A man sits in front of a bad television program and does not know that he is bored; he reads Vietcong casualties in the newspaper and does not recall the teachings of religion; he learns of the dangers of nuclear holocaust and does not feel fear; he joins the rat race of commerce, where personal worth Is measured in terms of market values, and is not aware of his anxiety. Ulcers speak louder than the mind. Theologians and philosophers have been saying for a century that God is dead, but what we confront now is the possibility that man is dead, transformed into a thing, a producer, a consumer, an idolater of other things.&quot; Centuries ago the apostle Paul came to a similar conclusion, saying: “The one that goes in for sensual gratification is dead though she is living.” (1 Tim. 5:6) The world is full of such persons who can well be called ‘the living dead.' But not all are that way; some see the significance of these critical times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Train Explosions</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt; At Dlphu station, five miles outside Naga territory in the state of Assam, India, a bomb explosion ripped a crowded train. The death toll climbed to 40 as rescuers dragged bodies /from the wreckage. One hundred others were injured. Only a week prior to this explosion in mid-April a similar blast killed 95 people. Some believe the bomb was planted by persons who are demanding independence frdm India. In the Assam area people are refusing to ride trains and station masters work in fear of their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Children in Brazil</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; According to new figures from the Brazilian Health Ministry, a thousand children under five die every day in Brazil. Malaria is prevalent in 90 percent of the country. The same source said that six million Brazilians have epidemic diseases. During the past two years the government has spent nearly $70,000,-000 to improve the nation’s health situation, but many problems remain. The shortage of doctors and nurses is staggering. Brazil still needs at least 40,000 more physicians and about 75,000 nurses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Half a Million Refugees</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; A month of rains and floods, beginning in the middle of March, devastated large areas of Central Java. Hard-est hit was the city of Solo. Official figures on loss of life and damages released April 12 show 131 persons dead, 80 injured and 540,892 refugees, many of whom have no homes to which to return. To date, 11,442 homes are listed as destroyed or completely washed away. Floodwaters reached a height of almost 40 feet In many areas of Wonogiri county, while parts of the city of Solo were 10 feet under water. Some 20,000 acres of rice paddies and other crops were destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Blood Donors</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; With the return of thousands of servicemen to America from Vietnam, the Public Health Service is urging hospitals, especially smaller ones, to be veiy cautious about accepting the veterans as blood donors. Reason: they may have acquired falciparum malaria, which could be transmitted through blood transfusions. The health service reports that in at least four cases individuals have developed malaria after their release from duty in Vietnam and return to civilian life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Famine Peril</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Toward the latter part of April a number of agricultural specialists assembled together for the purpose of evaluating the world’s food supply. They concluded that unless the problem of feeding underdeveloped countries could be solved, &quot;the fate of all men will be the fate of India,&quot; which, of course, is not pleasant at present. Dr. Paul C. Mangelsdorf, director of the Botanical Museum at Harvard, pointed out that only 15 species of plant' &quot;stand between mankind and starvation.” In fact, he said, 30 percent of all human energy comes from a single species —rice. /</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Religion on the Upbeat</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Teen-agers rocked 'n' rolled ‘ In the aisles of historic Old</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">South Church, Boston, during a religious service on April 25. About 1,100 teen-agers were present at the gathering, which was organized by a Harvard Divinity School graduate who said that he was trying to translate traditional Christian concepts into teenage language. During the service, rock ’n’ roll tunes were used with religious lyrics substituted for the original words. Dr. Frederick M. Meek, senior minister, said the congregation “participated reverently.&quot; The only sermon was a &quot;sermon-dance” that lasted five minutes. In Rome, Italy, teen-agers appeared mesmerized as they listened to a mophaired rock ’n’ roil group playing a &quot;beat mass” in the chapel of the Roman Catholic church of St, Phillip. Little wonder that the world is empty to teen-agers when their spiritual diet is nothing more than so much musical nonsense. Can you imagine Jesus Christ dancing the frug and watusi in the aisle of the synagogue in Nazareth as those teen-agers did in Boston? Hardly!</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">The World’s Population Up</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">Throughout the world last year, 125,000,000 infants were born and 60,000,000 people died, which leaves the earth with a net increase of 65,000,000. According to nongovernmental Population Reference Bureau in Washington, as many people were added to the world in 1965 as now reside in Canada, Dominican Republic, Belgium, Egypt and New Zealand combined. Earth now is inhabited by 3,350,000,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Artificial Heart</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">What was hailed as a milestone in surgery was performed on April 21 when Dr. Michael DeBakey successfully attached an artificial heart to a 65-year-old patient. The operation took five hours. The artificial heart remained attached to patient Marcel L. DeRudder and was pumping life-giving blood at 85 beats a minute, in conjunction with his own heart. The object of the artificial heart is to take over the work of a weak or damaged heart and allow it to heal itself. A medical team from Baylor and Rice universities in Houston, Texas, estimated that a bypass pump could help 75 to 90 percent of all heart attack victims. An estimated 900,000 Americans die every year of heart ailments, which are the nation’s No. 1 killer. Five days after receiving the artificial heart Marcel DeRudder died. An autopsy disclosed that death was caused by a pulmonary or lung rupture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Governments Topple</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$&gt; Nearly every month somewhere in the world a government is toppled by undemocratic means. U. S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk stated, “Since I have been Secretary of State I have lived through 52 coups d’etat in the world, that is, unconstitutional changes of government somewhere.” Rusk figured that during 1966 there '.vevld te sa government changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Demonstrations Everywhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;§&gt; This has become a decade of demonstrators and demonstrations. Almost any issue can provoke a demonstration, (pn April 19, when U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk arrived in Ankara, Turkey, to attend the annual meeting of the Central Treaty Organization, fifty university students staged an anti-American demonstration. The students marched on the U.S. embassy with placards and banners proclaiming: &quot;This is not Johnson’s ranch;’' and, &quot;Yankee go home.” In New York city’s financial district workers and antiwar demonstrators traded punches and insults on April 14 during a hectic 45-minute protest march outside the New York Stock Exchange. Demonstrations against the prosecution of the war in Vietnam were held in many places throughout the world—Peking, Rome.and several Australian cities. American marines on leave in Oslo, Norway, fought with demonstrators marching on the U.S. embassy. Meanwhile, Buddhist and Roman Catholics demonstrated in and near Saigon for and against the war. In West Germany more than 20,000 Protestants from West Germany, Belgium and Switzerland demonstrated on March 7 against new theology trends. The demonstration was a protest against “falsification and obscuring God’s word by modernist, existentialist theologians.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Volcano Assets</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">For about two years between 1963 and 1965 Mount Irazti was in constant eruption, belching out millions of tons of fine volcanic ash, which destroyed large areas of arable land around the capital dty of San Josd, Costa Rica. Since that time Japanese experts have been studying the ash and find it to be of a quality that can be put to practical use. They- have offered their help to establish a new national industry in Costa Rica, using the ash to manufacture many household objects, such as cups, plates and sugar bowls, as well as bricks and blocks for construction purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Older Workers</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">The United States Labor Department pointed out that only 11 percent of the workers in manpower and training programs are over 45 years old, although they make up 29 percent of the unemployed. The study, made by the department, revealed that the average 55-year-old man who accepts a job stays on for 7 years. That is 6 months longer than the average 25-year-old keeps one job. The moral is that hiring a 55-year-oId may provide an employer with as many years of service as hiring a young worker.</span></p>

<p><span class="font13">Gamma globulin is a fraction of blood plasma rich in antibodies and used by doctors as an injection against measles, hepatitis and other diseases. But they are finding that it can be a dangerous procedure. Dr. David Gitlin, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, warned against giving children gamma globulin simply because they seem to be unusually prone to infection. Such therapy, he said, can produce harmful effects that are both immediate and long-range. In girls, gamma globulin might eventually have an adverse effect on their babies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">Hair Money</span></p>
<p><span class="font13">&lt;$■ Last year India earned nearly 3,000,000 rupees ($630,000) from the export of human hair. Hair given to the god Venkateshwara is now finding its way into American and European markets. Venkateshwara is one of the gods of the Hindu trinity. Pilgrims go to his temple to have their heads shaved and they give their hair to the god. About 50 <sup>!</sup> tons of hair is collected every year. Now, ways are planned, not only to sell the hair, but to make the wigs and export them directly. The profits made from the hair will be paid to the Venkateshwara temple, less a service charge.</span></p>

<p><span class="font14">The integrity of the text of the Holy Bible is truly a marvel of modem times. To think that anything penned by man could survive intact through centuries of recopying and concerted efforts to destroy it! What is it that lifts the Bible far above all other “holy books”?</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">To quote one of the outstanding Bible textbooks of today: “In order for a religious book that is used in worship of God to be the truth, it must be from a truthful source. It must have a truthful author, who is acquainted with fact, reality, truth, and who is unafraid to tell the truth for the benefit of the lovers and seekers of the truth. Really, it should spring forth from the God of truth and should show God as he really is in his qualities, his position, his purposes and his works. . . . For this reason the written Word of God, the Holy Bible, stands forth as a challenge against all the other ancient sacred books of religion, . . . Prove to yourself that the Holy Bible is the one Book of the truth. Read it, study it; follow it, and receive the greatest blessing in your life.”</span></p>
