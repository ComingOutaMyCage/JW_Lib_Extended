</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Many persons wish it were not that way, preferring to shut themselves off from what is going on. But no matter where we live, we cannot escape the fact that each of us is vitally affected by developments in the world as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In virtually every avenue of life world conditions pose difficult questions and problems. For instance: How to cope with the reduced purchasing power of money, rising prices and a jittery world economy. World conditions affect savings put away in banks, old-age retirement plans, the price you pay for things, and even whether you will have a certain item of food or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">More than that, world conditions affect the family, not only the feeding and clothing of family members, but also the relationship between marriage partners and the raising of their children. Widespread immorality has a deteriorating effect, offering many temptations to immoral conduct. And immorality prevalent in motion pictures, TV and in real life adversely affects children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Then as youths grow up, governments often demand them for fighting wars. How common have become hot and cold wars, civil wars, revolutions, terrorism and violence! One news correspondent, who has long covered international affairs, spoke of “the will to revolt” as being so widespread “as to be almost universal today”! You cannot help but be affected by the world tensions this spirit causes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Moreover, because of the moral breakdown, the streets of many cities are unsafe after dark. There</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">has been an alarming disintegration of law and order. Violence, robbery and rape have become ever-present possibilities with which to reckon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, it must be admitted that man’s very worship is affected as it has never been before. Churches are losing influence, people are turning cold and faithless, and in some countries atheistic and radical elements are trying to stamp out religion altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What can be done about such conditions in the world? It does no good to pretend they do not exist. Far better to seek the meaning of world conditions, to find out why they are as they are and what can be done to cope with them. Only one Book in all the world does this satisfactorily. That Book is one you probably have in your own home, the Holy Bible. Consult it as you consider the following articles in this magazine. See how the Bible explains the reason for present world conditions, what you can do about them and what hope there is for the future.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">W</span><span class="font1">HEN you go to the market, you pay more for bread, eggs, vegetables and meat than you did ten years ago or perhaps just one year ago. You also pay more for rent, for operating an automobile and for medical care. Because of inflation your money is experiencing a steady loss in value. On the surface a dollar, a peso or a mark appears to be the same as always, but in actuality it is not, because it will not buy as much as it used to. Inflation is a common problem throughout the world, some countries suffering more from it than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Brazil, for instance, the cost of living skyrocketed 81 percent in 1963, so that what could be bought for a cruzeiro at the beginning of the year took one cruzeiro and 81 centavos to purchase twelve months later. During the same period the cost of living in Uruguay jumped more than 40 percent, and in Chile and Colombia the rate, at times, has risen 50 percent. In some places inflation has been even more explosive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Back in the spring of 1923 the German mark crashed in value to where 57,000 marks were worth only one United States dollar. But the mark’s value continued to plummet. By the middle of October one American dollar was worth 6,500,000,000 marks. Three weeks later it was worth 630,000,000,000 marks. A serious crisis resulted. People began suffering from a food shortage because farmers refused to sell food for money that was rapidly becoming worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inflation caused a similar economic tragedy in China following the second world war. In 1946 one American dollar was worth about 2,000 Chinese dollars (yuan). By February 1948 the value of the Chinese dollar had dropped to where it took 328,000 of them to equal an American dollar. A few months later the American dollar was valued on the black market at 11,500,000 Chinese dollars. The salary of the average government worker was so great that it required him to carry his pay away in big bundles of bank notes. Paper money of small denominations was regarded as of so little value that the people used it to light their kitchen fires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inflation has also greatly devaluated the American dollar. For example, if we compare the dollar’s buying power in 1939 with its buying power today, we find that it is now worth only 46.4 cents, assuming that it was worth 100 cents in 1939. This means that if you were making $2,000 a year in 1939 you would have to earn about $4,300 today just to preserve your purchasing power. If you earn less than this, you are losing ground, being unable to purchase as much with your salary as in 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Those who are hurt most by inflation, whether it is the creeping variety or the explosive variety, are people with fixed incomes. Those living on pensions, social security or an income from mortgages and bonds find it increasingly difficult to care for their daily living expenses. The person that anticipated retiring with life-long payments from an insurance policy may find, when retirement time comes, that inflation has made the income from life insurance inadequate for meeting the higher cost of living. So, instead of retiring, he must continue working. With the passing of every year, inflation makes the money in such fixed incomes worth less and less.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark10"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark11"></a>Why Inflation?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Although the causes for inflation seem rather complex, with many theories attempting to explain it, a big underlying factor is a government’s policy of increasing the supply of money excessively. When this is done, the more money it turns out on its printing presses the more each unit of money, such as a one-dollar bill, loses in purchasing power, because the money supply is being diluted; and this lowers the quality of the money. We might compare the process with diluting a quart of milk with water. The result is more milk of lower quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The increased quantity of money that circulates because of such government action deludes some people into thinking that they are better off because they have more money in their pockets. However, unless their wages are increased in proportion to the inflationary rise, they will be worse off because their money, despite their having more of it, will not purchase as much as before. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The expansion of credit is another underlying cause of inflation. It has the same effect as an increase in the money supply because it makes more money available to the people, which, in turn, increases the demand for goods. When supply is not keeping up with demand, prices rise. With rising prices unions press for wage increases that increase the operating costs of manufacturers. Faced with a profits squeeze, manufacturers raise still higher the prices of their goods, and workers, in turn, seek still higher wages to keep up with the rising prices of the goods they must buy, and so it goes. This is the wageprice spiral that results from the inflation caused by increasing the supply of money and by making credit easy to get.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Effect on Morals</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The effect of inflation upon many persons is to stimulate within them a love of money. Money's increasing availability accompanied with an increase of things that money can buy causes people to greedily grasp after money as if it were the only thing worth living for. Honesty and truth are thrown to the wind by many persons when confronted with an enticing opportunity to make a big profit. If it requires them to ride roughshod over other people, they will not hesitate to do it. Extreme selfishness governs their actions, crowding out any thought of neighbor love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But this attitude does not bring real happiness. Rather, it results in a spirit of competition that brings much heartache and trouble. It is just as God’s Word the Bible explains: “Those who are determined to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many senseless and hurtful desires, which plunge men into destruction and ruin. For the love of money is a root of all sorts of injurious things, and by reaching out for this love some have been led astray from the faith and have stabbed themselves all over with many pains.” —1 Tim. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All around can be seen the rotten fruitage that the love of money has produced. That it is indeed the root of injurious things is evident from the great number of crimes that are committed daily throughout the world in order to get money. It causes'people to act toward one another like savage beasts. Notice that the Bible foretold that this love of money would be a contributing factor to the present critical times. Pointing forward to our day, it said: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">will be lovers of themselves, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">lovers</span><span class="font1"> 0/ </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">money, . . . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">2 Tim. 3:1, 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How obvious that this is the situation today! That the inflationary boom has been largely responsible for the increased number of money lovers Henry Hazlitt, in his book </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What You Should Know About Inflation,</span><span class="font1"> noted: “Inflation tends to’demoralize those who gain by it even more than those who lose by it. . . . The spectacle of quick and easy returns increases the temptations to corruption and crime. It is not merely that inflation breeds the gambling spirit and corruption and dishonesty in a nation. Inflation is itself an immoral act on the part of government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So the person that has developed a love for money develops distorted values. He loses sight of moral and spiritual values that make life more meaningful and that can be a source of real happiness and contentment. Instead, he seeks happiness in material things and centers his life around money and the things that money can buy. But if he should lose his money or other material possessions, he is completely shattered. His materialistic world comes crashing down around him. Some persons have even committed suicide when this has happened.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>Money a Protection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">This does not mean that money is bad in itself. On the contrary, it serves a very useful function and can do a lot of good when it is properly used by people and wisely managed by the government that issues it. Explaining the value of money, the Bible says: “Wisdom is for a protection the same as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">money is for a protection; </span><span class="font1">but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom itself preserves alive its owners.” —Eccl. 7:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So money has its place. It can often help to protect a person from going hungry, from lacking adequate shelter and from being without sufficient clothing. It may be used to provide protection in the form of medical care. It is a means to obtain the many material necessities of life as well as to enjoy some material pleasures. So money is a friend when it is kept in its proper place and viewed properly. It is attaching too much importance to it, allowing the pursuit of it to eclipse spiritual values and to interfere with enjoying one's family and friends, that leads to trouble. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">love</span><span class="font1"> of money is what plunges men into destruction and ruin, not money itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Therefore, it is only the part of wisdom to use money in such a way that it will provide the greatest protection. Inflation, it is true, is constantly diminishing the buying power of money, but discreet buying can make it worth more than if care is not exercised in making purchases. Taking advantage of price reductions and out-of-season sales is a good method of getting the most for one’s money. But the way to gain the greatest protection from money is to resist the temptation to buy unneeded items. Cautious use of credit is also wise, for overextending oneself can lead to financial tragedy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark16"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark17"></a>Money's Protection Limited</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">There are now fears that in the United States credit expansion has reached dangerous proportions. Private debt has increased 530 percent in the last twenty years, and it and all other American debts total an astronomical $6,842 for every man, woman and child in the United States. A reversal in America’s economic expansion could be disastrous with such a burden of debt. Many people who now are heavily in debt would lose all the material things for which they had been living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That an economic reversal is not an impossibility, but under these conditions is even likely, economist Ludwig Von Mises, in the book </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Theory of Money and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Credit,</span><span class="font1"> observes: “Credit expansion initially can produce a boom. But such a boom is bound to end in a slump, in a depression.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the United States a deflationary economic collapse centered around the stock market wiped out many accumulated fortunes a few decades ago. With an inflationary economic collapse money could become practically worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It happened in Germany and China, Money’s worth is so uncertain. It is thus not the best protection, and for that reason Jesus Christ counseled: “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven . . . For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” —Matt. 6:19-21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To emphasize again the limited protection that money offers, Jesus told of a certain rich man who worked hard and stored up tremendous wealth and then said to himself: “ ‘Soul, you have many good things laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, enjoy yourself.’ But God said to him, 'Unreasonable one, this night they are demanding your soul from you. Who, then, is to have the things you stored up?’ So it goes with the man that lays up treasure for himself but is not rich toward God.”—Luke 12:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Think of it! All the money of the world’s richest men cannot preserve them alive to enjoy the blessings of life. It cannot even give them the health and peace of mind that are so important to happiness. The worth of money is really limited. The Bible’s counsel is therefore wise: For people “to rest their hope, not on uncertain riches, but on God, who furnishes us all things richly for our enjoyment; to work at good, to be rich in fine works, to be liberal, ready to share, safely treasuring up for themselves a fine foundation for the future, in order that they may get a firm hold on the real life.”—1 Tim. 6:17-19,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Building up a righteous standing with God, who is the Source of life and all good things, is the way to lay up safe treasures in heaven. It will assure you of “real life,” everlasting life in God’s new system of things; something no amount of money can buy. Illustrating the superior worth of wisdom, the Bible proverb says: “Happy is the man that has found wisdom, and the man that gets discernment, for having it as gain is better than having silver as gain and having it as produce than gold itself. It is a tree of life to those taking hold of it, and those keeping fast hold of it are to be called happy.&quot;—Prov. 3:13, 14, 18.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are comparatively few people today who appreciate that wisdom and the knowledge of God are of greater worth than money. But remember, the Bible foretold this very condition, saying: “In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">last days ..</span><span class="font1">. men will be ... lovers of money.” What a tragedy for those who trusted in money when the time soon comes for God to exercise his destructive power against this wicked system of things! At that time money will offer no protection, just as when God executed judgment against ancient Jerusalem. The Bible foretold this, saying: “Into the streets they will throw their very silver, and an abhorrent thing their own gold will become. Neither their silver nor their gold will be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s fury.” Then, not money, but 'wisdom itself will preserve alive its owners.’ —2 Tim. 3:1, 2; Ezek. 7:19.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">F</span><span class="font1">ROM all over the world come reports of the breakdown and disintegration of the family. Practically everywhere there are soaring divorce rates, desertions, infidelity, illegitimacy and, in particular, juvenile misbehavior. No longer do common interests unite family members, nor do moral standards restrain them. Each member often goes his own way with little regard for the feelings and welfare of others in the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Family Service Association of America called family breakdown “America’s number one social problem.” The deterioration of family life in Canada caused educator Dr. R. W. B. Jackson to predict: “It is quite possible that by 2014 the family may disappear as a unit of society, and other units based upon age groups and interests may take its place.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Does this seem an exaggeration? Is the problem really that serious? Has the family reached a crisis that may eventually lead to a radical change in its structure? What does the evidence indicate?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark18"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark19"></a>Family Breakdown World Wide</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">A New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1"> headline of July 30, 1965, read: “Johnson Discerns Crisis in Families.” The article said: “President</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Johnson declared today that the family unit had collapsed among an alarming number of Americans,... this fundamental in all sections of so</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ciety.” A look around reveals that the family is indeed breaking down!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No longer are marriage bonds held sacred. Why, in just the United States last year there were nearly 450,000 divorces, or an average of close to one divorce every minute! There is no question that marriage ties are weakening. Even in countries where divorce a short time ago was practically nonexistent it is now common. Poland, for example, had virtually no divorce before the second world war, but in 1950 the country had 11,000 divorces, and by last year the number had nearly doubled, to about 21,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Infidelity and premarital sex relations, once considered shocking, are now almost taken for granted by many. Noted one New York sociologist, Perry J. Gangloff: “There has been a real change in moral behavior. ... It is our opinion that infidelity is now taken as a matter of course.” In Britain a committee working in connection with the British Medical Association reported “that promiscuity had become fashionable during the last seven years.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This change in moral behavior is reflected in the avalanche of illegitimate births. In the United States nearly 250,000 babies are born to unwed mothers each year, which is twice the number reported for 1950 and three times what it was in 1940. In London, England, there were 8,835 illegitimate births in 1962, or about one illegitimacy for every seven births. But in Latin America illegitimacy rates are even higher. For example, a news dispatch from Venezuela reports that 49 percent of the children there are born to unwed mothers!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The breakdown of the family4s also reflected in the number of pregnant girls getting married. In Australia premarital pregnancies increased by 135 percent in the past twenty years. According to, another report, two out of three babies born to girls under twenty years of age in Britain are conceived out of wedlock. And in the United States one study showed that where both bride and groom were of high school age, more than four out of five brides were pregnant at the time of the wedding. A young girl from a small town in Pennsylvania explained: “I don’t think people are shocked by much of anything around here any more. The kids who don’t get pregnant, don't get married. It’s accepted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Throughout a major part of the world the situation is similar. The London </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sunday Times</span><span class="font1"> carried the following headline last year when reporting on an international conference dealing with family affairs: “46 Nations Share the Problem of Juvenile Sex.” The article noted: “There was general acceptance among most of the representatives of 46 countries attending, of premarital intercourse even among boys and girls in their early teens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A German delegate explained: “Through my clinic I have ceased to be shocked about anything. I accept that girls go to bed with boys either because it is the fashion or because they do not want to lose a friend. The problem we have to tackle is that 70 percent of our marriages are now due to pregnancy.” But gross misbehavior of youths is not limited to sexual immorality. This is evident by the fact that about 50 percent or an serious crimes in some countries are committed by youths under twenty-one years of age.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark20"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark21"></a>Why the Crisis?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">What is responsible for this shocking misbehavior of youth and for the disintegration of the family? Why at this time, when man has realized some of his greatest achievements, should this basic unit of civilization be facing a crisis? The answers to these often-asked questions are not as difficult to obtain as one might think. They are found in the Holy Bible, the one you have in your own home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In its opening chapters this inspired Book contains an accurate record concerning the origin of the human family. It explains in clear, easy-to-understand terms how God created the first man and woman, brought them together as husband and wife, and instructed them to bear children. The family is, therefore, a divine arrangement, being thought out and designed by God. Thus, for family life to be a blessing to its members, God’s instructions relative to its operation must be observed.—Genesis chapters 1 and 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But can it honestly be said that families today observe God’s instructions in directing their affairs? Do they seek the Bible’s counsel when difficulties arise? The answers. to such questions are only too obvious. The majority of persons ignore the Bible, considering its counsel out-of-date. And whether people are willing to admit it or not, it is this failure to heed the instruction of the One who originated the marriage arrangement that is responsible for the family crisis that millions now face.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not to be overlooked, too, is the fact that Almighty God foretold the present family crisis. Pointing forward to “the last days,&quot; His Word said: &quot;Men will be lovers of themselves,.. . haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">parents,.. . having no natural affection”</span><span class="font1"> (2 Tim. 3:1-3) These are the very conditions being experienced! The present-day fulfillment of Bible prophecies such as this one makes clear that we are living in “the last days*’ of this wicked system of things. It is a transition period; a wicked system is on its way out, soon to be replaced by God’s righteous new order of things. But in the meantime, how can families cope with these critical times?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Coping with the Crisis</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">It is only by going to God for instruction. In his Word the Bible he has provided the guidance and example man needs. As a husband or wife, do you find that difficulties sometimes arise that cause friction in your marriage? Then open your copy of the Bible and consider its wise advice. Turn, for example, to Ephesians chapter five. Note what it says in the way of counsel to wives:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord, because a husband is head of his wife as the Christ also is head of the congregation ... In fact, as the congregation is in subjection to the Christ, so let wives also be to their husbands in everything. . . . The wife should have deep respect for her husband.”—Eph. 5:22-24, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God originally created woman to be man’s helper, “as a complement of him.” (Gen. 2:18) He realized that in the close marriage union one party had to be vested with the authority of making decisions and directing family affairs. And a wife who is honest with herself will admit that she was not designed for this role, but that her husband was. So by heeding God’s wise counsel, subjecting herself to her husband even as the Christian congregation does to Christ, a wife will find real contentment and satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But to assure happiness, husbands, too, must apply God’s instructions. Notice in this same chapter of Ephesians the fine counsel the Bible gives to them: “Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and delivered up himself for it ... In this way husbands ought to be loving their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself, for no man ever hated his own flesh; but he feeds and cherishes it, as the Christ also does the congregation . , . let each one of you individually so love his wife as he does himself.”—Eph. 5:25-29, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Humans naturally seek their own bodily comfort, cherishing and feeding themselves. The Bible says that husbands should exhibit this same consideration for their wives, copying the perfect example that Jesus set in demonstrating love for his congregation of followers. A husband can do this by showing respect for his wife’s feelings and wishes, even as he does his own. He can also demonstrate love by taking an interest in the things his wife does around the house, and by complimenting her and expressing appreciation. God's counsel to husbands and wives is indeed practical!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, to avoid trouble in the family the children, too, must be raised properly. The One who designed the family also gave instruction on how this should be done. Turn in your Bible to Deuteronomy chapter six, verses six and seven, and observe carefully what God said on the matter: “These words that I am commanding you today must prove to be on your heart; and you must inculcate them in your son and speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">' Did you notice how parents are to guard their children from wrongdoing? It is by regularly teaching them God’s Word. Yes, by inculcating in them the righteous principles found in the Bible. And who is to take the lead in giving this instruction? God’s Word says: “You, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fathers,</span><span class="font1"> dp not be irritating your children, but go oh bringing them up in the discipline and authoritative advice of Jehovah.” (Eph. 6:4) Failure to heed these clear, easy-to-understand instructions has led to a crisis in family life. It is just as the Bible warned: “The rod and reproof are what give wisdom; but a boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame.”—Prov. 29:15.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Bible Counsel in Operation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">That God’s counsel is just as practical today as when it was recorded is being demonstrated by hundreds of thousands of families the world over. They are following God’s instructions, and this draws them together in love for one another and love for God. When the wife is in subjection to her husband, and the husband shows love for his wife, and when both of them work together to train their children, the family is not threatened by a crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Consider, for example, such a family in Brooklyn, New York, where crime and delinquency are probably as bad as anywhere in the world. In this particular family the father takes the lead in seeing that his wife and five school-age children are provided not only with necessary physical food but also with instruction from God’s Word the Bible. The evening meal, for instance, is a regular time of happy fellowship and instruction. How so?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Well, first of all, before eating, thanksgiving is expressed to God. It is not a mechanical prayer, but is a sincere expression that impresses upon the children that the family is dependent upon God for the good things of life. During the meal the children are encouraged to express themselves regarding what they learned at school or things they have done. Often the father will review the family, usually in connection with a Bible text that they have previously discussed. The children enjoy this, and sometimes will come to the table prepared in advance for such a quiz from dad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This family also sets aside time at least one evening a week when they read the Bible together. On these occasions opportunities are afforded to impress upon the children the value of living morally upright lives, and the importance of cultivating qualities such as honesty, integrity, loyalty and truthfulness. On other evenings games are played, or sometimes the parents teach their children practical arts. Hie mother has already taught each child, from the youngest, the ten-year-old girl, to the oldest, the seventeen-year-old boy, how to iron his clothes and sew them, as well as how to bake and cook. The result Of taking such a genuine interest in their children has been a close and happy family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When God long ago said that parents should teach their children when they 'sit in the house,’ ‘walk on the road,’ ‘lie down,’ and ‘get up,’ He knew that this interest and concern would unite the family. He also knew that in time the fruitage of such instruction would be upright, integritykeeping citizens, an honor both to their parents and to God. When Bible instructions are heeded the family is indeed a blessed arrangement that brings joy and satisfaction to everyone concerned!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">True, family life now faces a crisis, and worldly experts are in a quandary as to what to do. But present world conditions will not always be this way. In fact, family breakdown is part of the sign that indicates that this wicked system of things will soon be destroyed by God, to be replaced by His righteous ’new order of things. Only families that apply God's instructions will then remain. O what a happy time that will be! Never again will divorce, immorality or juvenile delinquency cause a family crisis.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">A newspaper editor similarly observed: “We live these days in a world where the prime motive of men seems to be strife, hatred and suspicion. There seem to be few places in the world where men are content to live in peace. Democracy hates Communism and vice versa and both sides are willing to bankrupt the world and risk world catastrophe to come out on top —if there is a top. . . . the fury of racism rages on two continents with both sides doing everything possible to infuriate each other. . . . Even the top scientists of our day are busy creating new weapons to blow the world to pieces faster.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These pointed comments on world turmoil were made several years ago. At that time tensions were not as pronounced as they are now. Today, in 1965, the international situation has reached the explosive stageI</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Areas of Strife Abound</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1"> partial survey of danger spots in the world verifies the fact of widespread and increasing world trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Middle East, for example, tensions steadily mount. Many experienced</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">statesmen see no way out except bloodshed. One .^writer who interviewed men in authority through-out this area stated: ‘Twice I have asked Nasser personally if he sees any hope for a peaceful settlement with Israel. Both times he answered with one word ‘No.’ I got the same answer from Jordan’s King Hussein. Within the last month I have asked Arab and Israeli cabinet ministers, American diplomats and U.N. officials in the Middle East if there is any hope of real peace. Invariably they answered, ‘Of course not. . . absolutely not . . , certainly not.’ ”—</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life, </span><span class="font1">June 18, 1965.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the same area, on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, another critical situation continues to smolder. Greeks and Turks oppose each other, with no solution in sight acceptable to both. Of this highly dangerous situation and of the Israeli crisis, the Vancouver, Canada, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Province</span><span class="font1"> of February 12, 1965, said: “When two races hate one another the way Turks hate Greeks and Arabs hate Jews, the breach cannot be repaired in a single generation. And meantime, someone else has to be employed to keep them apart. This is the sad tale, in synopsis, of the excessively-troubled Middle East today. No easy solution is in sight to end the bitterness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Farther eastward India and Pakistan continue to shed blood over disputed Kashmir and over the area known as the Rann of Kutch. Each claims the other infringes on her territory. Of the Kashmir dispute an editorial entitled “Tension in Kashmir,” printed in the New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1"> of June 22, 1965, noted: “So long as the subcontinent is divided between India and Pakistan, Kashmir will be a source of contention. Moreover, it involves that always dangerous communal problem—the relations between Moslem and Hindu. . .. The problem has thus far proved insoluble. Neither side will budge.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Added to India’s troubles is the fact that in late 1962 her armies were pounded by large Chinese Communist forces, which swiftly sliced through disputed border areas. These Chinese armies, still poised in the Himalayan mountains, remain a constant threat, causing India to divert much needed resources from critical domestic projects in order to build her military machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Congo, rebellion continues to simmer. In Korea armed camps stare uneasily across the truce line. Berlin provides a continuing source of tension. The Dominican Republic crisis, where United States armed forces intervened to help quell what many viewed as a popular uprising against an unpopular government, has added tensions to the entire Western Hemisphere. Also in that part of the world the animosity between Cuba and the United States continues as a painful open sore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Alliances and partnerships that seemed to provide security in the past have recently begun to break down. NATO, SEATO and CENTO have received stunning setbacks, severely limiting their effectiveness. The Common Market in Europe has been staggered by the opposition of France’s Charles de Gaulle, who strongly disagrees with some of the group’s policies. Even the Communist “bloc&quot; of nations has been rent with tension-producing divisions.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Aslan Tension Explodes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The gravest tension spot, one threatening to engulf mankind in world war, exists in Asia. The implications of this crisis make thinking men shudder as the safety of mankind is jeopardized more each passing day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not just a “cold war,” but a “hot war” rages in Vietnam. This bitter and ugly conflict grows in intensity daily. The United States escalates its commitment in men and material to back the South Vietnamese succession of governments. Tens of thousands of American troops have already poured into that war-ravaged land, and many more, perhaps hundreds of thousands, are to be sent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Communist-backed forces, called the Viet Cong by Westerners, receive assistance from North Vietnam and also from Communist China, which country looms ominously to the north with her vast resource of manpower, having a population of about 700,000,000, and which now possesses the atomic bomb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As both sides continue to pour in additional men and equipment, the situation builds toward a disastrous showdown. Already thousands of lives have been sacrificed and, as United States President Johnson declared, the conflict &quot;will get worse before it gets better,”—New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times, </span><span class="font1">July 11, 1965.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>United Nations Role</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Is there not a means for settling world disputes such as the critical one in Vietnam? Has not the United Nations, with a membership of 114 countries, been designed to lessen such tensions? In theory, yes, but in actual practice the United Nations today finds itself rendered practically useless as an agency for settling world crises. More and more the tendency is for nations to ignore the United Nations and to use their own means of solving problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Due to this tendency U.N. Secretary-General U Thant warned: “The world organization will turn into a debating society if its slow progress toward stability and world peace is further reversed.” He said that events in 1965 have “tended to undermine the position of the U.N. as the primary agency for maintaining international peace.”—New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sunday News,</span><span class="font1"> May 23, 1965.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Bible Explains Rising Tensions</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">It is admitted that the efforts of men and nations to stem the rising tide of tension are failing. What, then, does the future hold? What are the prospects of such tensions easing, of peace and stability returning to the world? Indeed, why is such trouble upon us in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When we turn to the opinions of world leaders and other prominent men for answers to these vital questions, there is no agreement. This should make the Godfearing person realize that he has reached a human limitation: man cannot foretell the future, nor explain why the best of efforts fail. To determine accurately what the reasons are for world tension and what the future really holds, one must turn to the only source that provides such answers, a source most people have right in their own homes, the Holy Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again and again the Bible’s remarkable foretelling of international events stamps it as above human origin, as the product of a mind far superior to man’s. This is so because its author is man’s Creator, Jehovah God. God inspired holy men to record in the Bible his will and purposes, as well as much history written in advance. This he did so that those fearing him could always be informed of the meaning behind world events. It is also true of our day. The Bible has recorded in advance details of current history, of current world tensions, so that godly persons would know why such difficult times were upon them and what the outcome would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of our day the Bible, in amazing detail, tells us: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, disloyal, having no natural affection, not open to any agreement, slanderers, without selfcontrol, fierce, without love of goodness, betrayers, headstrong, puffed up with pride, lovers of pleasures rather than lovers of God.”—2 Tim. 3:1-4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What an accurate description of presentday world woes! But will such trying times subside in the immediate future? No, for those who produce them “will advance from bad to worse,” the Bible foretells. (2 Tim. 3:13) This means that shortly world tensions will reach a critical point never before experienced in human history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">. The Bible also explains why this is so. It is because God’s great adversary is nearing his end and is doing all he can either to rule the earth or to ruin it. This adversary is the rebellious spirit creature Satan the Devil. For 6,000 years he has plagued mankind, but much more so in these “last days.” With reference to these times we are told: “Down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. . . . Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, having great anger, knowing he has a short period of time.” —Rev. 12:9, 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, at the beginning of these “last days” Satan and his demon angels were cast out of their heavenly habitation down to the vicinity of the earth. He knows that action means his near end. That is the real reason behind mounting world tensions. Satan and his demon hordes are nearing the end of the time allotted to them by God, as is Satan’s entire system of things, so he is intent on stirring up world chaos at an accelerated pace. That is </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">just what is</span><span class="font1"> talcing place today?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We cannot escape it. We live in the “last days,’’ not of humankind, but of this wicked system of things, as Jesus Christ foretold so clearly. (Matthew chapter 24, Mark chapter 13, Luke chapter 21) History verifies that our generation is indeed an unusual one in history. The New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times Magazine</span><span class="font1"> of May 2, 1965, reported: “Most historians now agree that the 19th century came to its end a little later than the calendar prescribed. It was not the organized festivities of 1900 but rather the organized hostilities of 1914 that decisively concluded a chapter in human history. . .. Then came the deluge and bloodbath.” Yes, it was the year 1914, with its World War I, that opened these blood-drenched, chaotic and tension-filled “last days” foretold by Jesus and the inspired Bible writers.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>When Tensions Will End</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The “last days” or “time of the end” means just that. It does not mean an indefinitely prolonged period of tension and paint It means a very definitely limited period of time, with a clear beginning, 1914, and a clear end. You should be thrilled to know that the end of these “last days” is positively in sight! As Jesus foretold at Matthew 24:34, it will be in “this generation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So while world tensions will mount, they will quickly reach their peak, at which time Jehovah God, the Creator of man and earth, will assert his almighty power and bring to an end all world tension and all those causing^it, both men and devils. His firm promise is: “The wicked ones he will annihilate.”—Ps. 145:20; Rev. 20:1-3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This annihilation of wickedness and wicked ones by an act of God will not be turned aside or slowed down. It comes on apace. At that time God will bring this system of things to its end and will replace it with the one, universal government he has promised in his Word. That government is his kingdom, to be ruled over by a tried, proved, just and loving king, Jesus Christ, in heavenly glory, beyond influence or corruption by any earthling. It is this marvelous government that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">will bring such </span><span class="font1">great benefits to all mankind under its rule that Jesus taught us to pray for when he said: “Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.”—Matt. 6:9, 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Never again will earth’s rulership be given back into the hands of selfish men, for “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom [in heaven under Christ] that will never be brought to ruin. And the kingdom itself will not be passed on to any other people. It will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms, and it itself will stand to times indefinite.”—Dan. 2:44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When that kingdom crushes all earthly opposition shortly, those who respect God and his Word will be preserved alive right through that time of desolation. The Bible promises: “The righteous themselves will possess the earth, and they will reside forever upon it.” (Ps. 37:29) Under the rule of God’s kingdom all tensions will forever disappear. Mankind will pass from one refreshing and upbuilding experience to another, throughout eternity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Until the time that God brings an end to tension, it will continue to build to its climax. So will the accompanying crime and violence. Hence, it means that sensible persons will want to give consideration to what they can do to protect themselves in such dangerous times.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">HEN an earthquake ripped through Chile in April of this year, it demolished two earthen dams above the village of El Cobre, releasing a wall of water that quickly buried the village and its inhabitants under a thick layer of mud. The shock and anguish of the survivors who dug frantically for their buried families is a common feature of great earthquakes. It can be seen wherever they strike in the world. In a matter of seconds they transform towns and cities into heaps of tangled ruins, burying hundreds of people and making thousands of stunned survivors homeless. Bringing terror and grief, they leave an impression that is not easily erased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The power of great earthquakes is astonishing, making man feel utterly helpless and extremely insignificant. The great earthquake that staggered Alaska in 1964 unleashed 400</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">During the past fifty years the frequency of destructive earthquakes of great size has been</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">most distressing for mankind. In 1920 the Kansu province of China was hit by a quake that snuffed out at least 180,000 lives in the first of ,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">three shocks; Chinese statistics claim casualties of one million. In 1923 Tokyo, Japan, , was shaken by a major quake that caused the deaths of 143,000 people and property damage amounting to four and a half billion dollars. In 1935 a great quake in Quetta,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">India, took the lives of 60,000 people. In 1939 Erzingan, Turkey, was hit, with 23,000 ; persons dying. Mountains were ripped to pieces in Assam, India, in 1950 when it was jolted by the second-most-viol ent quake to be parts of the earth. Commenting on their frequency, the magazine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American </span><span class="font1">said in its issue of September 1950: “Major quakes used to occur in clusters, each period of activity being followed by a rest period. Since 1948, the pattern has entered a new phase, with approximately one great quake a year,”</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font1">recorded. It reached 8.6 on the Gutenberg-Richter scale used by seismologists.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font1">And so the record continues, with great we are on the threshold of a new system of earthquakes repeatedly striking in various things of God’s making.—Luke 21:28.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font1">Since 1960 major earthquakes have averaged more than one a year. Chile was hit by four major shocks in 1960, killing 5,700 persons. Another great quake shattered Agadir, Morocco, the same year, bringing death to 12,000 persons. Two years later Iran was jolted by a major quake that killed at least 10,000 persons. Skopje, Yugoslavia, shuddered under the blow of a great quake in 1963 that destroyed four-fifths of the city. In the same year a devastating series of quakes leveled 80 percent of the Libyan town of El Marj, killing 300 persons and injuring 500.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The third-greatest quake recorded in the past sixty years is the one that rocked Alaska in 1964, registering 8.4 on the Richter scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another hit Taiwan the same year, the worst in twenty years for that country. In 1965, the quake that hit El Cobre and other towns in Chile caused damage estimated at $200 million. Later io May another major quake shook San Salvador in El Salvador, doing a great amount of damage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Along with other troubles of great magnitude that have struck this generation since 1914, these frequent earthquakes of major size</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">W</span><span class="font1">E LIVE in a world where theft, rape and assault at the hands of criminals, delinquents and perverts are dstily occurrences. Far from being a problem limited to one nation, this has caused law-abiding citizens the world over to fear what the future will bring in the way of crime and violence. In one world capital the population has increased 5 percent in seven years, but the number of crimes committed annually has soared 137 percent. People wonder what they can do to protect themselves and their families from lawbreaking and assault.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fear has motivated many persons to irm themselves with pistols, knives, small :ear-gas guns and other weapons. They isually conceal these on their person, ready for use if needed. However, such veapons have serious drawbacks. In many □laces concealed weapons are illegal. Even where they are lawful, the use of these devices by an amateur is risky, often proving to be more dangerous to the user arid innocent bystanders than to the attacker. And there is always the danger that persons possessing such weapons will use them in a moment of excitement or anger and cause injury or death needlessly. This is not to say, though, that there is nothing persons can do to protect themselves amidst these worsening world conditions. There are some basic and. practical suggestions for self-protection that can prove invaluable to people of all ages, living in all parts of the world, especially where the crime rate is high.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>Sound Advice for Self-Protection</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Of much greater value than weapons for self-protection are </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">good sense</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">reasonable-</span><span class="font1">ness and </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">foresight</span><span class="font1"> Many attacks and ’robberies could have been avoided if the victims had taken the precaution of using vwiyighte^ ally crime does not flourish in the light Before you walk down a street or corridor in a dangerous locality, check to see if it is sufficiently lighted. If not, is there another way you could go, even though it might take a few minutes longer? Those few extra minutes taken so as to travel in the light and out of the darkness and shadows could mean the difference bet-tween your being attacked and your arriving at your destination safely. Many crimes are committed at night, so if you can avoid it, you may find that it is best </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">not to be out late by yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If at all possible</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">^have a companion</span><span class="font1"> wher you go out at night, or at any time of the day when you'go through areas known to abound in crime and violence. </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Avoid </span><span class="font1">groups loitering on sidewalks and suspi-cious individuals lurking in doorways or in the shadows close to buildings, even crossing the street if necessary to keep clear of the danger. If you must go to a dangerous section of town alone, it may prove to be a protection if you Identify yourself, as in the case of a Christian minister’s carrying a Bible in his hand. In view of world conditions, to become careless about these matters is to invite disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Forethought can be exercised in the matter of dress. What image will you create if you travel a crime-ridden area in your best clothing? If your clothing attracts attention, would it be surprising for a thief to conclude that you are a source of easy money? Similarly, the wise person does not vainly parade his wealth when he opens his wallet. Women, too, should bear in mind that modest attire lessens the likelihood of sexual assault. A woman can be sure that sensual clothing that is designed to reveal and excite will do just that to depraved criminals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Good sense also suggests that one avoid irritating people. When walking down the street or when traveling on trains and buses, do not stare at people. Often fugitives, the mentally deranged and people under the influence of stimulants become nervous and dangerous when other individuals gaze at them. The sound Biblical advice is: &quot;Make it your aim to live quietly and to mind your own business.” (1 Thess. 4:11) Also, try not to antagonize people by what you say, be they drunkards, beggars or thrill-seeking youths. If you must speak, remember the Bible’s counsel: “An answer, when mild, turns away rage, but a word causing pain makes anger to come up.” It further advises, “be gentle toward all.”—Prov. 15:1; 2 Tim. 2:24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As crime does not thrive in the light, so too it is often thwarted by noise. Police officials advise that when assault victims make a commotion, assailants usually flee, since the last thing they want is to have attention called to their dastardly deeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some people carry a police whistle for this purpose. Others take advantage of the protection that a dog may provide inside and outside the home. This has little to do with how ferocious the dog appears. The excited yaps of a little poodle may draw as much attention as the barks of a German shepherd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Women, when threatened with rape, should remember to scream. In fact, a basic rule for women confronted with this situation could be simply stated: Scream, and keep on screaming! Even under the Mosaic law it was acknowledged that a woman who really wanted to resist an assault would scream, (Deut. 22:23-27) Remember, noise is an effective defensive weapon.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>The Power of Speech and Prayer</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The voice can also be used in another way. In some situations persons have been able to reason with their would-be assailants. Recently two young women were in an automatic laundry when a man came in and herded them at gunpoint into a room in the rear of the building. He ordered them to undress. They refused, praying aloud to Jehovah God for help. Finally they told the now-confused gunman that they were Jehovah’s witnesses and that it was against their religious belief to do what he was demanding; they would not do it even if he shot them. Result? The frustrated gunman fled from the two courageous women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When material possessions are threatened by a bandit or gunman, people react in different ways. Some resist and are successful; others, when resisting, are killed. The Christian whose life is dedicated to Jehovah realizes that his valuables cannot compare with the importance of his health and life. Material possessions, he may well reason Biblically, are not worth one’s having to be taken to the hospital or to the cemetery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One Christian minister was confronted with a man who drew a knife on him. “Give me your money/<sup>1</sup> the bandit demanded. “I’ll be glad to/’ said the minister, handing over his wallet, “but I have something far more valuable than money tor you.” “What’s that?” “I have words of everlasting life.” The minister then slowly began to talk to the robber about God’s promise for a better system of things. Amazed, the criminal apologized and returned the stolen wallet. Unafraid, the minister made arrangements to visit the man, and in time a Bible study was* started with him in his home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many times the sight of a Bible or even a Bible-study aid will dissuade a robber, Christians should not be afraid to talk about Jehovah and his Word to those who seek to do wrong.—Prov. 18:10.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Protection for Children</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">As important as self-protection is to most parents so is the urgent need to provide proper direction and protection for their children. When violence comes to youngsters, it is often from depraved sex deviates. Many parents appreciate that the prevention of sex crimes against their children begins with proper forewarning of them at home. Dr. Fredric Wertham, psychiatrist and expert on the psychology of violence, said: “Many of our most brutal crimes could have been so simply prevented—if only their child victims had been taught to beware of elementary dangers. The dangers of lonely places, of men and boys who showed signs of molesting them. Many parents are reluctant to give this kind of instruction to children, but today it is negligent to omit it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible commands parents to ‘train up a child according to the way for him.’ (Prov. 22:6) Current world conditions necessitate that child training include warnings as to the physical dangers that exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Wise parents caution their children against going off with strangers without receiving the consent of their parents, especially when offered bribes of money or candy. Some parents have instituted the “underno-circumstance” rule. Following it, their children would under no circumstance accept rides from strangers or enter a stranger’s house without first asking permission from their father or mother. When explaining these matters to your children, even if it is when they are just four or five years of age, it is wise not to frighten them, but let them know that allowing older men or boys to fondle and pet them can lead to wrong familiarity and even to physical hurt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Show your children that this is a serious matter, possibly asking them questions as to what they would do under certain circumstances and allowing them opportunity to question you as to the reason such caution is necessary. Then you can follow up your instructions by exercising care as to the whereabouts of your children, making sure that, even when they are playing, they are with others. In the matter of protecting them from crime and violence, much will depend on the instruction and oversight you provide.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark42"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark43"></a>The Home and Automobile</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Protection for the family also involves making sure that they are safe when they are at home. It has been said that the key to your safety may well be the one that works the lock on your door, or the chain that keeps the door from swinging open. Where crime is prevalent, many find it wise to secure their house or apartment with reliable locks on all doors and windows, including those leading to their basement, locks that cannot be opened with a simple playing card or screwdriver. When moving into a different home, many persons have the old locks replaced; and when getting new keys made, they see that no duplicates are made that can be used by unauthorized persons to gain entrance to their home. Before allowing someone admittance into your home, have the person <sup>1 </sup>identify himself. Jesus advised Christians to be “cautious as serpents and yet innocent as doves,” and by extension this principle could apply to safeguarding one's home and family.—Matt. 10:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Added protection can be obtained by taking simple precautions to discourage robbery or sexual attack. If you have your drapes, curtains or shades drawn at night when disrobing, you will block the view of any roving eyes. Additionally, thieves travel about at night looking for unlighted houses or ones that give signs that the residents are not at home. By leaving a lamp lit or a radio playing when you go out for the evening, you can give the impression that the house is occupied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It would also be the course of wisdom in certain areas to take some protective steps when you are in an automobile. One safety measure that can easily be used when traveling in dangerous or unfamiliar areas is to have the doors locked so they cannot be opened from the outside and the windows closed or rolled up far enough to prevent anyone from reaching through an open window and grabbing one of the occupants. Men have been known to enter cars waiting for a traffic light. If anyone approaches your car menacingly, put the car in motion as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When parking your automobile, do not leave valuables or clothing on the seats. These items should be put in the glove compartment, trunk or some place where they are protected from searching eyes. Leaving the automobile parked in a well-lighted area also serves as a discouragement to thieves and decreases the possibility of your being attacked when entering or leaving it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even though these sensible precautions are needed, it is not healthy to live in constant dread of attack that can keep people in nervous, fearful seclusion. Balanced per sons are cautious and follow reasonabl safety measures, but at the same time th°' continue to live active lives. They will thu ‘let their reasonableness become knowi to all men.’—Phil. 4:5.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>What Does the Future Hold?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">But some may ask, Will crime and violence continue to darken our lives indefinitely? If we understand the basic cause of the turbulent world conditions, the darkness of the future will disappear. The rising tide of crime and violence is part of the “increasing of lawlessness,” which Jesus Christ foretold as one of the evidences that would identify the “last days” with its “critical times hard to deal with.” (Matt. 24:12; 2 Tim. 3:1) Even though the crime rate increases for a while longer, we have God’s guarantee that He will shortly institute a righteous system of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In that perfect new order under God’s kingdom we will not have to worry about criminals and assailants, for God will allow only law-abiding persons to remain alive. Jehovah will direct earth’s affairs by means of his King, Jesus Christ, and “righteousness is what the inhabitants of the productive land will certainly learn.” Locks will be a thing of the past. Young and old will live together in peace and security. Children will play outside with no fear of being molested. The extent of the peace and safety is indicated by the promise that a little boy will be able to play even with lions and leopards. Yes, God assures us, “They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea.”—Isa. </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">26:9; 11:6-9.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">L</span><span class="font1">OSS of faith is growing—loss of faith in God, loss of faith in the Bible, loss of faith in the churches. ^Though many still profess belief in God and in the Bible and even belong to a church, their faith is minimal and hardly affects their daily life. Many persons are putting more 'faith in science than in religion. Historians who disagree on many other points agree that the influence of the churches today is less than in the memory of any living man. Take a look at the widespread loss of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From South Africa comes this report: “The empty church is the evil symptom of degeneration in our time.*’<sup>1</sup> In North America religion’s loss of influence is reflected by a shortage of clergymen, with seminary rolls declining, as youths see less church influence. “Nobody pays much attention to ministers any more,”<sup>2</sup> is the blunt comment of a thirty-two-year-old man, trained at a seminary but who now chooses to work at a steel mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Turning to Europe, one finds virtually empty churches, with general religious apathy. Thus after American cleric Norman Vincent Peale visited Europe, he wrote: “It appears that church-going and religious practice are in decline.... In England, for example, one clergyman told me he had not seen a full church on a Sunday in years, or for that matter *a halffull church either,’ he glumly added. . . . Going across Protestant England to Catholic France and Italy one becomes aware that churches, especially old ones, have become more like historical monuments, you might say, rather than vital spiritual influences.”®</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Italian magazine </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ABC</span><span class="font1"> confirms that impression by reporting that the number of Catholics who adhere to the prescribed religious functions are few: “One or two percent at the most of the obligated ones adhere to a rigorous observance. This decline of religion affects all Christian countries, and it is not the prerogative of just the Catholic countries. . , . The Churches are being deserted.”<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the churches being deserted, it is not surprising that in Germany the newspaper </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Die Welt (The World)</span><span class="font1"> published an article saying: “Liberal sociologists such as orthodox clergymen speak quite openly of a general fading away of faith.”<sup>5</sup> Smail wonder German philosopher Gerhard Sce-czesny declared: “One good salesman . . . might well be capable of converting the European masses to Islam.”<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Viewing the world religious scene, Rabbi Arthur Lelyveld, a leader of the Jewish Reconstructionist movement, declared: “Religion is simply no longer an effective force in our society.”<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Why this loss of faith and church influence throughout the world?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>Churchmen Find Churches to Blame</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">As clergymen admit, the cause of this loss of faith lies largely with the churches themselves. Thus, in Germany, a booklet published by the Office of the Lutheran Church in Kurhessen-Waldeck, Cassel, said: “The majority of our people are members of the Church, but are really unbelievers. . . . Church services have offered them stones instead of bread.... The spark of faith perhaps still alive in them has been smothered by their association with the Church.”<sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Scandinavia the loss of faith is reflected by the words of Danish Dean Nepper-Christensen, who is quoted as saying at an annual meeting of the Church Alliance: “The churches stand more or less empty. . . . The message of the church leaves the people cold.”<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And in lands where churches still have many members, churchmen question the conviction of their members. Recently </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Time</span><span class="font1"> magazine commented that 65,000,000 Americans claim to be Protestants, explaining: “Ministers fear that their congregations are no more committed to the church than to the country club.”<sup>lu</sup> And why is this? Because the churches have become in effect glorified social clubs, as admitted by E. Digby Baltzell, author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Protestant Establishment:</span><span class="font1"> “We, especially men and college graduates, are realizing that the church and synagogue are becoming places to meet rather than places of worship. It is, therefore, religious institutions and their leaders who are doing most to drive religion out of American life.”<sup>11</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rather than the Bible being at fault for this loss of faith, it is the churches themselves. But why are church leaders being accused of ’smothering faith’? Why are the churches not building faith in God?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Clergy Undermine Faith in Bible</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Foremost among the reasons for the loss of faith is the clergy’s downgrading of the Bible and substituting for it conflicting human philosophies. When religious leaders teach that many of the Bible’s accounts are myths, is it any wonder that loss of faith follows? Religious leaders have watered down Bible teaching with evolution, psychology and tradition. In fact, in Australia a church authority said “Anglican tradition” was replacing Scripture as doctrine in the Church of England.<sup>12</sup> Because they have got so far away from the Bible, many no longer look upon the clergy as men of God, as those teaching God’s Word,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some say that they have lost faith because the Bible is not modern and that the message of the churches leaves them cold. But what are the real facts ? That the clergy, in order to please modern man, have “modernized” their message by psychology, by adding evolution and other stories and by discarding Bible prophecies and other Bible accounts they consider ‘myths.’ It is this “modernized” message that leaves the people cold! It has no spiritual strength, no healthful teaching to build faith; it is “stones instead of bread.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This very situation was foretold in a prophecy contained in the Bible at 2 Timothy 4:3, 4: “There will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This prophecy foretold that religious leaders would turn people away from the healthful teachings of the Bible, to ‘false stories,’ to tickle people’s ears with soothing words. The ear-tickling of modern religious teaching cannot build up faith, for it is not firmly based on the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Moreover, the clergy have not applied Bible knowledge themselves; as a result they are often not an example of morality; and they do not firmly insist on strict morality by their parishioners. Yet the blame for loss of faith does not lie entirely at the doorstep of the clergy, for the laity have wanted it this way.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Parishioners Share Blame</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Bible prophecy indeed foretold that the time would come when the masses &quot;will not put up with the healthful teaching.&quot; This is according to their “own desires.&quot; Why do they desire to disregard the Bible? Because the Bible interferes with their own selfish desires and because it condemns their pride, their materialism, their fornication and adultery and other works of the flesh. If they professed to follow the Bible, they would be condemning themselves, for the Bible condemns what they are doing.—Gal. 5:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Furthermore, the great Prophet, Jesus Christ, pointing forward* to the “last days,” foretold: “Because of the increasing of lawlessness the love of the greater number will cool off.” (Matt. 24:12) Note that “the love of the greater number” of those professing love for God will cool off. Millions of professed Christians have shown increased lawlessness and lovelessness, along with the fading of their faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The result is, as the Bible foretold for the “last days,” men have turned bitter and cold and many have only “a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power.” (2 Tim. 3:1-5) In other words, their religion proves to be powerless as far as bringing forth true Christian fruitage. Many even profess a “form of godly devotion,” yet, as foretold for the “last days,” they ridicule the evidence. This also is &quot;according to their own desires.&quot; —2 Pet. 3:3, 4; Matt. 24:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because the people in general have wanted it this way, the laity share with the clergy in this loss of faith. They have been turned all too willingly from the Bible to worldly thinking and ways.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Worldliness of Churches</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>and Parishioners</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Small wonder that many have lost faith and even turned atheistic! For both clergy and parishioners have become as much a part of this world as its politics and wars are; and this has repelled many. Did not Jesus Christ say of his true followers: “They are no part of the world, just as I am no part of the world”? Yes, he did! (John 17:16) But today church members do not stand out morally or spiritually in a community. They are like everybody else, because they have gone worldly. The Houston </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font1"> of June 1,1965, for example, reported on a scholar’s analysis of more than a thousand pages of reports by religious leaders:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“Southern Baptists were told that their denomination was in a state of decay. . . . The giant 10.6-million member denomination, along with the United States, were compared to ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and Sodom and Gomorrah by a seminary scholar, Dr. William Walter Adams of New Orleans. ... He said that secularism, worldliness and the loss of Christian conviction have caused decay among Baptists.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Observe that this seminary scholar speaks of “worldliness and the loss of Christian conviction.” They go together, for worldliness leads to loss of faith, even to enmity with Almighty God. (Jas. 4:4) The worldly churches and their members could not have God’s blessing, for His own Word requires of true Christians that they be “without spot from the world.”—Jas. 1:27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the clergy and their adherents have spotted themselves all over by worldly thinking and by getting embroiled in political issues of the day, even in the bloodiest wars of history. Concerning World War I, one magazine report said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“This war was incubated in the heart of what used to be called Christendom, among peoples with the longest history of organized Christian faith ... the armies of 1914 were composed of Catholics, Protestants and Jews in roughly equal numbers on both sides. Equally acclaimed, or disregarded, on both sides were the teachings of the Hebrew prophets and of Christ Himself. Disdain of religious precepts, it is noted, became even more pronounced in the second [world] war. . . . The result, as seen by historians with a world perspective, has been a pronounced weakening in the fiber of religious faith.”<sup>ia</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, as candid historians see it: The clergy and their parishioners have made themselves a part of this faithless world, its politics, its wars, Catholic killing Catholic, Protestant killing Protestant, and so forth. How could such worldliness result in anything but a colossal loss of faith? Those who read the Bible can see for themselves that the clergy and the church members are ignoring the teachings of Jesus Christ. They cannot help but lose faith in such worldly religion, which is so unlike Jesus Christ and the early Christians, who were “no part of the world.”—John 17:16.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Flee Worldly Churches,</span><br><br><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark59"></a>Wqrldly Thinking</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">So before our eyes are the very conditions foretold in the Bible for the “last days” as evidence that we are in “the conclusion of the system of things.” We see the man-pleasing clergy, the laity that desire to have their ears tickled and who profess only “a form of godly devotion” and who prefer to close their mind to the evidence of the “last days.” We see the foretold increasing of lawlessness and of lovelessness among mankind. Yes, all this is foretold by God!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible also tells us what course to take: Break free from the worldly religious systems that are so much a “part of the world.” For how can you remain with such organizations that have turned worldly and expect to have faith, since you would be ignoring the very teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ? Turn away, then, from what the Bible symbolically calls “Babylon the Great,” the world empire of false religion. Flee out of it, in obedience to the Bible’s command: “Get out of her, my people, if you do not want to share with her in her sins, and if you do not want to receive part of her plagues.” —Rev. 18:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Specially urgent is it that you flee worldly religion now before Bible prophecy concerning the destruction of false religion is fulfilled. The Bible foretells how the political powers will turn against “Babylon the Great,” destroying it utterly. Already we can see evidence of antireligious elements at work in parts of the world. So before God causes this prophecy to be fulfilled, flee “Babylon the Great”!—Rev. 17: 5, 16, 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">World conditions, including the loss of faith, indeed prove we are in the “last days.” So flee from both the worldly churches and worldly thinking and its materialism. But do more. Turn to God and to his Word, the Holy Bible, the only Book that can give you “faith to the preserving alive of the soul.&quot;—Heb. 10:39.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2">A</span><span class="font1">S WE have seen from the previous articles, it is in the Bible that answers can be found for the distressing problems that face us in this twentieth century. But how do we know that the Bible is God’s Word? How can we be certain that it is not simply good human philosophy but that it actually contains divinely inspired counsel and instruction for guiding us through these perilous times ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are a number of features about the Bible that give us solid reasons for knowing that it is God’s Word. First of all, there is the Bible’s remarkable harmony. Even though its sixty-six books were written over a period of about 1,600 years by some forty different writers, the Bible follows a harmonious theme in progressively revealing the purposes of its Author, Jehovah God. This is especially remarkable in view of the fact that these writers came from many different walks of life —some being shepherds, others fishermen and still others priests and kings—and they lived under the influence of differing forms of human government. When one observes how conflicting and contradictory are the writings of uninspired men, even those living at the same time and in the same land, the marvelous harmony of the Bible stands out as strong evidence that the Bible is not a compilation of merely human philosophy but that it truly is God’s Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another powerful indication that this Book is of more than human origination is its honesty and candor. Unlike secular histories that often are colored to make a ruler look good, the Bible frankly and honestly discloses the mistakes made by rulers and other prominent persons who had God’s favor. What secular leader would record his own shortcomings for all to read? Yet Moses did, and neither did he spare his close relatives by overlooking their sips. (Num. 20:7-13; 12:1-15; Deut. 3:23-27) King David’s adultery with Bath-sheba and Peter’s denial of Christ are also straightforwardly presented in the Bible. Such honesty in relating events certainly speaks well of the Bible.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Historical Accuracy</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">But in addition to its internal harmony and honesty, the Bible’s historical accuracy also stamps it as authoritative. Recently a man of science pointed up the folly of calling the Bible book of Genesis &quot;myth.” He said that, as a result of modem archaeological discoveries, “convincing arguments can be advanced for believing that Genesis is based on accurately reported fact and is no myth.’’<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark62">1</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same can be said regarding all the Bible. Secular history, for instance, long had no record of the people known as the Hittites, yet the Bible spoke about them. In this regard, what has archaeology discovered? An authority explains: “One of the striking confirmations of Bible history to come from the science of archaeology is the ‘recovery’ of the Hittite peoples and their empires. Here is a people whose name appears again and again in the Old Testament, but who in secular history had been completely forgotten and whose very existence was considered to be extremely doubtful.”*</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Various kings mentioned in the Bible were also, at one time, considered mythical, such as Chedorlaomer, Belshazzar and Sargon, But this is no longer so. Discoveries have supported Chedorlaomer’s existence.! Excavations have turned up Babylonian records that show that Belshazzar was second in the kingdom, ruling whenever his father, Nabonidus, was elsewhere.! And archaeological findings have made Sargon one of the best-known Assyrian monarchs. §</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Little wonder that many comments have been made by archaeologists as to the Bible’s historical accuracy! The prominent archaeologist Nelson Glueck, after many years of exploration of the Holy Land, said: “Scores of archaeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail historical statements in the Bible.”<sup>0</sup> Yes, the Bible is now recognized as being historically true, but it is far more than a book of accurate history.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Scientifically True</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">The Bible is also scientifically true. When touching on matters of science, the Bible does not parrot the wrong views that prevailed among the nations at the time it was written. At a time when it was commonly believed that the god Atlas or some other powerful underpinning was holding up the earth, the Bible revealed the scien- <a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark65">2</a></sup><sup>&nbsp;<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#bookmark66">3</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote4"></a><a href="#bookmark67">4</a>&nbsp;<a name="footnote5"></a><a href="#bookmark68">5</a></sup>&nbsp;tific truth that the earth has no tangible means of support. Over 3,400 years ago it said: God &quot;is stretching out the north over the empty place, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">hanging the earth upon nothing.&quot;</span><span class="font1">—Job 26:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Further, a thousand years before the Common Era the Bible revealed the existence of the cycle in which water from all the rivers flows into the sea, from where it is lifted by the sun’s rays in the form of water vapor, carried by clouds over the land and deposited as rain, and finally flows back to the sea again. The Bible explained thte presently understood cycle: “AU the winter torrents are going forth to the sea, yet the sea itself is not full. To the place where the winter torrents are going forth, there they are returning so as to go forth.&quot; —Eccl. 1:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These are only a few of the many scientific truths found in the Bible although it was written at a time when peoples were filled with superstitions. It is not surprising, then, that scientist Sir Isaac Newton once said: “No sciences are better attested than the religion of the Bible.” Even in this atomic age the Bible is still in harmony with proved facts of science, because it was inspired by the One who created the very things studied by men of science.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark69"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark70"></a>Its Superior Principles</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Another convincing evidence that the Bible is the Word of God is its superior principles. They are the finest known to man. Instead of selfishness, the Bible teaches generosity; instead of hatred, it teaches love, even love for enemies; instead of unrelenting harshness, it teaches compassion, mercy and forgiveness. Reflect on the principles found in Jesus’ famous sermon on the mount, including his positive command: “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them.” (Luke 6:31) Abraham Lincoln said that this Bible sermon “contained the essence of all law and justice”!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many noted men have commented similarly on the superiority of Bible principles. One English jurist, Jeremy Bentham, observed: “All the massive bulk of our English and American law may be reduced to a very few grand principles underlying the whole and which were enunciated by Moses.”<a name="footnote6"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark71">6</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Because of its superior principles, the Bible has power to transform the lives of men for righteousness. Early Christians, who put Bible principles to work in their lives, stood out because of their moral uprightness. The second-century Christian writer Tertullian compared the conduct of Christians with that of the non-Christian Romans, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot;When Christians are brought before you on the mere ground of their name, is there ever found among them an ill-doer of the sort? It is always with [you non-Christians] the prison is steaming, the mines are sighing, the wild beasts are fed: it is from you the exhibitors of gladiatorial shows always get their herds of criminals to feed up for the occasion. You find no Christian there, except simply as being such.”t</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Yes, the Bible’s superior principles make better people, as noted by an early American president, Thomas Jefferson, who said: “I have always said and always will say that the studious perusal of the Sacred Volume will make better citizens, better fathers, better husbands. . . . The Bible makes the best people in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Only Jehovah God could originate such superior principles that change lives. The Bible’s having such life-transforming principles marks it as unique, as the Word of God!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark72"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark73"></a>Fulfilled Prophecies</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">But the most striking of all features of the Bible that show it to be God’s inspired Word is the remarkable fulfillment of its prophecies. The Bible consistently has prophesied events in minute detail hundreds of years in advance, and they have come to pass exactly as foretold!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For example, 200 years in advance the prophet Isaiah was inspired to foretell the fall of the ancient world power Babylon, and even to give such details as the personal name of its conqueror and that the city’s two-leaved doors would be left open. (Isa. 45:1) And just as foretold, the Persian King Cyrus did lead the Medes and Persians in the conquest of Babylon, and the two-leaved doors along the Euphrates waterfront were left open. What remarkable fulfillment!</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, just as remarkable is another prophecy given by Jehovah through his prophet Daniel foretelling the rise of the Medo-Persian Empire, its conquests and, finally, its defeat by the ascending Grecian world power. It was foretold that after completing his conquests the worldconquering Grecian king would be “broken,” and, in time, “four kingdoms from his nation [would] stand up, but not with his power.”—Dan. 8:3-8, 20-22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Was this prediction accurate? Did Greece under the command of its mighty king Alexander the Great conquer Medo-Persia? Any student of history knows that it did. And, following the death of Alexander, was the Grecian Empire divided into four lesser kingdoms? The historian Charles Rollin notes: “These prophecies of Daniel were fully accomplished by this last partition of Alexander’s empire. . ... These four kings are, Ptolemy, Seleucus, Cassander, and Lysimachus.” Rollin was moved to ask: “Can any one possibly ascribe to chance, or human foresight, so many circumstantial predictions, which, at the time of their being denounced, were so remote from probability; and may we not evidently discover, in them the character and traces of the Divinity?”<a name="footnote7"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark74">7</a></sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No man could possibly look into the future and so accurately foretell coming events. The Bible, however, abounds with such fulfilled prophecies,! proving beyond question that it is indeed the Word of God!</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark75"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark76"></a>Present World Conditions Foretold</span></h3>
<p><span class="font1">Certain Bible prophecies even pointed forward to “the last days” or “the conclusion of the system of things” and described in detail conditions that would exist then and what they would mean. In previous articles we have already noted that “critical times hard to deal with” were foretold, when people would be “lovers of money,... disobedient to parents, . . . without selfcontrol, fierce, without love of goodness,” and so forth. But God’s great Prophet, Jesus Christ, also foretold that “nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another pestilences and food shortages.&quot;—2 Tim. 3:1-5; Matt. 24:3; Luke 21:10, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Can there be any doubt that we are now living in the era of unprecedented troubles of which God’s inspired Son and his apostle spoke? Has any other generation experienced ‘nation rising against nation and kingdom against kingdom’ in global war? Only since 1914 C.E. has this taken place, as New York </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1"> military editor Hanson Baldwin explains: “World War I ushered in the century of Total War, of—in the first full sense of the term—global war.&quot; t</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to total war, the Bible also foretold &quot;great earthquakes,” and these, as we have seen, have unquestionably marked our time. Pestilences or disease epidemics, too, have occurred “in one place after another.” Food shortages also have plagued much of the world ever since World War I. The present fulfillment of Bible prophecies concerning the “last days” has made ours an unparalleled generation in the history of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the Bible does not leave its readers in a quandary as to what these unprecedented world conditions mean. Jesus Christ explained that they mean we are fast approaching a destruction of all wickedness comparable to that of the global flood in Noah’s day. (Matt. 24:36-39) In the Bible that destruction is identified by the term Armageddon, “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.” (Rev. 16:14-16) This righteous war of God will very soon now, yes, within this generation, cleanse the earth and make it a decent place in which to live for all those who love God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What other book thousands of years in advance foresaw the present world conditions and explained their meaning? Not one aside from the Bible! How confident we can be that “all Scripture is inspired of God and beneficial”! (2 Tim. 3:16) Therefore, do not let God’s inspired Word sit on a bookshelf in your home unused. Go to it for counsel and guidance. Let it shape your life, influence your daily activity, govern your decisions and mold your outlook on the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is the keen desire of Jehovah’s witnesses to help you to gain faith in the Bible as God’s Word and to benefit from its wise guidance in these critical times. They will be pleased to conduct a regular Bible study with you in your own home free of charge. Write the publishers of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font1"> or get in touch with Jehovah’s witnesses at their Kingdom Hall in your locality. Avail yourself of this invitation to become better acquainted with the only Book that can guide your steps safely through these perilous times.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Draft Atom Pact</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;§&gt; Geneva, Switzerland, the home of many international conferences, is host of the 17-nation disarmament conference. On August 17 the United States unveiled its draft treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. This draft was hailed in Washington as an “important step forward.’’ Considerable public fanfare was used to draw attention to the plan. However, in Geneva reactions were somewhat different. The Russians said that the draft was not worth discussing. So the flaring buildup ended in another stalemate, not unexpected. Just eleven days before this, in Hiroshima, Japan, 30,000 Japanese, calling to mind the destruction of 70,000 lives there just twenty years ago, had expressed their hope that atomic warfare would never be used again. Yet the availability of nuclear weapons constantly increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Chilean Disaster</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before recovering completely from the earthquake disaster in March of this year, Chile, in August, again suffered heavily at the hands of the elements, this time from freak wind and heavy rainstorms, the worst in forty years. The effects are estimated to be even worse than those left by the quake. Early estimates showed that 10,000 families had suffered loss or damage to homes and to their household goods. Twenty-two of Chile’s twenty-five provinces have been declared officially disaster zones. At least thirty-five persons died as direct results of the storms, including five skiers who perished when a snowslide destroyed the building where they were sleeping, and three children who were killed when the roof blew off their recently built schooL Others were smothered in the ruins of their adobe homes when the walls were weakened by the heavy rains. Most of the main roads and railway lines were cut with washouts and damaged bridges. About two hundred small fishing boats were smashed. Damages are put at millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Violence Erupts</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; The nation had held its breath as the summer wore on. Then in Los Angeles a Negro was arrested for drunken driving. A mob formed. A shaky peace was shattered. Violence erupted and rioting spread throughout Los Angeles and southern California. The police were not able to control the rioters, estimated to number 6,000 to 7,000. The rioters roamed the streets, burning, looting and shooting over a wide area. Then National Guard units were rushed in. Five days later it all ended. The estimated cost in damages, $200,000,000, and 34 dead. The Federal government allocated $1,770,000 to help rebuild the area. The number of persons arrested reached more than 3,800.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The spark that flashed in Los Angeles soon spread to Chicago, Illinois, and to Springfield, Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">The American Farmer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$■ It has been a long time since the American farmer has had it so good, say the statisticians. Excellent crops and higher prices for cattle are helping them to put money in the bank. Based on the year to date, Agriculture Department economists estimate the farm income for the full year as follows: Gross farm income from all sources will be $43,300,000,000, highest on record. Net farm income after paying expenses is expected to be $13,500,000,000, the highest since 1953; and net income per farm, $4,000, also the highest on record. However, when one considers the high cost of farm machinery and the long labor hours, the $4,000 figure proves that the farmers are not rolling in wealth. Furthermore, not all have prospered equally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Wheat for Russia</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Canadian wheat growers are reaping a bonanza. The portion of the 1965 wheat crop sold to Russia by Canada now runs to nearly 222,000,000 bushels. The grain sales to the Soviet Union will bring more than $400,000,000 to Canadians. Also, from this year’s crop, Canada has sold 79,000,000 bushels of wheat to Red China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Disrespect for Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Lewis F. Powell, Jr., 57-year-old outgoing president of the American Bar Association (ABA), recently called crime America's No. 1 domestic problem. On August 9 he listed three symptoms of &quot;deteriorating law and order”: (1) The willful violation of laws and court decisions, sometimes by officials sworn to uphold them. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(2)</span><span class="font1"> The doctrine that only “just” laws need to be obeyed and that every man is free to determine what is &quot;just.” (3) The growing use of coercion in the form of demonstrations, sit-ins and street mobs and the using of these methods to enforce political views. Powell suggested that disrespect for law and order could be created by some demonstrations and sit-ins. “An ordered society cannot exist if every man may determine which laws he will obey, and if techniques of coercion supplant due process,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Voting Rights</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; On August 6, in the very room where one hundred and four years ago Abraham Lincoln signed a bill freeing slaves in America, President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This law is to guarantee the Negro the right to vote. The law has plenty of muscle in it. It is equipped to check into discriminatory practices, abolish poll taxes and suspend literacy tests as a prerequisite to voting. It was, ironically, the week in which Negroes in Los Angeles, Chicago and Springfield rioted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Singapore’s Future</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some years ago fears were expressed that Singapore, the last great British naval base in the Far East, might go Communist. Suddenly, on August 9, a two-front crisis erupted in southeast Asia. Singapore seceded from Malaysia and became an independent island nation. Fear swept quickly through all the noncommunist areas in southeast Asia. Singapore declared its neutrality. Singapore now has become a nation-city, with no hinterland. Her reason for breaking with Malaysia was mainly one of survival. The city exists on trade. Trade means life or death to her. To live, it must have unlimited access to nearby markets, which means trading with the Asian mainland and Indonesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Masai Durability</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;*&gt; In Kenya, Africa, the Masai tribe of about 150,000 were visited by a team of researchers in July. This team was attempting to discover why the Masai never seem to get heart trouble in spite of a diet high in cholesterol. These African herdsmen walk sometimes fifty or sixty miles a day without noticeable strain. Professor George Mann of Vanderbilt University brought with him a treadmill in an attempt to evaluate the fitness of the Masai. A healthy U.S. college boy would last about 14 minutes on the treadmill before dropping off limp, exhausted and gasping for breath. An American record was 27 minutes. Some 39 Masai warriors were persuaded to get on the treadmill. Some of these were youths only 12 or 13 years old, others were old men. Two of the Masai walked the treadmill right off its maximum scale of 30 minutes and 30-degree elevation. The group averaged 23 minutes on the treadmill. None sat down after their performance, but stood waiting another turn. Their pulse did rise, but not their respiratory rates. For some curious reason these men were not breathing hard. Perhaps their way of life, free from the tensions and pressures of industrial civilization, accounts for the findings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Rationing Grain</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">India’s chronic food shortage forced her, on August 6, to impose food rationing on her city dwellers. Men, women and children in urban areas were limited to 12 ounces of wheat or rice a day. The national average consumption of food grain had been about 14.4 ounces a day. On August 19 mobs in Kolhapur looted grain shops. Six persons were killed when the police opened fii£ on the looters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Fighting Violent Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Serious crimes increased by 13 percent in America last year. In the heart of the nation's capital, Washington, D.C., the growing army of criminals was creating great concern. On July 23 at four o’clock in the afternoon a woman employee was attacked in the Department of State’s new building, which is located about five blocks from the White House, the president’s home. Reported attempts at rape, thefts of handbags and other personal belongings are many. On August 4 the State Department added guards in its main building to prevent sexual attacks on women in offices, halls, stairways and elevators. On August 9 the State Department shut off free public access to visitors. Now any visitor must have approved credentials or be on a conducted tour. The passport division advised its employees to stand near the alarm button when riding in the self-service elevators, to werk in pairs and to take other precautions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Alcohol and Accidents</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Alcoholic beverage revenues accruing to the American government in the fiscal year ending June 30 may exceed $3,500,000,000. Automobile accident costs attributable to the use of alcoholic beverages in the same twelve months totaled $4,000,000,000, or more than the alcoholic beverage tax income. According to the U.S. National Safety Council, alcohol is involved in as many as half of automobile accidents, the costs of which add up to $8,100,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Behind Prostitution</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Some people are inclined to coddle the prostitute and excuse her ways, believing her to be a person pressed into this despicable life against her wishes. However, a prize-winning study, reported in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Globe and Mail</span><span class="font1"> for July 5, revealed that Montreal prostitutes are in the business because they want the cash it brings them—$300 to $500 a week—and an easy life. Twenty prostitutes, whose ages ran from 20 to 27, cooperated on the study. The prostitutes regarded their occupation as essential to society and all admitted stealing from clients. Factors common in each prostitute's background was a low </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">educational level; of the</span><span class="font1"> twenty, nineteen came from broken or divided homes, all lived as children in crowded houses in decrepit conditions; insecurity and misery dominated their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Still Defusing Bombs</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&lt;$&gt; Twenty years after World War II bomb disposal units are still called out almost daily to dispose of bombs or weapons found as a result of the last world war. Nearly 4,000,000 bombs, shells and other explosive charges have been rendered harmless In Bremen, Germany, since World War II ended, it was reported on August 17. The city administration .further announced that 7,000,000 rounds of machinegun and rifle ammunition and several thousand automatic weapons and pistols have been collected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaks for Itself</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;$&gt; The Auckland Star,</span><span class="font1"> July 9, published the following item under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the subheading</span><span class="font1"> “Students’ Plea”: “Sixty students attending the Australian National University decided at a meeting to ask the students’ union to install a contraceptive vending machine In the union’s building. Only one student, a girl, spoke against the motion.” Integrity and virtue do not appear to be valued by the rising generation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Serum Hepatitis</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&gt; Serum hepatitis, a virus infection of the liver, is often a severe disease. Recently a medical source stated that in the United States there were 86,000 cases of serum hepatitis in a year. Many more thousands of cases, no doubt, have not been reported. Serum hepatitis is one of the major hazards that can follow the transfusion of blood. Unfortunately, today, says Dr. Walter C. Alvarez, “thousands of transfusions are given, of only a pint of blood—an amount too small to do any good. All such a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">transfusion can do is perhaps </span><span class="font1">to give the patient a serious disease.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Anger’s Double Kill</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Forty-year-old Henry C. Fisher had a heated quarrel with his son Henry, Jr., 16, over mowing the lawn. The boy collapsed during the argument. The father, while trying to revive his son, suffered a heart attack. Heart attacks killed the irate father and his son. Was the argument worth it?</span></p>
