<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">WHILE the WATCH TOWER takes no part in politics in a partisan sense it must needs take note of all politics which have an important bearing on public welfare, and thus stand related to the fulfilments of the divine prophecies.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For the next four months the people of the United States will be in a fervor of excitement such as has not been known for more than thirty years.  The &quot;Gold and Silver question&quot; will, we believe, prove to be almost as important a question as was the &quot;Slavery question&quot; in 1860: and the action in the United States will affect all the world.  It may mean another &quot;spasm&quot; or &quot;travail pang.&quot;  But we still hold that God's saints are a separate and peculiar people, distinct from the world and its parties and factions; and accordingly urge all to increase their watchfulness, zeal and prayer for our Kingdom, which alone will meet the needs of the &quot;groaning creation.&quot;  Our Kingdom, for which we labor and wait and work, is the one for which also we pray, daily--&quot;Thy Kingdom come-- thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.&quot; Since none of earth's kingdoms are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">ours</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we should be separate from all;--&quot;Kept for the Master's use.&quot;  Whoever enters politics will surely find that the time, influence and talent pledged to the Lord's service will be drawn into political channels.  &quot;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.&quot;  &quot;Ye are not of this world, even as I am not of this world.&quot;  &quot;I have chosen you out of the world and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain.&quot;  These our Master's words, and his caution that we watch and pray lest we enter into temptation, and the assurance that we are now in a time of special testing, should put us on guard, so that the Apostle's words may be true of us; &quot;He that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.&quot;--`1 John 5:18`; `Jas. 1:18`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Under the caption &quot;Religious Anarchy&quot; the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Philadelphia</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Press</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> proceeds to advocate compulsory Christian Union.  Its arguments illustrate the Apostle's statement that &quot;the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.&quot;  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unconsecrated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> believers (and hence natural men--not &quot;new creatures&quot;) and unbelievers so largely preponderate both in pulpits and pews that the general sentiment will be more affected by the false than by the true view.  To all except &quot;the sanctified in Christ Jesus,&quot; &quot;transformed by the renewing of their minds&quot; and &quot;taught of God&quot; through his Word, truth is stranger than fiction.  The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Press</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> says:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;A regulated liberty is just as necessary and as possible, and no more perilous in the Church than in the State.  Individualism simply will not work.  Of course, if religion be conceived of simply as a device to save each isolated soul from future damnation, then the question falls.  In that case each must be as solitary as though no other had ever lived.  He sins by himself, he dies by himself, he is saved or damned by himself, as the case may be.  But that is not religion</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2004 : page 159::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">from the Christian point of view.  Our idea of religion is that it is a joint enterprise for the moral uplift of humanity, and that each person concerned in it saves himself incidentally and without knowing it.  But no cooperation is possible without some relinquishment of personal freedom of action.  It is not in point here and now to say much about where we conceive the seat of authority to be, or through what organs it should act. It is enough to hold up to reprehension that selfish,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2004 : page 160::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">impotent, mercenary conception of salvation which is so firmly lodged in the common thought.  No man liveth to himself in any sphere of life.  This is preeminently true in the sphere of religion, which is intended to be the social bond among men.  The opprobrium of the present ecclesiastical situation is its apparent anarchy. Men will not submit to discipline, and they ought to submit.  Do not misunderstand me.  I have no hankering for either the Inquisition or the Geneva Council of Elders or the Court of Arches.  But then, these are only ancient bogies to frighten children with.  Our peril is all from the opposite quarter.  What the Church needs to day is not pious and independent people, but men who for Christ's sake and for humanity's sake are willing to cooperate with their fellow citizens in the household of faith.  The creed of the Church may not be the form of expression which they would prefer; its discipline may be somewhat antique; its restraints may be somewhat irksome; but so long as it asks or prescribes nothing which is definitely contrary to right or truth it becomes the man who reveres God and who wishes well to men to forbear.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here the evil results of false doctrine come to the surface.  This writer (like a growingly large class in and out of the churches) has given up as antiquated the theory of mankind's fall by Adam's disobedience and the redemption of all by Christ in order that all may come to an individual knowledge and trial for eternal life under the terms of the New Covenant.  His idea is the evolution idea of salvation (?), that our race developed gradually from microbes or protoplasm into monkeys, and from monkeys into men, and is saving itself as a race by cultivating and civilizing itself.  Hence his statement above, &quot;Our idea of religion is that it is a moral uplift of humanity, and that each person concerned in it saves himself incidentally and without knowing it.&quot;  This is the logical conclusion of evolution, and it appeals of course to the &quot;natural&quot; heart.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If his premise as to the object and purpose of religion be accepted as correct, his conclusion that a union of Christians under some kind of a creed, &quot;or any kind,&quot; so as to better accomplish this &quot;moral uplift of humanity&quot; would be logical.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But as his premise is false so is also his conclusion. He rejects the Scriptural testimony respecting the mission of the true Church, and hence his groping darkness and the darkness of the many on this important subject. As we have frequently proven in these columns, the Scriptures declare that the object of God during this Gospel age is not &quot;the moral uplift of humanity&quot; (except as it may </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">incidentally</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be effected), but the selection, trial and perfecting of a special Church or &quot;royal priesthood&quot; who, when all selected, shall be associated with their chief or High Priest (who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">redeemed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> them and the entire race) in the promised Kingdom of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">For this Kingdom we wait, for it in God's providence is to accomplish &quot;the moral uplift of humanity&quot; during the Millennial age which will soon be ushered in. For it, as instructed, we pray, &quot;Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">However, faith in a ransom from an Adamic fall is fast fading from the minds of those who have never understood the subject and cared not enough to seek for the truth upon it; and thus &quot;Christendom&quot; is preparing for the union or &quot;federation&quot; which the Scriptures foreshow will be the final phase of &quot;Christianity.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">True Christians are recognized by God (1) as individuals; (2) as individuals who having severally submitted their wills completely to the will of God are each under the direction or </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">headship</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of Christ, and related to each other in and through his spirit and Word, and not by either physical or mental creeds or other bonds.  Let us stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free indeed.  Yet let us submit ourselves one to another and serve and love one another as members together of the Lord's body.  Thus shall we realize the union and liberty combined; lost during the dark ages and not yet realized by any who are in sectarian bondage.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                    *  *  *</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   A writer who sees matters more clearly writes as follows in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Christian World.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Christianity, as it came from Christ, concerned itself with spirit, motive, conduct.  The disciple was he who 'heareth my words and doeth them;' whose life answered to the great appeal, 'if ye love me, keep my commandments.'  The Christianity of theology, on the other hand, puts the emphasis on something entirely different.  It constructs a system of elaborate meta-physical propositions about the modes of the Divine existence and the relation to them of the Person of Christ, and then declares concerning them, 'this is the Catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he cannot be saved,' adding as a clincher 'which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.'</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The mind which can accept creeds has no necessary relation to the Christian mind at all.  A Constantine could do that and be a murderer of his wife and his son.  A Catherine de Medici, in the name of the Catholic Creed, could order a Bartholomew massacre. An Empress, Catherine of Russia, could uphold the orthodox confession and rival Messalina in her debaucheries.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It is equally certain that the church confessions, powerless to produce the true Christian spirit and morality, are equally powerless to produce the true Christian conviction.  When we are told we need to be convinced of Christ's right to command before we obey Him, we admit the plea.  The true Protestant knows a better method.  Hungry for the facts which bear upon his spiritual life, he will seek to give to each one of them its proper weight over his intellect and his heart. But the intellectual system which he builds out of them will ever be open to revision as new light comes.  And the atrocity of using that provisionary system as an instrument for persecuting his neighbor will be one of which he will never be found guilty.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">              ====================</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2004 : page 161::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">RESTITUTION, FAITH CURES, PRAYER CURES AND</font></b><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">             </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE GIFT OF HEALING.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          --CONTINUED FROM OUR LAST.--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THE privilege of prayer which God has provided for his people is one of the greatest boons imaginable. &quot;Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.&quot; (`Heb. 4:16`.)  The mercy has been provided by God in the great sacrifice of Christ, sufficient to cover all &quot;the sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;&quot; but we must by faith approach the throne of grace in order to obtain this mercy. So, also, with all of our necessities as new creatures in Christ; grace to help for every time of need lies waiting for us to claim it--at the throne of grace.  Although our Heavenly Father knoweth what we need, and has made so abundant a provision for us, yet he will be inquired of, solicited, by his people, for these mercies which he assures us he is far more pleased to give than are earthly parents to do good unto their children.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God's appointment that his people should approach him in prayer is, therefore, not for the purpose of informing him of our needs, for these he knows far better than we do, but for our spiritual profit, that we may be kept in close touch with him, that we may continually realize his love and care and grace toward all who have come into the divine family through Christ and the New Covenant.  For this reason, while sending rain and sunshine upon the world in general, God holds in his hand many favors, great and small, for &quot;his people,&quot; which he will bestow only in answer to their faith and prayers.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Prayer is not a privilege merely, but also a necessity; --commanded as indispensable to our Christian growth. (`Rom. 12:9-13`; `1 Thes. 5:17`.)  Whoever loses the desire to thank and worship and commune with the Father of mercies, may rest assured that he is losing the very spirit of sonship, and should promptly seek and remove the barrier--the world, the flesh or the devil.  Every additional evidence of the Lord's confidence in us by the revealing to us of his character and plan, so far from diminishing our worship and prayers, should multiply them.  If our hearts are good soil they will bring forth the more abundantly.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">              </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE MODEL PRAYER.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   All of our Lord's recorded prayers are beautiful in their simplicity, trustfulness and unselfishness; but the one usually termed &quot;the Lord's prayer,&quot; given as an example of a proper prayer, is certainly in every</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2005 : page 161::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">way a model, which we do well to follow closely in all our petitions.--`Luke 11:2-4`; `Matt. 6:9-13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Its opening address is full of filial reverence and trust,--&quot;Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name!&quot;  What could be more sweet and childlike! What could be more reverent than this bold approach, direct to the throne of the heavenly grace!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) It does not proceed hastily to the lesser things of a personal character, but, recognizing that God takes knowledge of all of earth's affairs, and has a gracious and sufficient remedy already provided, the model prayer acknowledges this, and thus expresses faith and interest in God's plan as revealed in his Word, saying: &quot;Thy Kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven.&quot;  Yes, indeed, it is not only fitting that all who approach God in prayer should previously have searched to know something of what he has revealed concerning his will and plan, but also that after learning of it they should thus confess faith in God, that his plan, when fully executed, will more than meet all the necessities of our case.  This is not a petition that God would bring in his Kingdom before his appointed time, nor an expression of an impatient longing for it; but an expression of hope and trust and patient waiting for that which we know will more than meet all proper expectations, and fulfill all the promises of God's Word.  It also signifies our allegiance to the Kingdom and its laws and spirit; and hence implies that so far as we are concerned, we will do all in our power to conform our lives to its precepts even now.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) Then coming to personal desires, it requests only the necessities,--the &quot;bread and water,&quot; which God assures us shall be sure to all who are truly his. It asks, &quot;Give us this day our daily bread.&quot;  The request is not for wealth, nor luxuries, nor overplus, nor dainties and delicacies.  It is simply an acknowledgment of God as the great Provider, and of our reliance upon him and his promises, leaving quantity and quality and everything else to divine wisdom and love, to be ordered to our highest good.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) Although our sins have been forgiven, and we have been received into the family of God as sons before we have any right to pray &quot;Our Father,&quot; yet we are very humbly to feel that we stand as &quot;sons&quot; by grace in Christ, and not in merit of our own.  We therefore appropriately acknowledge that we are trespassers, daily, who do not and cannot do the will of God perfectly, praying, &quot;Forgive us our trespasses,&quot; our shortcomings.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) Next we acknowledge a principle of God's justice, that mercy will be extended through Christ only in proportion as we realize the spirit of divine</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2005 : page 162::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">mercy, and are willing to exercise it toward others who come short of perfection in their dealings with us; hence we add, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;as</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we forgive those who trespass against us.&quot;  This is equivalent to a bargain with God, that we accept his terms of mercy, and will expect none, except as we ourselves exercise it toward others.  What a thought!  If fully appreciated, how it would influence all of God's sons to be kind and generous toward each other and toward all men </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in thought</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> as well as in word and deed.--See `Matt. 5:24`; `6:15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) &quot;And lead us not into temptation;&quot; or, rather, since chastisements and temptations (or trials) are necessary to our discipline and preparation for the Kingdom (`James 1:2-12`), we must understand this as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Emphatic Diaglott</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> indeed renders it, &quot;Abandon us not to trial.&quot;  Since the trial of our faith worketh patience, experience and hope (`1 Pet. 4:12`; `Rom. 5:3-5`), and is needful for our perfecting in holiness (`1 Pet. 1:6,7`), the Father will not hinder us from having temptations, even though he himself tempteth no man. (`Jas. 1:13`.)  A man is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">tempted</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when he is led astray and enticed by his own selfish, fallen desires; he </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> when he yields to those desires. (`James 1:14`.) But in the hour of trial, temptation, who could come off conqueror without the promised &quot;grace sufficient for every time of need&quot; which will succor us and not permit us to be tempted above what we are able to bear, but will with the temptation provide also a way of escape?--`1 Cor. 10:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(7) &quot;But deliver us from evil,&quot; or, as some prefer it, Deliver us from the Evil One.*  The great Adversary is as much on the alert to entrap us through the weaknesses of the flesh, as our Lord is ready to deliver us and give us victory.  We are not sufficient of ourselves for such a contest against the powers of darkness, and hence have need frequently of this petition to the throne of grace, for as the Apostle declares, &quot;our sufficiency is of God.&quot;--`2 Cor. 3:5`.</font><br />
<br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Our prayers are not to be &quot;vain repetitions,&quot; formal requests for what we do not expect.  We are to &quot;ask in faith, nothing wavering.&quot; (`James 1:6`.)  And whatsoever things ye ask &quot;believe that ye [shall] receive them,&quot; for whatsoever is not of faith is sin, hypocrisy. --`Mark 11:11,24`; `Rom. 14:23`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">The child of God must therefore be a close student of his Father's Word; because he is expected to ask that he may receive, that his joy may be full; and he is cautioned to ask only for such things as his Father has expressed a willingness to grant; and he must ask in faith or not at all.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There can be no doubt that in this matter of prayer, as in other matters, our Heavenly Father designs to cultivate faith in his people.  He tells us that &quot;Without faith it is impossible to please God;&quot; and that &quot;This is the victory that overcometh the world, even your faith.&quot;  Hence, only those who exercise faith, and ask in prayer for the promised favors, are really ready to receive them according to God's judgment and arrangement.  This being the case, it should be the prayer of God's people to-day, as amongst the Apostles, &quot;Lord! increase our faith.&quot;  And thus praying, and laboring to this end, each would be more and more helped in overcoming the world and its faithless influences.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">True faith is not credulity.  It is critical, and believes only upon good evidence.  It criticizes closely and distinguishes clearly between the teachings of men and the substantiated Word of God.  But, having found the Word of God, it trusts it implicitly, knowing that its Author cannot lie; and that all his purposes and promises will be accomplished.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">True faith, then, makes sure of its ground by giving careful heed to the Lord's Word; and then, asking according to that Word, it has confidence in the results, and waits and prays and watches, perseveringly and patiently.  &quot;Watch and pray,&quot; and &quot;believe that ye shall receive,&quot; were our Lord's frequent injunctions.  He spake a parable about an unjust judge who was moved by the importunities of a poor widow to do her justice; and then inquired whether God, the true judge, would not in due time hear his elect Church, and avenge their cause justly, though he wait a long time,--until his own &quot;due time.&quot;  And we are told that he uttered this parable to the purport that God's people ought to pray continuously, and &quot;not to faint [yield].&quot;-- `Luke 18:1`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" color="#FF0000" face="Verdana">Whatever might be our natural inclinations with reference to definiteness and persistency in prayer, we must take our instructions from the Scriptures; and, overcoming our natural predilections, we must as &quot;little children&quot; and as &quot;dear children&quot; conform our views and conduct to the instruction which is from above. Let us all, therefore, remember the words, &quot;Ask [in my name] and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.&quot; (`John 16:24`.)  The Heavenly Father has multiplied mercies, blessings and providences in store for his obedient and faithful children </font><b><font size="2" color="#FF0000" face="Verdana">who will ask for them.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">True, some of these proper and authorized and much desired requests are long delayed;--for instance, the Church for more than eighteen centuries has prayed, &quot;Thy Kingdom come!  Thy will be done on</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   *The remaining sentence with which this prayer is usually closed is spurious--not found in the ancient Greek MSS.  It would appear to have been added at the time when an earthly exaltation of the Church had led some to believe that the Papal glory was the glory of God's Kingdom.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2005 : page 163::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">earth, as it is done in heaven.&quot;  God has heard, but has not answered yet.  Nevertheless all who have thus prayed for and desired the Millennial Kingdom have been blessed by their faith in that Kingdom not seen as yet,--but evidently now very near.  However, other requests--for daily food and for succor in temptation and deliverance from the Evil One,--have been promptly answered.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In this connection notice specially that the privilege of prayer, or any other favor of God, is not granted for selfish purposes.  A thing which might be properly desired and asked for in one case might be improper if asked for from some other motive.  To desire and ask for something good in itself, in order that we might be glorified before our fellows, is a wrong request, because of a wrong motive.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The desire for a good thing, simply for ease and convenience, is an improper, selfish motive.  The Apostle refers to such cases, saying, &quot;Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, to consume it upon your desires,&quot;--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> for vain-glorious purposes or other selfish reasons. (`Jas. 4:3`.)  To ask for some good thing simply to make a test of it, thereby to establish our faith, is seemingly an improper request, for none but the faith-</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">full</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are promised anything.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Besides, God's plan is that we should walk by faith and not by sight.  Hence, we not only should not ask anything unauthorized, but as we grow in spirituality our petitions will be chiefly for spiritual favors; and even in asking for these we should be particular not to</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2006 : page 163::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">specify </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">how</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> they are to come.  And we should look for the answers to our prayers in natural rather than supernatural channels, since God's usual method is to use supernatural means only where the natural means are inadequate.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The graces of the holy Spirit are specially stated to be open to our requests and corresponding efforts: Your Heavenly Father is more willing to give the holy Spirit to them that ask it, than earthly parents are to give good (earthly) gifts to their children.--`Luke 11:13`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">      </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;YE HAVE NOT, BECAUSE YE ASK NOT.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                --`James 4:2`.--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The trouble with many is that they do not avail themselves of the great stock of divine grace set apart for the benefit of those who, abiding in Christ, and his word abiding in them, do ask, do seek and do find. Let no one suppose that all prayer must be selfish. Quite to the contrary, we have a wide field of prayer-liberty in full accord with the Lord's Word and will.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Every trial of faith and patience is an occasion for prayer for the promised succor.  Every failure to gain victory is an occasion for a prayer for forgiveness, and as well for divine blessing, that the lesson of our own weakness may be deeply impressed, so that in the next similar trial we may promptly apply for and lay hold upon the &quot;grace to help&quot; promised.  Every victory over self is an occasion for prayer that we be not high minded and puffed up, but kept humble and watchful for the next attack from the great Adversary. Every service for the truth becomes an occasion for a prayer of thanks for the privilege of serving the Great King and mayhap to have suffered something for his cause; and a cause for supplication for further opportunities of service and grace to use them wisely.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If you have trials and temptations which you are able to overcome, and which are working out in your character patience, experience, brotherly-kindness, sympathy and love, rejoice and offer the prayer of thanksgiving and acknowledgment of divine mercy and help.  If your trials seem heavier than you can bear, and likely to crush you, take the matter to the great Burden-bearer, and ask his help in bearing whatever would do you good, and release from all that would not do you good, but which would injure you.  If your heart is full of a desire to obey the Lord's injunction and &quot;forget not the assembling,&quot; and you are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unreasonably</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> hindered in a way that you have tried to overcome but cannot, take the matter to the Lord in prayer, and watch and wait and strive according to your prayer, and you will soon see a manifestation of divine power on your behalf.  If you see a true brother, a true &quot;soldier&quot; faltering and in danger, let your heart be so full of love for all of the Lord's &quot;brethren&quot; that you will not only run to his relief, but also supplicate the throne of the heavenly grace unceasingly, until you have regained him, or until in his wilfulness he has renounced the &quot;narrow way&quot; entirely.  And should the fault be your own, your prayers and efforts will surely be blessed and overruled to your own profit.  If you have no burning zeal to preach the good tidings of great joy, pray earnestly and faithfully and persistently for it, and strive for it, and you will soon have it.  If you have a zeal and love for the gospel, and lack ability to present it, pray for the ability while you make full use of what you have.  If you have the zeal and the ability and lack an opportunity, take it to the Lord in prayer as soon as you can, telling him that you are faithfully using all the opportunities you have.  Then watch for more opportunities without slacking your hand to use the very humblest and smallest within your reach.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Have you a quarrelsome disposition, or other bad habits, which you realize are a burden to your home and family, and to your brethren in the Lord's household? Take it to the Lord in prayer, asking grace and help to overcome, and meantime using your best diligence and effort in harmony with your prayer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Do you lack wisdom, so that your efforts to serve</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">the Lord and the truth are usually failures?  Take it to the Lord in prayer, remembering the promise, &quot;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not.&quot;--`James 1:5`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Have you business complications brought about by your lack of judgment, or the dishonesty of others, or your generosity to the poor, etc.?  And do these perplex you and hinder your progress in spiritual matters, and thus threaten your welfare as a &quot;new creature?&quot;  This surely is a proper matter to lay before the Lord at the throne of the heavenly grace.  And although it would not be right for you to attempt to dictate how your relief shall come, and you should not expect the Lord to work a miracle to prosper your imprudent venture, yet you can ask his wisdom to guide and overrule in the results, better than your wisdom could do it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Here is a wide range of subjects (and it might be widely expanded) upon which we may go to the throne boldly in the name of Jesus and ask and receive, seek and find, God's grace sufficient.  But the range of subjects upon which we may not approach God in prayer is also large.  We may not ask anything to minister to pride or selfishness or ambition, nor anything which would injure another; nor anything which would conflict with the Lord's plan as revealed in his Word. Oh! how many &quot;ask and receive not, because they ask amiss,&quot; that they may consume the desired favor upon their earthly desires.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE PRAYERS OF CHRIST UNSELFISH.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Our Lord's prayers, like all his acts and teachings, are models of unselfishness.  Therefore, before we ask anything of the Father, one question should be carefully considered; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">viz.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--Why do I want this?  If the petitioner is consecrated and desires the healing of any that are sick, it should not be for his own glory, nor for his own comfort, nor in any manner for himself; for such requests are selfish and out of harmony with his covenant of sacrifice --&quot;even unto death.&quot;  Remember the course of our Lord and the apostles.  Our Lord used divine power in feeding the multitude because of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">their</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> necessity, and to glorify the Father; but when he himself was forty days without food he would not use the same power to feed himself, by commanding the stones to become bread, because this would have been contrary to his mission; for he came not to serve himself but others: not to preserve his own life, but to sacrifice it, to lay it down in the service of others.  He created food for the multitudes, but not for himself or the disciples, though he referred to the miracle as an evidence that </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">if ever necessary</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the same power would create bread for them.  But it seems to have been the Father's plan to provide for his people by natural means, for there is no record of necessity for such a miracle on their behalf. Doubtless the Lord and his disciples partook of the bread and fish after they were made, and probably of the remaining fragments, but note that the object of their creation was the relief of the multitude and not their own refreshment. (`Matt. 15:32`; `16:5-12`.)  He healed the lame and the palsied miraculously when it would glorify God, but when he himself was weary, he &quot;sat on the well&quot; to rest, or used other natural means. Though he prayed often to the Father, and knew that he was heard always, and although sometimes heavy and sorrowful, as in Gethsemane, yet his prayers were requests for grace and strength to do the Father's will, and to finish the work he had come to do.  And though he tells us that by asking he could have had &quot;twelve legions of angels&quot; to protect his person and his life, yet he would not ask--preferring to have the Father's will accomplished, which he had come to perform; namely, to give himself a &quot;ransom for all.&quot;  So notable was this a characteristic of his, that even his enemies noticed it, and said, &quot;He saved others [from sickness, etc.], himself he cannot save.&quot;  They could not appreciate the self-sacrifice which he was performing. And so, too, we may reasonably expect that many nominal Christians to-day will not understand the same motives and conduct in those who prefer to share in Christ's sufferings, to join with him in sacrifice, in order that they may share also in his coming glorious work of blessing and restoring &quot;that which was lost.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">      </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">APOSTOLIC GIFTS USED UNSELFISHLY.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Notice also the Apostles.  They, too, had the gift of healing as well as privilege of prayer, but they did not use these selfishly.  In all the records we find no instance of the exercise of the gift of healing on behalf of any of the apostles or any of the church; nor have we any record of prayer for health, or other earthly luxuries, being offered by any of them for themselves or each other, except in one case--that of Paul (`2 Cor. 12:7-9`), and his request was not granted; but he was told that instead he should have a sufficiency of grace to compensate and enable him to bear it patiently.  This should command the attention of all.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Although Paul's request for himself was refused-- God seeing that his affliction of weak eyes could be made to work to divine glory and his own advantage --yet his gift to heal </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">others</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was marvelous: &quot;And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul, so that from his body were brought unto the sick, handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them.&quot; (`Acts 19:12`.)  Mark also the fact that though there is no account of the healing of the sick among the early disciples, it was not because they were never</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2007 : page 164::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">sick, for several instances of sickness are recorded.  Paul</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2007 : page 165::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">writes to Timothy, &quot;Trophimus have I left at Miletum </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sick;&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and again he writes to Timothy, who was evidently often troubled with indigestion or dyspepsia, to use wine as a medicine; saying, &quot;Use no longer water [exclusively], but take a little wine for thy stomach's sake, and for thine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">often infirmities.&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`1 Tim. 5:23`.) In neither of these cases did Paul send handkerchiefs or aprons from his person, nor did he mention either praying for their recovery, or advise them so to pray.  Evidently these cases should teach us that the gifts of healing, and prayer for the recovery of the sick were used, not upon the saints, but rather through them upon others, for the purpose of calling attention to the apostles and their gospel as being approved by God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">A special reason why the saints cannot properly ask for physical health and earthly luxuries, we have already intimated is, that they, like their Lord, have consecrated themselves, and pledged to God the exchange of all earthly favors and privileges for the heavenly favors and glories to come;--a foretaste of which they now enjoy through the exceeding great and heavenly promises which cheer and refresh and comfort and bless more than earthly blessings could. Who, that understands the matter, would renounce his heirship in the future heavenly glories, together with present hopes and spiritual joys or reexchange them, if he could, for future earthly restitution, and present occasional foretastes of it?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THREE CAUSES OF SICKNESS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   But some will inquire, If it is not proper for the consecrated to pray for the healing of themselves, what does the Apostle James mean when he says, &quot;The prayer of faith shall save the sick?&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Accidents may and do occur so far as the world is concerned, but the saints are God's peculiar care; nothing can come upon them except as specially permitted. While God could take all the world under such special supervision, he pleases rather to let them be subject to the ordinary vicissitudes of the present condemned state--accidents, sickness, etc.  Only the church (the consecrated) is comforted with the assurances of special care: &quot;Your Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things,&quot; and &quot;Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him,&quot; those that respect and love him, those consecrated to his service.  Of such it is written, &quot;All the steps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord;&quot; and &quot;the very hairs of your head are all numbered.&quot;-- `Matt. 10:30`; `6:31-34`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While therefore sickness may in a general way be considered, at least indirectly, the work of Satan who deceived mankind into sin, and hence into sickness and death, yet in view of what we see of God's special care of the saints, we know that, in their case at least, sickness could not come without the Lord's special permission; and hence it should be regarded in their case as from him, and not directly from Satan, who could have no power over us except it were given him of the Father.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We accordingly classify the causes of afflictions, including sickness, as follows,--but only as applicable to the consecrated church.  First,--Those which have been either produced or aggravated by our activity in the Lord's service.  Second,--Inherited weaknesses and those brought on ourselves by violations of the laws of nature previous to our entrance into the family of God as sons.  Third,--Such as come upon us as discipline or chastisement from the Lord for sins or wanderings or coldness, or for the sin of failing to fulfill our covenant of sacrifice; or as needed discipline to prevent these.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FIRST CLASS SUFFERINGS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Of the first class were the sufferings of Christ-- his weariness, weakness, bloody sweat, ignominious buffetings, and all the reproaches and sneers, and bitter words, to which he meekly and quietly submitted until the sufferings of Calvary terminated his human existence. Of this first class were also the wounds of Paul and Silas, when scourged for preaching Christ, when stoned, beaten and imprisoned, and when in perils by sea and by land, among the Jews and among false brethren.  Of this class was also the dyspepsia of Timothy, who, probably not naturally strong, studied and labored for the Lord, and in the interest of the church; and such we are distinctly told was the cause of the sickness of Epaphroditus, of whose sickness Paul writes, saying, &quot;Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">because for the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">work of Christ he was nigh unto death,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not regarding [sparing] his life, to supply your deficiency.&quot;-- `Phil. 2:29,30`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, indeed, these and all such sicknesses and scars and wounds are honorable marks of distinction, which each soldier of the cross should be ambitious to bear, as Paul said referring to injuries endured in the service of the truth, &quot;I bear about in my body </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the marks</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Lord Jesus.&quot;  These he had received, not in money-seeking or fame-seeking, nor in self-indulgence, nor in quarrelling and disputing about the loss and dross of earth, but in the good fight of faith; in contending earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints, against error amongst Jewish friends, and against philosophies and sciences falsely so called.  He endured his wounds and tribulations in telling the glad tidings of the gospel of Christ of which he was not ashamed,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2007 : page 166::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and holding up the cross of Christ--to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness, but to us who believe the power of God and the wisdom of God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All the &quot;overcomers,&quot; all the faithful in Christ Jesus, are likely to have some such scars as proofs of their faithful endurance.  There is no escape in this war.  It is war to the death with all as well as with our Head and Captain, and the first loyal soldiers in our army.  And it is in this view that `Rev. 20:4` represents all those who shall be accounted worthy of the first resurrection as being &quot;beheaded.&quot;  (The beheading is symbolic; for neither our Lord nor the apostles were literally beheaded.  It signifies that all must suffer earthly disadvantages, and lay down their lives in the defence and service of the truth, if they shall be worthy to share Christ's glory.)  All suffering for righteousness' sake is suffering for the truth.  Our daily lives are to be &quot;living epistles known and read of all men;&quot; and if we suffer because we refuse to be conformed to this world, or because we give the testimony of our lives against sin and for holiness, we suffer for the truth's sake.  If your talents and opportunities permit no more active service for the truth than such godly living and suffering therefor, rejoice! and reckon that yours are among the first class sufferings, and let patience do her perfect work of moulding your character by this means to our Lord's likeness.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle tells us also of a &quot;fellowship of suffering&quot; which may be experienced through mental sympathy.  Those who cannot suffer personally and physically for the truth can sympathize with those who have such sufferings and can thus become &quot;partakers,&quot; sustaining, encouraging and upholding those who are in the &quot;great fight of affliction&quot; for the Lord's cause, by their words, faith and prayers.  Notice the promise to such in the Apostle's words in `Heb. 6:10`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Sickness and discomfort of any sort, incurred by our energy in the service of the truth, are permitted by our Father as evidences of our fidelity and love; because if not liable to such tribulations, or if relieved of them instantly by a miracle, the Lord's service would cost us no sacrifice and the test of our willingness to endure for the truth's sake would be wanting.  As it is, however, every ache and pain or wound of person or of feelings, and beheading socially or literally </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the truth's sake,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> becomes a witness of the spirit, testifying to our faithfulness.  And in all such tribulations we should rejoice greatly--as say our Lord and the Apostle Peter.--`Luke 6:22,23`; `1 Pet. 4:13-16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SECOND CLASS SUFFERINGS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Of the second class of sickness and afflictions are poverty, constitutional weaknesses, etc., which, like Paul's sore eyes, the Heavenly Father sees will be really advantageous to us.  For he doubtless often sees better than we how weak we are, and how a little adversity is necessary, as ballast, to keep our poorly balanced little vessels from capsizing.  These weaknesses God sees best to leave us under, but assures us, through Paul, of &quot;grace sufficient&quot; to counterbalance such weaknesses.  A realization of such care for our real interests, while humiliating, in that it forces conviction of our weakness, is refreshing and inspiring, in that it proves our Father's love and care.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THIRD CLASS SUFFERINGS.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The third class includes chiefly such afflictions as God visits upon his children as special chastisements for special transgressions.  These are mentioned in `Heb. 12:5-11`.  &quot;Son, despise not thou the discipline of the Lord, nor faint when thou art reproved by him; for whom the Lord loveth he disciplineth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.  If ye endure discipline, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father disciplineth not?  But if ye be without discipline whereof all are partakers, then are ye spurious and not [real] sons....Now, no discipline for the present seemeth joyous, but grievous; nevertheless, it yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which are [properly] exercised [or trained] thereby.&quot;  This description, it will be observed, covers not merely the reproofs or rebukes of the Lord (`verse 5`), of the unfaithful and wanderers and transgressors,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2008 : page 166::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">but also the disciplinary trials which come to us in well doing, and are permitted for the developing and strengthening of character;--hence both second and third class sufferings.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is only the rebukes and reproofs of the Lord for sin and unfaithfulness that we are examining in this third class of afflictions.  We remark, too, that probably every son, except the one perfect one, our Lord Jesus, has at times needed and received rebukes by afflictions, for unfaithfulness.  And it is well that we should learn to recognize these rebukes and to wisely apply their lessons.  Rightly dividing, we shall neither err with some in crediting every affliction to the devil --receiving none as rebukes from our Father, nor will we err on the other hand and suppose every calamity and accident which occurs to the world in general and to the nominal church to be a divine rebuke.  We should see clearly that only the consecrated &quot;sons&quot; are under God's special supervision, which includes rebukes by the Lord for sins and shortcomings, as well as afflictions in well-doing, permitted to test and perfect us. If therefore the saints experience serious afflictions, they should at once examine themselves conscientiously before God, to see whether their afflictions arise in any sense from faithfulness to the Lord and the truth.

<font size="2" face="Verdana">they find that they do, they should rejoice in them, and wait patiently for recovery, which without our asking sometimes comes speedily; praying meantime with thanksgiving for blessings enjoyed and with supplications for further usefulness in the Lord's due time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle Peter mentions some who </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">suffered,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not for righteousness' sake, but as evil-doers and as busy-bodies in other men's matters.  Such, as he shows, have no right to rejoice in such sufferings, but contrariwise to be ashamed,--to lay the lesson to heart and by God's grace reform their methods.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">While some, humble minded, do not readily recognize any sufferings as endured for the Lord's sake, and need to be encouraged along this line, others who do little and suffer little from any cause, imagine themselves martyrs for the truth.  Let us avoid both extremes and think of ourselves soberly, underestimating rather than overestimating our little services and sacrifices.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But if we see no evidence that our afflictions have resulted either directly or indirectly from our zeal in the Lord's service, we should at once seek for a cause of the afflictions as a rebuke from the Lord, remembering that nothing could happen to us aside from our Father's permission, and that he never permits them except for a wise purpose.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of the rebuking afflictions Paul wrote to the church at Corinth. (`1 Cor. 11:21,22,27,29,30-34`.) After recounting how careless and unappreciative of their covenant many of them were, failing to recognize their proper participation with Christ, to be broken with him and share his cup of suffering for the truth's sake, he says: </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;For this cause</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.&quot;  This may refer to spiritual lethargy and sickness only; but not improbably also to the physical.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The general object of many such afflictions is our discipline and reformation; and happy is the son who shall speedily note a rebuke of the Father, and repent and come back quickly into full harmony; and who, exercised thereby, shall seldom need the rebuking rod of affliction.  The Apostle refers to this also (`1 Cor. 11:31-34`), saying, &quot;If we would judge ourselves we should not be judged [by the Lord].&quot;  If we would critically watch ourselves and correct our own faults, disciplining ourselves, we should not need to be taken in hand and disciplined by afflictions.  &quot;But when we are judged by the Lord we are corrected, [in order] that we should not be condemned with the world.&quot;  The consecrated are tried now, in order that they may not need any further trial in the future, during the Millennial age, when the world shall be on trial.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Is any among you suffering [afflicted], let him pray,&quot; says the Apostle (`James 5:13`).  This counsel will apply to all the trials and afflictions of God's people, mental and physical, especially such as are of the first class or the second class.  Such sufferers may take all their troubles of every kind to the Lord direct, and be assured of his sympathy and grace to help and sustain.  Such need no elders to pray for the forgiveness of their sins, as in the following `verses (14,15`), where, evidently, the third class afflictions are referred to,--sicknesses the result of rebukes from God for sins, and not sicknesses of the class first described, in which we may rejoice.  James says: &quot;Is any sick among you?  Let him call for the elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">though</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him.  </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Therefore</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> confess your </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.&quot;*  The prayer, as we understand it, should be for the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">forgiveness</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">of the sins</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of which the sickness is a punishment or rebuke, rather than for release from the deserved punishment. But if the sickness was a judgment or discipline for sin, we should expect that when the sin had been confessed and truly repented of, the Lord would remove the chastisement and raise up the penitent son from the affliction, either partially or wholly.--Compare `Matt. 9:2-6`; `John 5:14`; and `1 John 5:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But let us remember that this statement does not refer to the various small aches and annoyances to which we, in common with the world in general, are subject; and which serve us a good purpose in the development of patience and sympathy for others.  We know this, first of all, by the calling in of the elders of the Church [the senior, or chief, or official members] to pray over and anoint the sick with oil: because such extreme measures would be quite improper for a slight ailment.  We know it secondly by the Greek word used for </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">sick</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in `verse 14`, which has the significance of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">helpless</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> or impotent.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We see, then, that promiscuous praying for health during the Gospel age would have been improper, and that only by means of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">gift</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of healing were the early cures of the age performed; that it ceased with the death of the apostles after accomplishing its object; and that the proper prayers relating to sickness, on the part of the saints, have been those offered for the forgiveness of sins--as a result of which healing followed. But we see, too, that as the Millennial age is dawning-- lapping upon the Gospel age which is closing--we</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2008 : page 168::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">should expect that healing and general restitution would begin to be manifested, much as we do see it. And this leads us to inquire,--In the light of the foregoing examination of the Bible teachings and in the light of our present location in the dawn of the Millennium,</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FOR WHOM MAY WE NOW PRAY?</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We answer, the saints cannot properly pray for their own health now, any more than could their Master.  They cannot properly ask the restitution privileges which they have consecrated, nor can they ask that their sacrifices be nullified by having all the cost of weariness, exhaustion, stripes or sickness miraculously removed.  But when they realize their afflictions to be punishments for sins, they can still feel at liberty to confess their sins one to another, and pray to God for forgiveness, and thus they may, as a result, be healed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The saints who abide in Christ, and in whom his Word abides, may pray for others than themselves, especially in view of the fact that we are now in the beginning of the Times of Restitution; namely, in cases where they are sure their object is not self-exaltation; where their desires for the recovery of the sick are not selfish; where they have reason to believe that the restored health would be consecrated to good works and the glory of God.  In such cases we may upon request pray for the recovery of the afflicted or imbecile </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not of</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the consecrated little flock--the sacrificers, the Royal Priesthood.  Yet even in such cases, though our faith must necessarily be strong, because confident of asking from right motives, and at a time when the Lord is pleased to grant a beginning of restitution blessings, we should always say, as the Master did in his prayers,--&quot;Nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">However, it is not time yet to expect general healing and full restitution work, as that evidently will not be due until the entire Priesthood shall have finished sacrificing and entered with their Head and Chief Priest Jesus, into the glories and perfections of the heavenly state or condition, typified by the Most Holy of the Temple and Tabernacle.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">    </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">HE MUST INCREASE, BUT I MUST DECREASE.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   At first sight it might appear that as the gifts at the beginning of the age were exercised </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the consecrated, so the healings to be expected in the Millennial dawn would be manifested mostly in answer to the prayers of the consecrated.  But not so, we believe, will it be found; this would bring the saints into too great prominence, whereas, like John the Baptist at the first advent, we must expect to decrease here, while the Church Triumphant, on the other side the vail, will be on the increase.  Our present relationship to the glorified Church--pointing out the nearness of the reign of glory--answers closely in correspondence to the work of John the Baptizer at the first advent. John proclaimed, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, and added, &quot;There standeth one among you whom ye know not.  He must increase, but I must decrease.&quot; So, much the same, is our message; and while the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2009 : page 168::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Church on the earthly plane will decrease, the glorified Church on the heavenly plane will be increasing in power and influence during the time of trouble coming, while the John class will doubtless be put under restraints, as John was cast into prison by Herod.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In harmony with what we should thus expect, various methods of healing meet with some success, and indeed we have heard of more than one case of healing where no cure was attempted, or even thought of, by either the sick or the friends.  One case was that of a sick girl, at whose bedside her friends had gathered, waiting for her to die; she immediately recovered, got up and went about as ever.  The only explanation she could give was that she had a dream in which a man laid his hand upon her head, and she felt a shock like electricity pass down her spine.  And this young woman did not even profess to be a Christian.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">By various means the Lord would gradually prepare the world for restitution, so that when it comes the new order of things will still leave room for the exercise of faith toward God; for the proud and scientific to explain from natural causes, while others will be led thereby to recognize such things as the beginning of restitution.  And since the overcomers have a great work to do in opposing error and instilling truth, and since, if they were much engaged in praying for the sick, it would detract from their real and important work of healing the spiritually sick and lame and blind, we see great reasons why we should expect these manifestations of restitution both </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">through</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> others than the saints.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">    </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">SHOULD THE CONSECRATED USE MEDICINES?</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   This question naturally suggests itself.  We are neither commanded nor forbidden to use medicines.  In our consecration we gave up human advantages coming to us as to all believers through Christ in exchange for the spiritual advantages offered us.  Hence all </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restitution</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> blessings and privileges we are debarred from </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">asking;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> although God, for his own wise ends, sometimes grants his &quot;new creatures&quot; special favors and manifestations of an earthly sort in their hours of need; even though they do not ask for them.--See</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2009 : page 169::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Matt. 26:53,54`; `Acts 12:6-11`; `14:19,20`; `Phil. 2:27`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It should be noticed, however, that (aside from Christ's work of redemption and restitution) condemned men are privileged to use such natural means as they can command, in food and medicines, for the relief of their ailments and the sustenance, as long as they may be able, of their condemned and dying bodies. And these privileges consequently the saints retain and possess, even after having exchanged the earthly advantages through Christ, for the heavenly advantages.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nothing, then, in their covenant of full consecration, prevents the saints more than unbelievers from using natural means for their relief.  We have the liberty to do so whenever our judgment indicates the expediency.  And though we are not informed that our Lord used medicines, we should remember that he was perfect, and had only such pains and aches as he himself </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">took</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> from others.  However, he certainly illustrated the principle of making use of natural means, not asking divine power for relief, by resting when weary instead of praying for supernatural restoration; and when hungry and thirsty he ate and drank instead of praying for strength and refreshment otherwise.  So, too, it was with the apostles as far as we may know from the meagre scraps of history of their private affairs furnished us in Scripture.  Paul tells us (`2 Cor. 11:27,30`) of his weariness and pains and hunger and thirst and cold and nakedness, and says he gloried in these marks of his faithfulness, but mentions not one word about praying for the removal of these by divine power; nor does he record one answer of such a prayer as a mark of favor with God.  On the contrary, in the single instance he mentions of having prayed for physical restitution (the restoration of his sight), he does tell us that the Lord refused his request, telling him it was best for him so--the grace sufficient being in spiritual and not earthly favors above those of natural men.-- `2 Cor. 12:9`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When Paul was thus needy at times, what did he do?  Did he pray God to feed and clothe him? No; he well knew that God had promised that no good, needful thing should be withheld, so long as he was his servant.  He did not ask God to create money in his pockets, nor to send some kind hearted person, not too lazy to work, with a basket of dainties for him to eat, while he studied or prayed?  No! that was not Paul's sort, else he would not have been selected as &quot;a chosen vessel&quot; to bear the Lord's truth.  When he was hungry Paul neither went out and begged nor staid indoors to pray for the things needed, but went to work at his trade,--tent-making, teaching publicly and privately as opportunities offered; unwilling to ask aid even of the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">believers</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> whom he served; though he well knew that they were negligently losing, both the privilege of giving to his support and the spread of the truth, and also losing the valuable instruction which he could have imparted during those hours necessarily devoted to secular labor.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We remember, too, Paul's advice to Timothy regarding medicine--to take a little wine </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">(as a medicine,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> not as a beverage) for his indigestion and &quot;often infirmities.&quot; And this we find in perfect harmony with Paul's own course and that of our Lord, and therefore certainly a safe guide to us respecting our Father's will.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But, says one, even if it be right to use simple remedies, such as may come under our observation,-- would it be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">right</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to spend the Lord's money (as all the money which the consecrated have is the Lord's) upon physicians?  We answer that our Lord and the disciples spent consecrated money for bread, which is the medicine needed when hungry.  And we presume Timothy, following Paul's counsel, spent some consecrated money for the medicinal wine.  Our Lord and the apostles did not commend medicines and physicians, and doubtless the art was so crude as to be unworthy of commendation; yet they were not condemned, and it was acknowledged that the sick need a physician. (`Matt. 9:12`.)  But in all this we would not be understood as advocating drugs and doses;--moderation should be used in all that we do, that whether we eat or drink or take medicine or whatever, all may be done with reason and to the glory of God.  Probably as many die of too much as of too little medicine.  We should not fill ourselves with medicine nor with wine nor be gluttonous with food; but be temperate in all things.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We cannot for a moment concede as the superiors or equals of our Lord and Paul, in faith or divine favor, some who in our day claim to live by faith, &quot;working not at all;&quot; who do little to weary or pain themselves, and who rejoice that they have no such experiences as Paul had with hunger and cold, and thirst, and nakedness, as marks of special faith and holiness and divine favor.  We believe that many such are sincere children of God, deceived on this question by following their own feelings and inclinations rather than carefully studying the perfect examples of God's will in this matter, furnished in Scripture.--See `2 Thes. 3:8-10,11-15`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In view of the Scripture teaching, we must therefore advise the consecrated to walk in the footsteps of our Lord Jesus and those who followed him most closely; ignoring in this as in other things their own preferences as to how they would </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to think about it, and how they would </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">like</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to do and have God do in such matters.  Let us fully submit our wills and methods</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2009 : page 170::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">to God's plan and arrangement as expressed and illustrated in his Word.  As &quot;new creatures&quot; we may ask freely and persistently for all spiritual blessings and graces, and unselfishly for all our necessities </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">promised.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Then, sure that such will come, we should seek for them and acknowledge them with thankfulness, by whatever agency or channel sent.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But in earthly matters we must be very careful: let us ask for nothing beyond our actual needs, as God (not we) sees the necessity and expediency--thankful always for the &quot;bread and water&quot; promised, as well as for every additional comfort.  Realizing always God's superior wisdom and boundless love for us, we should fear to take our interests in any degree out of his hand. Thus we may always live rejoicing, realizing that, whatever may befall us, all is working out for good to us.  We may need an acquaintance with pain, or to come into perplexity and almost to want, in order to have needful experience or testing or chastisement. And we should learn to search for and appreciate the lesson or chastisement quickly, and prove ourselves apt pupils in the school of Christ.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">          </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">PRAYERS FOR OUR CHILDREN.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">                  ----------</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   Especially in the case of their children, consecrated parents may well feel that, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">now</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in the dawning of the Millennial age, they have special privileges in prayer; for of all classes these are most surely the heirs of restitution blessings.  The children of all believers are </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">justified</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> through the faith of their parents up to the time they reach years of mental discretion. (`1 Cor. 7:14`.) Hence they are heirs of the earthly blessings, restitution, etc.  And now that the Restitution Times are upon us, we should feel great confidence in asking health and strength and life for such.  It would seem indeed that now the children of believers might live on down into the full sunlight of Millennial glory and blessing, when none will die except such as sin wilfully against that light and favor.  Yet in all our requests we cannot ask otherwise than as the Master did, saying--Nevertheless not my will but thine be done.  And it should be the aim and patient endeavor of each parent to bring his children as nearly as possible to the proper point of full consecration--the reasonable service of all.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">GOD'S PROMISES TO DAVID.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">         --JULY 26.--`2 Sam. 7:4-16`.--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">--&quot;In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust.&quot;--`Psa. 71:1`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DAVID was now fairly settled and prosperous in his kingdom, and the nation was enjoying a season of rest and peace; the people were united, the Ark was in Jerusalem and the religious zeal of the nation was revived.  For all these blessings David was grateful; and, desiring to give some tangible expression of his gratitude, he thought of the Ark of God, the symbol of the divine presence, dwelling in a movable tent or tabernacle while he himself dwelt in a house of cedar; and he therefore conceived the thought of utilizing the present seemingly favorable opportunity for erecting a house for the Lord where the symbol of his presence might abide continually.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With this thought in mind, David consulted with the prophet Nathan, who encouraged him to carry out his noble purpose.  Both men desired to render supreme honor and reverence to the Lord and thought the time to do so had come.  In this, however, they were mistaken, as God showed Nathan that night, saying, &quot;Go and tell my servant David,&quot; etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">God showed David that his time for the erection of the more permanent residence had not yet come, and that he had given no command to that effect yet, nor inquired, &quot;Why build ye not me a house of cedar?&quot; etc. (`Vs. 7`.)  Although for a time the nation was enjoying a season of rest and peace, there was yet much to be done in the way both of conquest and of organization, which would of necessity interfere with the proposed work; besides which, the nation must not consider itself so firmly established in the land of promise, until first, according to the divine direction, they had taken full possession and subdued their enemies.  When they had done this, they might consider themselves settled, and build for the Lord a more permanent residence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It was further shown that this work of preparation would require the entire period of David's reign; but the assurance was given to David that his purpose was appreciated and that, though God's time had not yet come, nor would it come in David's time, yet his son and successor should build the house and should enjoy a peaceful and prosperous reign, while David was permitted to prepare the way for it, both by gathering and preparing the materials for its construction, and also by subduing their enemies and ordering the affairs of the kingdom.  This was the work to which David was appointed: he was necessarily a man of war, although a lover of peace.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In this promise concerning the prosperous reign of David's son and heir to his throne, it is plain that there was more implied than was ever fulfilled in Solomon. True, the reign of Solomon was one of unprecedented prosperity and he did build the house of the Lord; but his kingdom did come to an end, the glory departed, the temple perished, whereas the promise to David was, &quot;Thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee: thy throne shall be established forever.&quot;--`Verse 16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The fact is that the promise or prophecy was of twofold application, referring only partially to Solomon</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2010 : page 171::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">and the temple which Solomon was to build, but ultimately to David's greater Son and Lord, our Lord Jesus Christ, whose kingdom is indeed an everlasting kingdom and of whose dominion there shall be no end, and also to that glorious spiritual temple, the gospel Church, exalted and glorified with her Head, toward which all the world shall worship during the Millennial reign. The reign of David, the man of war, prefigured the preparatory work of this Gospel age--the struggles of God's people against the oppositions of sin, the preparation of the living stones for the spiritual temple; while the reign of Solomon represented the glorious reign of Christ and the wealth and wisdom and peace and prosperity which shall characterize it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The purpose of David to build a house for the Lord which should surpass in magnificence the king's palace and every other structure, and thus be an expression on the part of the people of their supreme reverence for him and the symbol of his presence, and the Lord's sanction and subsequent execution of the generous purpose, are often referred to to-day in justification of the large outlay of the church's means in elegant church buildings and furnishments.  But apparently the matter did not appear so to the apostles and the early Church; for they met from house to house and in upper rooms and erected no church buildings: they only sought some convenient place for simple accommodation. Nor do the sacred records give a single intimation that it is the duty of the church to provide in various localities elegant buildings with lofty steeples, chiming bells, grand organs, upholstered pews, stained windows, with elegant pulpit orators and trained choirs.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor do the temple structure and furnishment afford any precedent in justification of these things to-day. The Jewish age was a typical age; its temple and all its appointments were types of the higher spiritual things to come; the typical Ark which rested in the typical temple was a symbol of the divine presence in the midst of his future spiritual Israel; and the typical shadows pass away when the realities come.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is very manifest, moreover, that the church buildings of to-day are more for pride and show, and to attract and hold the rich and influential, and to repel the poor, than to glorify God in any way.  Let us not be deceived with the vain pretensions of earthly glory; but, shunning these things, let us remember that wherever two or three are met together in the Lord's name, that is the house of God, and there his glory is seen and felt.--`John 4:23,24`; `Matt. 18:20`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">IN considering the incident of this lesson we are reminded of the words of the Apostle `James (5:10`) --&quot;Take, my brethren, the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example.&quot;  What examples they present--of faith, humility, meekness, obedience, patience, endurance, brotherly kindness, love.  We call to mind Moses' devotion to God and his cause, his tireless zeal and loving ministry through long years of extreme trial; we mark also the obedient faith of Abraham, of Jacob, of Samuel, of David, and of all the noble list of ancient worthies who fought the good fight of faith with unabated energy to the end of their course.  While we consider these worthy examples of loyalty and faithfulness to God and to his truth and righteousness, we remember that these characters were developed under only the moonlight of the law-dispensation; and, in this view of the matter, reason suggests what the Apostle Peter also calls attention to,--&quot;What manner of persons ought </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">we</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to be in all holy conversation and godliness?&quot; (`2 Pet. 3:11`)--we who are the recipients of the much more abundant grace of this gospel dispensation?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The kindness of David, to which attention is directed in this lesson, is another mark of a noble character. David was now well established and prosperous in his kingdom.  The way to it since his anointing had been a rough and stormy one; and in one of the seasons of severest trial the remarkable friendship between himself and Jonathan, Saul's son, was thoroughly proved and strongly cemented.  And while Jonathan freely submitted to the will of God which intercepted his own succession to the throne of Israel and gave it to David, he desired and received of David the assurance that when he should be thus established in his kingdom he should always show kindness to him and his posterity. See `1 Sam. 20:14-17`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When the days of his prosperity came at length, years after Jonathan had gone to his rest, David, remembering his covenant, began to inquire if there were yet any left of the house of Saul to whom he might show the kindness of God.  He found but one, the only surviving son of his friend Jonathan, and upon him he lavished the affection and kindness which it would have been his pleasure to bestow upon Jonathan himself, had he survived.  Gratefully he remembered the love of his friend, and lovingly he endeavored to requite it to the extent of his ability.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There is really no more worthy trait to adorn a righteous character than that of gratitude.  It is gratitude that returns to God that filial affection which is due from the creature to the Creator.  It is gratitude that encourages and sweetens the cup of loyal devotion between friend and friend.  It is always the due reward of loving service and especially of self-sacrificing service, though it is not always the reward rendered.  The spirit of the world is, alas! so far removed from this that even loving and self-sacrificing service is more frequently rewarded with cold, thankless indifference, and not seldom with reproachfulness or persecution.  Those therefore who will live godly and cultivate the graces of a godly character must not be disappointed in failing of their reward here, and in meeting the rebuffs that are sure to come to them in the line of duty.  Let them duly appreciate their opportunity of proving their devotion</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">to righteousness and truth by taking patiently and bearing with humble fortitude whatever of reproach</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R2011 : page 172::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">or ingratitude may be the present reward, content to await God's time and God's way for giving to righteousness its due reward.  Such overcomers who count not their lives dear unto them are of the David (beloved) class.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The golden text of this lesson needs no comment except the exhortation that we should each more and more endeavor to put it in practice, and to see that with each passing year we are able to note some degree of advancement in this element of godlikeness, not overlooking that sure proof of brotherly love mentioned in the last clause--&quot;in honor preferring one another;&quot; remembering also the similar counsel of the same apostle on another occasion--&quot;In lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves.&quot; (`Phil. 2:3`.) If we merely say that we love one another and yet pursue a steady course of self-seeking, wherein is the love manifest?  Let us not love in word only, but in deed and in truth.--`1 John 3:18`.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--I had a very enjoyable meeting with the brethren at Rapid City, including Brother Zink.  At Shoal Lake I had one public meeting, when I gave a two hours' explanation of the chart.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I was specially pleased with the brethren at Shoal Lake on account of the plain improvement in their characters.  Once before I mentioned to you a noted infidel of a most blasphemous character who had come into the truth.  It was just grand to see the gentleness and humbleness which have taken possession of this former blasphemer.  Whilst I heard him talk, I felt all the time like shouting, &quot;Hallelujah! what a Savior!&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--I notice what you say in a late TOWER concerning our Lord's words to the thief, &quot;Verily, I say to you to-day, thou shalt be with me in paradise,&quot; and in addition suggest the following:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Grammatically, &quot;to-day&quot; is an adverb of time; and the question arises, Does it qualify the verb preceding or succeeding it? </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Is it &quot;say to-day&quot; or &quot;shalt be to-day?&quot;  In this and all kindred cases we must be guided by the sense or context.  Now we have several parallel grammatical constructions to this.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Note `Deut. 8:19`.  &quot;I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.&quot;  Mark that the translators did not punctuate this at all. Why did they punctuate Luke's passage?  The context here shows the adverb of time, &quot;this day,&quot; to qualify the preceding verb, &quot;testify;&quot; </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">i.e.,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the testimony is given this day, and not they would perish this day; for they were to go on trial as to their walk, etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">`Deut. 15:15` is another fitting example of qualifying a preceding verb.  Also `Deut. 30:16`--&quot;In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God,&quot; etc.  And why did not the translators punctuate this as well as the passage in Luke?  Does it not seem as if the translators expressed a preconceived idea by their use of the comma?  Would it not have been better unpunctuated, as they left the other passages?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In evidence that the translators had a preconceived idea about our Lord's words to the thief and that it was not because they lacked grammatical knowledge on this point of an adverb qualifying a verb preceding it, see `Acts 26:29`--&quot;And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">all that hear me this day,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were both almost,&quot; etc.  The Apostle surely did not mean, I wish you were like me for this one day, but I wish that all who hear me this day were like me, Christians, consecrated even unto death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Then our Lord said to the Jews, and later to his disciples, &quot;Where I go ye cannot come.&quot;  Then why should it be thought that he would take the thief with him?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I would like your opinion on `Jno. 5:39`--&quot;Search the Scriptures.&quot; I do not understand this to be a command.  The context to me seems to convey this idea: Jesus referred to a few witnesses regarding himself-- `verse 31`, his own testimony, a true one; `verse 32`, &quot;another&quot; true one; `verse 33`, you sent to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">John,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and he also testified of me; `verse 36`, greater than John's testimony, the works; `verse 37`, the Father also, but, of course, you have never heard his voice nor seen his form, but that would not matter if you only had his word remaining in you.  Why, see here, you search the Scriptures because you think by them to obtain everlasting life and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">these very Scriptures</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you are searching also testify of me. Thus our Lord's words were more of reproach than command or invitation.  Yours in our Redeemer,           F. B. UTLEY.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   [We agree that the last suggestion was probably the intent of our Lord's utterance; but it is undoubtedly the duty as well as well as the privilege of the sons of God to search and study their Father's Word,--that they may know all that he would reveal to them.  The entire suggestion above is good and interesting.  EDITOR]</font><br />
