<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">T</span><span class="font5">HIS journal is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible Instruction, or &quot;S</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">eminar</span><span class="font5">y Extension&quot;, now being presented in ail parts of the civilised world by the Watch Town Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, chartered A. D. 1884, &quot;For the Promotion of Christian Knowledge&quot;. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word but also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society's conventions and of the coming of its traveling representatives, styled &quot;Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our &quot;Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society's published Studies most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., Teibi </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Dei Minister</span><span class="font5"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Minuter of God’s 'Word.</span><span class="font5"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature la considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian's hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus, </span><span class="font5">who gave himself </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> [a </span><span class="font5">corresponding price, a substitute] for all&quot;. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2:6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills ; 2 Peter 1:5-111 of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">what </span><span class="font5">la the fellowship of the mystery which. . </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">.has </span><span class="font5">been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be nmdc known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ages </span><span class="font5">was not made known unto the sons of men as it ia now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men. while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance Into fullest subjection to the will of God m Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord bath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his scruce: hence our decisions relative to what nuij and wlint may not appear jn its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of his Word, for the nnln&gt;i|&gt;Hng of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">urge oug </span><span class="font5">leaders to prove all Its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly made to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the church is “the temple of the living God”, peculiarly &quot;his workmanship”; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel ace—ever since Christ became the world's Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished. Gods blc-ing shall come &quot;to all people&quot;, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 2s : 14; Galalians 3:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers In Christ's atonement for sin, progresses; and when the last of these &quot;living stone-&quot;, “elect and precious,” shall have bccu made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the firsi r&lt;—urrc&lt; non : and the temple shall be filled with bis glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium.—Revelation 13:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that &quot;Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font5">man.&quot; “a ransom for all,” n..&lt;l wi.l be &quot;the true light which hgbteth </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world&quot;,</span><span class="font5"> &quot;in due time&quot;.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1:9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the hope of the church is that &lt;-he may be like her Lord, “see him as be Is,” be &quot;partakers of the divine nature',’ and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">share his </span><span class="font5">glory as Ins Joint-lieir.— 1 John 3.2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the saints for the future work of service: to develop In herself </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font5">grace: to he God's witne-s io the world; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">age.—Ephesians </span><span class="font5">4:12; Matthew </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">24: </span><span class="font5">14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">brought to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">all by </span><span class="font5">Christ's Millennial kingdom, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">restitution of nil that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the bands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font5">Acts 3:1923; Isaiab 35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark3"></a>VIEWS FROM THE WATCH TOWER</span></h3>
<p><span class="font15">G</span><span class="font6">EORGES SCELLE, Professor of the Faculty of Dijon, France, in giving a spring review of the outlook in so-called Christendom, was reported by the San Antonio </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Express</span><span class="font6"> as saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">&quot;In 1921 there are more causes likely to provoke a general European war than there existed in 1914.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">•‘The partition of Asia Minor has aroused hate and old enmities throughout Europe. Four or five nations are at each other’s throats over the division of the spoils. Quarrels in the Balkans are more lively than ever. In the future the Saar valley plebiscite may bring in a conflict. Revolution may break out at any moment in the Ruhr. The Polish question, the Dantzig corridor, the isolation of east Prussia, all are blocks in the way of final peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Silesia is in a turmoil. Teschen is tire cause of a nearwar between Poland and Czechoslovakia which may become serious at any moment. Jugoslavia has failed to become a united nation and Montenegrin Serbs have already revolted, while Hungary is only waiting her hour to strike to commence war on her neighbors. Austria is at death's gasp. Bulgaria is meditating revenge on Greece. The greater Greece of the Sevres treaty is costing hundreds of lives daily and will cost many more. Roumania is menaced on one side by Transylvania and on the other by the Russians through Bessarabia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Remains the post-war rivalry between the United States and. England, already vitally serious, and the antagonism between America and Japan, which all the world expects to result in an armed conflict sooner or later. All the governments of the world, instead of trying to remedy matters, are making them worse by imperialistic policies born of the same motives that brought about the World War. Peoples and governments did nothing to avert the catastrophe of 1914 and they are doing worse than nothing to avert the crash that is coming.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AN EXPECTED CRASH</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Answers,</span><span class="font6"> a London publication, commissioned one of its representatives to interview men prominent in British commercial life and to put to them ths question, “When will the crash come?” The answer of one well known financier was very definite:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘Two or three years,’ he said with decision. ‘If things are allowed to drift, we shall then be utterly unable to purchase the bare necessities of life, and the bulk of our population will die of starvation. Useless to think about transporting them to the Colonies, America—anywhere; there will not be enough ships. Useless to think about appealing for<sup>-</sup> help to other countries; all Europe will be tottering to its fall. Starvation for most of us, emigration for the majority of the survivors, the setting of England’s sun as a commercial nation—this will be inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘There will, of course, be commercial crashes earlier,’ he added, ‘but the great danger is the complete and final shattering of our economic structure, and that will surely come about if we do not export sufficient manufactured goods to pay for the food that we must import to maintain our population.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I repeated the substance of this statement to an eminent economist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘Yes, I agree,’ he remarked. ‘But the crash which is creating so much nervousness in business circles will, in my opinion, take place this year.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mr. Lloyd George, British Premier, in a speech addressed to fellow Welchmen, incidentally reviewed some of the world’s problems and described its conditions. Coyly conscious of alluding to Scripture, he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The world is reeling under the most terrible blows that have ever been struck. It is restless; it is demoralised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The machinery of trade is dislocated. New nations are rising up as on the morning of the resurrection, and the new light is dazzling them. They are reeling like drunk men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is a very common declaration in these days that there must be something radically wrong with society, that millions of people should be out of work, and that millions more are unable to sell what they have produced. These remarks are usually made with an air of profundity. But it really requires no very keen insight to observe the facts; they are so apparent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“TOO MUCH ORGANIZATION”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Among those who believe there is something wrong but few have any suggestion looking toward improvement. One of these few is the National City Bank of New York. In its monthly publication that institution says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“It is admitted that something is radically wrong. It is wrong that great numbers of people should be so ill-informed about economic affairs that instead of acting in a manner calculated to secure cooperation and stability they use their influence to break down the delicately balanced industrial organization and create confusion and disorder. The modern industrial organization is dependent upon intelligent, voluntary, harmonious cooperation on the part of all the people. It requires that the people shall distribute themselves according to choice in the various industries, and so direct their individual policies as to keep the industries in balance and accomplish a ready exchange of products. If through mistaken ideas of self-interest they organize themselves into groups, either national groups, class groups, or occupational groups, and become so intent upon forwarding group interests that they lose sight of the necessity for general cooperation, the wliole modern system of highly-developed industry will break down. It will be strangled by too much organization. There is indeed something radically wrong with society, and this is It.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While the above quoted ideas of the National City </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Bank seem </span><span class="font6">plausible, they do not answer the very present question in the minds of less favored people. One of these, a railroad mechanic, writing in a conservative publication, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘I am earning $48 a month now. My rent is $35, gas $7, carfare $5, but why should I kick? I still have $1 left. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Maybe </span><span class="font5">that's the one the railroads want. A man doesn’t have to be a socialist,’ remarks the man drily, ‘to see that he is the goat’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">DISADVANTAGED FARMERS</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If the mechanics are in an unfavorable situation then the farmers are in still a worse state. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Oklahoma Farmer</span><span class="font6"> is authority for the statement that it requires the hides from three carloads of cattle to purchase one set of farm harness. Careful inquiry produced the information that the buyer of hides would have to be convinced that a cowhide was something special before he would pay more than a dollar for it. At the hardware stores they found that it would take $95.00 to pay for a complete set of fair quality working harness. Only a few months ago the price of the same set of harness is said to have been $125.00. In addition to this, and in harmony with it. the Hattiesburg (Miss.) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American </span><span class="font6">sets forth the fact that the hides from twenty-two calves bring the farmer $13.20, reckoned at six cents a pound. That same farmer, if he desires to purchase a pair of shoes made from his own calf-skins, pays $12.00 for the pair, leaving him a balance of $1.20 in theory, but very much behind in fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">When the price of wheat went down some months ago the large financial interests announced through the public press that the trouble was due to a falling off in foreign demand. The farmers started an investigation and found that more than two hundred million bushels had already been exported and one hundred million bushels had been purchased for future delivery. This was eighty million bushels more than the estimated surplus of wheat in this country. Then the great financial interests issued another explanation. This time they said that the purchases of wheat for export had been made largly for the British Royal Commission in such a way that competition was eliminated and prices held down. Thereupon some of the farmers’ organizations ferreted out the facts. They discovered that the export price of wheat during November, 1919, made an average of $2.81 per bushel; for the same month in 1920 the average was $2.61 a bushel. The average price received by the farmer in Nevember of 1919 was $1.70 a bushel; the average price received by the farmer in November, 1920, was about $1.00 a bushel. From these figures it is apparent that the European buyer paid thirty cents a bushel more for wheat in 1920 than he did in 1919. From the same set of figures it is equally apparent that the American producer received seventy cents less per bushel for his wheat than he did the year before. This leaves an extra dollar per bushel for all the wheat exported. A small percentage of this extra profit was eaten up by the increased freight rates, but the most of it found lodgment elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PREACHING PROFESSION DECLINING</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While it is not so profitable to be a farmer, the preaching business seems to be also on the decline, if we are to take seriously the words of the Bishop of London, as recorded by the Newcastle (Eng.) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Chronicle:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘The business men of London are not such fools as to put their sons to such a rotten profession as preaching,’ said Dr. Ingram, Bishop of London, in a speech here advocating better pay for clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘By their niggardly support of the church at the present time', he added, ‘the people of England are undermining the ministry itself.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It must be said in explanation of this Episcopal gentleman’s remarks that he does not mean to imply that actual putrefaction has set in. The word ‘rotten’ is merely a bit of English slang intended to suggest the undesirability, and withal unprofitableness of the preaching profession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Bohemians are deserting the Roman Catholic faith by the hundreds of thousands and allying themselves with the new state church of Czecho-Slovakia. More than a million Bohemians have left the Romanist ranks, generally taking the church buildings and priests with them. The Baltimore </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American</span><span class="font6"> reports as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Priests of all orders, as well as those who during the Austrian regime contributed millions of crowns yearly to the Catholic treasury, have joined this formidable separatist movement, with the result that hundreds of churches are no longer celebrating masses, while the few remaining Roman Catholic priests are unable to find more than 10,000 of their flocks in all Bohemia.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The papal officials are considering making a formal complaint to the League of Nations in an effort to induce Czecho-Slovakia to pay for the churches which were taken without formalities, and also to indemnify former priests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While this rather serious blow to Romanist prestige in Central Europe is recorded, papal adherents in other quarters believe that Rome is gaining ground. The Manchester (Eng.) </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catholic Herald</span><span class="font6"> finds occasion for gratification in the increased observances of Good Friday on the part of Protestants. It remarks editorially:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“‘The Christian world was all Catholic once, and once again It will be Catholic.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Such is the statement that thoughtful men, men of no religion or of no creed, frequently make.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“We read that on Good Friday a Church of England clergyman gathered a number of ministers of various denominations to hold the Three Hour's Service, a custom now very widespread in the Church of England, but not, as far as we know, hitherto participated in by Non-conformists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“There were present three Congregational ministers, also a Presbyterian, a Baptist, a Wesleyan, and a Primitive Methodist.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">CHRISTENDOM’S CONFIDENCE IN MONEY</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Churchman</span><span class="font6">. an Episcopalian organ of this country. makes an interesting ami honest confession, which sc quote:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;Clear ns a fluming lieacon it is written in the Gospels that we might live line. Since the war there has been Riven to the Church of Christ the .....st romantic, chivalrous</span></p>

Those who should be uttering uttered the beatitudes were dumb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">&quot;The next Bishop of New York must build the cathedral, we ure told. A cathedral is the last thing which tbi- great city needs.

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GENERAL SMUTS ON THE LEAGUE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This power of money was attempted to be crystallized in the League of Nations. Those who are even moderately familiar with the bringing into being of the League know that it was formulated and that it has been most strenuously advocated by Great Britain. France has never had any use for it. nor has she ever paid any attention to it. Only Anglophiles in this country have .sought to bring about it- complete establishment. It is an interesting bit of substantiary information which we take from a speech of General Smuts, made in Johannesburg. South Africa, and reported by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rand Daily Mail</span><span class="font6"> of that city:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“’After all. it is useless talking about the league when you do not want to lie a member of the British Empire. [Applause] The League is very largely modelled on the unwritten working constitution of the British Empire. The people who gave most thought to the impression of the great plan worked absolutely with the British Empire before them—the League of Nations v. ns framed on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“‘I feel on this occasion, continued the Premier, when great issues are at stake, that I can do liest in the cause of the League of Nations by fighting the cause of the British Empire. (Prolonged applause]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“‘I^et me just say this: People who have not given great thought to the subject don't realize that in some curious way the fate of the British Empire will in the future be linked with the late of the league of Nations.’”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘Although it does not seem a very great result of all we hoped and fought for,’ said the Premier, ‘I feel certain that the League of Nations is the mustard seed, small today, diminutive and insignificant, but which will grow and expand, and in the in the centuries to come will cover the face of the earth.’ &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A JEW ON THE PALESTINE MANDATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But all witnesses are not agreed that the Britanno-League-of-Nations lias worked any weal for humanity. Israel Zangwill. the distinguished Jewish man of letters, in writing in the Boston </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sunday Advertiser,</span><span class="font6"> says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“ ‘Life caricatures our concepts,’ complained Dr. Herzl to me in the early days of his movement, and. indeed. history lias few' grimmer ironies to show than (that] his noble and pacific vision of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the Jewish state </span><span class="font5">should draw its hopes of realization from the bloodiest war of history, or that, on the embodiment of Mr. Balfour's promise in the Turkish conditions a Zionist ieadei in Jerusalem should have ordered the Shofar to be sounded as at the coming of the Messiah; and have thus officially identified a dubious political transaction with the ‘one far-off divine event’ for which Jewish mysticism has waited for nigh two thousand years. It is only another proof of the demoralizing effects of racial egotism and political faction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just what Mr. Zangwill means by these words becomes more apparent from a reading of his contribution to the London </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Spectator,</span><span class="font6"> on the same subject:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“If the hack-word ‘amazing’ had really been put out at grass. as you report suggests. 1 should have had to call it back to characterize your attitude on the Palestine question. You continue to gird at Sir Herbert Samuel's appointment, as though no duty rested upon the Entente or the League of Nations to carry out the Zionist item of the Turkish Peace Treaty or the solemn promise which preluded it— a promise w Inch was ns dangerous to the Jews in enemy countries as it was valuable to the Entente nt a dark moment In its fortunes. I was not surprised to see the ,1/orn-</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">ir.fl Post</span><span class="font5"> anxious to reduce Mr. Balfour’s pledge to ‘a scrap ot puper’—the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> is a militarist journal—but to find a re-s]&gt;ectuble Christian organ, nay, the Christian family organ, backing and buttering up the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font5"> calls Indeed for the impugned epithet. The fact that the present Palestine plan is a disastrous defeat for the cause for which Dr. Herzl besought my services a quarter of a century ago, and that the appointment of Sir Herbert Samuel is </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font5"> mere cover for the practical repudiation of the Balfour omi.se. adds to the audacity of the pretense that a ‘ himnosa hiereditas’ has been inflicted upon poor suffering Britain, already-staggering under the ‘too vast orb of her fate’. The .Vornt'np </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Post</span><span class="font5"> actually declares that the Jews get everything and England nothing. The truth is the exact reverse. Indeed, the acquisition of a buffer-state for the defense of Egypt has been the chief argument put forward by the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Manchester Guardian</span><span class="font5"> in its persistent plea for Zionism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“The idea that without any special status or privileges a ‘Jewish National Home’ can emerge in Palestine in face of the present Arab preponderance—even though this is far smaller than the fifteen to one which you allege—is an illusion all the more pitiful because so many millions of homeless wandering Jews have been shamelessly buoyed up with a Messianic dream, the collapse of which cannot fail to be tragic. But a certain enrichment of population and fertility must as inevitably ensue in the new and largely derelict British possession under such an able administrator as Sir Herbert Samuel, especially with so much Jewish enthusiasm to exploit, and if he is as ‘timid and weak-hearted’ as you say, all the less chance of bis departing from the official British tradition in favor of his own race. The Arab will soon learn that Sir Herbert Samuel has not the remotest intention of enslaving or evicting him, and will as little justify your fears of a Jewish domination ns my hopes of a Jewish State. As for your idea that Mr. Lloyd George had to find him a good job, it is an open secret that he refused office under the present Premier, loyally sticking to Asquith. England is to be congratulated on so able and high-minded a servant, though his appointment is to Zionism proper a shorter way of spelling disappointment. The headship of a Jewish hero like Jabotinsky was necessary in Palestine, if Israel—like other beneficiaries of the war for the principle of mil tonalities—was to reenter the circle of nations: the real makers of history come not from Cabinets but from prisons.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark5"></a>THE KING’S HEART’S DESIRE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Thou hast given him his heart’s desire.”—Psalm 21:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font6">SALM 21 is the coronation psalm of Israel. In all probability it was written for the occasion of David’s own coronation, but being “a psalm of David”, it must be understood as bearing upon him </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font6">is David’s Son and David’s Lord. Its subject matter is very intimately connected with that of Psalm </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">20, </span><span class="font6">which contains the prayer: “Grant thee thy heart’s desire, and fulfill all thy counsel”.—Psalm 20: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">that Psalm either Jesus is represented as soliloquizing, and reassuring himself; or the divine purposes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font6">personified, and thus speak. The time is the time </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">trouble, not primarily Christendom’s time of trouble but the time of distress and difficulty which was upon Jesus himself. In certain respects this trouble stretched over the whole three and a half years of his ministry, finding its culmination in the Garden of Gethsemane where “with strong cryings and tears” our Lord faced the most momentous questions of his whole existence. Indeed it would not be inappropriate to stretch the application of this time of trouble to the whole period of his humiliation, including the humiliation of his body (Philippians 3:21) and the closing time of trouble of this gospel age and to apply the final ‘setting up on high’ to the exaltation in the kingdom. But the simplest picture is to apply it to our Lord Jesus himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">“SET THEE UP-ON HIGH”</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">1. “Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high;</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">2. Send thee help from the sanctuary, And strengthen thee out of Zion;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">3. Remember all thy offerings, And accept thy burnt sacrifice.”</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Did Jehovah answer Jesus there in the Garden? Oh yes: Jehovah heard him always. (John 11:42) Jehovah answered Jesus because he knew and trusted in the name of Jehovah, the God of Jacob. The God of Jacob was he who had met Jacob (the people of Israel) when that nation was nothing and had nothing, and who yet promised them everything. This thought of God’s bounty is expressed in New Testament language by the words, “the God of all grace”.—1 Peter 5: 10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">name of</span><span class="font6"> Jehovah, the God of Jacob, is very significant. It does not apply merely to the words </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">God or Jehovah,</span><span class="font6"> but to the character which is back of those words. To praise God’s holy name means much more than shout ‘glory to God’; it means to approve and to laud the blessed character of our Creator and covenant God. Concerning Jesus it was promised: “Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will. I deliver him: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font6">will set him on high, because he hath </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">known my name”.</span><span class="font6"> (Psalm 91: 14) To be ‘set on high’ evidently means to be assured of the appreciation and fellowship of Jehovah, communion with him who is the “High Tower” of the new creation. The margin uses the word support, instead of set on high. Although this prayer </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">Psalm 20 applies particularly to Jesus, there are</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font6">other statements which assure all the messiahs, or anointed ones, in a similar manner. As it is written: “Jehovah also will be a tower for the oppressed, a high tower in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">times</span><span class="font6"> of trouble; and they that </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">know thy name</span><span class="font6"> will put their trust in thee”.—Psalm 9:9, 10; See also 46: 7, 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This prayer indicates expectancy that the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">name</span><span class="font6"> of Jehovah would set Jesus on high. How can this be? In this way: Jesus was in the character likeness of his Father. The possession of this character likeness made it possible for the Father to communicate with and convey messages to Jesus to an extent impossible with us, his imperfect followers. To him, for the same reason, was the spirit of God and of holiness given without measure. He knew what Jehovah meant when he said thus and so; he knew how Jehovah felt; he knew his Father’s desires, his preferences, his will. Therefore, the possession of a Godlike character made it possible for Jesus to reach up to his High Tower and ours, and to receive the uplifting and buoying assurances of the Father that all was well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">SUPPORT FROM ZION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Jehovah sent help from his sanctuary, from the Most Holy, from Zion, from the heavenly condition itself. Although there seems to be no adequate textual support for the story incorporated in the later manuscripts of Luke’s Gospel, to the effect that an angel from heaven ministered to and comforted Jesus in Gethesemane, still some such comfort was evidently given him; for he became convinced that death under the charge of blasphemy was a part of the Father’s plan for him, and seeing it to be the Father’s will, he was serene. Jehovah not only sent his Son help from his exalted sanctuary, but he strengthened or supported him in the trying hours following the Garden.—Psalm 3: 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">God remembered the offering which Jesus had made of himself, as well as those offerings which were to come afterwards, but the acceptability of which depended on Jesus’ entire faithfulness and integrity. Yes, more than this: all the offerings of all mankind throughout the thousand years of Messiah’s reign depended upon the perfect conformity of Jesus to the will of the Father. No doubt these facts bore heavily upon our Savior in the Garden, for he was “exceeding sorrowful, even unto death”. (Matthew 26:38) But he was not more conscious of these facts than </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font6">Jehovah. He who “worketh all things according </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">the counsel of his own will” did not forget; he remembered all the High Priest’s offerings, both then present and to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE BURNT SACRIFICE TURNED TO ASHES</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Furthermore, the God of Jacob, the God of mercy and grace, did not only remember his Son’s interests, but he accepted the burnt sacrifice. All the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">things 166</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6">which were burnt on the copper altar in the Court of the Tabernacle or of the Temple were </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">burnt</span><span class="font6"> sacrifices. Every offering was in part a burnt offering, because, since fire was the chosen manifestation of God’s presence, the portion of each sacrifice specially dedicated to him was consumed by fire. But the term is generally restricted to that which was a </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font6"> burnt-offering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In this passage, Psalm 20: 3, the Revised Version margin gives for “accept” the rendering “accept as fat”. The Common Version gives in the margin, “turn to ashes”. This is evidently the thought: ‘accept thy burnt-offering by turning it to ashes’; i. e., the fact that the broken body of the daily sacrifice was consumed on the brazen altar by the fire once sent from heaven and in accord with the directions once given from heaven was not only an assurance that the sacrifice was acceptable, but it was an indication to proceed with the other phases of the ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It was always by fire that a sacrifice was accepted. It was thus, probably, that God “had respect” to the offering made by Abel. (Genesis 4:4) That is how ‘God testified of his [Abel’s] gifts’. (Hebrews 11:4) It was thus that Abel “obtained witness that he was righteous”. No sacrifice which God specifically accepted or to which he wished to call particular attention was ever consumed by fire emanating from this earth. It was consumed by “fire from heaven”. (Leviticus 9: 24) When it so chanced that sacrifices were offered apart from the place which Jehovah had chosen and appointed and where he had set his name and where his miraculous fire already was, then the fire had either to fall specially from heaven or come by heavenly command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE HEAVEN-SENT FIRE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In connection with the dedication of the Tabernacle in the wilderness, of the priestly order, and of all the furnishments and utensils of the Tabernacle, we read of Jehovah’s promise that upon the completion of certain stipulated ceremonies ‘the glory of the Lord should appear’ (Leviticus 9:6), that is, God would give the most noticeable sign of his presence among them, of his approval of the Tabernacle, its officiators, and accoutrements, to show that everything had been done according to his instructions. (Exodus 24:17) And, in addition to the glory, a fire came out from before the Lord and consumed the burnt-offering, etc. This was the proof which God gave upon extraordinary occasions of his acceptance of a sacrifice. This was done, aside from the probable case of Abel (Genesis 4:4), in the case of Aaron (Leviticus 9:24); in the case of Gideon (Judges 6:21); in the case of Manoah and his wife (Judges 13:19-23); in the case of David dedicating the threshing floor of Oman (1 Chronicles 21: 26); in the case of Solomon dedicating the Temple (2 Chronicles 7:1); and in the case of Elijah.—1 Kings 18: 38.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">'Jo express the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">accepting</span><span class="font6"> of an offering or sacrifice the verb </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">dashan</span><span class="font6"> is used, winch signifies </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">to reduce to ashes,</span><span class="font6"> that is, by fire from heaven. In such a case as the dedicating of the Tabernacle it was necessary that the fire be very apparently of divine origin, and that it should come in such a way as to preclude the supposition that any art or deceit had been practised on the occasion. It would not do for Moses and Aaron </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font6">bring this fire out of the Tabernacle with the claim that God had kindled it there for them; for then there might be ground for doubt as to its genuineness. The fire </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">came out</span><span class="font6"> from before the Lord, and </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">all the people saw</span><span class="font6"> it. The victims were consumed by fire which was quite manifestly of no human origin. Josephus says that “a fire proceeded from the victims themselves, of its own accord, which had the appearance of a flash of lightning”. An ethereal or electric spark or flash was sent immediately from the divine presence, either as represented in the glory light of the Most Holy or in the pillar of cloud above the tent of meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The devil, in order to give credit to his worship among heathen peoples, imitated this miracle. The Romans claimed that Jupiter testified his approbation of the sacrifices offered to him by the sound of thunder and the show of lightning: to this the Latin poet Virgil alludes: “Audiat hsec genitor, qui feeders fulmine sancit” —Tet Jupiter hear, who sanctions covenants by his thunder’. Servius, a Latin commentator on Virgil, says of this passage: “To sanction the covenant signifies to confirm it; for when a covenant was made, if there were a flash of lighning, it was considered to be thereby confirmed: or rather because our ancestors lighted no fires, but obtained by their supplications divine fire,” etc. The expression about their ancestors shows that they could boast of no such fire then. Either Satan had at one time imitated the miraculous fire for them or they had simply borrowed the account from the Jews, as Virgil surely borrowed his description of the golden age from Isaiah. Solinus Polyhistor gives an account to the same effect; speaking of the Hill of Vulcan in Sicily, he says: “They who perform sacred rites in this place, put a bundle of vine tree wood upon the altar, but put no fire to it; for when they lay the pieces of the victim upon it, if the deity be present and he approve the sacrifice, the bundle, although of green wood, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">takes fire of itself</span><span class="font6"> and without any other means the deity himself kindles the flame”. These are noteworthy instances, for they show either how exactly the heathen writers have borrowed from the sacred records or how exactly the devil’s religion copied that of Jehovah. As a further imitation, the Romans had their perpetual fire in the Temple of Vesta, which they claimed to have descended at the first from heaven and which they kept with the most religious veneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">FIRE AND THE “LIVING” SACRIFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The celestial fire which was sent by Jehovah to consume the sacrifices on the brazen altar in the first official Tabernacle is said by the Jews to have been scrupulously preserved up to the time of Solomon, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">when </span><span class="font6">it was renewed by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">God. </span><span class="font6">This seems unlikely </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font6">first thought; but it is quite possible that, in view </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">the lesson as to its sacredness which God gave in </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">deaths of Nahab and Abihu, the Jews, even in the midst of idolatry and unfaithfulness, kept this fire </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">going </span><span class="font6">out of superstitious fear. It was evidently going </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font6">the time of David; for, though the ark was at Zion, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">brazen altar was at Gibeon, and Zadok, the priest, offered burnt offerings there. (1 Chronicles 16: 39, 40) Jewish rabbins and historians insist that the miracu</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">lous </span><span class="font6">fire once kindled on the great altar in Solomon’s Temple was never allowed to go out until Manasseh tore down the altar. This was certainly the law on the subject. (Leviticus 6:13) But even the Jews admit that after the captivity there was no miraculous fire, no Shekinah light, and no tables of the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This divine fire was an emblem of the holy spirit. And as no sacrifice could be acceptable to God which was not salted, seasoned, or rendered pleasing by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">this </span><span class="font6">fire, as our Lord says (Mark 9:49), so no one can offer acceptable sacrifices to God unless it be in the spirit of holiness—the love of righteousness and hatred </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">iniquity. Hence the command for the disciples to tarry in Jerusalem before beginning their antitypical </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;living</span><span class="font6"> sacrifices”, i. e., daily or continuous sacrifices. They should wait for the spirit under the emblem of fire (Matthew 3:11); and it did actually descend in this similitude on the day of Pentecost.—Acts 2:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">So, it was not possible for the priest in the type of Israel’s daily evening sacrifice to proceed into the Holy until God’s fire from heaven had started the consumption of the lamb’s carcase on the altar in the Court, for it was coals from this fire which was consuming the sacrifice in the Court which had to be carried along into the Holy and there used to kindle </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">incense which was burnt on the golden altar. At all events, regardless of the order, it had to be fire from off the altar.—Exodus 30:7; Numbers 16:46.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ACCEPTED SACRIFICE AND PRAYER</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Incense is ever a symbol as well as a fitting picture of prayer; prayer in its broader signification of fellowship praise, service. Note the connection between incense and prayer in Psalm 141: 2 and Luke 1:10. Compare also Jonah 2: 7. Psalm 20 by its conjunctive Selah joins the thoughts of accepted sacrifice and prayer, even as they were joined in the type of the daily evening sacrifice contained in the ceremonial law of Israel. In the type, no incense could arise until the sacrifice had been accepted or salted by fire, so in the antitype </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">there can be no true prayer apart from accepted sacrifice. </span><span class="font6">The accepted sacrifice is the basis of prayer, and the prayer is the outcome of the accepted sacrifice. Dear Brethren, shall we not rejoice at the presence of the fire? Is it not a mark of divine approval; without which we cannot have fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ; without which we know not to praise God aright; without which we know not to serve him ? The fire comes and, like a sizzling branding-iron, burns the vital truths of God’s Word into our very beings. Then we have something to talk over with the Father; then we have reason to praise him; then we have the impulse to serve him as he ought to be served, in spirit and in truth; then we can have acquiescence in the painful features of God’s purposes. On that bitter night in the Garden of Gethsemane the fire which had come from heaven in the shape of the fresh realization of and keener insight into God’s purposes for him, burned into our Lord’s consciousness until it was impossible for him to disagree with the Father, and the incense smoke rose up to heaven in a grand volume of amen and amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">NO STRANGE FIRE EFFECTIVE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">All other fire than that from the brazen altar was “strange fire”. (Leviticus 10:1, 2) It did not come from heaven, “from before the Lord”; and it was for this reason that it could not be used to kindle the incense upon the golden altar. Jehovah wanted the fire to be his own. So with the church of this gospel age: the fire must come from heaven, the suffering must be heaven-appointed, it must be The reproaches that fell upon him’, it must be the ignominy and shame which attach to faithful proclamation of the message of the gospel, if we are to have anything to pray about and any ground for acceptance of our' prayers through the great High Priest in the Holiest of all, even heaven itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Only the new creature can pray in this especially significant sense. Acceptable worship must be true and in the spirit of the petitioned. (John 4: 24) In preliminary ways, as well as in the final sense, is it true that “'that which is engendered of the flesh is flesh”. (John 3:6) The flesh cannot pray. That is, the spirit of the flesh as the flesh now is has nothing to pray about. The flesh represents self-will, as Adam followed the flesh instead of the spirit of God when he disobeyed. The flesh can “say prayers”, or offer prayer, but “it profiteth nothing”. (John 6: 63) For the flesh to pray is like offering strange or common fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The remainder of Psalm 20 describes the benefit which the church class receives form viewing the Father’s treatment of his Son. Psalm 21 then takes up the matter at the time of our Savior’s resurrection. The Selah between verses 2 and 3 leads the mind forward and shows what these heart’s desires were, which had been mentioned in Psalm 20: 4. Hence the Selah follows the answer to the prayer (Psalm 21: 2); and in giving the reason for the answer reveals to us what the petitions of the prayer were.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">MET WITH BLESSINGS AND BOUNTIES</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">2. “Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, And hast not withholden the request of his lips.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Selah.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">3. For thou meetest him with the blessings of good tilings;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">4. He asked life of thee; thou gavest it him, Even length of days for ever and ever.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">5. His glory is great in thy salvation:</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">C. For thou makest him most blessed for ever: Thou makest. him glad with joy in thy presence.” </span><span class="font6">It will not be irreverential if we draw a comparison from human life. Who has not seen a wearied and perhaps weeping child fall asleep on Christmas Eve, howbeit hoping for the blessings of the morrow? The first thing it knows in the morning is the parent’s call and caresses, and armloads of presents to make it glad. So Jesus, Jehovah’s wearied and most-loved child, sorrowed to sleep on Calvary. With what tenderness the Father must have watched through the night of his Son’s death, waiting for the morning and conning over the coming happiness of his child. The next thing Jesus knew was the voice of his Father, saying, in effect and possibly in words: Jesus! it is time to wake up now; here is your wonderful new clothing which I have prepared for you and promised; here are the good things which your heart desired!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With what quivers of joy must not the opening eyes of Jesus have gazed upon the face of his Father, whose kindly features had so lately dimmed from view as the light of life flickered low and out. But now! Gone the night, the sorrows over, home at last!</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In some such way did Jehovah &quot;'bring the first-born again into the habitable’ (Hebrews 1: 6) and ‘meet him with the blessings of good things’.—Psalm 21:3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What those good things were and are is implied by the following verses. There was endless divine life; there was glory, honor, and majesty; there was joy in the presence of Jehovah; there was eternal steadfastness and assurance that his own trial time was past; there was the needed discernment to hunt out all enemies and the power to destroy them as enemies in the fire of the world’s time of trouble,; there was power to praise God as he should be praised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">AN IMPORTANT CONFUSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">But there is something in connection with this satisfying of the desires of the king’s heart that may be overlooked in the Common Version account. A part of what now appears as the superscription to Psalm 22 belongs as the subscription to Psalm 21. There would be no way to determine for a certainty about this matter were it not for the fact that a detached psalm is given us in the third chapter of Habakkuk. Since this is a typical psalm standing by itself, with no other psalm proceeding or following it, we can see for ourselves what style was observed in the denoting of the psalms. There is (1) a superscription, (2) the psalm proper, and (3) a subscription. The superscription forms the title, not unlike the main headings of articles in this journal. In some cases the historical circumstances which gave rise to the writing of the psalm are given in the title, as a very appropriate subsidiary part of the heading. The subscription consists of the directions concerning the use of the psalm, when such were given. Whatever were the circumstances which occasioned the writing of the poem at first, or however prophetic its content, when it was formally handed over to the leader of the Temple choir it was so marked, with sometimes an intimation of the appropriate time for the using of such song.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We find the same three divisions in the “writing of Hezekiah” (Isaiah 38:9-20), which was that king’s psalm of praise and thanksgiving for recovery from his great sickness. In verse 9 there is the superscription or title; in verses 10 to 20 there is the psalm proper; and in verse 20 the subscription. King Hezekiah acted as his own musical director and ordered the psalm to be used in the Temple worship during the rest of his lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">To demonstrate the ease with which the subscription of one psalm (not standing alone) may be confused with the title or superscription of the next psalm, we reproduce herewith a few lines covering the ending of Psalm 21 and the beginning of Psalm 22, from Ginsburg’s Massoretico-Critical Edition of the Hebrew Bible:</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">An example of the confusion which has arisen from assuming that the titled Psalms have two parts (the title and the body) instead of three (the title, the body, and the subscription) may be seen by looking at Ps</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">alm </span><span class="font6">88. As the Psalms are divided in our Common Version, and in every otner version back to and including the Hcptuagint, this one Psalm has two authors, lint the difficulty is at once removed by observing that the first part of the title belongs as an adscript to the preceding Psalm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE HIND OF THE MORNING</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This matter bears upon the subject in hand in this way: the most of what now appears at the head ol Psalm 22 should be at the end of Psalm 21, which is under discussion. It reads: “For the chief musician, concerning Aijeleth hash-Shahar”. The “higher critics” see nothing in this but a possible allusion to some kind of musical instrument, although all seem to be agreed that the meaning of the actual words is “hind [or gazelle]of the morning”. (See Revised Version, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">margin) </span><span class="font6">But we look for something more dignified and worthy of divine revelation than mere guesses about wind instruments. The words </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">hind of the morning</span><span class="font6"> are a figure </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font6">speech not infrequently found in Eastern and NearEastern literature. The expression is found in Arabian poetry today.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Just as the horns of the hind may be seen above the rising ground before his body comes into view, so the timorous dawn, ere it is emboldened by the actual body of the sun, shoots up over the horizon its horns or rays of light, and becomes thus the harbinger of a new day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The meaning therefore of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Aijeleth hash-Shahar</span><span class="font6"> is clear. It refers to the rays of the rising sun, and may </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font6">well expressed in our language by </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the day dawn. </span><span class="font6">Having gotten so far, the mind of the earnest Bible student will have no need to go down into Egypt for </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">help, </span><span class="font6">or to turn to the wise men of Babylon for their traditions. The Scriptures will prove our all sufficient guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Do </span><span class="font6">we not read of the promised dawn of a day that </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">will </span><span class="font6">bring peace and blessing to a sin-di stressed and sorrow-distracted world? Do we not read of how “darkness covers the earth [Christendom] and gross darkness </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font6">people”—heathendom? (Isaiah 60:2) Do not the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">same </span><span class="font6">sacred writings tell us that “the night is far </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">spent” ? </span><span class="font6">The memorable last words of David tell of this coming dawn of a better day, and how One, as the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">sun, </span><span class="font6">shall cover all the earth with the glory of his light. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">that prophetic utterance he reveals what Isaiah meant when he said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Behold, kings shall rule in righteousness,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And princes shall rule in judgment.”—Isaiah 32:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Not only do “the last words of David” refer to this coming glorious day (2 Samuel 7) but also his “prayers” end with the same reference:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“Blessed be Jehovah God, the God of Israel,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Who only doeth wondrous things :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And blessed be his glorious name for ever;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">And let the whole earth be filled with his glory; </span><span class="font5">Amen, and amen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">—Psalm 72 : 18-20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It is difficult to think of anything more to pray for when that prayer shall Ire answered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE LAST WORDS OF DAVID</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The last words of David, the son of Jesse,” already referred to as touching on the blessed theme, read :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[The Authority for Speaking]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“David the son of Jesse saith,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">And the man who was raised up on high, The anointed of the God of Jacob, And the sweet psalmist of Israel, saith, The spirit of the Lord spake in me And his word was upon my tongue. The God of Israel said, The Hock of Israel spake to me: One that ruleth over men righteously, That ruleth in the fear of God, [The Day Dawn]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">He shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun riseth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Even a morning without clouds;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As a tender grass springing out of the earth By clear shining after rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">;The Righteous Rule]</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For is not my house thus with God?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For this is all my salvation and all my desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">For shall not he make it to prosper?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">—2 Samuel 23:1-5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In Hebrew each of these last four lines begins with the same word, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">for.</span><span class="font6"> The Authorized Version renders them “although”, “yet,” “for,” and “although”. The Revised Version, “verily,” “yet,” “for,” and “although”. But it is better to render the word uniformly as is done in the Revised Version margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Is not this the day dawn of which David prophesied and sang ? Is not this the day dawn for which creation groans and for which both spiritual and fleshly Israel wait? In another place this waiting for the morning is beautifully expressed:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">“I wait for Jehovah, my soul doth wait, And in his Word do I hope. My soul waiteth for Jehovah, More than they that watch for the morning;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I say, more than they that watch for the morning.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">—Psalm 130: 5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This is “the hind of the morning”, this is the day dawn, the subject to which Psalm 21 relates. This is “the tender mercy” of God; this is “the dayspring from on high” whose visitation is celebrated in the prophetic song of Luke 1: 78.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SCOPE OF PSALM TWENTY-ONE</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Having thus seen the general subject matter of the Psalm, let us look at the outline of its structure:</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jehovah Addressed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A 1. The King’s rejoicing in Jehovah’s power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">B a 2-5. Jehovah’s gifts to the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">b 6. Jehovah’s appointments for the King.—R.V., </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">c 7. Reason for the King’s establishment</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The King Addressed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">B a</span><span class="font5"> 8-10. The King’s judgment on his enemies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">b 11. His enemies’ devices against the King.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">c 12. Reason for his enemies being driven away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font5"> 13. His • people’s rejoicing in Jehovah’s migli.y deeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This great Messiah, the spiritual Seed of Abraham, the Ruler of men, will first put down his enemies, who are at the same time the real enemies of men. For while those enemies are active there can be no peace; while they rule there can be no blessing. Thon he will bring light and blessing and peace and glory to his fleshly people Israel and through them to all the families of the earth. This was and still is the King's heart’s desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">And do we not long for this day to break more fully? Now we are living in the time when the morning cometh and a night also. Dawn still struggles with darkness, but its victory is sure. We still do well to take heed in our hearts to the divine prophetic Word that shines as a light in a dark place<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark15">1</a></sup> until the Millennial dawn fully break. This dawn is bieanuig and the day star is arising, although the clouds obscure him from the common vision. Higher critics, the wise men of Babylon, tell us that we do not well to take heed to the prophetic word either in our heads or in our hearts, and in this matter they practise exactly what they preach. But we believe that they will soon be ashamed at being found among those who “conceived a device which they are not able to perform”.—Psalm 21: 11.</span></p>

<div>
<p><span class="font14">First in this picture of the glory side of the &quot;Millennial age is mentioned a new heaven; then a new earth; then a new city; then a new tabernacle: then God's </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">presence </span><span class="font5">in the midst of the peoples,; then the abolishment </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of death, dying, and sorrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This is not the first time the new heavens and earth are referred to. The Lord through the Prophet Isaiah (65:17, 18) had long before promised the thing of which this chapter </span><span class="font5">contains a fuller description. The Apostle Peter, guided by the .same spirit of wisdom from on high, says that the followers of the Lord Jesus &quot;look for a new heavens and a </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">new </span><span class="font5">earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness”.(2 Veter 3:18) The same Apostle tells us that the present heavens and earth are a storehouse </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font5"> lire; they will pass away will) a hissing or rushing noise and the elements shall be dissolved with fervent heat. This earth and the works in it shall be burned up by reason of the coming of the tiny of the Lord. 'These hesneii' which now are. and have been since the tune of the flood, contain nothing which preserves. They are all composed of combustible materials—combustible ideas, ambitions, and theories of government. It is these same lieineiis concerning which the Scriptures elsewhere tell us that they wax old as doth a garment that they shall be folded up and cast aside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">THE XEW CITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why this new heaven and earth became xisible lies in the fact that the former — now present — heavens and earth and sea were passed away. While there will </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">be the </span><span class="font5">new heavens (the spiritual dominion of Christ) </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and the </span><span class="font5">new earth t the reconstructed condition of society), yet. a« a matter of course, there will be no more sett—no more ••.rbulenl and unrestrained masses of men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The mind is next brought down from such lofty and general subjects as the heavens and earth to the more concrete idea of a city. The same ruling class occupies more than one relationship toward the members of the human family; and to show tins the figure of the city is introduced. During the present evil world the devil has sought not merely to control the hearts and minds of men, but also their physical conduct. For this purpose he has established great systems of empire in the world designed to carry out the dictates of his own u ill. This civic control of mankind is pictured by the symlsd of a great city. In like manner, but not with like purpose or eflect. the Messiah class will occupy mole that: one relationship toward mankind. The elTorts and activities of this glorious company will be bent toward encouraging the loftiest ideas of worship in the minds of men. The\ will spread the knowledge of the glory of God abroad in the earth. Without coercing the will of anyone they will finally effect a complete cleansing of the earth from the defilements of pride and selfseel ng. But In addition to this spiritual guidance or control over man as Prophet and Priest, they will have absolute control over the civic affairs of men ns King. The word 'civic' comes from the Latin word </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">civis,</span><span class="font5"> a citizen of a city. So, here the figure of a city is introduced as showing how control over the civic affairs of men will gradually settle tlown and become nn established factor in the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This 'equence between the new heavens and earth and the new Jerusalem is also shown in Isaiah 65:17, IS. There it is said: (11 “Behold. I create a new heavens and a new earth.&quot; and in the re: t verse. (2) “Behold. I create Jerusalem a reioic, .g&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">IHC DESCENDING CITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The A|s&gt;stie Paul &lt;i&gt;eaks of “Jerusalem from silsive”. (Galatians </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">4</span><span class="font5">:26) This expression is frequently met with</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">in Jewish writers. The Apostle John sees this heavenly city or civil government over men not merely in the heavens and as a future thing, but he sees her come down from above. The Jerusalem from above becomes the Jerusalem beneath, not unlike the Tabernacle which was on Mount Sinai which was. so to speak, brought down into the camp of Israel; for M&lt;r^-s was straitly instructed to make all things according to the imttern which had been showed him in the mount.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This settling down of the holy city is intimately associated with the picture which Isaiah gives of the establishing of the mountain of the 1/trd's house in or on the tops of the mountains. (Isaiah 2:2-4) This Messiauic kingdom is to be established in a |xr-ition sli|&lt;enor to and oxer all the hitherto kingdoms and governments of earth. The dimensions of this cilx als,, approximate those ot a mountain. The length, breadth, ami height of it are equal. If the figures given in tins chapter be taken literally, they signify that this city will be aliout fifteen hundred miles wide in each direction. In aux case, the thought is one of vasrness and of ample resources for meeting any and all emergencies. All the cities of the earth, both ancient and modern, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">put </span><span class="font5">together would not approximate in size such a city as here described. We ate not arguing for a literal interpretation, but simply calling attention to the thought of sujieriority and vastness, which is evidently the kernel thought </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font5">passage. The A|&gt;os|le John had seen the destruction and practical annihilation of the old Jerusalem. That </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">city </span><span class="font5">itself, called several times by the evangelists “the holy city”, was ruined, laid in ashes, and it had come to nothing. John saw this younger and fairer sister as it </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">were, </span><span class="font5">in a vision : wo see it in the text.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Jerusalem stands for the whole church, as the ancient city stood for the whole nation: because there occurred (1) the administration of the word of the Law and of the ordinances, (2) the assemblies of the i«eople. (3) the worship of the true God by his own appointment, anti (4)-the presence of God himself in the midst of all. The temporarynature of this government is shown by the use of the word •tabernacle’ in the third verse of our lesson. Though holy and righteous, this government of Messiah is intended to last only so long as is necessary to bring mankind up to the point where they can receive anew not only their own franchise on life but the original charter for earth's government as given to man : “Have dominion over . . . every living thing that moveth upon the earth”.—Genesis 1:28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">GOD DWELLING WITH MEN</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Thus God. represented in hi« church, the great Messiah class, will dwell with the world of men during the Millennial age and they shall be his people—taken by and large, nothwithstanding the fact that some of them will prove unappreciative and incorrigible. Then the redemption price (1 John 2:2) shall have been paid, and, the due time having come for a manifestation of divine favor, all people shall be treated as the Lord's people; none of them shall be treated as aliens, strangers, foreigners from God and his promises and his blessings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While the Millennial kingdom will be the kingdom of God's dear Son, it will also lie the kingdom of God, because God's dear Son and his joint-heir, the church, will be in ub«.olute accord with the Father, and all that shall be done under their control will fully and completely represent the divine will respecting men. Nevertheless, it will be a separate kingdom from that of the remainder of the universe, as the Apostle Pnul indicates. “He must reign until he hath imt all enemies under his feet . . . And when all </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">thin</span><span class="font5">gs 172</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">shall be subdued uiiio him. then shall the Son also be subject to him that did put all things under him. . . . Then cometh the end. alien he shall lune delivered up the kingdom to (hid eien th» I'.nher&quot; in the close of the Millennial age.—1 t'or.iitlinm- 1.&quot;: 2-1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The whol- aorh of the Millennial age is summed up in n few words, and we are brought to its culmination in the declaration, “There shall be no more death; neither sorrow nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things are passed nway”. What a glorious sunburst of blessing is in these words! Whnt a grand fulfillment will be there of the Ajmstle's declaration respecting “times of restitution of all things which God hath spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began”! This declaration, however, applies to the very end of the Millennial age. and not in full to any previous time in that nge: for other accounts show us unmistakably that there will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font5">imperfections and chastisements and stripes throughout </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">nge while mankind is being lifted up. Or, as our </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Lord </span><span class="font5">expressed it. the raising up of mankind throughout </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font5">Millennial age will be a “resurrection </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">judgment&quot;, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">in</span><span class="font5">struction, discipline, chastisement—John 5 : 28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Another pen picture of that time shows how that </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">even </span><span class="font5">at the close of that age there will be a severe trial and testing to demonstrate to what extent enforced </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">obedience </span><span class="font5">of that age shall have rightly affected the hearts of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">those </span><span class="font5">who experience its blessings, so that their love will be </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font5">righteousness, and their hate directed </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">against Iniquity. </span><span class="font5">(Revelation 20: 7, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">8) </span><span class="font5">He who in that final test shall </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">mani</span><span class="font5">fest that his heart contains anything aside from full loyalty to the Lord and the principles of righteousness will </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">his part In the second death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">THE EARLY LIFE OF SAUL </span><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">--July 3 — Acts 21:39; 22:3,2S; 2 Timothy 3:14.15; Philippians 3:5, 6-- </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">•‘J/Mlau tj ye shall hear his voice, harden not</span><span class="font5"> pour </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">hearts.”—Hebrews 3:7,8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SAUL’S BOYHOOD IX TABSU.S--A CITIZEN OF NO MEAN CITY — SAUL'S EDUCATION IN JERUSALEM--HIS DISTINGUISHED TEACHER.</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">G</span><span class="font5">OD'S amba--ador to the geiilde-. to the uncircuin-cision. Paul, the honored Apostle of Jesus Chri&lt;t and the first me-M-iigei of t lie church, was born in Tarsus, a city of the ancient Itoman province of Cilicia in Asia Minor. Tarsus was one &lt;ii the distinguished cities of that time, situated, a- it was. some four hundred fifty miles north and west from Jerusalem and in the northeast corner of the Mediterranean Sea. The Taurus Mountains bounded Cilicia on the north, the Sea on the south, Syria on the east, and Pamphylia on the west. Tarsus was the capital. The Apostle himself calls it “no mean city”. Part of the force of these words is lost in English. “Mean” is literally, </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">without a mark</span><span class="font5"> or </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">token.</span><span class="font5"> ‘Mean’ was used of uncoined gold or silver, very much as if we should say, ‘no bullion city’. Instead it was marked and distinguished, as minted gold or silver is stamped. Tarsus was a “free city”, having its own laws and magistrates. It was a “self-governing metropolis”, as its coins boasted. The city possessed a famous university and it ranked with Athens and Alexandria as an educational center.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">St. Paul himself tells us that he was set apart from his birth. Not that he means to Imply anything like absolute and unalterable personal election ; but rather that he wishes to tell us that special divine providences were over him, preparing and fitting him for the great work which he was to do, yet without having his will coerced at any stage of the experience. These divine providences are seen in choosing this very city of Tarsus for him to be born in. Here it was possible for a Jew to be born a Roman citizen, brought up in a gentile city, and at the same time to remain a strict Jew. learned in the law and true to the traditions of the fathers. In this place as in no other he could have laid a certain foundation for the larger work of the future. Neither Alexandria nor Athens would have done so well; for the former was steeped in mysticism and the latter swimming in philosophical babblings and strife about words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">OF HEBREW PARENTAGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Young Saul was a Hebrew of the Hebrews, 1. e„ of double Jewish parentage and doubtless also using the Hebrew tongue in the home and elementary school, while Greek was the language of the street, the mart, and of the higher school. Like almost all Hebrews in Roman occupied territory. this young Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin (Phlllp-pmns 3:5) had two names, one a family name and one an outside name (Acts 13:9), and in which latter name, doubtless, his citizenship was registered. It was a Roman citizenship: and his Roman name was Paul, or, more accurately. Paulus. It was because he was to be the Apostle to the gentiles that the name Saul gives place to that of Paul early in his apostolic activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Saul’s boyhood, passed and the scenes of the famous city, could not have been uninfluenced by them. Alexander the Great had been located in Tarsus at one time and nearly lost his life while swimming In the icy waters of the Cydnus. Cleopatra sailed up that river in magnlfioent state to meet Antony. Julius Ctesar made Tarsus his home for a time. Philosophers, poets, and authors of great </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">renown </span><span class="font5">were there at the time of Saul’s childhood. From one of these poets, Aratus, Paul quoted in his speech on </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Man </span><span class="font5">Hill in Athens many years afterward, though with a </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">very </span><span class="font5">different meaning from what </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font5">usually applied to It </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font5">cosmopolitan interests and activities of the place must </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have </span><span class="font5">made deep impress on the mode of thought of this young boy. and enabled him in after life to use gentile similes aud metaphors knowingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In harmony with the strict teachings of the Pharisees (his father was also one), Saul was taught a trade. This he learned before he was set at his more serious studies in Jerusalem; for even though a lad was expected to be a teacher of the law he had to learn a trade. Tosaphta says; “What is demanded a father toward his son? To circumcise him, to redeem him, to teach him the law, to teach him a trade, to take him a wife. Rabbi Judah says: He that teaches not his son a trade does as if he taught him to be a thief.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">At the age of five Jewish lads began to study the Bible at home with their parents. This was the case even with Timothy, though he was only half Jew. Indeed it is said that “from a babe” he had learned the Scriptures. It could not have been otherwise with young Saul. The mother of a Jewish family usually taught her sons the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Shama</span><span class="font5"> (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Hallel</span><span class="font5"> (Psalms 118-118), either in whole or in part. At six the Jewish youth went to an outside school conducted by a rabbi or teacher. At these schools Jewish children received the rudiments of education, learning to read by instruction from the rabbi in some of the books of the law, which were their only text books. At ten these youths were to begin to study the earlier and simpler developments of the oral law, such as were afterward collected and recorded under the title of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Mishna.</span><span class="font5"> At thirteen the Jewish lad was expected to become a “son of the commandment”, going through a kind of confirmation which impressed on his mind a certain amount of personal responsibility toward the Law from that time on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all probability it was at this age that young Saul was brought to Jerusalem to be finished off as a thoroughgoing Pharisee under the most renowned teacher of that time, Habban Gamaliel. This teacher became president of the Sanhedrim only a few years after Saul’s arrival in the city. Gamaliel was a grandson of Hillel, the most famous of all Jewish latter-day teachers. Hillel lived to be a hundred and twenty years old. His son, succeeding him in office, was Simeon, the same Simeon, it is believed, who was present in the Temple at the time of Jesus’ presentation, though he did not become president of the Sanhedrim until his venerable father’s death, thirteen years later. It was he who joyously acknowledged Jesus to be the coming Messiah. For this reason Jewish writers make very sparse comments about Simeon. Simeon’s son was Gamaliel. It is just possible that the belief of his father had some tempering effect on the thinking of his distinguished son. At all events, it was he who counseled moderation in the matter of persecuting the apostles. He must have sat in the Sanhedrim which condemned our Lord to death, but even as president of it he would have no deciding voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Paul later says that he was </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“brought up</span><span class="font5"> in this city”, all of which must indicate that he came to Jerusalem when quite young, and remained, say, some ten or twelve years, leaving for Tarsus before our Lord’s ministry began—Jesus and Saul being about of one age. Possibly he stayed at the home of his married sister, who lived there, but of this we have no information. It was customary for young students to spend part of their time at their manual trade, thus earning something toward then- subsistence. This was often done even where the parent, were well-to-do, as it was considered a part of the education of a boy to teach him to be independent and self supporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There were said to be more than four hundred synagogues in the city of Jerusalem. This number is accounted for by the fact that groups of students and older people from different foreign cities were there. .Some of these preferred to meet together because of greater familiarity with the language of their birth than with the vernacular Aramaic-Hebrew. There was a Cilician synagogue, as is subsequently implied by the statement in Acts. (Acts 6:9) Paul evidently belonged to this synagogue, at least in the time of Stephen’s persecution.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark279"></a><span class="font9"><a name="bookmark280"></a>SAUL THE PHARISEE</span></h3>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">--July 10 — Acts 7:54 — 8:3; 22:3,4; 26:4,5,9,10--</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">“Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.&quot;—1 Timothy 1:25.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">SAUL’S FALSE TRAINING — THE GROUNDS FOR HIS PERVERTED CONSCIENCE--“l THOUGHT I OUGHT”--CONSCIENCE AND RIGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font14">C</span><span class="font5">ONSCIENCE, as shown by the experience of Saul of Tarsus, may lead one Into grievous error and serious sin. We must suppose that the Apostle meant what he said and that he knew how to say it when he spoke of his Pharisaical persecutions of the church of Christ as sin. He was not wicked withal: there was no willful violation of known principles of right; but there was sin, for sin is a missing of the mark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The reason why Saul missed the mark of quick discernment of the divine will and purpose is to be found in his wrong teaching as a Pharisee. The word ‘Pharisee’, according to Aruch, a Hebrew cyclopedia, means separated one, “one who separates himself from Levitical impurity and Levitically Impure food”. Its meaning may be approximated in our language by the word Separatist or Puritan. But alas! As with Puritan, so with Pharisee. The peaked hat of the Puritan, while less glorious a crown than the tiara of the Vatican, covered as inexorable a purpose. So it was with the ancient Pharisees. They did not stop with attempts at personal piety; but looked down on those who did not or could not live just as they lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most essential conditions which were exacted from everyone who wished to become a </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Chaber</span><span class="font5"> or member of the Pharisaic association were two. Each candidate was required to promise in the presence of three members that: (1) he would set apart all the sacred tithes from the produce of the land, and refrain from eating anything which had not been tithed, or about the tithing of which there was any doubt; (2) he would scrupulously observe the most essential laws of purity which so materially affected both the eating of food and all family affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">VARIOUS JEWISH CLASSES</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">It is difficult fcr us who have been unaccustomed to such things to appreciate how thoroughly minute were the Mosaic laws respecting tithing and uncleanness. The possibilities of becoming unknowingly unclean through contact with another who was unclean were so varied that they gave rise to four degrees of purity, and to four divisions In the Pharisaic associations. The Sadducees, another prominent but small class in Jewish national life, consisted of the priestly aristocracy. The Essenes, still another class, were more strict than the Pharisees in some respects. The various classes in Judaism in the time of Saul, the Sadducees, Essenes, Pharisees (four grades), and sinners, might be roughly compared with our modern “bluebloods” or aristocrats, the bourgeoisie or upper middle class, the average' man or the “public”, and the proletariat or “down-trodden masses”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">From this it will be seen that the Pharisees were a lay association calculated to instill in the minds of the people generally the fact that if they would observe the Mosaic laws they might all be priestly, “a kingdom of priests,” and thus curb the ambitious efforts of the Levitical priesthood to control not only temple rites but also national matters. In view of the fact that the Pharisees were the most influential part of the people and that they were working along democratic lines, it is all the more pathetic to And them rejecting our Lord Jesus as the Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Saul was included in that class which was so forcibly accused by the Master. He was learned in the law and in the theories of how to apply it to life, but he was not learned in mercy or grace. Some of the Pharisees hesitated not to say that the law might be interpreted in seventy-two ways. They rather boasted in these multitudes of curious ideas, and had Jesus’ message been such that it could have been made a seventy-third interpretation they would probably have embraced it glady. But it was- so positive and so decided that It plagued them and disturbed them in their delightful haziness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">PHARISEES THE “BEST” PEOPLE</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">But it must not be thought that the Pharisees did no good to the people. They did much, else they could not have had influence. Their mistake was not in being entirely inconsiderate of the people, but it was in thinking that the very best that they could do by themselves would avail anything toward everlasting life. As a people of priests and kings, the Pharisees considered themselves the guardians of the divine law and the ancestral customs, trusting implicitly that he who selected them to be his peculiar people would protect and shield them and theirs from all outward dangers which threatened the state. They were firmly penetrated by the conviction that as long as they were faithful to their God no power on earth, however formidable, would be permitted to ravish his holy heritage successfully. Hence they repudiated the time-serving policy of the aristocratic Sadducees, who maintained that a man’s destiny was in his own hands, and that human ingenuity and statecraft ought to be resorted to in political matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The Pharisees led a temperate life, renouncing both excessive riches and immoderate pleasure, and they strove above all to acquire a knowledge of that law and to practise those precepts which would fit them for the life to come. Their mistake lay not in doing the things which they did, but in thinking that those things constituted saving religion. Their holiness really, exalted self, for it implied that scrupulous observances of rites and ceremonies would make them worthy of Lfe, overlooking as they did “the weightier matters of the law”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The cult is not dead today; for there be some who still believe that agonizing and “doing something” and pious reflections and relentless and unmerciful self-examination and moralistic living and humanitarian practice will avail something toward making them acceptable in the Father’s sight, forgetting, if they be Christians at all that they have already been accepted in the Beloved and that it is now for them to obey in humility and not exalt self by imagining that they can perfect the flesh. Saul could not be used of the Lord until that idea had been burnt out of him by the light shining above the brightness of the sun at noonday. It is certain that we cannot be messengers of grace if we still hope for ceremonial righteousness and overlook “the righteousness which is of God by faith”.</span></p>

I think the whole to be the most sublime, and its use in praise and testimony meetings increases our appreciation of it as well as of the great Creator. Additionally I find great pleasure in using the weekly subjects in their respective order as introductory greetings, placed In the upper left hand corner of all correspondence with the brethren, either letter or postcard.

<p><span class="font5" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Brethren :</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I would like you to know what a blessing I have received through participating in the Golden Age work. At first I thought that some of the expressions made in the special issue, Number 27, were not in keeping with the teachings of the meek and lowly Jesus. But I decided to put my trust in the Lord, knowing well that in his Father’s Word I had the promise that he would be with us even unto the end of the age. And remembering Brother Russell’s comment on this verse in the daily manna (November 30), I felt it was my privilege to take part in the work, and let the work speak for itself. And now, I thank the Lord for the way he has guided and used the brethren in charge of the work at this lime. I am meeting some who are not only anxious to accept the special offer mentioned in the Golden Age magazine, but are eager to purchase the other six volumes, and also willing to lay down their little all on the Lord’s altar of sacrifice. What a joy and favor from our heavenly Father, to meet such grateful and appreciative ones! Surely the Lord’s blessing is with those who are keeping close to the channel of truth. I remember you often in my prayers, trusting, you to be kept closely linked together with the tie of heavenly love.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Believe me to be one with you in the Master’s service,</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">At the prayer and testimony meeting of March 23 (Jehovah Supplies — Philippians 4:19), we realized more than ever before how helpful God’s channel really is, and how he is using it to supply the bride (his daughter) with the material necessary for her wedding garment, recipes, models, patterns, etc., complete to make her a beauty and joy to the Bridegroom and to show forth the honor and glory of the Father throughout the ages of the ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We do want you to know, dear brethren, that we do love you and that you are always in our petitions to the throne of grace, that you may be. kept pure, strong, and faithful, and that our dear Watch Tower may continue to be used of God and his dear Son as the channel of truth.</span></p>

And my prayers go up each day in thanksgiving to our heavenly Father for his wonderful provision for our every need and for the way he has led us through the fiery trials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">I know you have the Lord’s blessings. And my prayer is that you may continue in his favor and receive the glorious reward at the end of your course.</span></p>
