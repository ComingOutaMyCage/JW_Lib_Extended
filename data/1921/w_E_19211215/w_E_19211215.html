<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">THIS JOURNAL AND ITS SACRED MISSION</span></p>
<p><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HIS journal Is one of the prime factors or instruments in the system of Bible instruction, or “Seminary Extension”, now being presented In all parts of the civilized world by the </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> chartered A. D. 1884, “For the P motion of Christian Knowledge”. It not only serves as a class room where Bible students may meet in the study of the divine Word bat also as a channel of communication through which they may be reached with announcements of the Society’s conventions and of the coming of Its traveling representatives, styled “Pilgrims”, and refreshed with reports of its conventions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Our “Berean Lessons” are topical rehearsals or reviews of our Society’s published </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Studies</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> most entertainingly arranged, and very helpful to all who would merit the only honorary degree which the Society accords, viz., FerM </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dei Minister</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> (V. D. M.), which translated into English is </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Minister of God’s Word.</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> Our treatment of the International Sunday School Lessons is specially for the older Bible students and teachers. By some this feature is considered indispensable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">This journal stands firmly for the defense of the only true foundation of the Christian’s hope now being so generally repudiated —redemption through the precious blood of “the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ransom</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> [a corresponding price, a substitute] for all&quot;. (1 Peter 1:19; 1 Timothy 2:6) Building up on this sure foundation the gold, silver and precious stones (1 Corinthians 3: Ills ; 2 Peter 1: S-ll) of the Word of God, its further mission is to “make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery winch . . .has been hid in God, ... to the intent that now might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God”—“which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed”.—Ephesians 3:5-9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It stands free from all parties, sects and creeds of men, while it seeks more and more to bring its every utterance into fullest subjection to the will of God in Christ, as expressed in the holy Scriptures. It is thus free to declare boldly whatsoever the Lord hath spoken—according to the divine wisdom granted unto us to understand his utterances. Its attitude is not dogmatic, but confident; for we know whereof we affirm, treading with implicit faith upon the sure promises of God. It is held as a trust, to be used only in his service; hence our decisions relative to what may and what may not appear in its columns must be according to our judgment of his good pleasure, the teaching of bis Word, for the upbuildtng of his people in grace and knowledge. And we not only invite but urge out; readers to prove all its utterances by the infallible Word to which reference is constantly niade to facilitate such testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TO US THE SCRIPTURES CLEARLY TEACH</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That the church is “the temple of'the living God”, peculiarly “his workmanship” ; that its construction has been in progress throughout the gospel age—ever since Christ became the world’s Redeemer and the Chief Corner Stone of his temple, through which, when finished, God's blessing shall come &quot;to all people”, and they find access to him.—1 Corinthians 3 :10, 17; Ephesians 2:20-22; Genesis 28:14; Galatians 3 : 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That meantime the chiseling, shaping, and polishing of consecrated believers in Christ’s atonement for sin, progresses ; and when the last of these &quot;living stones&quot;, &quot;elect and precious,” shall have'been made ready, the great Master Workman will bring all together in the first resurrection , and the temple shall be filled with'his glory, and be the meeting place between God and men throughout the Millennium—Revelation 15:5-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">IThat the basis of hope, for the church and the world, lies in the fact that “Jesus Christ, by the grace of God, tasted death for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">man,” “a ransom for all,” and will be “the true light which lighteth </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every man that cometh into the world&quot;,</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> &quot;in due time”.— Hebrews 2:9; John 1: 9 ; 1 Timothy 2:5, 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That the hope of the church is that she may be like her Lord, &quot;see him as he is,” be “partakers of the divine nature’,’ and share his glory as bis joint-heir.—1 Jolin 3.2; John 17:24; Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That the present mission of the church is the perfecting of the-saints for the future work of service; to develop in herself every grace; to be God’s witness to the world ; and to prepare to be kings and priests in the next age.—Ephesians 4:12; Matthew 24: 14 ; Revelation 1:6; 20 : 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">That the hope for the world lies in the blessings of knowledge and opportunity to be brought to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">all</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Christ’s Millennial kingdom, the restitution of all that was lost in Adam, to all the willing and obedient, at the hands of their Redeemer and his glorified church, when all the wilfully wicked will be </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">destroyed.—</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Acts 3:19-23; Isaiah 35.</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font12"><a name="bookmark3"></a><a name="bookmark4"></a>ANNUAL REPORT 1921</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17">U</span><span class="font9">NDER the terms of the charter and by-laws of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, the annual meeting was held at Pittsburgh on Monday, October 31, 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A three-day convention preceded the annual meeting, being held at Memorial Hall. Brother Macmillan was the chairman of the convention, which was addressed by the chairman and several other brethren, amongst them Brothers Wise, Van Amburgh, Kendall and Rutherford. Sunday afternoon a public address was delivered at the Syria Mosque by the President of the Society, at which the attendance numbered approximately three thousand. Splendid attention was given and we hope much good was done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Monday the thirty-first being the anniversary of Brother Russell’s change to glory, the friends assembled in the afternoon at the cemetery, where memorial services were held, being made brief, however, on account of the inclemency of the weather. A little souvenir of the plot of ground and the pyramid stone marker had been provided, which was distributed amongst those in attendance. While brief, the ceremony was sweet and brought many memories of the past and the faithful service of our beloved Pastor. While all missed him, all rejoiced that he had passed to Ins everlasting reward, being forever with the Lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Withal the convention was a very blessed one and when the hour came for returning to the respective places of abode, each heart responded with thankfulness to the Lord that he had graciously permitted our assembling together for fellowship and encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Monday morning the thirty-first, at ten o’clock, the annual meeting was convened, with Brother Rutherford, the President, in the chair. After the usual devotional services the order of business was taken up. The first order of business after considering the minutes being the reports, both the President and the Secretary made reports of the activities of the Society during the past year. On motion of Brother Hayes, of Washington, the reports were received and those present by unanimous vote expressed a deep appreciation of the management of the work under the Lord’s supervision and the blessings that had attended it during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRESIDENT’S REPORT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brother Rutherford made rather an exhaustive re-poit, the substance of which we set out here, as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As President and General Manager of the Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society it is my privilege and pleasure to make report to those holding voting shares assembled at the annual meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Believing that the King’s business requires the best possible service, it has been the policy of the management to put the work of the Society on an efficiency basis. To this end the work at headquarteis has been organized, and likewise the work at the various branch offices has been arranged. All the dear brethren at headquarters appreciate the fact that it is a privilege and not a right to be there, and that the privilege of engaging in the Lord’s service at this time is. second to none granted to any one on earth. And being all devoted to the Lord and his cause, they recognize it is a great privilege, to cooperate in the w ork with others in making known the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">As a great orchestra renders harmonious music only when each player attends strictly to his instrument or part of the business, eien so the Lord’s work yields harmonious results when each one remains at his post and performs with his might what his hands find to do. We strive to learn the lesson, “Study to be quiet and do your own business”. With these practical methods directed always by the holy spirit, every one manifesting the holy spirit finds the work joyful and beneficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">OFFICE ROOM</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Since the reestablishment of the Bethel the executive offices; editorial rooms, correspondence department, etc., have been at Bethel. The space there, however, has been inadequate to accommodate the workers required to meet the increased demands. Hence it has been necessary for us to lease a building at 35 Myrtle Avenue, Brooklyn, some eight blocks from the Bethel Home, at which place we have installed most of our printing machinery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In all there are laboring at Bethel 107 persons. Every one at headquarters works. For this reason it is known as a workhouse and not a place to idle away time. All the available space in the Bethel Home is occupied either as offices or as sleeping rooms, only that we reserve two rooms for guests who visit us from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the English work done at the Myrtle Avenue office, there are located also the domestic German, domestic Greek, domestic Armenian and domestic Hungarian offices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">One of the great expenses borne by the Society in years past has been that of printing, because the chief work of the Society is to preach the gospel by use of the printed page. In former years a great amount of this was printed and sent out free; but as times grew more strenuous and many of the friends less able to contribute to the work, it was thought wise to sell the literature and in that way to help bear the expenses. In. addition to this, experience has proven that when a person buys a book he is much more likely to read it than when it is given to him; and since our chief object is to get the message into the minds of the people, it has seemed to be the best way to sell them the literature rather than to give it away. The Lord’s blessing has been manifested upon this method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Manufacturing the booklets, etc., has been a great expense. In former years the setting of The WatchTower in type and its printing was all done by hired help, not consecrated. And that was true with reference to the booklets. As labor conditions grew more acute and the prices increased, it seemed to be the part of wisdom to purchase and install a printing plant. We therefore purchased and equipped our printing plant with a large rotary magazine press, built an escalator connecting the press with the trimming room aboAe, installed cutters, trimmers, stitchers, knife-grinders and other necessary equipment, together with a flatbed press for the printing of booklets, a folding machine, typesetting machines, multi-color press, stereo molding equipment, lathes, etc., at an approximate cost of $50,000.00, payment being made in monthly installments. In addition to this we equipped the domestic Greek Branch with a typesetting machine; also a similar machine in the domestic German Branch. Furthermore, we have at the domestic Polish Branch in Detroit a printing outfit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">By the Lord’s grace we were able to find consecrated brethren with sufficient experience to man all this machinery ; and the result has been that our printing during the last year has been done at the minimum cost— at a price much lower than that involved had it been done anywhere else. We have purchased paper directly from the mills and all other material at the lowest price possible; and in this way have been able to get out a large amount of literature at less cost than otherwise ■we could have done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The typesetting machines (Intertype and Linotype) enable us to set all the type for The Watch Tower, The Golden Age, booklets and books; thus greatly reducing the cost of production. In addition to the English work done here, we are able to set on our machines the type in the Greek, German, Italian, Slovak, Hungarian, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Until recent months all of out stereotype plates were molded by other companies and at a very high cost. We have now installed machinery for molding the stereotype plates for The Watch Tower, The Golden Age, booklets and books; and these stereotyped plates we are able to manufacture as good as any one and at the very lowest possible cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Watch Tower, The Golden Age, and other publications, are put through on schedule time. A chart is kept in the Service Department by which is indicated in advance when each part of the work must be done. The copy from the editorial rooms must be in the hands of the typesetters on a date certain, and each part of the manufacturing must be taken up at a specific time. Now the articles are written and sent to the composing room and are put in type on the typesetting machines. These are operated in three shifts; therefore copy sent down in the evening is next morning in galley proof on the desks of the proof-readers. As soon as the proofs are approved, the forms are made up and taken iin ediately into the adjoining room, where the plates are molded. The plates are then transferred to the press-room and the press is started. Our big press will print on an average of 50,000 copies of The Golden Age daily, or an average of 25,000 complete copies of the “Millions” booklet. The press has turned out as high as 34,000 completed copies of the “Millions” booklet in one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Formerly when The Watch Tower was mailed, practically the whole office force was taken off for two or, three days for wrapping the Towers. Now all the addressing is done by machinery and one man operates a machine which stamps the mailing slips on the journals. They are then tied in bundles and thrown into mail bags and hauled in our own truck to the post office. And when we have a large shipment, arrangements are made with the post office to take them direct to the cars to be shipped away. If your Tower or Golden Age does not reach you on time, it may be the fault of your local postoffice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BRANCH OFFICES</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">When the disturbance came in 1918, relationship between the home office and the foreign offices was practically severed. The reorganization of this work had to be done afterwards and began in the Fall of 1919. It is gratifying to note the increase of the work in foreign fields. There seems to be a greater freedom of action when each nationality has some specific thing to do about witnessing to its own people. Hence we deemed it wise to organize branch offices, all of which are operated under the supervision of the main office, at Brooklyn, which branch offices are both domestic and foreign. By “domestic” is meant a branch located in the United States which carries on the work among people speaking a language foreign to English; and by “foreign” we mean an office located outside of the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There is such a quantity of data relative to the work by the various branch offices of the Society that our space would not permit us to publish a detailed report, so that here we can give only a brief suin ary of the activities of the work among foreign-speaking peoples operated under the different branches. We give them here in alphabetical order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Arabic:</span><span class="font9"> Domestic branch at Brooklyn; Brother J. Fakourey, secretary in charge. This branch has only recently been organized, but within a short time it has done some good work. There has been a fair distribution of the “Millions” booklets, also the sale of quite a number of copies of Volume 1 of Studies in the Scriptures, and besides tracts and other free papers have been circulated. Public lectures are held each week in Arabic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Armenian:</span><span class="font9"> A domestic branch was established at Brooklyn in July, 1921, with Brother A. S. Zakian as secretary in charge. The Watch Tower is now being published in Armenian. The “Millions” booklet in this language, as well as in the Armeno-Turkish, is having a good circulation in the United States and some other parts of the world. There is a limited Pilgrim service conducted from Brooklyn, and particularly is this service furnished for the benefit of the Armenian population in California.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Australian:</span><span class="font9"> The office at Melbourne is in charge of Brother W. W. Johnston. With his annual report Brother Johnston writes: “Herewith find enclosed a copy for the annual statement of the Australian Branch. From it you will see that our total output is almost double that of the previous year. The output of the Studies in the Scriptures has increased about one and one-half times; and the sale of booklets and 'Hell’ Towers, including ‘Millions’ and ‘Talking with the Dead’, has increased more than five times. . . . We are encouraged to greater diligence in the service of him who did so much for us.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The total number of Studies in the Scriptures, Pastor Russell’s Sermons, booklets and Scenarios sold is 37,047; Peoples Pulpit, The Golden Age and The Watch Tower distributed, 750,919; letters received, 2,679; letters sent out, 3,191. “Golden Age No. 27 was widely distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand. The dear friends are now busy with the ‘Mil-lions-Mystery’ drive and we anticipate great things. Everywhere the people flock to hear the glad message that millions now living will never die. There appear to be larger opportunities and greater demand for service than ever before; and by God’s grace we intend to do our best to keep up with the demand.” Last year Brother MacPherson made a Pilgrim tour of Australia with splendid results. Brother Johnston delivered thirteen lectures in New Zealand on the subject “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">British</span><span class="font9">: The British Branch at London is in charge of Brother J. Hemery Brother Hemery reports the work in Great Britain this year as very successful. That office has printed 250,000 of the “Millions” booklets and made a wide distribution throughout the British Isles. In addition to the many public meetings held by speakers who travel by railway, several brethren travel throughout the land on motorcycles. They go in pairs, each motorcycle carrying a side car. They advertise a meeting in a town where there is no class, hold the meeting and sell the literature. As we go to press we have not the details in sufficient form to publish at this time, and while they are expected daily from the London office the publication will have to be deferred until some later date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian:</span><span class="font9"> The Canadian Branch was established during the war at Winnipeg, with Brother W. F. Salter in charge; and later it was moved to Toronto, where it is now situated. The year closing has been the best by far of the work in Canada. Brother Salter’s letter accompanying his annual report says: “My heart is overflowing with gratitude and thanksgiving to our loving heavenly Father as I forward to you the fourth annual report covering the work in Canada during the year 1921. His blessing has rested richly upon the efforts of the friends throughout the Dominion. . . . For the Pilgrim visits the classes have arranged first-class auditoriums and well advertised the meetings, with the consequence that the greatest witness we have ever made has been effected. Pilgrim brethren have addressed public meetings with an approximate attendance </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">169,113. In addition to this 104,325 have attended the Drama exhibitions; making a total public witness </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font9">273,438. This does not include the public meetings </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">held </span><span class="font9">by the classes and addressed by the elders, which means many more thousands who heard the message. The Pilgrim brethren m making these visits and to address public meetings have traveled this year 111,276 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Our dear Brother Black finished his course with joy April 29, 1921. He served many long and faithful years in the truth and was particularly zealous in the Pilgrim work during the dark years of the war in Canada. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font9">was dearly beloved throughout the Dominion and elsewhere; and in the Lord’s providence his passing has inspired many to press on with greater love and zeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“The colporteurs have done splendid work, and the result is indeed encouraging. The class organization for the Golden Age work and the sale of other of the Society’s literature shows gratifying results. Sales of the Studies in the Scriptures (Volumes 1 to 7, inclusive) amount to a total of 35,847; ‘Talking with the Dead’, 20,963; ‘Millions Now Living Will Never Die’, 82,526; miscellaneous books, booklets, etc., 15,593; letters and cards received, 13,148; letters and cards dispatched, 19,996. In addition to this we have put out tracts advertising the meetings to the number of 500,000 since August.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CENTRAL EUROPEAN OFFICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It was deemed best to organize and put in operation an office in Central Continental Europe for the purpose of more directly managing the work there. Such an office was established at Zurich, Switzerland, after the close of the fiscal year 1920, with Brother C. C. Binkele in charge. The jurisdiction of this branch is over the countries of Switzerland, France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria, and Italy. Some of these countries embraced have local managers and some have not; yet there are workers in all the countries named under the direction of the Central European office. The organization is such that the local representatives in these countries named keep in direct touch with the Central European Office, make reports to that office in their respective languages, and the central office translates the reports into English and forwards them to the main office at Brooklyn. The Lord has wonderfully manifested his blessing upon this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At Berne, Switzerland, a number of brethren organized a company and established a printing plant, installing a number of printing presses and type for printing in foreign languages. The Society has a special arrangement with this printing plant and its literature there is produced at practically cost. The printing plant is operated entirely by the brethren and for all the Society’s printing they charge only the cost of material and for their work they receive the same allowance that the Bethel friends receive. There in the past year the literature, particularly the “Millions” booklet and other booklets. have been printed in French, German, Dutch, Polish. Greek, Italian, and Yiddish; and other languages are now in process of manufacture there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Brother Binkele’s report on the work in Switzerland says: “In Switzerland we started last spring (and continue doing so) to visit every city and town of note with the Photo-Drama and follow up with the ‘Millions’ and kingdom message; and wherever interest is manifested we continue to hold meetings, offering and selling the booklets as we go along. The result has been encouraging indeed. A number of classes have been started and a goodly portion of the interested ones have meanwhile come into the truth and are now walking with us. From the so-called Apostolic Christians people of teachable disposition and fine character have recently accepted present truth. We rejoice over this fact all the more, because they come from the old ‘fold’ Brother Binkele used to ‘shepherd’ before clearer light was given him and because he has known them for many years to be honest and faithful Christians. One of their preachers is with those that have come into the truth. So you see, dear Brother Rutherford, the Lord is untiringly gracious unto us, blessing our every effort to further his cause and to make known the glad tidings. ... In Switzerland and Germany we are just preparing to add to the lecturing on the ‘Millions’ theme also the theme of ‘Can the Living Talk with the Dead?’ because spiritism and all its relatives have come to be a real pestilence among Christian people there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Two weeks ago I attended a convention of the French-Swiss friends at Lausanne, which was visited better than any French convention I have ever attended. There was a better spirit and we notice the ‘Freytag influence’ has been cast off and overcome. Brother Durieux is very active and has been hard at work among the French, the best field among the French being the hard-working miners in the North and the furthermost South of France. Alsace-Lorraine is prospering.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">There was some disturbance in Holland at the beginning of the year because of the interference of meddlers; but now the work directed from the Central European Office and managed locally by a brother in Holland is progressing splendidly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Prior to the World War it was impossible for any one to preach the truth in Austria. Through the efforts of the Central European Office a way has been opened and brethren have recently visited Austria and held meetings and sold a great number of the “Millions” booklets and other literature. One brother reporting on the meetings in Vienna, Austria, writes: “The message made a mighty impression. The announcement caused iin ense sensation and gave rise to much discussion on the streets before the meeting. The hall was overcrowded long before the beginning and the doors were shut, while hundreds were turned away. The crowd listened with breathless attention to the wonderful message of the establishment of the kingdom of God and the comforting promises of the Scriptures that millions now living will never die. Never before have I seen people so anxious for the message as there. At the end such a storm of applause raged through the great hall as I have never before heard; and then the crowd stormed the book tables and struggled with each other to get the ‘Millions’ booklet. Some of the persons would buy from five to ten booklets at one time, while others crowded around the platform to ask questions and many cried out, ‘When will the next discourse be?’ In a word, it seemed to us that the message was to them the bread of life—to a dying, hungry people.- On the evening of the discourse we sold 2100 ‘Millions’ booklets and received 1200 address cards in addition; and each day since we have received many inquiries from Vienna. The follow-up work is arranged; halls have been rented, and on the sixth of November another Pilgrim brother again goes from Germany, Brother Wellenshaus, who will give discourses there with the Lord’s help. In December again a Pilgrim brother will be there, Brother Cunow, who is particularly fitted of the Lord to organize Berean studies.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A stock of literature is kept at the Central European </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Office,</span><span class="font9"> from which the various countries of Europe are supplied on quick order without the necessity of sending to America for it. This organization has facilitated the witness of the truth in that part of the world; and while the priests and clergy oppose violently, the work still grows by leaps and bounds. There has never been a time in the history of the harvest that such interest has been manifested in Continental Europe, particularly in the countries above named, as during the past twelve months. The friends there are encouraged, and this should encourage the brethren everywhere. The Catholics have long kept the people in ignorance of the Bible and in recent years the Protestants in Continental Europe have turned to higher criticism; and indeed there is a famine in the land for the hearing of the Word of God and the order-loving people are gladly hearing the message. The time has come for them to know the truth, and the Lord is granting opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">France:</span><span class="font9"> The French work under the supervision of the Central European Office is operated from Berne, Switzerland, Brother E. Zaugg being in charge, directing the French work in French Switzerland, France, and Belgium. There are local representatives in Paris, where a depot or local office is kept, stocked with literature; and brethren travel throughout Switzerland, France, and Belgium proclaiming the message in the French language and distributing the literature and books in that language. Particularly has the message “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” interested the people in these countries as nothing else heretofore has done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Germany</span><span class="font9"> (foreign branch): During the war it was impossible for the main office at Brooklyn to coin unicate directly with the German office and conditions in Germany made the witness of the truth almost impossible. During the past year the work was reorganized and placed within the jurisdiction of the Central European Office, with Brother Paul Balzereit as local manager at Barmen. The organization for the public witness has done splendid work during the past year. The colporteurs as well as the class workers have sold a great many books. The public witness has surpassed anything that Germany has ever known. Great crowds storm the halls to hear the testimony; and aside from the United States, Germany has sold and distributed more of the “Millions” booklets than any other country in the world. As an illustration: prior to the World War there were in the vicinity of Leipzig only a few truth friends. During the past year a convention of Bible Students was held there attended by 2,500 of the brethren, and it is reported as being one of the most spiritually helpful conventions ever held in Germany. The enemy in Germany not knowing what else to charge against the Bible Students is now charging that our work is Jewish propaganda financed by wealthy Jews of America. As a matter of fact, as all know, no Jew has ever contributed one penny to the spreading of the gospel through the Society’s efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">German</span><span class="font9"> (domestic branch): A German branch located at Brooklyn, with Brother T. Boerner as secretary in charge, is specially looking after the German work in the United States and Canada. This office is equipped with a linotype machine and printing press, under the direction of the main office at Brooklyn, and is translating and preparing for publication the German literature of the Society; also conducting a Pilgrim service amongst the German-speaking people. For most of the year The Watch Tower has been published here in German; but for convenience it is now arranged to have all the Towers printed in Germany and sent from there to the German-speaking people in America as well as in other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Czechoslovakian</span><span class="font9"> (domestic branch): This branch is located at Detroit, together with the Polish Branch, with Brother Salata as secretary in charge. These brethren have been doing during the past year a splendid work in the distribution of literature, the sale of “Millions” booklets and other publications of the Society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Danish: </span><span class="font9">The Society’s office for Denmark is located at Copenhagen; Brother C. Liittichau, secretary in charge, directing the work throughout that country. The Lord’s blessing has been manifested upon the work there this year, and the reports are encouraging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Finnish:</span><span class="font9"> The work of spreading the gospel in Finland is directed from Helsingfors by Brother K. Harteva, under the supervision of the Swedish office at t)rebro, Sweden. The conditions resulting from the war have made it quite difficult there in many ways for the disposition of the literature. Brother Harteva reports: “We have been surrounded with many difficulties, but on the other hand the Lord has helped us and we have been able to do a good lot of work. All seven volumes of the Studies in the Scriptures are now published in the Finnish language, and in addition thereto Brother Russell’s sermons, ‘Tabernacle Shadows,’ the Manna, hymn books, ‘Millions’, and the various booklets; and besides, much free literature is distributed. A regular Pilgrim service is conducted from this office and during the year 1464 meetings were held for the Finns; while 2124 meetings were held for the Swedish-speaking people in Finland. More than 100,000 books and booklets were sent out.” Brother Harteva is a very noble brother; and laboring under difficulties, is spreading the glad tidings amongst the Finns and the Swedish-speaking people in that land in both languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greek</span><span class="font9"> (domestic branch): This branch, located at Brooklyn, with Brother M. A. Stamoulas secretary in charge, under the supervision of course of the main office, is directing the work amongst the Greek-speaking people in the United States. The work has grown marvelously during the past twelve months. Not only is The Watch Tower translated, set in type and printed in the Greek language here; but other books and booklets are likewise pi epared for publication and printed. The increased interest in the Greek work- in the past year is unparalleled in any previous year; which gives much cause for rejoicing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Greek</span><span class="font9"> (foreign): The foreign work amongst the Greeks, both m Greece and in the Isle of Crete, is conducted by local brethren there, particularly Brother Bosdoyannes. This brother is a college professor, who for a number of years has been a teacher and is thoroughly learned in English as well as in Greek and translates much of the literature for the Society. He makes Pilgrim tours throughout Greece and Crete and reports splendid interest wherever he goes. Other brethren are likewise engaged in spreading the gospel there. The priests of the Greek church succeeded in preventing the “Millions” booklets from being sent in from the United States for distribution; but the adversary has not been successful in preventing them from going m some other way. The people are now getting the “Millions” booklets and other literature of the Society in Crete and in Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Hungarian</span><span class="font9"> (domestic) : This branch is located at Brooklyn; Brother John Vargo, secretary in charge. The list of the Hungarian Watch Tower subscribers during the past year has greatly increased. The interest at the public meetings likewise increased, and the sale and distribution of the Hungarian literature has grown far beyond our expectations. Our Hungarian brethren have shown a great deal of zeal and earnestness in spreading the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Hungarian</span><span class="font9"> (foreign) : The foreign Hungarian office is located at Cluj, Roumania, with Brother C. Szabo as secretary in charge; and the work is done in connection with the Roumanian office at that place. A large number of “Millions” booklets have been distributed among the people in the last year, who have gladly heard the message that the kingdom is at hand. More details concerning this work will be found under the heading of the Roumanian office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Indian:</span><span class="font9"> The Society’s headquarters for India are located at Kottayam, South India, with Brother A. J. Joseph as secretary in charge. Besides the other books of the Society the “Millions” booklet has been translated and published in the Malayalam and Urdu dialects; and translations are progressing in the Singhalese (Island of Ceylon), Tamil, Burmese, Telugu, and Canarese dialects. There has been a large distribution of tracts in India this year and the brethren have held numerous public meetings in various parts of the country, with splendid interest. The nominal church, particularly the Church of England, is bitterly persecuting our brethren in India. Brother Joseph writes:“Conditions are serious, with signs of famine and distress everywhere. The conflict between capital and labor is growing bitter.” Many of the people, however, are  gladly hearing the truth. There is a decided awaken n u m India and a hungering and thirsting alter the kingdom message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Italian</span><span class="font9"> (domestic): The Italian work for the United States is directed from the main office, Brother G. De Cecca being the secretary in charge of that work. Not only is The Watch Tower printed by the Society and sent out regularly in the Italian language, but books and other literature, as will be seen by reference to our literature bulletin. The Italian work in Italy, as above suggested, is under the direction of the Central European Office. Brother Guzzetta, formerly of the Bethel, is now in Italy, and also Brother Adolph Weber, who are working amongst the Italian people and spreading the gospel. Italy has never shown a great interest in the truth, but during the past year there is a manifest increase of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Jamaican:</span><span class="font9"> Readers of The Watch Tower will be pleased to note that the work in Jamaica is now in a much healthier condition than at any time in the past. Brother Davidson, the Society’s representative there, is doing his best to further the work and the Lord is adding his blessing. The colporteur work has been slow, due to financial conditions; yet the exhibition of the Drama for the public has been well attended, as well as the public meetings. The literature has been well received and much of it has gone out to the people. Brother George Young is now visiting Jamaica and other British West Indian possessions and holding public meetings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Korean: </span><span class="font9">The Society’s work for Korea is carried on from Seoul, Korea, under the direction of Brother P. S. Kang, secretary m charge, who together with other brethren has made pilgrimages during the past year throughout Korea, holding public meetings. While the interest has not been as great as in other places, a goodly number of books and booklets have been sold, particularly the “Millions” booklet. The latter is translated and published in the Pure Korean and also in the Mixed Script dialects. Korea is controlled by Japan, and while there are not many Christians in Japan, yet there are some who are interested in the truth. The message “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” is now being translated into the Japanese language and we expect to have it published in a short time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Lithuanian</span><span class="font9"> (domestic) : The work of spreading the truth amongst the Lithuanian-speaking people in the United States is carried on from the office at Detroit, where Brother J. R. Muzikant is secretary in charge, under the supervision of Brother E. J. Coward. The Watch Tower is published in this language, as well as books and other literature. There has been a healthy increase amongst the Lithuanians who have become interested in the truth during the past year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Norwegian:</span><span class="font9"> The truth in Norway has not spread as rapidly as it seems it should. There has been a lack of proper understanding, apparently; but we hope for better results in the near future. For some time the work of Norway has been directed from the Swedish office, but now it is under the direction of Brother Enok Oman. We hope for a better organization of the work in Norway and an increased witness for the truth amongst those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Palestine: </span><span class="font9">The Society’s office for Palestine is located at Ram Allah, a short distance from Jerusalem. Brother Abed Mansour, assisted by several other brethren, conducts the work from there. The number of the consecrated is small and most of these are Arabs. But during the past year the literature of the Society published in Arabic, Yiddish, and English has. reached Jerusalem, Samaria, Nazareth, Tiberias, and Safed. This office reports: “We have received many letters from friends all over the world, but have been unable to reply to many because of the different languages”. Recently some Jews there have become interested in the message of truth. Some brethren have recently gone to Palestine from Europe who are now joining the Arabian brethren in spreading the truth in that land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Polish</span><span class="font9"> (domestic) : The office of the Polish work is at Detroit, and at the request of the Polish brethren during the year one of the English-speaking brethren was put in charge, Brother E. J. Coward. All the Studies in the Scripture are published in the Polish language and practically all the booklets; and the Poles have done a splendid work throughout the United States during the past twelve months. The work is in a healthy condition and increasing. Five Pilgrim brethren speaking the Polish language visit the classes and hold public meetings, besides the many local speakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Polish,</span><span class="font9"> (foreign) : The office of the Polish work in Poland is located at Warsaw, with Brother C. Kasprzy-kowski in charge. The work there has been conducted under great difficulties in the past year. Recently Brother Kasprzykowski wrote: “The work is progressing and developing rapidly. Classes are growing and the number of brethren is steadily increasing. In Warsaw every Sunday about 700 attend the meeting in the morning. Recently one of the Polish brethren because of preaching the truth was arrested in Cracow. Amongst other things he was charged in an indictment with slandering the Pope. He defended himself in court, using the Bible for his defense, and the judge directed his acquittal, stating from the bench that he had made a complete defense, saying that he was authorized by the Scriptures to speak as he had spoken. This caused an increased interest in the truth. The persecution awakened the people to know why this man was persecuted.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The work in Russia has not been a success. While the brethren have gone into Russia, they have not met with a reception calculated to be favorable to spreading the gospel of the kingdom. Brother Kasprzykowski writes: “The Bolsheviki do not permit the proclamation of the gospel message. The work is not successful due to the conditions of gross darkness which exist there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Roumanian:</span><span class="font9"> The Society’s branch office for Rou-mania is located at Cluj; Brother J. B. Sima, secretary in charge. The zeal and earnestness put forth by the brethren in Cluj during the past year is cheering to the hearts of God’s people everywhere. It would seem that the people of that land, amongst whose ancestors there were many Christians in the early days, would hear the kingdom message; and although the office has been open in Roumania only a short time, at the last Memorial nearly two thousand consecrated brethren partook of the emblems. The brethren there have met with many difficulties in their efforts to spread the truth, and yet they have pushed forward with a zeal befitting those of the Lord’s house and have been greatly blessed. The people are very poor and are not able to buy as many books as they want, the cost of production and shipping them there being rather too high for the people to meet the price. Hence an arrangement is now on foot to establish a small printing plant in Roumania, from which the literature will be turned out much cheaper; and we hope for a much wider witness in the near future. Many encouraging reports come from Brother Sima. We give a few extracts from his report, not having sufficient space to publish it in full: “We are glad to advise that the Lord's favor in his great work is with us, continually opening to us new places and more opportunity to herald the good news. Recently some of our brethren visited Bucovina, where are many Baptists and Adventists. The result of their visit there for a few weeks is seven classes organized and now studying the volumes and “Tabernacle Shadows’. One of these classes has about 70 members. From Bessarabia a brother, who was until recently an Advent preacher, writes 'About 200 m this place, besides many neighboring places all around, have received the truth. Send to us a brother as soon as possible.’ Another brother, over sixty years of age, formerly an Adventist, writes from Bucharest: 'I thank God for keeping me alive until he sent his servants to make me free from the chain with which I was bound for ten years. The Lord has coin issioned you with the direction of his work in Bucharest; therefore see to it and make all efforts to do it until the door is closed.’ ” While the work is spreading m Roumania. the persecution also increases. But the brethren arc rejoicing and pushing forward with the message.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">South Africa:</span><span class="font9"> Brother Henry Ankertill, in charge of the work in South Africa, reports splendid progress in spreading the gospel in that land during the past twelve months. During the year, Brother Ankertill, assisted by Brothers Williams and De Jager and other brethren, gave a wide public witness on the subject “Millions Now Living Will Never Die”. Brother Ankertill reports: “This campaign opened with a lecture at the Opera House, Cape Town, when 2,000 were present. Thereafter public lectures were held in the towns of Simonstown, Pearl, Worcester, Beaufort West, Kimberley, Vryburg, Mafekmg, Buluwayo, Salisbury, Johannesburg, Krugersdorp, Benoni, Heidelberg, Pretoria, Potchefstroom, Klerksdorp, Kroonstadt, and Bloemfontein; and from the last named we proceeded to the Orange Free State and Natal, returning by the sea and touching at several ports. In making this tour long distances were covered at a large expense, all of which expense was borne by the brethren in South Africa. A considerable amount of literature was also sold and much interest was manifested. These lectures were held in both the Dutch and English languages; and the ‘Millions’ booklet was sold in English, Dutch, and Afrikaans, besides another large amount of literature that was sold.” While the interest in the truth increases, the persecution increases; and this but spurs the brethren on to greater zeal and action. Africa is hearing the message, and those who hear are being made glad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Colored Branch: </span><span class="font9">The work among the colored brethren has been constantly on the increase in the United States in the last year or more, and we have thought that it would grow much more rapidly if the colored friends more particularly would take hold of it. After prayerful consideration and consultation with a number of the colored brethren, a four-day convention was recently held in New York, at which time it was determined to organize a colored branch of the Society. This has been done, and Brother T. E. Banks, of Cincinnati, has been appointed to the position of secretary for the Colored Branch. His office will be in Brooklyn and the work conducted from headquarters here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some of the colored brethren have had the thought that this was a segregation of the colored friends; but this is entirely a wrong idea. There is no segregation about it. While all Christians are one in Christ, each nationality or people should recognize the privilege of serving their own people. It has been found that the organization of the work under various branches has received the greatest blessing of the Lord; and we have no doubt that his blessing will, be manifested particularly on the colored work henceforward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">A regular Pilgrim service will be inaugurated, public meetings will be held, and we call upon our colored brethren to join heartily in the proclamation of the message of the kingdom now being established. The colored friends will find it much more advantageous to organize separate classes and not meet with their white brethren, but devote their energies and services amongst the people of their own color. It will give more opportunity of service for the colored brethren and a wider witness for the truth; and those who are not able to participate in the service should encourage the others by meeting with them. Therefore we strongly urge the colored brethren in every part of the land to organize separate classes and carry on a separate public witness. All contributions to this work of the Society may be sent separately to the Colored Branch, made payable, of course, to the Society. All communications should be addressed as follows: Watch Tower Bible &amp;&nbsp;Tract Society, Colored Branch, 124 Columbia Heights, Brooklyn, N. Y., and the correspondence will be handled by the secretary in charge, Brother Banks, under the supervision of the office here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish:</span><span class="font9"> The Spanish Branch of the Society is located at Los Angeles, California, because there is a greater center of Spanish-speaking people. Brother R. Montero is the secretary in charge. Besides publishing The Watch Tower and Volume 1 in Spanish, the “Hell” booklet, “Tabernacle Shadows,” the “Millions” booklet, and other publications are put out in that language also. There has never been the interest manifest amongst the Spanish people that has been shown amongst some others, and probably this has been largely due to their training under the Papal system. But we are happy to report that there is now a growing interest amongst the Spanish-speaking people in the United States, in Mexico, and m South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Swedish:</span><span class="font9"> The office of the Swedish Branch of the Society is located at Orcbro, Sweden, with Brother A. Lundborg in charge. Tins office also directs the work now in Finland through Brother Harteva, as above mentioned. The general report from Brother Lundborg is that the work has been growing in Sweden during the past twelve months, and particularly has interest increased in the public witness and the message that “millions now living will never die”. During the past year Brother Macmillan made a tour of Sweden and the interest manifested at the public meetings was marvelous, all the halls being crowded to capacity and a great many purchasing the “Millions” booklets and other literature. While the adversary has sought to disrupt the work in Sweden, the Lord has been pleased to bless the message. The office at Orebro this year has printed and sent out 265,000 of the “Millions” booklets in three different languages, besides a great quantity of other literature. The public witness on the subject “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” has been wide in Sweden, as well as in other Scandinavian countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">South America:</span><span class="font9"> The Society maintains a depot or office at Port of Spain, on the Island of Trinidad, which is directed by Brother G. L. Talma, and from which considerable literature is distributed and many meetings are held by the friends, although small in number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At Georgtown, British Guiana, there is a wide witness given by the local brethren; and the public are manifesting interest. Brother George, Young, now on a tour of that section, will visit these points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">Ukrainian</span><span class="font9"> (domestic): This branch is located with the Detroit Polish office, with Brother M. Kostyn in charge, under the direction of the main office through the Detroit office; and the message is spreading amongst the Ukrainians in the United States to the great joy of those who are hearing. The public meetings are well attended and many are buying the literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Each one of these foreign branches keeps an accurate account of monies received and monies expended, literature received and literature sent out, Pilgrim visits, meetings, attendance, etc.; and makes a monthly report to the main office at Brooklyn on blanks furnished for that purpose, so that the office at Brooklyn keeps in close touch with all the foreign work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“MILLIONS NOW LIVING WILL NEVER DIE”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In answer to the question concerning the end of the world, Jesus, after mentioning the World War, famine, pestilence, social disturbance and persecution of Christians, said: “This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations”. </span><span class="font9" style="font-style:italic;">This gospel</span><span class="font9"> clearly means the message that the world has ended, the kingdom of heaven is at hand; hence millions now living will never die. In the countries above mentioned during the past twelve months there has been a wide witness of this message, all the public-speakers using this subject. The little book “Millions Now Living Will Never Die” has been translated into thirty-one languages. It has now been published in twenty-nine languages, and up to October 1, 1921, there were published and sent out in all these languages combined from the main office and the various branches a total of 3,366,000 volumes. Public meetings addressed by able speakers have been held in practically all the cities and towns of the United States and Canada during the past twelve months at which this subject has been used. On September 25 and October 30 simultaneously every Pilgrim, elder or other brother who was able to give a public address addressed a public meeting at some place. The reports from the meetings were exceedingly gratifying. At the conclusion of each of these meetings a large number of booklets was sold. The combination of “The Finished Mystery”, “Can the Living Talk with the Dead?” and “Millions Now Living &quot;Will Never Die” has reached in this way a great number of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PILGRIM SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The public speakers sent out during the year by the Brooklyn office number 101. These Pilgrim brethren have visited the classes and held parlor meetings and addressed the public at advertised meetings. The number of public meetings held in the United States during the year is 5,261; total attendance at public meetings, 814,113; number of visits, 7,075; number of class meetings, 8,882; total attendance at class and convention meetings, 357;703; total miles traveled 688,987</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVENTIONS</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the fiscal year there were held in the United States and Canada 29 conventions. This does not include the local conventions of the various classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">At all the public meetings addressed by the President of the Society during the past year and by some of the other speakers, announcement has been made by fullpage advertisement in the newspapers. Some have thought that this was a useless expenditure of money; but when it is properly understood it can be seen that it is an economical way of spending money. The advertisement is not merely for the purpose of getting people to come to the meeting, but as a witness. The fullpage announcement carries a statement of the truth, which is equivalent to a tract, and thus reaches for each meeting many thousands more than ever go to hear the lecture, and from these advertisements a great many orders have been received by the local classes, as well as by the office, for books and other literature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">SERVICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year there have engaged in the regular colporteur work in the United States 319 colporteurs, who have devoted all their time to canvassing for and selling the literature of the Society. Since the end of the fiscal year 170 have enlisted as auxiliary colporteurs, and this will add to the workers for the ensuing year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Within the year a working organization was affected in many of the classes throughout the United States, each class so organized furnishing so many workers who spent a part of their time in the field making calls and selling literature. The number engaged in this work during the year was 9,013.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The calls made by the colporteurs during the year were, to wit: 3,196,400. Counting families as 3.5 persons per family, according to statistics, the colporteurs reached with the message approximately 11,190,596 persons. The class workers made 2,871,145 calls. The total number of calls made by colporteurs and class workers is 6,067,545, reaching approximately 21,242,475 persons. The colporteurs placed literature in one form or another in homes to the number of 701,013. The colporteurs and class workers together placed literature in one form or another in 1,213,509 homes; consequently within the daily reach of approximately 4,248,495 persons. Thus it will be seen that approximately one-fifth of the population of the United States was reached by calls and witnessed to during the year. Nothing compared to this has ever been done in any one year during the harvest period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">BOOKS AND LITERATURE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">During the year books and literature in the English language alone were sold and distributed in the United States exclusively by colporteurs and class workers as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Studies in the Scriptures (including Zg’s) and Scenarios ........... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,133,288</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Can the Living Talk with the Dead?”...................... 414,231</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Hell” booklets and other booklets (exclusive of the “Millions” booklet)......................... &nbsp;35,350</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Some idea of the quantity of literature that has been distributed amongst the people can be approximated when we are reminded that there have been printed and sent out from the Brooklyn office alone magazines, tracts, etc., as follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age....................................................... 2,509,567</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Talking with the Dead”...................................... &nbsp;414,231</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Tracts ----------------------- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;232,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Figuring these in tract pages of literature distributed amongst the people (aside from the Studies in the Scriptures, Scenarios and “Millions” booklets) would amount to 262,049,312,000 tract pages. This was in the United States alone, to say nothing about the wide distribution of literature in all the other countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE WATCH TOWER</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The English edition of The Watch Tower, as its readers well know, is published at Brooklyn and sent to subscribers throughout the world. The Watch Tower is also published in foreign tongues. The total number of languages in which it is now being published is fifteen, and the subscription list is constantly growing. Notwithstanding the disturbances that came in 1917 and 1918, the subscription list now exceeds what it was in 1916 and 1917. It is gratifying to know of the increased numbers who desire the message of truth as sent forth in The Watch Tower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE GOLDEN AGE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age has done a splendid work during the past year, and has furnished a medium for reaching the public that we could not otherwise have reached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">We are pleased now to call attention to the fact that The Golden Age subscription price, beginning with January 1, will be reduced to $1.00, in order to put it within the reach of all classes of the reading public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">PRINTING</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In addition to the printing plant at Brooklyn, the Society also has printing presses, Linotype machine, and other printing apparatus at the Detroit office, where the literature is printed in the Polish, Ukrainian, Czechoslovakian, Russian, and other languages. The Society is also doing a large amount of printing in Germany, and in Poland, in addition to the printing plant at Berne, Switzerland, and the one that is now being put in at Cluj, Roumama. Also a considerable amount of literature is printed at London. The English Studies in the Scriptures and the other books are manufactured in the United States under contract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">CORRESPONDENCE</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The correspondence during the year has been unusually heavy, requiring an additional clerical force to handle it. Letters and cards received during the year, 160,161; dispatched during the year, 157,965. In this connection we might suggest that the friends could aid a little in this behalf by making their letters brief and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">FINANCIAL</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Nothwithstanding the high cost of living, unemployment, etc., the friends have very liberally supported the work this year through the “Good Hopes”. We append hereto a brief summary of the financial statement as shown by the Treasurer’s report at the annual meeting, at the close of the fiscal year, October 1, 1921;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Balance from 1920 (corrected)..................................$2,275.58</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Good Hopes” Nov. 1, 1920—Oct. 1, 1921................ 164,606.56</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">$166,882.14</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Foreign branches and work in U. S.......................$84,166.35</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Foreign Pilgrim work from U. S.........................—$1,435.70</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Local Pilgrim work........................... &nbsp;40,096.69</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Conventions ....................................... &nbsp;$1,187.60</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Free literature, postage, expense, etc $12,918.73</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Special witness work $16,112.03</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Incidental ............................_............. &nbsp;1,629.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Balance ............................................. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9,336.04</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">$166,882.14</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">With the closing of the fiscal year there were unpaid bills that will practically wipe out this balance, but we look forward with faith and confidence in the Lord to supply the funds for the ensuing year. It is with gratitude that we note his continued manifestation of loving kindness to his people who are striving to make known the message of the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">It may be of interest to the friends to know something about the duties of the main office and the work performed. The Secretary-Treasurer keeps an accurate account of all monies received and expended, and pays out only upon voucher duly attested; keeps a book record of all donations, with the names of the persons donating and the number of voting shares to which each is entitled. In addition to this he serves as a member of the Editorial Committee of The Watch Tower and conducts certain correspondence, particularly relating to his department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Office Manager has charge of all the departmental work, overseeing that, assigning the help and looking after the various departments. The correspondence work generally is divided among a number of brethren, according to states. Account is kept of mail received and sent out, orders received, shipments made, etc., so that at the close of each day the status of the work can be readily ascertained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The duties of the President can be briefly stated as follows: General supervision of the main office at Brooklyn, which is divided into the following departments: Financial, Editorial, Pilgrim, Correspondence, Service (including Sales, Colporteur and Bookkeeping), Circulation, Store, Composition and Typesetting, Shipping, Trucking, Bethel Home (including Dining Room, Kitchen, Laundry, and Housekeeping). He receives the reports from foreign branches, examines these and gives general direction as to the work in all the foreign countries, money to be expended and how to be expended, and generally supervises the work in each foreign country. He also conducts correspondence relating to the general affairs of the church, both domestic and foreign; supervises the publication of The Golden Age; writes for and supervises the publication of The Watch Tower; and prepares copy for tracts, books, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">If some of the friends do not receive prompt reply to letters addressed to the President’s office, please understand that it is not because of neglect, but because of inability to answer all of them promptly.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font9">The world is the field. Large is the field and small the number of workers; yet thanks to be God that he permits his people to have some part in the work that the Lord is conducting. Taking a general view of the field, we can truly say the Lord has caused his name to be heard in the land during the year just closing. In our annual report for 1920 we suggested that the year 1921 would be one of unprecedented opportunity for spreading the message of the kingdom. In this prediction we were correct. It has been the best year of all; and greater numbers of people have heard the message of truth during 1921 than in any previous year during the harvest time. This is just what we should expect. The battle is on between the “beast” and the Lamb, with certain victory for the Lamb. The kingdom of heaven is at hand. and truly we can now say: “The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever”. The tide of truth is rising higher and higher, and notwithstanding ever-increased persecution, the truth continues to be spread and the common people are hearing it gladly. There is much yet to be done. Let the Lord’s dear saints everywhere take courage and gird themselves </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">for a more </span><span class="font9">strenuous witness in 1922 than heretofore. So long aa the Lord gives us opportunity to labor in his field, </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">let </span><span class="font9">us do it with a joyful heart. Slack not </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">your handi, </span><span class="font9">dear brethren. The worldly-wise see that the present order of things has gone to seed and is rotting down. The unholy alliance through its medium of propaganda, the public press, is freely stating that if the present efforts of its statesmen in world conference at Washington do not bring about peace amongst the people, within a few months the whole civilization will be plunged into chaos. We know they are certain to fail. They have made the loop with which to bind themselves. They have put their heads into the loop and hence their kings and nobles are now being bound; and this honor the Lord has given unto his saints. Let his dear people everywhere take courage. Calmly, soberly, yet joyfully, let them press forward now in making proclamation of the kingdom, seizing every opportunity as it is given. Each one as he goes can confidently say: “I will triumph in the works of thy hands!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">The Lord’s people of every nation, kindred and tongue are in action united in heart and in hand. May this union of peace and harmony prevail; and let all now stand shoulder to shoulder and continue to battle for the cause of our King until victory crowns our efforts and we stand with him upon Mount Zion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">In the next issue we hope to have something to say about the outlook for the coming year, for the encouragement of the Lord dear people throughout the earth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">OBADIAH AN UNWILLING MESSENGER-ELIJAH AND AHAB MEET — THE RENDEZVOUS AT CARMEL--ELIJAH’S CONFIDENT CHALLENGE -JEHOVAH’S TRIUMPH.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">effect </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith.&quot;—1 John 5:4-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">J</span><span class="font8">ESUS opened heaven three years and six months, from his baptism to his death, and rained down the divine dew of the gospel. Elijah shut heaven for the same length of time, and there was no rain at all. This drought is connected with Elijah’s prayer. (James 5:17) From this we are not to suppose that Jehovah merely pandered to the whims of Elijah. Elijah was God’s spokesman, and he under stood the divine law. The law had said that rain would be withholden from disobedient children of Israel. Elijah therefore had a Scriptural basis for his prayer that it should not rain. Indeed, the vindication of Jehovah’s name was involved in the matter, inasmuch as longer lack of punishment might seem to indicate laxity or carelessness on Jehovah's part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah had dwelt with the woman of Sarepta for more than two years. This was now in the third year, not of the drought, but of his sojourn in Phoenicia. Thereupon divine direction was miraculously imparted to him to the effect that he should go and show himself to Ahab. He was further informed that his prayers to Jehovah for rain were about to be answered. Accordingly, Elijah journeyed down the coast of the Mediterranean some fifty miles to the neighborhood of Mount Carmel, or near the modern city and harbor of Haifa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">During the near forty-two months of aridity the land had suffered severely from famine. Some food could be imported for the people,, but this was too difficult and expensive for the live stock. Ahab’s private stables came to the point of suffering, and he divided the territory of Israel between himself and Obadiah, his chief steward, so that they might visit all the water heads in the hope of finding enough grass to keep their horses and mules alive. It was particularly desirable that the king’s own steeds should be preserved for use in case of invasion. The whole land was at an extremity; and some surrounding king might be ambitious enough to occupy parts of the land and endanger the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This Obadiah was not the later prophet who bore the same name, but he was a worshiper of Jehovah. To be a worshiper of Jehovah at all under the reign of Ahab and Jezebel required no inconsiderable courage. To be a worshiper of Jehovah in the very household of Ahab meant much more. Doubtless Jehovah liad exercised his care over Obadiah, with a view to using him as an intermediary between the king and the prophet Elijah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">ELIJAH DILIGENTLY SOUGHT</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It </span><span class="font8">was during the three years after Elijah’s announcement of the closing of the windows of heaven that Ahab </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sought </span><span class="font8">diligently for Elijah. The Prophet had said that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font8">should not rum except by his word; and as the barren</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ness </span><span class="font8">of the fields and the emptiness of the streams became </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">more </span><span class="font8">widespread, Ahab was moved to action. Not only did </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">he </span><span class="font8">seek throughout Israel but he prosecuted the search in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">surrounding principalities and kingdoms, exacting and receiving an oath from the monaiclis of those lands to the effect that Elijah was not there. As a matter of fact, the Prophet was all the while in the territory of Ahab’s fatherin-law, but so well concealed that no one was able to discover his vv hereabouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Incensed at hei husband’s inability </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font8"> find Elijah (to punish him or to force him to produce ram), Jezebel sought out and put to death<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark8">1</a></sup> a great many otliei worshipers of Jehovah (1 Kings IS: 4) The word prophet in this passage simply signifies one who prays to, supplicates, am} calls upon Jehovah The same usage of the word prophesy is found in verse 29 of the same chapter. lion many were slain we do not know, but one bundled veie hidden by Obadiah in one of the numerous caves of the legion and fed with bread and water This action on Obadiah’s part was betrayed to the king but piobably kept from the queen. Obadiah must have been a very faithful and useful seivant; otherwise the king would have destroyed him. His very name remained unchanged, which meant, Servant of Jehovah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Quite probably by divine supervision Obadiah’s share of the territory lay to the west of Jozreel, the capital. It was while traversing this section and possibly making for the perennial springs of Mount Carmel—ore of which was made use of m connection with the subsequent sacrifice there—that Obadiah was met by Elijah The king’s steward recognized the Piophet at once and fell on his face before him Again, the Piophet's words were </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">few: “Go, tell thy loid,</span><span class="font8"> Behold, Elijah is here&quot;. But Obadiah demurred He wanted some assurance that Elijah would remain there. He knew of his master’s anient efforts </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font8"> find Elijah and of the disaster which befell a number of lus fellow' worshipers in consequence of Ahab's failure If he were to bear a message to Ahab saying that Elijah was present near Garmel am! il the king should hasten thither and not find him, he would be wiath.v indeed, and Obadiah's high standing in the knig-’s Junmehold would no, longer serve to protect him Tlieiefore Ehj.ili assured him that he would remain m that spot until Ahab came This was satisfactory to Obadiah and lie proceeded to find the king</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Ahab was found he came at once to meet Elijah Could it be tlnil this bold piophet of Jehovah who had so atidacioiisiv prophesied no rain and had so successfully hidden fiom Ins piling search wns-now leallv theie<sup>7</sup> Yes, these he was and Ahab, like all small men, sought to blame God's prophet toi that very thing which was Insown responsibility. “Is it thou, tlmu troubler of IsiaeP&quot; But Elijah answeied that the cause for the trouble was not in him The cause of the dearth ot-water was placed on its true giotmd the king and the people had forsaken the true God and God had shut up the heavens, that theie was no rain. Eliiah was only the minister of God used to dispense the judgment. Ahab was to blame, and hm father Omri</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Ahab’s weak bluster was met not only by a statement of truth as to the cause of the famine but it was met by a command to send and gather together the heads of iribes and families in Israel unto Mount Carmel where Elijah would be Furthermore, the king was (omni.inded to bring the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal, who were specially under Ahab’s patronage, as also the four hundred prophets of Venus Astarte, who constituted the court chaplaincy of Jezebel. The relationship of Ahab and Jezebel to Baal and Astarte was inadvertently mentioned in reverse order in our last lesson. It will be noted that while the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal were brought to Carmel, the four hundred prophets of Venus, Astoreth, or Asherah, were not there. Evidently Jezebel would not allow </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">her</span><span class="font8"> prophets to leave Jezreel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE RENDEZVOUS AT CARMEL</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the course of a few days the leaders of Israel, together with the Baalite prophets, were gathered together before Elijah on Alount Caimel. Elijah approached boldly and yet calmly to the people and said, literally, “How long halt ye about on two boughs?” This is a metaphor taken from birds hopping about from bough to bough, not knowing on which to settle. The revised Version renders this passage, &quot;How long go ye limping between two sides?” The thought of lameness is a good one and should not be overlooked. The people were halt, they could not walk uprightly, they dreaded Jehovah, and therefore could not totally abandon him; they feared the king and the queen, and therefore thought they must embiace the religion of the state. Their conscience forbade them to do the first of these things; their fear of man persuaded them to do the latter: but in neither were they liemtily engaged. Just at this juncture the minds of the people seemed to be in a state of equipoise. When Elijah proposed to them, “If Jehovah be God, follow him: but If Baal, then follow him,&quot; they answered not a word. The reason that the people said nothing was that they had nothing to say. Not all people are as wise as that, but these Juul been suffering from thirst and were not disposed to be captious on any point. Many of them were doubtless convinced that the drought was a divine judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah proceeded to sum up the situation by saying that, while there were four hundred fifty prophets of Baal present, he was the only one representing Jehovah. All the advantage of numbers was on the side of Baal. It was four hundred and fifty to one. Elijah did not complain because Jezebel's four Jvumlred priests were not brought, inasmuch as he probably knew that they would be used to the subsequent undoing of Ahab. (1 Kings 22 6) Elijah further proposed that the people piodnce two bullocks, from which one would be chosen by the priests of Baal and one left for the Prophet of the Lord. Apparently there were some cattle left in the hill districts where the water heads had preserved a small amount of freshness and grass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The bullock for Baal was to be cut up in the usual sacrificial manner and hud on wood on an altar. The Baalite priests were to call upon their god to ignite the sacrifice by miraculous fire If Baal answered by fire he should be acknowledged as very god. But if lie did not Answer and if Jehovah answered his Prophet by sending fire to burn up the sacrifice of the other bullock, then Jehovah was to be acknowledged as God in the hearts of the people. This time the&gt; people answered: “It is well spoken”—-it is a fair proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">number,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">THE SUN-GOD INVOKED</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Elijah gave his opponents every advantage when he granted that the God who answered by </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">fire</span><span class="font8"> should be acknowledged as the true God; for as the Baal who was worshiped here was certainly Apollo, or the Sun, he was therefore the </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">god of fire,</span><span class="font8"> and had only to work In his own element. Since the Baahte priests were greater in number, they were given the preference In point of time.</span></p>
