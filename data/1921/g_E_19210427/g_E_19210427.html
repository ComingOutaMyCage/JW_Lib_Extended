<h3><a name="bookmark12"></a><span class="font14" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Crime’s Rising Tide </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">(Part</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One)</span></h3>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE situation is not so bad in America as in Europe, where in some places the authorities give no protection after nine o’clock p. m., ' and where by early evening business automatically stops because everyone is off the streets. ---- In America, however, business keeps on as usual and is not hampered by external crime; but the losses are considerable, and not a few go without things which they had owned until some stranger bolder than Wall Street relieved them of their belongings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crime's Appetite</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■„ rpHE losses from crime indicate an omnivor-ous criminal appetite. Stories drift through the press telling of one man “giving up” his silk shirts; a woman losing her beaded handbag; etc. Overcoats are gone, among them one £ belonging to a chief of police. Some belle parts with a pearl necklace worth $150,000—after it has disappeared. Charlotte King Palmer reports gems gone worth $767,000. A 400-pound bust of Werner von Siemens walks out of a * Berlin park. A silver-mounted marshal’s baton of an ancient king of Poland is recovered by the gendarmes. One poor fellow tells the authorities that some of his personal property has disappeared—“two $90 suits, a $74 overcoat,-a $14 pair of evening trousers, a (new) $23 boy’s suit, a mink stole, a nickel-plated watch, a’pearl-handled knife, three belts and a n Eversharp pencil”. Money, checks and securities take wings without stock-market speculation, including a haul of $3,500,000 by some hoys \who<sub>:</sub> became so scared at the huge -amount that; they burned most of it to ashes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Altogether the takings, and •miscellaneous costs to the public of those that take, without some process of law to hide behind, amount to some $3,500,000 a day the country over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Banks and Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ANKS are among the sufferers. Cashiers throw up their hands; bank employes line up with face to the wall before the watchful muzzle of a gun. Paying tellers never know which gentlemanly face will peer above a weapon of war. Receiving tellers here and there keep supper waiting for fearful merchants who wish to deposit the afternoon receipts. The contents of bank vaults change guardianship in expeditious order; and walls, floors and partitions give way to hungry hammers, chisels and crowbars, assisted by Fourth-of-July accompaniments and acetylene “can-openers”. Securities seem strongly disposed to change from regular to -illicit holders, disappearing from safes, vaults and the hands of bank and bankers’ messengers on the street, to repose in the care of pawnbrokers and irregular dealers at distant points, in amounts running to hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Banditry</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">B</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ANDITRY flourishes as never before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Stolen automobiles on the track stop trains for hold-up men to ransack and cart the fruitage of their skill and boldness off in trucks. Golfers returning home get out of their cars and give up their possessions to perfect strangers. Clerks on mail trains look into the muzzles of shiny automatics, and permit new-found acquaintances to ‘depart with $100,000 or so. Mail sacks yield their registered mail, while armed guards in the next car watch in blissful bravery over their charge. Burglary in particular flourishes. A roll of oilcloth carried into an apartment for delivery is the cover for a handy firearm, and electric drills and nitroglycerine finish the job with the safe. Seldom have the citizenry felt less confidence that a good</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19210427_files/g_E_19210427-5.png" alt="" style="width:21pt;height:19pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">night's sleep might not cover some great loss of. earnings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">With such crimes against property it is not ’surprising that the misdirected initiative and energy should yield a heavy crop of crimes against the person. Alen get off easy who are beaten with blackjacks, felled with the fist, dropped fo the earth with the butt of a revolver, - or clubbed into insensibility. Whether the attack is resisted or not, the objective of the assault is often found seriously wounded, with bullets through shoulder, chest, limbs or abdomen, and not infrequently dead, shot through the head, heart or other vital organ. Killings <sub>(</sub> are not limited to New York: a southern city a thirtieth the size of the metropolis has the unenvied record of the leadership in murder and manslaughter; for a person in the larger city’ is eleven times as safe from death by this cause. Afemphis is followed by Savannah, while the safest places from sudden illegal killing are Aliiwaukee and Dayton. New York, in spite of great publicity to the contrary, is the safest of the large cities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">American Crime Wave</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">U</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">P TO the first of the year opinion differed as to the existence of a wave of crime. The dry interests naturally desired to make a good showing for the principles for which they stand, and pointed to statistics showing a general decrease in crime. Figures for the entire country’ are not readily compiled; but those for New A<sup>T</sup>ork City, including only’ the varieties of crime most dreaded — murder, felonious assault, assault and robbery and burglary—for the first eleven months of the six years ending with 1920 were respectively 15,885, 14,431, 13,141, 10,838, 11,292, and 10,614, indicating the substantial decrease of a third. Another set of figures from the District Attorney’s office, taking 1917 as 100 percent to compare with, shows for the^hree following years respectively 118 percent, 141 percent and 128 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It appears from this that the crime wave reached its peak in 1919 and receded about 16 percent in 1920, as far as New York is concerned. During the Christmas Holidays and just preceding, the opportunities for good pickings by the light-fingered is at the highest in the year, and takings of property increase annually, all cities reporting such a peak in crime. Illegal killings in 1919 and 1920 reached the high figure of 9.1 per 100,000 population, as against 8.5 in 1918, but less than the 9.2 of 1916 and 1917. Prison populations; have increased in some places, owing to police activity; but in most of the smaller cities and towns the jails were never as nearly empty. The U. S. Secret Service reports the greatest amount of criminal activity in its history, but fails to advise how much of it is the immensely greater i number of crimes under the new dry and other economic laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Foreign Crime Wave</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE can, however, be no'doubt that a tidal wave of crime exists in other countries, and that the same conditions in America would produce the same increase in offenses against the law. Some European countries are reported to have nine times the crime that they had before the war. In Spain political .crime is rife, and many business houses have petitioned the Spanish Government-to give guarantees for the lives and property of factory owners, employes and workmen. England in 1920 had 11,034 more sentences to prison than in 1919. Paris joins wnth London in a wave of crime, suggesting that the widespread prevalence of lawlessness has a common world-wide cause. Alany American cities show some increase in crimes of violence. Alen made desperate by the cause that is making people desperate the globe over, come out of the darkness ' to rob and, if unavoidable, to kill. It should not be concluded, however, that anything like the amount of crime exists here that does in Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Politics and Crime &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N POLITICS, as in love and war, anything is considered fair by those to whom a trusting populace gives the management of public affairs. It is the regular thing for a group of politicians to lie and to slander to the limit in order to prejudice and ruin an opponent, however honest or capable he may be or may not be. Every conceivable and imaginable expedient is resorted to in order to bring about the removal of a man. An observing French historian remarked recently that nearly all elections in America are fought on religious lines, the Democratic party being substantially the Roman Catholic, or Clerical party, and the</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark14"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark15"></a>■ *</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Republican party being in effect the Protestant party, for overwhelming majorities in the parties belong to those respective faiths. This fact is sedulously sidestepped in press discus-sions'of political affairs, but in a locality predominantly Romanist a Protestant official is. liable to become the target for political mis<sub>T </sub>representation with a view to prejudicing him in the eyes of the public and obtaining his removal, and vice versa in a predominantly Protestant community. Something of this kind may explain in part the “terrible crime wave” Of New York City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■Protection against Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">LL sorts of protection against crime have</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">• been advocated or put into effect. Long-range remedies are hauled out of storage, such as surgical operations on the heads ofcriminals to make them law-abiding citizens, the removal of tonsils, and the perpetual restraint of mental defectives, beginning at childhood, continuing with a three-year reformatory course,., training in trades, and life-long supervision at home— the army of supervisors to be paid for out of ♦Axes. The number of such defectives is under three percent of the population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">For immediate protection many are the instructions. Good, strong steel safes are advocated, particularly with unremovable bottoms requiring more than the all-night work of expert yeggmen to get into them. A better plan is suggested in the removing of all valuables and money to the bank, which must then be open till six or seven, and the leaving of all private safe doors open by night “to foil the •robbers”. Mustard gas in the safe over night sends robbers off. Vigilance committees, security alliances, safety-fund societies, protective unions and like associations of merchants increase the, difficulty of successful crime. Revolvers and automatics are plentifully scattered about stores to,be handy for employes in thelnstant of' danger—and friends are shot with them. Prompt use of the telephone to the police is another anti-crime activity of the lay population. Foot-signalling devices abound in stores, especially ih th$ jewelry trade. A few’ merchants have* installed able-jawed bulldogs in their places of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Banks and cashiers are canvassed to erect glass shields capable of resisting 45-caliber bullets at twelve inches range. The United States</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Bureau of Standards is training its employes to become expert safe-blowers and “can-open- -ers”, with a view to ascertaining the burglar’s line of attack and of finally developing &quot;the absolutely impregnable war-chest”. Hotel guests are supplied with elaborate instructions how to keep their doors locked and to take extraordinary precautions about suspicious persons. Garage owners are exhorted to maintain close relations with the official guardians of the peace. Streets, and particularly dark comers and nooks, are to be better-lighted.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE average voter imagines that a large police force means an equally large number of policemen constantly on duty. The actual figures for the New York police force of 10,700 men show that the number available for actual patrol duty is 14 percent at a time, the other 86 percent being divided as follows: officers 13<sup>4 </sup>percent, traffic duty 13 percent, detectives 8 percent, plain-clothes duty 5 percent, sick or on vacation 8 percent, court duty 13 percent, two shifts off duty constantly 26 percent. On this basis the 1,500 patrolmen constantly on duty on 3,514 miles of street have something over two miles of street apiece, certainly a very small number of officers to do the excellent work that is accomplished. On a population basis this is one patrolman to every 3,747 population, probably as light a representation as any place of any size in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Naturally the patrolman has to be a broadminded, tolerant citizen with a live-and-let-live policy for all the hundreds under his care. He is likely to know the persons of criminal tendency and to let them alone when they are not making trouble for the citizenry. There is always a kind of armed truce between the officer and the known members of the underworld. It is in times of public alarm that the criminal is dealt with with strict severity, and in such times as the recent newspaper crime wave stringent action is taken. The jails become filled, not because of any great increase in crime, but from enhanced zeal on the part of public servants. Spectacular auto patrols with rifle squads hurdle the street comers. This proved an excellent plan in Cleveland, where such squads are ahvays ready to reach the scene of a crime in two or three minutes, rendering more difficult the escape of the offender.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Motorcycle patrols ehug ceaselessly and swiftly along thoroughfares and deserted streets, warning the would-be criminal to wait : a Ini or to “hide himself until the danger be overpast”. The policy is adopted of keeping known committers of crime on the run and to give no rest day or night, so that the birds may take wings to healthier localities. General roundups embracing scores or hundreds of suspected persons gather jailfuls, out of whom a few are detained as “wanted&quot;. Gambling dens and other resorts are broken into, and the inhabiters* names entered on the blotters of the police station. Rough work is encouraged, as in ordinances granting promotion to officers that kill a criminal, so that it is the boast that more men are brought in on shutters than ever before, a policy, however, which invites reprisals in the shape of an unusual wave of illegal killings and woundings of both citizens and police. Persons unable to give a satisfactory account of themselves are brought in to the station to be questioned and citizens out after midnight are stopped and asked what their business is. In Cincinnati &quot;suspicious appearance” is the offense entered, and convictions are many, but the suspended sentence protects the officer and • the court from prosecution for illegal arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Roads to and from municipalities are guarded, passers stopped and questioned, and quick communication is arranged between localities to trace suspects promptly; neighboring states cooperate, and frequent and large rewards are offered for the arrest of wrong-doers. Paroles from prison are restricted so as to keep the prisoners from being at large as long as possi-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">telephones are installed to afford facilities for the prompt reporting of trouble. Firemen are called into service to report difficulties, as are municipal employes of all kinds. In many cities the brutal beating of offenders arrested is</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">practised to make them afraid of the personal injury'connected with trouble with the police. The clergy are enlisted to urge faith in—not the Deity—but the rank and file of the police force, and to plead for cooperation in municipal endeavors to. keep crime down and to provide anti-criminal education — nothing, however, to be said about employers not profiteering or not keeping their factories open or paying wages that will not drive men into crime. Mounted state police are asked for, like the so-called</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Cossacks” of Pennsylvania, to strike terror by -ruthless and lawless methods. Fleets of high-powered automobiles are provided to compete with the swift cars employed in crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">New York and a few other cities are distinguished by having zones or deadlines where nq known crooks are allowed, but are arrested on sight within the forbidden precincts. Criminals, in their armed truce with the police, usually respect these limitations, but not so much of late. Of course the poor average citizen with a few dollars or cents he hates to lose, wonders why a whole city should not be a forbidden ' zone, as well as the haunts of His Excellency, Big Business, in Wall Street In some office buildings everyone entering the building is expected to register his name and the office he intends to visit. Special protection is often . given to localities wher? large payrolls are handled on pay-days. Some simple folk even wonder why little criminals and their gambling dens are broken up and the big stock exchange gamblers and the big criminals are given special protection and the law not enforced against them.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE policeman's life is not a safe one. Many an officer in discharge of duty is wounded or killed. The officer has to be ready any time to advance amid the whistle of bullets. Daily he flirts with death, in dangerous neighborhoods.

Graft, once considered rife, has not of late been often charged against the Metropolitan police, though there are occasional suspicions of collusion with lawbreakers, something almost inevitable in a period reeking with such public stealing and corruption as was exemplified in the Shipping Board scandal. In some places, where charges of inefficiency are made members of the force are detailed to give brief talks before a variety of organizations to lay the facts before them. Large parades and receptions to public men afford examples of the efficiency of the police ta handling people with tact and without offenee. The mixed population of American cities pre-</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">duties call for patience, knowledge of human nature and courage, and many are the tales of the detective’s skill. The detective bureau is the invisible eye and ear, and sometimes the powerful hand, of the department of public safety. The detective is omnipresent and almost omniscient. Cities are divided into zones about im- - portant financial, manufacturing or shopping districts, which are patrolled by plain-clothes men whose business it is to detect offenses and offenders. Detectives frequent the haunts of criminals; they arrange the round-ups whereby hundreds, scores or dozens are taken, and the persons wanted sifted out; they make acquaintances and obtain the friendship and the confidence of offenders, for the purpose of betraying them in the interest of society. They patiently watch houses for hints of habits and acts of the suspected;, they attend public and private gatherings in the search for evidence; they . masquerade as members of- suspected groups, ■ by pretended zeal rise to high places, and even incite the groups to crime, in order to “get” individuals wanted out of the way. They watch the streams of travel at stations, docks and transfer points; they keep an eye on the crowds entering and leaving theatres and public places; they busy themselves in the corridors of public buildings. They act as postmen, expressmen, milkmen, or delivery men; at times they commit crimes themselves in order to emphasize to the public or their employers the need of their services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Some detectives are men of particularly strong physique for the muscular handling of men; for in the pursuit of duty they are assaulted, wounded, and sometimes murdered. Occasionally they have to show themselves veritable gymnasts ip the pursuit of their quarry. Yet they are huriian, and score some marked • failures to detect, as when stores are looted and the contents of safes taken out while dozens of public guardians pass, and when Nicky Am-stein parades showily in an automobile before hundreds of them without being recognized. It is particularly hard to get good men for this service, and its efficiency is hampered by green and amateurish members and by the class of men who will take such work at the pay offered,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■ Lawyers and Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">L</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">AWYERS, as agents of the courts, bring ■ </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> about the conviction of offenders, and are an important factor in the social defense against crime. But criminals are to be considered innocent till proved guilty, and often are able to hire better lawyers than the prosecution can. Every conceivable device, straight and crooked, is employed to preserve the accused from harm. It is a poor lawyer that cannot obtain repeated adjournments of the trials of men who are actually committers of crime, until the offense is forgotten, the witnesses scattered or tampered with, or strong political or religious infiu-ence corrupts the action of justice, and the accused is freed, often without trial. A class of able lawyers is relied upon by offenders to get them out of trouble. Bail is secured; but the criminal often prefers to leave and forfeit the bail, after which, in the press of new cases, the old are forgotten. Lawyers, too, know to a nicety the personality of judges, and get cases, if possible, heard before certain judges whose peculiarities can be played upon to the utmost. In the United States the jury is chosen, practically by the attorney for the criminal, and in murder cases not far from 90 percent escape conviction for offenses of which there would often seem little reasonable doubt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Courts and Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE ideal court is one where justice is impartially and speedily meted out, but the courts are hedged about with hindrances to ideal action. Precedent favors the accused., Postponements are so presented as to be hard to refuse, especially in the magistrates’ courts, where the matter can easily be passed on to a successor. Patrolmen are needlessly kept waiting in court, where calendars might, be rear-Tanged to get&quot; the officers quickly back on patrol duty. Too low bail is allowed for desperate men; the cases of w’ell-known offenders might be advanced and speedy trial given, especially in crimes of violence. First offenders are sometimes treated too leniently, and permitted to go back unscathed to further crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. The treatment of criminals in the United States is outlined by a Middle West editor:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“If a man starts out to rob and kill upon the highway in England or Canada he knows that if he is caught he will in all human probability suffer the penalty of his crime. If he does this same thing in the United States, he knows that in all human probability nothing whatever will happen to him. At the police station every facility will be afforded for his prompt relief, able lawyers will search for flaws in his indictment, political judges will listen to appeals from state and county and city chairmen and bow fo the threats of journalistic dictators .... Perhaps the chief offenders are those members of the legal profession who seem to have no compunctions whatever about securing the release and escape of our very worst criminals. The bar associations turn a sympathetic ear toward their black sheep, and eminent attorneys decline to become prosecutors or judges. There is more money in the defense than in the prosecution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The leniency of politicians—as when President Wilson pardoned Dorsey, the wealthy seller of thousands of tubercular cattle — discourages judges. It was this state of mind that made Judge Kenesaw M. Landis refuse to sentence six poor men convicted of stealing six sacks of sugar. “I can’t sentence these men with the Dorsey thing fresh in iny mind”, said the Judge in court. “Dorsey’s activities ran into the thousands of dollars, while these men stole only a few hundred dollars’ worth of merchandise. I will continue this case indefinitely.”</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">UNISHMENT for crime seems to vary with several factors. Political judges in Chicago impose the minimum of $25 for running gambling joints, and the minimum of $5 on professional crooks and gamblers. Such penalties are too light and can handsomely be afforded out of current proceeds from the “business”. Other judges impose the maximum both in fines • and imprisonments, and urge laws increasing the penalties to unheard-of extremes, in the face of the science of penology, which clearly demonstrates from the history of crime that severity of punishment is no particular deterrent to crime; for crime does not-vary with the hardness of judges, but with other causes entirely unrelated to courts and prisons. “As well be killed^ for, an ox as a sheep,” illustrated the mental processes of an offender in the days when hanging was the punishment for scores of offenses against property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The taking of a criminal’s life, however, is regarded a reasonable penalty for bis taking</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">of his victim’s life, and is the rule world-wide. If the penalty is certain it deters from murder; but for the three years of 1916, 1917 and 1918 the United States had 23,842 murders, but only 285 executions, or 1.2 percent—a laxity which accounts for the fact that Chicago, with a third । the population of London, has twelve times the j murders, or with equal population would have thirty-six times as many. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;!</span></p>

Rewards for the apprehension of offenders, are fruitful occasionally, but such propositions are •’ usually “safe” enough offers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Insurance against crime, while comforting to the insured, hinders offenders but little. That crimes against property are on the increase is . demonstrated by the ever-rising premiums for ; burglary insurance, which in certain cities advanced on residences from $27.50 to $40.00, and on apartments from $30 to $50, the advances of 45 percent and 67 percent representing the '' increased value risk to property in residences and apartments. For banks and brokers the * premiums have had a heavy riser and in some instances and localities the policies provide that armed guards are to accompany all movements of cash and securities, for the average loss ratio in proportion to premium has run as -i high as 70 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Civilians become alarmed over press stories of crime, and by thousands carry concealed weapons even in states where this is prohibited, little reckoning on the incredibly swift gunwork of the professional criminal. Bodies of excitable citizens cry for vigilance committees and like organized mob-methods, while right under their noses the criminal, who knows the futility of such extra-legal methods, plies his trade. Who. for instance, would want to agree to the suspension of constitution, law and order asked for i by a writer in the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Globe,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> “in the steamship business”—“Establish vigilance com- ; mittees of business men in every locality, and I</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sub>z</sub>. Methods of Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HE methods of crime are as many as the crimes. Hold-up men impersonate detec. tives, and follow up with smashing blows, and resistance with a shot. They enter houses and secrete themselves in the most unlikely places. <sup>Z</sup>On'e victim asserted that the burglar hid in a washtub. In a courtroom robbery the men ___ entered during business hours and waited in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">washroom until they were safely locked in for <sub>r</sub> the night. Safes not yielding to frontal attacks are turned upside down and the flimsier bottom cut off. Burglars take lunches along, or get them on the spot; for a “job” may last eight or ten hours and “a working man needs lunch <sup>r</sup> in between”. A detective calls, shows his badge to get the lay of the premises, and later makes a “business” visit. Cord is not up-to-date enough, and victims are immovably bound with wire. The acetylene-gas “can-opener” cuts its fiery way through thick metal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Furniture is smashed up if the day’s—night’s —wage proves disappointing—no wage cut for the burglar! Porch-climbing is not a forgotten “ art. In the office of the German Finance Ministry at Berlin demolished walls and splintered furniture evidenced the ardent search for treasure. Too obvious victims are crammed into trunks or closets, to delay the hue and cry. “Give us aii-” may he the opening demand in a garage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Tfi&amp;'-law of violence is the canon law of the desperate criminal; demands refused or orders</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">until untied by friendly railroad men. Skylights are more fashionable entrances than doors. Dead men and women will never learn, till the end of their long sleep, how deftly their bodies were relieved of rings and jewelry. Payroll men. do not know when they may look into the business end of a gun, nor lines of workmen on pay-day when they will hand over their pay- . envelopes to men whose toil is not after the : way of the shop. - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Women cleaning a house may be paid off and sent home by what they imagine is the man of the house. Bank officials obey with alacrity the bogus Federal bank examiner whose tool for the audit is an automatic pistol. Knitted soldier-boy helmets make excellent masks. The movements of the patrolmen are known to the minute in advance of a nocturnal operation. Roadside inns are not so popular after the guests have been lined up against the office wall, hands up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Against the criminal the odds are heavily increased by the ready telephone. &quot;Citizens are requested to report promptly to Police.Headquarters or any police officer any suspicious circumstance.” Nothing is so effective a deterrent as the certainty of the immediate spreading of the news of crime over a wide area, with the prompt spreading out of a horde of officers and citizens forming a net that the utmost skill alone can escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Automobiles and Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">OUNTERING the telephone in the race for supremacy is the automobile. A considerable percentage of public chauffers is said to have criminal records; most of them are seeking to earn an honest living, but some are all too familiar with the urgent, “Now heat it as fast as you ean”, from “pals” that jump in after some desperate offensive—and then nothing can be so quickly lost as a swiftly moving taxi on a crowded street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Cars are stolen and in &quot;short order put replaced by others. In crime waves citizens are asked to record the number of every taxi they get into, hut the tags of illicit cars are often so covered with dirt as to be unreadable. In the country, and especially in suburban sections, the automobile is almost inseparably associated with the dashing exploits in which hanks and business places are separated from their cash.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">! In some Western states, it has long been the ’ .practice of automobile drivers to pass by any one signalling for help in a breakdown, so frequent have been the hold-ups worked by that I ruse. The homely, useful, slow-going truck does <sup>;</sup>its part in the wholesale* moving of the proceeds '. of big thefts. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">- The advent of everybody’s automobile gives police protection‘a new and almost unsolvable problem:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">' ■ “Criminals are not seen by police officers on the streets,” comments the editor of the Buffalo </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evening Post.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> “The man or the woman who steps into an automobile after dark vanishes until he or she leaves it. The magic carpet of eastern lore could be no more effective. Crime has-discovered what a perfect means . for approach and for getaway the automobile provides —swift, silent, unnoticed and unrecognized.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">And the New York </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">World</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> adds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Crime has been put on an automobile basis. A taxi-cab slows down to permit a pedestrian to be assaulted and rifled of his valuables, and a touring car speeds off with a murdered policeman dropping from the running board. It is a startling and sinister condition of things in a civilized community.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The same machine that flees with the offenders, carries the spoils off to the thief’s partner, the “fence”. Every article stolen is worthless until it is converted into cash. The “fence” is a seemingly honest merchant who by day keeps store and by night receives the proceeds of robbery. Some wholesale establishments with a reputation for bargain prices for retailers get much goods in this way. It is risky “business”, and a goodly profit is kept by the “fence”, who after a while cleans up his business methods and becomes a sure-enough merchant, or retires for life, to live his years in fear of betrayal by his “clients”. Very few “fences” appear in the criminal docket, each “fence” unmolested being an intimation of “protection” by some powerful politician who works not, and yet magically grows in wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Education and Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">T^HE characters “of criminals present an interesting study. Education plays no small part, but there is yet to be put in operation an •educational system that will develop mentality and chkrac^er and will strengthen weak points to an extent that will eliminate criminal tendencies. Even at school age the American criminal begins his operations. Serious crimes are to be thought of as the work of the old and hardened, but young boys are found committing heinous crimes. It is probably not the school, but a social system&quot; working by environment, that is instructor-in-chief in crime. ‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Much responsibility, however, lies at the school door. Schools, with all their transform- ' ing potentialities, train ch^fly the intellect, and leave the moral faculties to the haphazard of other agencies. Mrs. Ellen O’Grady,, deputy police commissioner of New York, revealed a . great principle, saying:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Too much science and not enough conscience. The whole basis of living, the framework of all legal and . ethical codes, is the tablet of the law of the ten commandments. This lesson must be woven into the daily curriculum of our children, if we want to stamp out this menace of child crime. The state must safeguard . its future and see that it has strong, stalwart, upright citizens, and the way to do that is to give them the spirit of the ten commandments in an agreeable way. When children are convinced that there is just as much fun in being good as there is in being bad, then they will be good.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Professor Wenbley, of the University of Michigan, confirms this: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Our educational system appears to be designed to prepare the student body for ‘hog competition’ and eighty percent of what is now taught in our schools • should be thrown out.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Governor Ferris also says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“We have spent all our time making ministers, lawyers and blacksmiths out of men, and now find it necessary to face about and make men out of blacksmiths, lawyers and ministers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Boys that steal simply follow efficiency methods in getting what they want in the shortest and quickest way to which their education points them. Crime is nourished on efficiency in business, because of its heartless, characterless principles. Education makes boys smart enough that not over one crime in seven is detected and punished. Prisons have many men that can measure up to the educational standard set by President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The five evidences of an education,” says he, “are correctness and precision in the use of the mother tongue; refined and gentle manners which are. the expression of fixed habits of thought and action; the power of the habit of reflection; the power of growth; and efficiency, or the power to do.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Men of this standard make the cleverest and crookedest criminals, because there are not included in it the requisite high principles of morality and religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Clever Bw Criminals</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">H</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ENCE boys of sixteen surprise officers of the law with their clever methods in stealing money by the thousands of dollars, and by ready wit in answering questions under examination. Boys of thirteen and under are caught in the midst of' a career of successful robbery and arson. Boys with revolvers and a liking for stories of crime and adventure—from which few boys are exempt—are already on the path to prison doors. Infant prodigies of crime— boy burglars, embezzlers.and train robbers— fill columns of newspaper space that might be devoted to useful topics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dry-os-dust education, with a fatuous disregard of boy psychology, drives boys the wrong way. With a negligible appreciation of the capacities of boyhood for good, society hustles the boy of fertile imagination and super-energy away into fields of misapplied ability, that reach finally to one of three things: reform, the penitentiary, or big business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Boys are especially apt in picking up a working knowledge of crime when in touch with experts whose adventurous efficiency they cannot hut admire. In prison the boy convicts are the hardest to reach with good influences. That many of them come back to their cells is evidenced by American prison records, and by .the statement in England by Dr. W. A. Potts, medical advisor to the Birmingham justices:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Of the people who go into prison it is probable that sixty-two percent have been convicted before ; this makes it safe to say that the present system does not prevent crime, but rather manufactures it. Although juvenile crime diminished considerably during and immediately after the war, it is now increasing at an alarming extent.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In Paris the head of a most desperate band, which had managed many magnificent coups— the Black Net Band—was Tarzan, an elevenyear old boy. In New York almost any day anywhere in the poorer districts boys of six to fifteen years may be seen “swiping” articles from hucksters’ wagons and taking them to their mothers, who accept the stolen goods—and the policeman says: “They are only kids”. In hundreds of homes boys commit offenses, are punished by their fathers—and taught further crime by mothers that blame the fathers for the. discipline—and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dullness and Crime</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">D</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ULLNESS, however, is a common characteristic of a large class of criminals. Only a fifth of prison populations have left school in the grade they should have been in for their age, and only one in fifty has left school in a grade ahead of the proper age. Three-quarters were backward a year or more, half of them two years or more, forty-two percent three years or more, down to the one percent that.left school ten years behind the proper grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Illiteracy dooms many to prison, because it has an effect like that of dullness in making the struggle for a living so hopeless that many give up and yield to the seemingly easier pathway of crime. So far from the average prison taking proper means for reforming and educating its unfortunate wards, the prisons are in charge of professional politicians, and the officials are usually given their places as rewards for political efficiency rather than for efficiency in penology. • Hence prisons do not reform men, but trajn them for a further and more successful life of crime, despite all twaddle of mushy reformers and ignorant clergymen to the contrary, [To be continued]</span></p>

<p><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">The Irish Question--</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">(Part Tu/o) </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">By Frederick J. Falldncr (Dublin)</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N A previous article, which appeared in the columns of the The Golden Age No. 39-40, the writer set forth a number of the prominent features oft the\ Irish Question. It is believed that the following additional facts will prove of interest to the many readers of this Journal in America, the British Isles, and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Recognizing The Golden Age to be a journal of fact, as well as of hope and conviction, care has been exercised in order that an accurate presentation may be made of the matters re- ' ferred to herein.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The writer desires, at the outset, to make it perfectly clear that he is in no way associated with any of the contending parties in Ireland, and that he views the Irish Question from a thoroughly impartial standpoint. The ensuing remarks will show that in that small country lesson are now being taught which, if discerned, should be of benefit to every thoughtful mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Though the year 1920 has proved to be a ’ momentous one in Irish history, there is every <sub>;</sub> evidence that the year 1921 will be yet more , <sub>r</sub> weighty. During the years 1914 to 1920 Sinn &gt;&nbsp;Fein gradually increased in power until event- ually it dominated the whole of Ireland,, with &lt;&nbsp;the exception of the north-east corner of Ulster, i where the majority of the people are loyalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">„ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words “Sinn Fein” mean “Ourselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone”. This great movement, with its well, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trained secret “army” and elaborate system of</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">espionage, was so thoroughly organized in its every department that it was thereby enabled to strike repeated and effective blows at the supremacy of British rule in Ireland. Thus the <sup>1</sup> year 1920 saw Sinn Fein at the height of its triumph. But the year 1921 witnesses the pres-<sup>1</sup> ence of another formidable combatant in the 1 arena of Irish politics. It is known in Ireland by the name “the Black-and-Tans”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">r &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Royal Irish Constabulary, a semi-mili-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>t</sub> tary body, originally consisted of 10,500 officers and men, and was recruited in Ireland. Owing <sub>f</sub> to the internal conditions of the country local enlistments in this force practically ceased. ' Consequently, as its strength had to be aug-men ted, recruiting commenced in England. Many ex-soldiers, who were then unemployed, offered their services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">As it was found impossible at the- time to supply these new police with the usual uniforms worn by the Royal Irish Constabulary, a mixed uniform was used. This, in some cases, consisted of green breeches, a khaki tunic, and a black belt. Hence as a nickname these men were called “the Black-and-Tans”. It is stated that the use of this term originated in Limerick, where there is a local hunt known as “the Black , and Tan”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Another force, separate from the Royal Irish ■ Constabulary and raised in England for service in Ireland, has received from the Irish the same ' title. It is an auxiliary police force whose members are ex-army officers, some of whom held high and distinguished rank in the British Army. They receive £1 per day pay. This body of men appears to be mainly responsible for the rapid change which has taken place in that lountry during the past few months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. Charges of a very scr:mis nature have been ■ &nbsp;&nbsp;' brought against members of these forces. Build</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ings are being methodically destroyed. Men are being shot in cold blood. Robberies, are frequent. Intimidation is rife. These have in some districts now become quite common occurrences, and in many cases are believed to be the work of servants of the British Crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., English Labor Party, when addressing a meeting at Hough Green (England) in December last, is reported to have made the following remarks concerning the conditions prevailing in Ireland:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“At the present moment it can be said, without exaggeration, that the ordinary machinery of Govern--ment in Ireland is at a standstill. Coercion has been applied with such indiscriminate violence that the people are terror-stricken. No man is safe. JJven women and children run terrible risks of’ being shot in the streets. The ordinary flow of trade is cheeked, and the economic life of the country is coming to a standstill. I have also information of robbery from the persons of men stopped by servajits of the Crown, and it may be said that looting and arson are commonplace. All this goes on day hy day and it cannot be dissociated from the Government’s settled policy, which is reactionary in conception, brutal in its application, and destructive in its consequences. I am not saying that all the outrages are on one side. I have never for one moment attempted to defend or condone the outrages committed in the name of Sinn Fein. But the outrages of that kind are one<sup>1</sup> thing; and a policy of deliberate reprisal, sanctioned, if not inspired, by a civi-lizefl Government, is quite another. The forces of the Crown, which exist only to maintain law and order, have been made the instrument of a blind and ruthless vengeance. This is not resolute government, but primitive barbarism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A labor commission, sent by the English Labor Party to Ireland, to inquire into the situation in that country, in its report published last December, makes the following observations : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The situation in Ireland today is nothing short of a tragedy, whether from the point of view of the Irish people or from the standpoint of British honor arid prestige. The Labor Party regards recourse to methods of violence as a confession of bankruptcy of statesmanship.” .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“In the Auxiliary Division [of the Royal Constabulary] the men who matter are those possessed of ability and education who are inflamed by political passion and who as far as could be seen during the visit of the commission, were being given a free hand in the south a nd the vest of L eland. Wherever reprisals have been .‘••cicntiflcnllv carried out so as to cause the maximum economic and industrial loss to an Irish countryside or city, they have almost invariably been the work of detachments of cadets.”</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19210427_files/g_E_19210427-11.png" alt="" style="width:22pt;height:600pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Several cases investigated by the commission revealed the fact that these detachments had worked independently of, and brooked no interference from, the forces of the Crown. Hitherto reprisals by Auxiliaries have been hushed up as far as possible, and efforts have been made to impute the blame for their misdeeds to innocent civilians. Evidently this force enjoys special and powerful protection.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“A large number of buildings in Ireland have been destroyed by fire, but the government has admitted only a few cases of arson committed by members of the Crown forces. Incendiarism is part of the policy of the ‘Black-and-Tans’ and Auxiliaries. It is, we - believe, one of their methods of terrorism and revenge.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“There are so many cases of looting and theft that the commission must add these crimes to those of burning and destruction.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Members of the Crown Forces have deliberately shot men in cold blood. These crimes are as revolting as the murder of British officers in their beds, and deserve equally thorough denunciation. Even if the victima-were ‘gunmen’ we do not think this in any way lessens the guilt of those who committed the murders. Terror. ism and outrage on the part of members of the forces of the Crown in Ireland are condoned, defended, and justified.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The outstanding fact regarding lots of the ‘Black- •’ and-Tans’ and Auxiliaries is that they are not under control. The Government has created a weapon Which it cannot wield. It has liberated forces which it is not at present able to dominate. The men have got out of hand, and the Government cannot truthfully deny it. The blame for the present situation does not rest primarily with the members of the Crown Forces but with the Government.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The foregoing extracts contain very serious allegations; and though this severe criticism comes from a source antagonistic to the existing British Government, their accuracy is not thereby affected. The charges appear to be well-founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is now the definite policy of the Crown _ Forces in Ireland to engage in reprisals against Sinn Fein. These have become general throughout tliiNfountry and in them the innocent have suffered with the guilty. The policy of reprisals appears to have received the unofficial approval of the British Government. In many instances the destruction of property has been very extensive. The most serious, so far, was the systematic burning of the centre of Cork city following an ambush of a detachment of Auxiliaries in the neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Government has practically denied that this was the work of servants qf the Crown, though the consensus of opinion among the Irish people is to the contrary. A military Court of Inquiry was appointed to investigate the matter, but at the time of writing its </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">report </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">has not been published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The following official list of buildings then destroyed and damaged in the City of </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Cor£ </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">will give some idea of the extensiveness of the work of the destruction:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Destroyed by fire:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">52 business houses &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Damaged by fire:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">18 business houses</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">2 private houses 1 other building A number of other towns and villages have suffered in a similar manner, and many unarmed civilians have been shot dead. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The following notices, which appeared in the Cork papers, in December, 1920, are reproduced, as giving a further insight into the conditions in Ireland:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“If G. Horgan is not returned by 4 o’clock on Friday, 10th December, rebels of Cork beware, aa one man and one shop shall disappear for each hour after the given time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Signed), B. AND T.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;IMPORTANT NOTICE</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“We, the undersigned, do now give the male sex of Cork City notice, which must be adhered to forthwith, that any person of the said sex who is seen or found loitering at street corners, or on the pathway, without reasonable excuse why he should be there; or any man or boy found standing or walking with one or both. hands in his pocket, will, if he does not adhere to this order, suffer the consequences which, no doubt, will ensue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Signed), SECRETARY,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Death or Victory League “God Save the King, and Frustrate his Enemies.” </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The southwest of Ireland has been, and still is, the most disturbed area in the country. In December, 1920, the counties of Cork, Tipperary, Kerry and Limerick, were placed under martial law. Subsequently several neighboring counties were included. In the City of Dublin people are prohibited from loitering in the streets, and all persons are required to remain -indoors between the hours of 10 o’clock p. m. and 5 o’clock a. m. The extension of martial law to the City of Dublin is probable if its</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">present disturbed state should long continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Within this area the militant section of the Sinn Fein movement, which is called the “Irish Republican Army”, has been most active. An official return of serious outrages attributed to </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Sinn</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Fein in Ireland, for the period January 1 to December 31, 1920, comprises the following:</span></p>

<p><a href="#bookmark28"><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Attacks on police barracks</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Nb statistics are at present available as to the number of civilians who have been killed and. wounded, and the total amount of valuable property which has been destroyed. It is known that the figures are high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">One method which the “Irish Republican Army” has adopted in its guerilla warfare upon the British Forces in Ireland is that of carefully prepared ambushes. These are a daily occurrence throughout the country. So frequent and so effective have they become that military and police motor transports and patrols now carry hostages with a view to protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The many assassinations which have taken place, and for which Sinn Fein is responsible, are stated to have been merely the carrying into effect of the sentences of death imposed by the courts martial of the “Irish Republican Army”. It is argued that the execution of enemies of the “Irish Republic&quot; are legal acts of war. Confiscations and levies of money have been made in different localities for the support of this anqy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Internment camps have been formed i n Ireland, in which active supporters of the Republican movement are being interned by the British military authorities. Considerable numbers of 'men- have been already apprehended and cwifined in this fashion. House to house searches for arms and ammunitions have taken pl ’eo in certain districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">.Extreme Sinn Fein has not been satisfied with aggressive warfare in Ireland alone. There is evidence that a plot was formulated for the wholesale destruction of warehouses and public buildings in England. On November 27, 1920, a number of incendiary fires, believed to have been the work of Sinn Fein, broke out among the Liverpool and Bootle warehouses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage was done. Had the plans been more efficiently carried out immense loss would have-resulted. Owing in part to the vigilance of the police the plans were not so successful as was expected. An abortive effort was also made recently to destroy a number of London warehouses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Roman Catholic Church possesses great power over the minds of the Irish people. Though in recent years, owing to the increase of educational facilities, and the consequent enlightenment of the minds of the people, that influence has waned, yet the Roman Catholic Church still occupies an important position in • their affairs. The younger clergy in the priesthood are Sinn Fein in sentiment. Several priests are prominently identified with the movement. A number of them have been shot dead or imprisoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The following notice, addressed to a Roman Catholic clergyman, in Tralee, will prove of interest:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Anti-Sinn Fein Quarters. We are hereby informed you are a member of that murderous gang called Sinn Fein. We do inform you you are on our list for execution, so prepare to meet your God. You give no time for preparation </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(sic),</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> but we do; so you may repent of the seed of wickedness you have sown throughout Ireland, and you priests are responsible for every murder in God’s sight. So God help you.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Such occurrences as these have tended only to stir up the religious passions of the people. They have not relieved the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Roman Catholic Church, as a unit, cannot be said to have taken a very decided stand on one side or the other during the last few . momentous years. Caution seems to have been the predominating motive. Dr. Cohalan, Roman Catholic Bishop of Cork, some time ago pronounced the ban of excommunication upon all those who in his diocese commit murder by taking part in ambushes. In explanation of his action he is reported as having said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“I did this because murder is against the teaching of the Chiireh and. moreover, its commission has entailed suffering and hardship on innocent persons. Since I made this pronouncement there has been only</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">P &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*■ , - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.. . :..</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">1 ?. one ambush in my diocese and those who took part in • it are assuredly excommunicated.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. . The Roman Catholic Church as a whole has ' not issued a similar decree. Had that Church exercised its power in instructing the people concerning the things “pertaining to the king; dom of God” and its foundation principles of <sup>?</sup> righteousness,, justice and love, the conditions ' in that troubled country would be different - today. It is a regrettable fact, which cannot be gainsaid, that the churches in Ireland, both • Protestant and Roman Catholic, have not done their duty. Instead of devoting their attention to the education of the people in the principles „ of true Christianity, as they are revealed in God’s Word, they have dabbled in politics and - thus have been instrumental in fanning racial and religious hatred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This can be said of all the great ecclesiastical systems throughout the world. They have outlived their usefulness. They have now become a hindrance to man rather than a help. Accordingly, Jehovah has decreed, in fulfillment of His prophetic Word, that all the organiza-. lions of men, small and great, religious and . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' secular, must be destroyed in this dawn of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Golden Age, preparatory to the inauguration, in their stead, of God’s great organization which the Apostle Peter has termed “the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The object of that kingdom, in which the gospel church shall be associated with Christ in the majesty and glory and power of the divine nature, shall be the restoration of man- _ kind to “that which was lost” by the human family through the willful transgression of father Adam in the garden of Eden; viz., ever. lasting human life on a perfect earth. See Daniel 2:44; 7:13, 14, 18, 27; Revelation 11: 15-19; 18: 21; Acts 3:19-21; Galatians 3:8, 16, 29; .etc., etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Father Flanagan, of Roscommon, was acting ' head of Sinn Fein during the absence of Mr. - De Valera, President of the Irish Republic, in America. In that capacity he recently entered into negotiations with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George, with a view to obtaining i- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peace in freland. They ended abortively. It is</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expected that a further peace parley will soon</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">take place lw»tween representatives of Sinn Fein and the British Cabinet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Government of Ireland Bill or Home . Rule Act, which has now received the Royal assent, has not been accepted by Sinn Fein; for Sinn Feiners uncompromisingly demand an Irish Republic. The Bill provides for, two Irish , <sub>t </sub>Parliaments, one for Northern Ireland, en&gt;-bracing the six counties — Antrim, Armagh, Down, Londonderry, Fermanagh and Tyrone ' . —the other for Southern Ireland, embracing the remaining twenty-six counties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Parliament of Northern Ireland will consist of a House of Commons of fifty-two - members, and a Senate comprising the Lord . Mayors o f . Belfast and Londonderry, and twenty-four Senators elected by the House of Commons of Northern Ireland by proportional representation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ -</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Parliament of Southern Ireland will consist of a House of Commons of one hundred twenty-eight members, and a Senate comprising the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, the Lord Mayors of Dublin and Cork, seventeen Senators representative of commerce, labor, and the pro- . fessions, nominated by the Lord Lieutenant, and forty-four elected Senators, including four Archbishops or Bishops of the Roman Catholic ' Church, two of the Chureh of Ireland, sixteen Peers, eight Privy Councillors, and fourteen . representatives of County Councils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Ireland will return forty members to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The Council of Ireland will consist of twenty . representatives from each Parliamentary area, of whom thirteen shall be members of the House of Commons and seven members of the Senate of that Parliamentary area. The President will be appointed by the King. The main duty of this Council ■will be to look after the railways and the fisheries, and to administer in common services which might by agreement between the two Parliaments be delegated to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">By identical Acts of the two Parliaments a united Parliament (of two chambers) may be set up for the whole of Ireland. , .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">If half of the members of either Parliament fail to take the oath, or are not validly returned, the Parliament will not be regarded as properly constituted, and the Government of the area will subsequently be administered on Crown Colony lines. Such a contingency having arisen, the Imperial Parliament may renew attempts to get a Parliament set up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">But this Home Rule Act will never bring peace to Ireland. The state of that poor country is getting worse day by day, and the possi-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">; bility of settlement is becoming more remote.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The British Empire, like all others of its kind, will soon be dismembered; for it is a part of the “kingdoms of this world” of which Paul <sub>m ; : </sub>asserts, Satan is the “god”. The British constitution is in many ways the most commendable of all the constitutions of fallen men, but ' M nevertheless it falls far short of that which | shall belong to the kingdom of God—the “desire of all nations”.—Haggai 2:7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;j</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is to be rejoiced .at that the time is so near &gt;&nbsp;' when misgovernment will have ceased forever ; among men, when every man shall love his* L neighbor as himself, when wars shall be no &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>Art in the Home</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">RTISTS claim that within the past few years there has been a step backward in the general internal appearance of American homes, and they blame it on the war. For several years after the Civil War there was little art among the masses of the people in 'America. Utilities that could be made cheaply and quickly by machinery were the things desired; and to the extent that straight lines ; were interfered with, in many of these products, the results were even worse than where ' the shortest path was chosen and no pretense of art existed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Chairs and sofas were made of horsehair; for there was plenty of horsehair, and the fabric was durable. Just how to explain the existence of some of the furniture and ornaments <sub>;</sub>^f a generation ago is a puzzle; but by 1914 the' average home was putting some of these things into the attic, and replacing them with more presentable furnishings. Then the war brought a check.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who know how to do sueh things have charted theirise and fall of art in the American home. They claim that it began to rise about the time of the World’s Fair, in 1893, and no doubt largely because of that fair; and that .when the great flood of people with artistic temperaments came in from the Southern&gt;&gt; European countries shortly afterward, designs straightway improved, and that the years from 1900 to 1915 marked a rapid, advance in providing the homes with really beautiful things. The cause of the step backward that was taken during the World War is that during that period manufacturers had a larger market than they could supply and found no necessity for keeping up their designs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Better Outlook for Art</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">OW that business has had a slowing down it is expected that there will straightway be an improvement in designs; for it is an accepted principle now that, other things being equal, the goods, wares and merchandise that are artistically designed outsell those which are not so designed. And there are few things in everyday life that cannot be at least a little improved by giving them more artistic shape and coloring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Moreover, the satisfied buyer of today is the dissatisfied buyer, the critical buyer, of tomorrow. The more a person buys, the better qualified is such an one to buy discriminatingly. The more designs one sees, the more certain it is that the least attrac ve ones will never find a market with that buyer again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">There is an “eternal fitness of things” that is becoming more and more recognized. One of the large manufacturers of fine silverware now employs an architect whose business it is to design the silver for a dining room to suit the furniture and fittings of the room, on the principle that French silver in a Colonial room is not </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> happy combination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Most European countries have for a long time recognized that in order to compete for the trade of nations which have a choice as to goods should look, those countries that produce the best-appearing goods will, in the end, gain and hold the trade. This was one of lie secrets of Germanys success in placing goods in all corners of the earth. It was the Teuton custom to establish art schools all over the empire, even in the little villages, thus bringing to light here, there and everywhere, boys and girls that could be made into real artists, later, in the advanced schools of the larger cities. The thought back of this was the obtaining of larger German markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The old idea that art was to be used merely in decorating the sepulchral homes of the elderly rich with pictures that nobody ever sees, or in embellishing with statuary grounds that are shut out from the public gaze, is giving place to the wider view that art should have its place in all human affairs. There is a best way to do everything, a best way to design coal scuttles, ash cans, back yards, and everything else about the home; and that way is art. It is possible to make cotton prints as beautiful and artistic as high-priced silks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">During the war, in spite of the fact that the manufacturers in all lines could sell more goods than they could produce, there was one line in which American designs constantly improved; namely, fabrics and costumes. These are now at so high..a plane that in many lines they have superseded French designs; and New York shopkeepers who handle the costumes are saying that these were created and designed in Paris, although the costumes were made here from fabrics also designed and made here. There are more designers of all kinds in New York than in the rest of the United States; and as long as the United States maintains a large share of the world’s trade it will be true that New York will supply the designs for the world in many branches of industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">European Interest in Art</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE was a time when European artists were chiefly occupied in painting pictures to be hung in churches and castles; and the subjects of the pictures were naturally such as would be likely to interest those who were managing such enterprises — pictures of the fires of purgatory and of those who had made their escape therefrom; pictures of lords, ladies, war horses and armor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The first artist to break away from these lines was Rembrandt, who saw something of interest in his father’s old Dutch windmill, sitting high upon a bluff overlooking a stream. There came a time when the little picture of this windmill, which Rembrandt painted, was sold to a Philadelphia millionaire for half a million dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Europeans generally have the view, which is gradually obtaining recognition in America, that all the children of the land, rich and poor, should have abundant and free access, to the best art and the best music available. Youth is the time for art and for music, and.the mind that is occupied with these things is freed to a large extent from evil influences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The principle is gaining recognition that it is better for a city to have a large number of small, conveniently-reached art museums, than to have one large one inconveniently located. Recognizing the place that art should occupy in the lives of all the people, Soviet Russia has displayed along the public streets the paintings and sculptures taken from the palaces of the rich, so that all might have an opportunity to see them. Surely if the treasures of ttyse palaces were to be rifled it were better that all should have access to them than that they should fall into the hands of others who would withhold them from all eyes but their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Paris, the Center of Art</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">APOLEON recognized the value of art to a city. No doubt he reflected upon the influence that St. Mark’s cathedral has had upon the revenues of Venice, that the Parthenon has had upon the revenues of Athens, and that the pyramids have had upon Egypt. In any event, as his armies swept over the land, his art collectors followed or accompanied them; and many of the most highly prized works of art in Europe</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>fc ■ .</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:line-through;">* ? ... .. ............ <sub>dl</sub>,,,, <sub>r</sub>. - , , —......... ■ ■ ... .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">were brought to Paris, which from that time has held the position of art centre of the world —at least from the museum standpoint of art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The French still recognize this principle of the value of works of art; and in April, 1920, noticing the large number of paintings that ■were passing into </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">erican hands, the French Chamber of Deputies passed a bill prohibiting the export of all ancient works of art—some of them now known to be spurious—regarding their possession as an important part of the nation’s existence. Spain is also agitated by . the loss of old paintings, purchased by the residents of other countries, and is also urging a law prohibiting works of art from leaving that country. In Italy all works of art more than fifty years old must be priced and offered for. sale to the Italian Government before being offered for sale to others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Just as Napoleon cleaned Europe of its art treasures in the early part of the nineteenth century, so some financial Napoleons have recently proposed that the present difficult exchange problem between Europe and America be solved by a transfer of a portion of the European treasures to America in exchange for American dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is pointed out that Europe needs raw materials and manufactured products, and that she has one thing which at the present time she can exchange for them, namely, a portion of her great supply of priceless old masters, rugs, tapestries, silver and gold plate, porcelains, enamels, books, marbles, objects of art, fine furniture and jewels of intrinsic value and -historic interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Europe does not like to part with these things,, but it isfpointed out that she had better do this than have them, at length, disposed of as in Russia. If considerable quantities of them were sent here bn consignment and sold at auction to otix^great new crop of profiteers, they could be paid'for in American funds and the exchange situation would be materially relieved. A relatively small shipment would accomplish a considerable result: for it is remembered, a mere haiWfu^ of pictures owned by the late H. C. Frii^r was worth sums estimated at twenty to fifty million dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Paris has a new genius, a great sculptor, Darde, formerly a shepherd boy, who carves his statues out'of granite with a pickaxe, using no models. Before beginning work on the granite he makes a portrait, in oil, of what the statue will be when finished. The features of these statues are those of men and women in public life in Paris which, once- seen by him, linger definitely in his memory. The French Government, despite all the other problems it has on hand, has found money to purchase \ • Darde’s works, and time and moans to provide him with a free studio, one which it always has ready for the aid of some artist of great merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scenic Art in America &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N THE Spring, the ride out of New York city toward the east, over the lines of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railway, is • like a ride through a rose garden. The sides of &nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the railway cuts have been planted with a &nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">species of rose bushes which not only holds the earth in place but transforms the whole area into a paradise of fragrant and beautiful flowers. The total expense of this cannot have ' been great, certainly not when the effect upon -the travelers is considered. There are many persons who would gladly go a long distance out of their way ■ to see such a sight as this, -which with reasonable effort could be duplicated almost anywhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Look at the structures of the elevated rail- .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ways in New York. Could they be more ugly in appearance! If one wanted to add to their hideousness, how would he go about it! Corr-pare these unsightly necessities with the exquisitely beautiful viaducts which grace the Lackawanna Railroad from end to end. Compare the stations, also; in the one case they are “frights”, and in the other they are attractive, picturesque, beautiful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not necessary that public structures ■ should look hideous. The old Brooklyn Bridge is a beautiful structure, much more so than <sup>w </sup>other .more recent bridges between New York and Brooklyn; for it has better. proportions and more graceful lines. The bridge is inherently beautiful, containing no attempts whatever at ornamentation. Look at the Woolworth Building in New York, the tallest and the most beautiful business structure in the world. Lower New York has many beautiful buildings, but what a wonderful place it would be if all<sup>1</sup> ’ ‘ the buildings in that section were in the same ' class as the Woolworth Building! Before the War the Germans had made a start in the same direction. Many of their modern factories look</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">i </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">like</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> magnificent public buildings. Is it not !■! better to have them built thus than to appear like some' of the repellant-looking factories that !&gt; were built here a generation ago!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">\ </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">An</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">d if the buildings are to be made more J pleasing to the eye, what about the spaces be* tween the buildings! Is it fair to the people - for a state to expend millions of dollars in the ■ construction of highways, to attract and hold . tourist and domestic travel, and then have the ■ _ scenery spoiled by the location of glaring, unsightly billboards, just where they would be</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;most Objectionable!</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">, The State of Massachusetts is now considering what steps can be taken to get billboards from off private lands. It is probable that the constitution will have to be so modified as to bring all the signs in the State under State control. England has a law which forbids the , erection of signboards that would obstruct the' view, and they must not be close to the highway. The ride from Philadelphia to New York, along either of the principal rail lines, is a nightmare because of the signs that glare at one from fields .and barns along the route.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. It is possible to make billboards in such a way that they will not be objectionable. At the approaches to some of the finest pieces of scenery in the United States are cleverly worded signs, prepared by one of the great automobile । tire companies, so designed as to represent a ' great history of the United States. On the two , pages open before the reader as he speeds along ; the highway, are set forth the most important L facts respecting the adjacent scenery, coupled, of course, with the information that certain , tires are the best of their kind. This is at least a useful phase of art in advertising.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something of this kind must have come to</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the notice of Prince Albert of England, who has proposed ..that similar signs be placed near all the spots df. scenic and historic interest in England, so that automobilists as they pass L. may have some knowledge of them. One is al* most led to wonder if the Prince has secured - the British agency |or these .American tires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New York's Art Center</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">EW YORK is to have an Art Center, a building wherein all the one hundred or more art association of the city will be represented. The building will have an auditorium, with spaces for permanent exhibits, display rooms and sales rooms, the object being to promote art in every branch of industry, from the manufacturing of the most insignificant to the greatest article in daily use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is of great importance that artists of all kinds be brought into close contact with one another, and with one another’s works, as well as the works of the artists of long ago. It often happens that the modern designer of tapestries, rugs, dress fabrics, wall paper or other modern necessity finds the germ of his idea in some old picture frame, pottery, lace, bottle, vestment or snuff-box. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is hoped that the starting of this art center in New York will lead to the organization of similar centers in all the principal manufacturing districts of the country. It is believed that such centers, if properly managed, cannot fail to facilitate the development of the crafts, the graphic arts and the industrial arts. New York is a good place to start the first one; for it has a larger number of craftsmen than any other American city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Art treasures are easily destroyed. At times there have been disastrous losses by fire among European art treasures; and in January, 1920, there was such a fire in New York. Several hundred rare pieces, amounting in value to about one million dollars, were burned in the Vanderbilt art galleries when an exhibition was l&gt;eing arranged. Eleven hundred art students . were in the building at the time the fire started, but were marched out in an orderly manner just before the walls fell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We may be sure that the God that ordered the gorgeous panoply of the heavens, that lights up the western heavens with His million-hued sunsets, that breathes life into the pansy, the butterfly, the rose and the human face, has in ultimate view a world which shall be filled with beauty everywhere. It will be man’s high privilege during the Golden Age, and forever afterward, to work with God, and with the things which God has made, to fulfill the divine promise made respecting our earth, “I will make the place of my feet glorious”. The earth is God’s footstool, the place of His feet; and it will lie His pleasure, and man’s, to make it a place of beauty and of joy forever when that which is perfect shall have come. ■</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">T IS consoling to read the pleasant columns of European Loan Stock Lists; for they are all at a discount. They stand for hundreds of thousands of millions in American money. Individual totals are not appreciated by the <sub>(</sub> average citizen. The grand total is probably not appreciated by mathematicians, as is evidenced by their composure when speaking of it in public. War makers who are in the cabinets have the best understanding of war debts of the latest pattern; for they know how difficult, if not impossible, would be the flotation, of a new twentieth century war debt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. Supposing the investor willing to fight, and therefore willing to subscribe, he could not find .the money. This cabinets know. Our Government has been urging the creation of vast local indebtedness for the building of workmen’s houses'at $4,000 or $5,000 each, at 6 percent; but it has had no adequate response. As the security is unquestionable, a want either of enthusiasm or of money is thus revealed. Similar treatment has been the experience of first-rate industrial companies that have tried for new capital at 5 percent. Such is the supply of money at present, which cannot escape the knowledge of those who have to declare war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The necessity of inviting subscriptions to a Government War Loan at 10 percent, at the start, would be a new experience, and would reveal to enemy powers the financial situation elsewhere, which could not be kept secret, like a temporary loan of twenty millions from a financial group. When another European war is considered, with it too will have to ba considered some hundreds of millions of citizens, the subjects of public appeal, to find all the money that patriotism may require. If the required quantity of patriotism be on supply, the required money will not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Let those who think another great war could be waged, reply satisfactorily to the providing of thousands of millions in money while the current loan stocks show prices (when redemptions are considered) yielding returns of 6 to 10 percent. If people talk with confidence of another great European war, test their knowledge of prices of European loans. If they show a rudimentary acquaintance, you will know that they have never considered a problem an answer to which would earn the hearty thanks of European statesmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Tour men on the Stock Exchange would understand the difficulty of starting another war. None of the countries thus encumbered has yet published any scheme for the systematic wearing down of its indebtedness. At best a year’s revenue saving will make only a small impression on the huge capital sum, perhaps to be lost the following year by the carrying of some work-providing scheme not &quot;economic” i n character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Let, then, the friends of peace acquaint themselves with the financial situation in Europe as at present harshly but faithfully reported in the daily stock lists.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the dangers to our feathered One evening in early autumn in was returning from work, my attracted to a little bird which hung suspended from some eockleburs. When first I saw it, a tremor ran through its little body. Evidently it had heard my approach and was endeavoring to cease its struggles so as to escape observation. Stepping up closer, I saw that it was caught by the “stickers” in the downy part under one wing; and it was held so fast that I had to pull quite hard to get it loose. ‘ This I did very gently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This is the second time I have observed such an accident. Some years ago, while strolling through a woodland west of Chicago, I saw a bird sitting on a cocklebur. I was surprised that it did not fly, as I was quite close to it. On &gt;&nbsp;closer approach I saw that it was dead. As I .,■' picked it up,.I realized what had happened to it. In alighting on this weed it had become fastened to the “stickers” by the down underneath its body; and not being strong enough to free itself, it had sat there and starved to death. Thus at times do the wild things of the woods and the fields meet their end.</span></p>

Editor: Please allow one who is not now a practising physician to point out a manifest absurdity in the article in your issue of April 14,. 1920, page 471. No one who knows the anatomy of the spinal column would seriously contend that a vertebra, unless suddenly and violently displaced, could be “adjusted into its natural position by a sudden and skillful movement of the hands”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">--Surgery (otherwise chirurgery) also works by hand, but it bases its practice on sound anatomical knowledge. I fear chiropractic is not so particular.</span></p>

Editor; Enclosed please find my check for renewal of my subscription to your valuable paper, which is chuck full of valuable matter. The editorials have a punch to them that a live man cannot fail to appreciate and admire. . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. A. G. Eckols, of this city, and the writer have been arrested, tried and convicted by the medics for having practised Chiropractic without obtaining a license from the State Medical Board. The latter will not give a license to . Chiropractors, as they will not recognite any school or college of Chiropractic whatever. In other words, the medical men of this state are endeavoring to kill our science in California and to drive us out of the state. They'are digging their own grave, however, and digging it deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In November last we tried to have an amendment passed allowing us a State Board of Chiropractors to examine Chiropractors so that those who proved themselves proficient, of good moral character, and possessed of a diploma from a^high class school of Chiropractic, could practise in the state without prosecution and persecution by the medics. We received 390,000 Votes, but lost by only about 12.000, having received the greatest number of votes ever cast in the United States for a measure of this kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Sentence'will be pronounced upon Dr. Eckols and myself on the 16th: and we are going to jail rather than pay a fine. 75 percent of which, if paid, goes back into the Medical Board’s hands. The judge and the prosecuting attorney practically admitted that this medical law is unjust. Some of the jurors also believed it to be unjust; but we are to be cast into prison for doing good, because we are getting too much business away from the medical doctors.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">HAT are you paying for apples? What did</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">the orchardist get ? He got about $2.00 to $2.40 per barrel of 11 peeks. Was this price clear gain 1 The barrel cost $1.45. The picking _ and hauling and up-keep of orchard came out of the 95 cents balance. Such a condition prevailed last fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">No particular effort was made to market what apples were produced, as there was no profit in them. My brother met a traveling man in the early fall months who explained that he was renting cold storage houses for apples but that no apples would be put into them. This was to shut out other companies and shut off territory from putting apples on the market. Once there were extensive orchards in this county but the net price realized caused the owners to cut down their trees.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Age fully measures up to my conception of a clean secular magazine—rich-toned, even handed, without fear of man, enlightening, encouraging, and fully committed to the cause of. truth and of “justice for the people”—the only one which I consider worthy of such a word of appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">You have given us so many articles of great value: “The League of Nations Imbroglio”; “Justice and the Poor”; “America’s Lost Liberties”; “The Bottom of Mexico’s Troubles”; (and we trust, ere long, to have the Bottom of Ireland’s Troubles) and the issues of Sept. 29 and Oct. 13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">These last two remind me of the two she-bears which came out of the woods and tare 42 children of those who persecuted the prophet Elisha — 42 months’ history of ecclesiastical wickedness perpetrated against the true Christ. For 12 months I have been expecting these issues; and I am sure that neither the beast nor his image, nor the mother harlot nor her daughters can long withstand such a siege.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mb. Editor : After reading the nasty sarcasm by which you have judged the ministers, clergy, etc., saying that it was their duty to preach and attend to God’s Word and not try to reform, of late you have mixed yourself up with every matter. Not that it has anything to do with me, and I would not mention this if you had not judged others for doing it. Are you departing from the good old ways of the Gospel and trying to win the people with other things 1 I just briefly mention your remarks in The Golden Age of December 8, 1920, on </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&quot;Petty Frauds and Their Detection&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">You have got to know more and teach more sound judgment yet. For God’s sake don’t lose your balance and think too much of yourselves. Remember our Heavenly Father is kind to all, and He has given more than just a few brains and thinking power and let us remember and keep in mind the Apostle James' words: “If any man lack wisdom let him ask of God”. Let us be definite on this one point. I have no wish for any one to ask wisdom of me, neither do I want wisdom from any man, but from God, only; let us keep Him to the front. Now in that article it tells the readers to refuse to accept paper and parchment with oheese. Are you justified in teaching this? and I should like you to answer me by letter. I am striving to get an honest living before God and my fellow men; and I happen to be one that sells cheese, etc. I have three families which trade with me, and two of them take The Golden Age and may read the article I have mentioned. Nothing up to now has been said on the subject. But I wondered what they thought of it, because under the circumstances I weigh paper with cheese, etc. And I am not afraid to say, and do it in the sight of my Heavenly Father, who is my judge. At the present^ time, I have paper in my shop which cost me ’3s. 6 d. a lb. Can I afford to give this away! No! And I don’t agree with the statement made in your pap&gt; r. If you want to teach the people you must go deeper than you have gone yet, and let us^iave justice for all. Then I can agree. I say, Teach the people to bring plates, etc.^ to have their goods put on in full weight, if they don’t want to buy paper. Once more I say in the sight and hearing of God, I can't afford to buy paper and give it away, but all who choose shall have full weight of everything if they will ' bring some article to put the goods in. I trust you will mention this in your paper. I don’t sen that you need mention names, although I am not afraid of same.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">N QUEENSLAND, the State operates J ranches, butcher shops, saw mills, coal mines, iron and steel works, canneries, hotels, fisheries, produce markets, insurance, sugar </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mills</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> and restaurants, and out of these various enterprises, up to January 1, 1920, had accumulated profits of $1,400,000. The price of meat at these State-owned butcher shops is half that in other ’ Australian states where the butcher shops are privately owned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In New South Wales any tenant who thinks his rent is too high can, at a cost of 24 cents, have an expert board review the case. Out of ’ 1,598 cases brought into this rent court, 8&amp;2 resulted in rent reductions averaging $2 per week, while 312 cases resulted in increases of rents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In December, 1919, wages of women in and about Sydney were fixed at a minimum of $7.41 per week (exchange figured at $3.80). On December 13, 1918, carpenters were paid $15.20 for a 44-hour week, bricklayers $15.96, locomotive engineers $18.24, firemen $13.30, municipal laborers $12.16. Penalties are provided for unauthorized strikes, but there are frequent strikes in mining and shipping. Violence in strikes is rare, probably because virtually all the citizens are of British stock. There is a predominance of unskilled over skilled workers, yet almost all classes and conditions of workers are unionized, even to the newspapermen and actors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In Newfoundland the government is in. the hands of the labor people. The Minister of Marines and Fisheries is the head of the Fishermen’s Union.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ica has been vaccinated some time in his or her custom, or from belief in its efficacy, or from fear of legal penalties, and often under protest. What is supposed to happen inside of the body when the vaccine is introduced by a doctor is little comprehended by many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">What a Vaccine Is</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> vaccine may be defined as an emulsion of dead germs standardized to a given strength suitable for therapeutic or prophylactic injection. A vaccine can be prepared from any given germ .which can be grown artificially in pure culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">So far no vaccine has been prepared against measles, for the simple reason that the germ of measles has not yet been discovered or cultivated in artificial media. The causative organisms, however, of many diseases have been isolated and grown artificially; and in consequence there are now in existence a very large number of different vaccines, made up of such germs' as cause typhoid fever, pneumonia, colds, influenza, meningitis, tuberculosis, boils, acne, gonorrhoea, puerperal fever, rheumatism, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Many vaccines contain a single species of germ only; thus a tuberculosis vaccine, or tuberculin, contains only the tubercle bacillus or a product of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is now known that there exist many species of the same germ; thus there are four varieties of pneumococci and a good pneumococcal vaccine should therefore contain the dead bodies of fdl the four types. Such a vaccine, consisting </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> Beyaral strains or varieties, is called &quot;polyvalent&quot;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Again, many diseases such as coryza (cold-in-the-head) and bronchitis, are due </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> an infection with more than one germ. In such conditions it is usual Ho find the pneumococcus, the streptococcus, the micrococcus catarrhalis, bacillus Friedlander, bacillus septus, etc. For such complaints a simple vaccine of one germ alone is not sufficient, and hence it has been found necessary to prepare “mixed” or &quot;compound vac-</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>cines” for such mixed </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">infectious conditions dl</span></h5>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Finally, a special vaccine may </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">be prepared ’ 0</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">fecting a given individual. Such a vaccine </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">mad*</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">genous vaccine”. An autogenous vaccine mad* K from a case of coryza or bronchitis is likely to H contain several species of germs, and would y therefore be a compound autogenous vaccineu W</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Do Vaccines Tend to Prevent Diseases?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">This question can usually be answered by ft* doctor, but to the patient it usually seems extraordinary that dead coryza ' organisms; for example, should be injected under his skin in order to cure his coryza or bronchitis. In reality the explanation is very simple and may be summed up as follows. When germs are introduced into the system, the living tissues have the power or faculty of manufacturing colloid substances which dissolve and destroy the bao-. teria injected. These anti-substances, as they, are called, are manufactured in excess and are ■ carried by the circulating blood to all parts of the system. When produced in sufficient amount, these anti-bodies destroy the live germs which are attacking the patient.. To put it more' technically, vaccines cause unsusceptibility to disease and help to cure disease by stimulating the production of specific anti-substances in the living body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Specific Anti-Substances</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Jenner, in 1789, was the first to inoculate a living virus—viz., cow-pox—into human beings, in order to stimulate the production of immunity to smallpox. Almost 100 years later, in 1877 (about when our Lord came into Christendom as the King of Glory, although invisible to the natural sight), Louis Pasteur found that by injecting cattle with an attenuated anthrax vaccine, he was able to protect them againsf anthrax. He obtained also successful immunity against chicken cholera, hydrophobia, etc., by inoculation with the living virus. The living vaccine had in all cases to be partially weakened by heat, etc., to render it innocuous or non-lethal. In other words, the germs in the vaccine were, so to speak, half-killed.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">•s</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Later, in 1889, Roux and Yersin, who were pupils of Pasteur, obtained a highly toxic extract from diphtheria bacilli. It was found that this toxic extract (freed from the bacilli by filtration through porcelain) was capable of conferring immunity when injected into animals. Thus rabbits which were inoculated with the diphtheria toxin, became insusceptible to diphtheria. The blood of the inoculated rabbits was found to contain the exact antidote to the diphtheria germ and its poison. This antidote was called diphtheria anti-toxin, a substance produced by nature itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>r</sup> In. 1890, Robert Koch introduced Tuberculin as an inoculation against tuberculosis. This Vaccine did not contain the tubercle bacilli, but consisted only of a filtered glycerine extract of the genus, and contained soluble toxic substances. The original tuberculins, consisting of toxic extracts of th&lt;e bacillus, were failures, and were dangerous on account of their toxicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The success of the diphtheria toxin, as an immunizing agent, and its success in calling forth the production of specific anti-toxin in the serum of the injected animal, led to the belief that the toxin was essential in the production of immunity, and this is why the toxic extracts of the tubercle bacillus and other germs were persistently used as vaccines for so long a time in spite of the unsatisfactory results obtained by them. We now know, however, that out of the large series of different germs used as vaccines, in only two—viz., diphtheria and tetanus—can it be said that successful immunity is attained by injection of the toxic extracts freed from the bacilli I y filtration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Exo-Toxins and Endo-Toxins .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The majority of bacteriologists now believe that there are two kinds of germ toxins, which they pall exo-toxins and endo-toxins. The ma-' jority of-germs contain endo toxins only, which reside within the snbstance of the bacteria. The exo-toxins, on the other hand, are excreted by the germ, and are apparently rare, since the only true infinite exo-toxins known are those of diphtheria and^tetannus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The true'Wo-toxins are highly complex protein poisons capable of producing the formation of anti-substances when injected. On the other hand, the endo-toxins are apparently very much more simple compounds of the nature of aminoacids, and they seem to be more or less incapable of stimulating the formation of specific anti-bodies when injected into the living animals. With the majority of bacteria, therefore, it would appear that the endo-toxic substances have little value in the stimulation of </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">immunit</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">y. In 1894 Pfeiffer discovered that when cholera germs were injected into an animal, anti-substances of a lytic or solvent power were formed in the serum, so that the blood of the injected animal became capable of dissolving the cholera bacilli. Later, Bordet and Gengou found that when the red blood corpuscles of one animal were injected into an animal of another species, the serum of the inoculated animal developed the power of dissolving the foreign red cells-that had been injected. Since then it has been proved by thousands of experiments that the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">living tissues possess the inherent potver</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> of manufacturing </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">specific</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> anti-substances against germs, when attacked or irritated by them. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Your readers will not fail to notice that it is only since our Lord’s Return in 1874 A. D., that the above wonderful discoveries in medicine were made. Notice also how the light on the subject has been progressive. This is the reason why the Bible can now be understood as never before. Just as these germs are now being recognized as potent factors in the .life of man, ■ so the Bible when rightly understood is found to be “the power of God unto salvation”. (Romans 1:16) Christ said: “The words that ■I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">life&quot;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">.—John 6: 63.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Indeed, when any foreign protein, whether animal, bacterial, or vegetable in origin, is injected into a living animal, it calls forth in the latter the production of a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">specific</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> anti-substance towards the foreign protein injected. It will be noted that the word </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“specific&quot;</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> is used, because it has been found that the peculiar power possessed by living animals is so very highly specialized (man was created by God ‘‘very good”, i. e., perfect.—Genesis 1:31) that the protective anti-substance produced acts only against the particular infecting germ or against the particular species of foreign protein injected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">An “antigen” is the term applied to a substance which, when injected into the living tissues, stimulates the production of an antibody towards itself. Each species of germ, whether alive-or dead (vaccine) ia therefore a “specific antigen”, which calls forth a specific protecting anti-substance when injected.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Your readers will not fail to notice also that even among these germs there are species; but each species is separate and distinct from the others. There is thus no mixing of natures. This proves conclusively that the Evolution Theory of the Higher Critics is wrong.—Genesis 1:11,12, 21 - 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">In recent years our knowledge regarding the </span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Specific bacterial </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">anti-bodies produced by inoc</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">HEN we read </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">about famine, gaunt and terrible, stealthily creeping upon the world, famine winch is still destroying its victims by the thousands, our sympathy goes out to the suffering ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">To think of a loving mother listening to the distressing cry of her beloved child for food, and she has none to give—the experience must be unbearable torture. Yet just this experience has been borne, and still is being borne, by thousands and thousands in the devastated countries abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Pierre Hamp, writing for a Paris weekly, Says: “I watched the bread lines before the soup kitchens in Austria, where American relief agencies are feeding all those under fourteen years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;At the door each child must show a card; and when the children leave they must be searched, because there is not enough bread for all the hungry to be fed. For this reason the children may not carry away food. Yet the keen intelligence of the young sometimes outwits the watchfulness of their elders. One little girl put her slices of bread into her stockings. The next week she came with a rag over her cheek, saying §he had the toothache. Under the cloth she hid irlump of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Often the children must be forced to eat. Grief at the thought that their mothers have nothing to eat kills their appetite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Sometime^ as<sub>s</sub> the children leave they are compelled to raifte their arms, for some hold bread hidden'ln their armpits; and sometimes they are searched, for many would conceal food for their hungry mothers at home.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">No age in the world’s history has been</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ulation has greatly increased. The immune substance develops slowly and increases gradually in quantity as the result of successive inoculations, and when once produced it is eliminated slowly from the system, so that the immunity lasts from three months to several years. It may be assumed that the success which has so far been achieved from the use of these detoxicated vaccines represents only the beginning of the ultimate possibilities of the-immunizing agents in the prevention and cure of disease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">through so much that is distressing as that' which is devastating the world today. These are indeed &quot;perilous times”. No one knows what a day may bring forth..</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Now as never before it is our duty to give aid and sympathy to the extent of our opportunity and ability. One means of giving aid is by showing how each one of us can contribute to the general supply of food by proper and economical eating day by day. A little care may easily reduce the amount of food consumed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is a well-known fact that the average American eats too much. It is no exaggeration to say that many eat twice the amount required to nourish the body. In order to preserve one’s strength and vitality, no more food should be eaten than is actually needed to maintain weight • and strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">First of all we should make a test to determine what that amount should be in our individual case in order to maintain our best endurance, weight arid strength with a clear brain; this should be ascertained, for it is the standard to have in view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Scientists of right living” have a great opportunity to show the world at this time how to live the “scientific way” and maintain a superb' condition of health and strength by the proper selection of foods. Never was there a time when this knowledge was so pitifully needed. Scientists of right living should not hide their light; under a bushel, but should let their knowledge extend itself so that it may reach the minds of others who may be in such need of the information that in some small measure will help “the poor groaning creation” at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is hard for the average person to under-</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; One that wastes health wastes food; for : human life is maintained by food. Those that have the information that may save lives should t impart that information at favorable oppor-' tunities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">i Realizing that in some measure good health and strength lie in the hands of each individual, one should show forth some zeal and energy in ■ putting this knowledge forth in a way that it ; will reach the largest possible number of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Some might copy this article and try to get the copy printed in each newspaper in his neighborhood, giving credit to The Golden Age. As ’ people learn and put into practice these prin-; ciples, they will in some measure be released ' from sickness and pain and the expense and burdens therefrom. Less distressing and happier will be their lot. By thus doing they can be 'doing good as they have opportunity'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">- &nbsp;&nbsp;. Scientific Feeding'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">. Horace Fletcher, the noted health authority, in his feeding of the Belgian refugees proved that people eat too much. He took the allotted portion of food for one hundred thousand, few two hundred’ thousand, and reduced the death rate one-third. Both doctors and undertakers complained of the falling off in business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>t</sub> His method was proper mastication. He took a number of people and taught them Jo chew ; their food until it was in a semi-liquid condi-‘ tion before swallowing. By this simple practice he accomplished his .wonderful work of feeding i twice the number of people with a given quantity of food, saved lives and reduced sickness at the sa^ne time—truly a wonderful example to set the World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">; Eating beyond our bodily requirements is due largely to our three-meals-a-day habit. It is sheer nonsense—this prevalent belief in three regular meals a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">i The time to^eat is when one is hungry, and at ■ no other time. If one is hungry at meal-time, then it is the time to eat. But one should not i sit down at the table and attempt to eat up the accustomed three meals a day If not hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Human beings do not show </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">much intelligence as dogs when they, eat &quot;three meals </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">day&quot; whether hungry or not A dog will not eat unless he is hungry. When he is sick, he cannot be coaxed to eat. Yet how often we hear </span><span class="font13" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">remark to the sick: &quot;Oh, you must eat to keep up your strength 1&quot; As a matter of fact the sick often use up priceless strength in order to dispose of food that is forced upon the stomach -when that organ is not prepared to use it Food so taken into the stomach is a serious menace, as the stomach is not ready to digest it Often-it turns into poisons of the most dangerous sort Many have gone to their graves because of the solicitude of their friends that they “keep their strength up I”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Preparedness</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">“Preparedness&quot; is a word quite often heard in the recent past Preparedness is preparation . for something we expect to do in the future. Preparation for a good healthy body is the first essential, regardless of what we expect to do or become in our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">To have a good healthy body we must observe the rules of health, and have food of proper quantity and quality, pure fresh air, pure water, sunlight, exercise, sleep and internal and external cleanliness. If these are properly provided day by day, health is sure to follow. If denied, ill-health is sure to come. Medicine will not take their place, but usually only adds to the already wrong condition. With good blood all the organs of the body function normally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">We are horrified at the appalling calamity that has overtaken the world since 1914. If we . give heed to God's Word, we are told therein that this, time of trouble upon the earth is to increase rather than to diminish in severity.— Daniel 12:1; Matthew 24:22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">It is the duty and privilege of each one to prepare to meet future emergencies, that we may be equal to any demands that may be made upon us. When we neglect this we meet failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Careful thought is needful to solve the problems that confront us daily. By giving them due consideration and arriving at a final ded-sion to the best of out judgment, we thereby eliminate worry. When we are free from worry and anxiety we can accomplish what we undertake more expeditiously, with less fatigue and with better results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Health and Thrift Suggestions</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following are suggestions for each one</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">who would like to help in conserving food and reducing the high cost of living. Let him ' omit one meal a day, say for a month or longer, until he has learned from experience the good . derivable from the practice. I venture the _ opinion that if one is of the observing sort, who <sup>r</sup> ’ profits by lessons of experience, and who wants to be in control of himself, he will continue right along after the month has expired. If all » the people would do this, the nation would be </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">j</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> able to save 100,000,000 meals each day; and the people would be greatly benefited both physi-t cally and mentally by the experiment, to say nothing of the great amount of labor eliminated ’ from the housewives’ daily routine. Better give . it a trial, and learn a great lesson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The average fat man or woman would be <sup>4</sup> greatly reduced in avoirdupois, would gain in strength and endurance,- if he or she would omit <sup>r</sup> breakfast entirely and take just about half the i usual amount for the other meals, not forgetting to chew the food as above suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">t The man or woman of the lean, emaciated sort would be benefited in practically every - -. instance. The thin person eats beyond his di-j gestive capacity. It is not the amount we can • put into our stomachs that nourishes, but what <sup>1</sup> is digested, assimilated and converted into blood. The thin type keep themselves thin by ' overeating, and gain in weight when the amount <sup>1</sup> of food is reduced and confined strictly to the amount required to maintain strength and nor'' mal weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">k ' Just try and see for yourself how much more satisfactory your daily life will become. The ’ food thus saved will add to the general supply <sub>(</sub> of the nation, and some of it might be sent to our starving friends in devastated Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Things to Eat</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The extent to which one can simplify one’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">diet and still thoroughly nourish the body is astonishing to those unfamiliar with the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Some consider that raw foods, properly pre- pared, are .far superior to cooked foods. Raw foods may'be ftermed live-foods. They retain all theii<sup>-</sup> various elements unimpaired, for in cooking there 4S more or less waste of the very elements essential to properly provide for the -needs of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">A diet of nuts, fruits and milk is attractive to ’* M many. If one adds tomatoes, lettuce, celgry, radishes, cabbage and other salad foods, with * 4,3 olive oil and lemon juice, raw wheat, raw rolled oats, figs, and maple sugar, he will have a gopd - S variety. A warm drink of cocoa helps to make a meal “satisfying”. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">The article on “Milk as a Food&quot; which ap- Jia peared in The Golden Age No. 32. showed the possibilities of milk as a food of the best kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Natural wheat is a perfect food, either raw ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or cooked. To prepare it, soak it, after a thor- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J I</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ough washing, for twenty-four hours in milk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; \</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">or water. If preferred, it may be -boiled or <sup>[</sup> </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">1 </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">steamed for several hours. If boiled, it should <sup>!</sup> * be simmered until the water has evaporated; j । the water should never be thrown away as it [ | contains valuable elements of the wheat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! 4</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">H</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">ALL CAINE, the well-known litterateur, author of &quot;The Eternal City&quot;, &quot;The Woman Thou Gavest Me”, etc., recently struck a blow for religious freedom and for religion untainted by conventionalism when he penned the following answer to an Anglican vicar. Mr. Caine lives on the Isle Of Man, off the British west . coast, and this correspondence is therefore taken from the </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Isle of Man Examiner,</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> date of January 1, 1921.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">r Mr. Caine writes: “The hostility of clergymen of the Church of England to Russellism is not a little significant. It must give you immense encouragement.” The correspondence follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">'•People Living in Glass Houses—”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“If the Rev. F. W. Stubbs, Vicar of Arborv, is* sincerely anxious to improve his knowledge of Russellism, I wonder how comes it that it has not occurred to him to sit down and quietly study ‘The Divine Plan of the Ages’ ambsay nothing more about it to anybody? Does lie want to‘put out’ his thinking and reading very much' as he puts out his shirts and collars to the wash? If, however, the object of Mr. Stubbs is merely to poke fun at the religions convictions of his. neighbors, let him be quite sure before Hie sets out on that game that the last laugh will beiwith him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“I hold that any man who tries to bruise another’s ensceptibilities, solely on the score of his religion, is no better that the lewd and base fellow who would try to get a laugh against a num on the ground that he had lost an eye, or an arm, or a leg in the late war. ~ .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“ So long as a man holds his religion in sincere faith, and does not merely make his living out of his profession&quot; of it, he and his religion have my respect.. Bui if a man keeps a religion as a man keeps a shop, i.e., in order to make money out of it, the position is altogether different. In China, where we have one of the oldest civilizations in the world, and see many features worthy of imitation, a man who runs his religion on a profit-making basis is an object of derision and contempt. Many English Nonconformists share the same view of a paid priesthood or ministry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Russellism has no interest for me except as a manifestation of a desire on the part of a large and influential community in Christendom to bring order out of chaos and to frame an expression of Christianity that does not offend our reason. It teaches that God is unknown and unknowable, because no one who was not himself the equal of God could possess the power of revealing Him. It repudiates the idea of a Trinity of Divine Beings, separate and yet one, as fit only for the dark ages </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">which it helped to produce.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> It affirms that Jesus was a perfect human being, nothing more, and that though He is forever dead it was as necessary that Jesus should live and die as that, His work accomplished, He should never live again, [as a human being, from which plane He was highly exalted to His present position as an Almighty Divine Being—Ed.] It teaches that the Holy Spirit has no personality; that it is a God-conceived agency prompting men to deeds of goodness and virtue.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Russellism refuses to believe that the Divine Author of the whole world should so quarrel with His own creation as to invent a Hell of everlasting torment for His own children, because if God created such a place of everlasting torment, no one would be more fitted for such torture than its author, a syllogism that is unthinkable.’ ‘Death is the wages of sin.’ but death can only come to a man during the Millennium by man’s own refusal to heed the entreaties of his Maker. That ’ ‘as in Adam all die,’ Jesus gave up His life that in , Adam all might enjoy respite, ransom, opportunity of escape from that death which is extinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Vicar of Arbory, however, is not athirst for knowledge. He is above all things anxious to get in his cheap and vulgar laugh. He asks if Russellism taught that the Millennium would begin in 1914; and if Russellites still hold to the view that it did. I have shown, however, that Russellites attach one meaning to the word, Millennium. Mr. Stubbs something, probably, quite different. Which is correct? I do not presume to arbitrate. Personally I have no burning interest in any interpretation of that wild poem, the Apocalypse, least of all the words of Chapter xx, verses 1 to 5.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;I recognize, however, a long list of modern prophets working on this argument: That if it took God six days to make the earth, and a day is to God as a thousand years are to man, the Millennium should be due 6,000 years after the creation. (See the Book of Barnabas in the Apocryphal New Testament) Orthodox Protestants used to plump for 1836. Swedenborg favored 1757. Baxter about a century and a half later. Dr. John Cumming, most noted of all modern English Mfl-lennarians. placed the end of the present dispensation in 1866 or 1867; but when those years fled by and nothing particular happened, he modified his theology, dying with the conviction that the beginning of the Millennium would probably not differ so much after all from the years immediately preceding it as people commonly supposed. How, otherwise, can the prophecy of Jesus (Matt, rvr, 28) be explained out of its clear significance? Thus also of Matthew xxiv, 34? Did that generation see ‘these things fulfilled’?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“Where, however, the Russellites get the smile on Parson Stuhbs is when they turn the tables and ask: 'What sort of nonsense is it that Parson Stubbs believes?* The Russellites say that Jesus was a man; Parson Stubbs says that He was a God as well.

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">While the doctrines of election and free grace, as taught by Calvinism and Arminian-ism, could never be harmonized with each other; with reason, or with the Bible, yet these two glorious Bible doctrines are perfectly harmonious and beautiful, seen from the standpoint of the plan of the ages.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">203.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> In view of God’s glorious plans for the future, what must be the attitude of every true Christian respecting thejecond advent of our Lord Jesus Christ— the first step toward the accomplishment of the long-promised and long-expected blessings for the world of mankind?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeing, the^i, tliat so many of the great and glorious features bf God’s plan for human salvation from sih and death lie in the future, and that the second advent of our Lord Jesus is the designed first step in the accomplishment of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">does the truth lie? Surely the question can be settled out of hand if Jesus expressly affirmed His inferiority to the Father ? Let us see. Jesus asserted His inferior--ity in knowledge (Mark xiii, 32); in power (Mark x^ 40); in virtue (Mark x, 18). Lastly, we have the cry&quot; of agony on the Cross: ‘My God! My~Ckxt! Why hast-Thou forsaken Me?* (Mark xv, 34) which would be quite unmeaning if the person forsaken and the person, forsaking had been one and the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Russellites, too, are entitled to ask Parson i Stubbs: . . . How. comes it that we know neither the day nor even the year </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Jesus’ birth; and only lay claim to December 25th because it is the Winter Sol— stice and is the birthday of an entire host of Pagan Gods, all of them reputed to have been born of virgins :-Crishna, Buddha, Mithra, Isis, Osiris, Hercules, Bacchus, Adonis, and dozens more? Is it all coincidence? And is it a mere coincidence that the rites of religion as practised by Parson Stubbs in Arbory Church Kt this very hour were, almost entirely, instituted by Mithra, five hundred years, approximately, before Jesus was born ?</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">those long-promised and long-expected blessings, shall we not even more earnestly long for the time of His second advent than the less informed Jew longed for His first advent ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Seeing that the time of evil,injustice and death is to be brought to an end by the dominion of power which He will'then exercise, and that righteousness, truth and peace are to be universal, who should not rejoice to see His day </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;"> And who that is now suffering with Christ, inspired by the precious promise that “if we suffer with him we shall also reign with him”, will not lift up his head and rejoice at any evidence of the approach of the Master, knowing thereby that our deliverance and glorification with Him draw nigh! Surely all in sympathy with His mission of blessing and His spirit of love will hail every evidence of His coming as the approach of the “ great joy which shall be to all people”!</span></p>

<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">7.</span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"> In John 5:28,29 why do some get a life resurrection and others a judgment resurrection?</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ans.: Because those who get the life resurrection (the ancient worthies and the church) shall have had their judgment—their trial—■ while the others (the world) have uot been on trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">t 8. What Scripture have we to show that the world has not been on trial for everlasting life; that is, is not being judged of the Lord?</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">His arm protects us and His hand will guide. Though dangers eompass us on every side. Though rough and perilous the road may be, His voice is ever calling, ‘Follow me’,</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Feel It a privilege to bear the cross;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Though It may mean both agony and loss. He bore so much for us; and shall not we,-His followers, also fellow-sufferers be?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;Be steadfast, though at times your hearts may fall As sorrows multiply and cares assail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">When friends forsake and lov’d ones pass away, And earthly hopes and pleasures all decay, Think </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the “Man of Sorrows’’; keep In view That Holy One who suffered so for you; And let your courage and endurance prove The depth of yojir fidelity and love.’,’</span></p>

There sickness shall be no more; not an ache nor a pain, nor any evidence of decay—not even the fear of such thing*. Think of all the pictures of comparative health and beauty of human form and feature that you have ever seen, and know that perfect humanity will be of still surpassing loveliness.
